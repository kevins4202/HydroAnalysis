2370,socioeconomic drought can directly affect human survival and economic development however existing literature lacks information related to the formation and development of socioeconomic drought and mainly deals with drought index and its properties we used coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 system dynamics sd method and soil and water assessment tools swat to calculate the standardized water supply and demand index swsdi the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model was applied to identify the driving factors of socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin and predict its future properties then propagation and the time from meteorological and hydrological to socioeconomic drought were predicted the duration and intensity of socioeconomic drought events were lower in the wet season than in the dry season and those having higher severity were more discrete among different factors precipitation exerted more pronounced impacts than radiation forcing similarly positive correlations between total vegetated percentage cover rural per capita income and radiation forcing were observed to be affecting the socioeconomic drought whereas leaf area index was negatively correlated seasonal variations significantly affected the propagation time where the time for the wet season was less than for the dry season moreover intensive radiative forcing would momentarily shorten the optimal propagation time in the wet season and extend it in the dry season results of this study provide a theoretical basis for understanding the causes mechanisms and factors responsible for socioeconomic drought and also provides insights on its transmission mechanism keywords socioeconomic drought driving factors propagation swsdi xgboost cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is considered as a complex natural disaster from the perspective of impact impact time and consequences drought has a great destructive effect on people s lives and ecological environment wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 generally drought is divided into four types meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic all types of drought are induced by the imbalance of water supply and demand wilhite and glantz 1985 sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2019a previous studies have focused more on meteorology hydrology and agricultural drought the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 yu et al 2019 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are the most widely used indexes for monitoring meteorological drought in addition the standardized runoff index sri which uses runoff data to calculate the hydrological drought index has been widely used in hydrological research shukla and wood 2008 the vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci are widely used in agricultural drought monitoring and prediction song et al 2008 unlike meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts socioeconomic drought did not receive much attention until 2015 most scholars defined socioeconomic drought as the inability of water supply of water resources systems to meet the water demand of social development which is an abnormal water deficit caused by the imbalance between supply and demand indexes describing socioeconomic drought mainly include the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri mehran et al 2015 socioeconomic drought index sedi shi et al 2018 and the improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri guo et al 2018 however these indexes have the disadvantages of complex construction large data demand and complex calculation in addition msrri imsrri and sedi were required to rely on reservoir information for socioeconomic drought assessment and when reservoirs do not exist or were not considered in the study area the above indices will not be calculated the recently proposed the standardized water supply and demand index swsdi wang et al 2022 has effectively made up for these deficiencies in addition to building a reasonable socioeconomic drought index the lack of analysis of socioeconomic drought factors restricts the development of socioeconomic drought research according to the definition of socioeconomic drought socioeconomic drought is limited by water supply and water demand but the current understanding of the relationship between supply and demand is less than complete under the background of global climate change the hydrologic cycle is accelerating resulting in a significant change in water supply at the same time lifestyle changes with the development of economy and science and technology resulting in the change of water demand therefore it is necessary to discuss the factors affecting socioeconomic drought in the context of climate change fraser et al 2008 the drought propagation is considered as a necessary means to clarify the process of drought formation guo et al 2019 at present most studies on drought propagation mainly focus on the propagation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought huang et al 2016 limited by the construction mode of socioeconomic drought index and the limited research there are few reports on the transmission process of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought however transmission between different drought types plays an important role in clarifying the drought evolution mechanism climate change has a significant impact on the water cycle causing changes in water availability by affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of atmospheric water holding capacity which in turn induces more droughts human activities and environmental degradation have caused large scale changes in climate which not only increase the difficulty of drought assessment but also clarify the need for future drought assessment ipcc 2012 with the impact of climate change future meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts will be more severe wang et al 2011 and the evolution law of future socioeconomic droughts is still in the exploratory stage the coupled model inter comparison project cmip driven by the world climate research program wcrp is one of the most influential data sources in the world meehl et al 2000 since its implementation in 1995 more than 20 years of hydrometeorological data have been accumulated which can help predict future scenarios these future data have been used in drought assessment climate change simulation flood forecasting etc since cmip3 dai 2013 the applicability of cmip6 data released in 2020 in simulating future meteorological and hydrological droughts has been demonstrated wang et al 2021 in view of this future socioeconomic drought evolution drivers and propagation were carried out by relying on cmip6 hence research on the influencing factors of future socioeconomic drought and the propagate of socioeconomic drought will help promote understanding of socioeconomic drought this study employs dongjiang basin as a research area and according to the definition of socioeconomic drought swsdi is constructed to explore the change of socioeconomic drought under climate change the factors affecting socioeconomic drought are identified by the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model and the process of propagation between meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought is analyzed to explore the mechanism of formation of socioeconomic drought this study supplements the socioeconomic drought research le and theoretical support for subsequent socioeconomic drought prediction and management 2 methodology based on the existing research on socioeconomic drought this study aims to explore the evolution driving factors and propagation of socioeconomic drought supplementing the lack and insufficiency of current socioeconomic drought research the socioeconomic drought status is expressed by the socioeconomic drought index swsdi based on the water cycle then the properties of future socioeconomic drought are explored using run theory and the evolution of socioeconomic drought is analyzed the deep learning model xgboost was introduced into the analysis of socioeconomic drought drivers to identify quantify and rank all factors that may affect socioeconomic drought finally the propagation of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought is demonstrated by linear analysis fig 1 2 1 construction of socioeconomic drought index a new standardized water supply and demand index swsdi based on water balance and water cycle was proposed the swsdi was constructed based on the inherent properties of data it ensures that the results are stable across study areas and periods the process of socioeconomic drought event levels being identified by run theory does not require subjective evaluation and does not mandate the presence of reservoirs and impoundments in the study area the swsdi is relevant to a variety of research areas the evaluation results are accurate and the computation process is straightforward thus this index can be used to assess socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin furthermore the sedi approach proposed by shi 2018 was used to extract socioeconomic drought events for the dongjiang basin and the swsdi results were validated from three perspectives socioeconomic drought levels drought durations and drought onset the swsdi achieved satisfactory results wang et al 2022 the standardized water supply and demand index is divided into three modules in the calculation process namely water supply module water demand module and index calculation module the water supply module is calculated by the the soil and water assessment tool swat model and the water demand module is calculated by the system dynamics sd method 2 1 1 water supply module swat model was selected to calculate the water supply capacity of the basin because it has the advantages of visualization multi scale multi variable and multi module and is more suitable for assessing the water supply capacity of the basin eini et al 2019 yang et al 2022 boluo station was selected as the outlet of the basin and the outlet of the monitoring section for simulation and calibration of runoff first digital elevation model dem and river network data were added to the swat model to divide into sub basins secondly land use soil type and corresponding attribute database were added to swat model to establish the geographic information module land use is usually reclassified into water forest and agricultural land and soil types are classified into luvisols lvh eutric regosols rge and cumulic anthrosols atc according to the corresponding attributes third meteorological factors such as precipitation evaporation and radiation were added to swat model to establish meteorological data module the runoff at the outlet of dongjiang basin was simulated through the above three steps the swat cup software was used in the calibration of runoff to adjust and verify model results the parameters calibrated by swat cup software were added to swat model again and the natural runoff of dongjiang basin i e water supply of dongjiang basin was finally obtained it should be noted that the measured runoff of the selected hydrological station was reduced to natural runoff for the calibration of swat model to ensure that runoff results were not affected by the reservoir operation this practice was to better identify the impact factors and the propagation of socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin chen et al 2016 at this point the basin water supply module was fully calculated and the water supply was marked as qs 2 1 2 water demand module when simulating the water demand of the basin the water demand module can generally be divided into two parts in channel water demand and off channel water demand in channel water demand refers to the amount of water required for ship navigation water quality maintenance ecological protection and salt tide suppression and off channel water demand refers to the amount of water required for daily production and lives of residents shi et al 2018 the water demand was calculated using the following formula 1 q d q in q off 2 q in m a x q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 where q1 q2 q3 and q4 are the minimum streamflow required for maintaining water quality standard minimum ecological streamflow minimum streamflow for navigation minimum streamflow for pressure brackish respectively which were collectively referred to as the in channel water demand qin qoff refers to the amount of water needed for people s living and human related activities that is off channel water demand in channel water demand includes requirements for water quality and quantity in general the amount of water required to maintain the stability of river is called in channel water demand according to guangdong province s current comprehensive resources planning the biological environment and navigation seawater flows through the river channel of boluo station in the dongjiang basin at a rate of 203 m3 s tu et al 2015 i e qin 203 m3 s the off channel water demand includes the water quantity related to social economy and people s lives the system dynamics sd method was used to calculate the off channel water demand this method has an excellent accuracy in the prediction of population economy and water resources carrying capacity and other data related to residents lives and is suitable for solving the water demand problem yi et al 2020 therefore the sd method was selected for the simulation and prediction of off channel water demand specifically the original data such as population urbanization rate and resident income were adopted to evaluate the off channel water demand in dongjiang basin based on the cause and effect relationship the prediction model for the expression of the socioeconomic water demand relationship was constructed as follows 3 δ u r w d u p i δ u r p ϕ 1 p ϕ 2 4 δ r u w d r p i δ r u p ϕ 1 p ϕ 1 5 δ d w d δ u r w d δ r u w d 6 dw d t d w d t 1 δ d w d 7 δ u r p t p k δ δ 8 δ r u p δ t p k δ u r p where δ u r w d δ r u w d δ d w d are the increase of urban water demand increase increase of rural water demand increase and increase of total water demand respectively dw d t is the increase of total water demand for year t upi and rpi are the urban per capita income and rural per capita income respectively δ u r p and δ r u p are the increase of urban population and the increase of rural population respectively δ t p k is the increase of population δ δ is the increase of urbanization growth rate p is the water price is the income elasticity coefficient ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the urban population adjustment coefficient and the rural population adjustment coefficient respectively and k is the accommodation coefficient using 2016 as the base year the sd method predicted that the dongjiang basin s water demand in 2099 would be 4 822 billion m3 or 152 90 m3 s details can be referred to the method part of yi 2020 and wang 2022 i e qoff 152 90 m3 s therefore considering all water demands the total water demand at the outlet of dongjiang basin was 355 90 m3 s qd 2 1 3 index calculation module swsdi is calculated by normalizing the probability density function of water supply and demand difference wsdd and converting it into standard normal distribution the swsdi was calculated by the following formula 9 q wsdd q s q d 10 i s w s d i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 if p 0 5 then p was replaced by p 1 p and the sign of the resultant swsdi was reversed the constants were c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 2 2 analysis of socioeconomic drought properties the swsdi was used to identify and assess socioeconomic droughts and can also provide early warning for socioeconomic droughts and coordinate reservoir operation to supplement water demand for the problem of drought properties run theory was generally accepted this method can identify the properties of socioeconomic drought events tu et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2017 including drought duration drought intensity drought start and end time and drought severity therefore this study explains the properties of a drought event drought duration d was defined as the duration from the beginning to the end of the drought event drought severity s was defined as the cumulative sum of the difference between the drought index value and the drought threshold in the drought event drought intensity i was defined as the ratio of drought severity to drought duration of the drought event 2 3 identification of factors driving socioeconomic drought identifying the driving factors of socioeconomic drought was a key link to predicting socioeconomic drought and analysing the socioeconomic drought propagation process the accuracy of identifying the driving factors will directly affect the subsequent processing direction of the socioeconomic drought propagation process the traditional identification methods of drought driving factors include building regression equations of multiple factors or comparing the correlation between them the above method has the disadvantage that the accuracy will be greatly reduced when more driving factors are introduced at the same time the two methods will ignore the problem of there being sno linear relationship between multiple drivers therefore xgboost was introduced into the analysis of drought driving factors this method was employed to predict swsdi through the numerical value of multiple driving factors through a deep learning algorithm when the predicted swsdi was the same as the actual swsdi the contribution of multiple driving factors to swsdi was obtained to obtain the driving factors of socioeconomic drought this relationship is usually nonlinear xgboost is a machine learning technology used for regression and classification which belongs to a class of integrated learning models friedman 2001 the algorithm completes the learning task by constructing and combining multiple regression tree models with good performance and speed on the basis of the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithm a regularization term was added which reduces the risk of overfitting the model and improves the accuracy of the model zhang et al 2019b the process of identifying socioeconomic drought influencing factors through xgboost model was as follows first given a sample x i y i i 1 2 n a regression tree was constructed for the identification of each sample and then n regression trees were constructed expressed as 11 y i i 1 n f k x i f k f where xi is the i th sample and yi is the predicted value of the i th sample f k x i is the regression equation corresponding to the k th regression tree of the i th variable and f is the set of all regression trees secondly the objective function was constructed which is composed of loss function and regularization term the loss function was to fit the training data and the regularization term was used to simplify the model the specific formula was as follows 12 l ϕ i 1 n l y i y i t 1 f t x i k ω f k where l ϕ is the objective function l y i y i t 1 f t x i is the loss function ω f k is the regularization term and yi is the true value of the sample third the real value of the loss function was approximated by the taylor expansion loss function the formula is as follows 13 l y i y i t 1 f t x i l y i y i t 1 g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i where y i y i t 1 is the loss value of t 1 tree before the i th sample g i f t x i is the first partial derivative of y i t 1 and 1 2 h i f t 2 x i is the second order partial derivative of y i t 1 fourth the final objective function was obtained as follows 14 obj t i 1 n g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i ω f t finally by calculating the number of occurrences of the i th input factor xi in all regression trees the importance score of the input factor in the whole model was obtained the calculation formula was as follows 15 score x i n 1 n t score n x i n t where n is the number of trees in the xgboost model and nt is the number of trees in the xgboost model 2 4 propagation of socioeconomic drought spi is a dimensionless meteorological drought index which characterizes the abundance of precipitation in a specific period through the fitting of precipitation probability and captures the precipitation deficit in that period usually in months sri is the hydrological drought index obtained by normal normalization after assuming that the runoff meets the gamma distribution which is used to characterize the abundance of the runoff in a specific period spi and sri can capture the meteorological and hydrological drought properties at different time scales usually 1 48 months and have been widely used in the analysis of meteorological and hydrological drought properties and the description of drought conditions this study calculated the spi of 1 12 months in 2017 2099 through precipitation data under different scenarios in the cmip6 data set and calculated the sri of 1 12 months in 2017 2099 through the swat model to simulate the runoff under different scenarios in the previous analysis of drought transmission the transmission process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was usually the main one and the relationship between spi and sri was considered as the transmission of drought from meteorology to hydrology considering the time scale of socioeconomic drought the correlation between spi n n month spi and sri n n month sri and swsdi was used to characterize the propagation time from meteorological drought to socio economic drought the time scale n with the strongest correlation with swsdi was considered to represent the best propagation time the spearman correlation coefficient was selected as the criterion for correlation barker et al 2015 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 the specific formula is as follows 16 ρ 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where n is the sample and di is the difference between the ranks of the swsdi and spi n sequences 3 study area and data river basin basin is located between 21 31 and 26 49 n and 102 14 and 115 53 e with a drainage area of 453 690 km3 fig 2 it is one of the three major basins in china along with the yangtze river and the yellow river it includes the pearl river delta xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river it is the source of water supply for six provinces and regions including yunnan province guangdong province and guizhou province as well as the hong kong special administrative region hong kong and macao the total water supply population is nearly 40 million and the per capita water resource is about 800 m3 the terrain of dongjiang basin is high in the northeast and low in the southwest the annual average precipitation of dongjiang basin is 1500 2400 mm from the perspective of spatial distribution it is more in the southwest and less in the northeast the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang basin are economically developed in 2019 the total gdp of each region supported by the dongjiang river reached 4 17 trillion yuan in this study monthly scale meteorological data were obtained from bcc csm2 mr cmip6 https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip6 to calculate accurately runoff with swat the 1 125 1 121 grid of precipitation data was uniformly interpolated by latitude and longitude on a 0 5 0 5 grid by bilinear interpolation four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios were used ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively wang et al 2021 the dem and land use into the swat model were from geospatial data clouds https www gscloud cn and landsat satellite remote sensing images https landsat gsfc nasa gov respectively soil properties were from harmonized world soil database hwsd which provided information on soil types soil phases soil physical and chemical properties at each grid point based on all the above data the runoff of dongjiang basin was calculated population and socioeconomics were obtained from the guang zhou statistical yearbook 2020 development data it should be noted that annual scale population gdp and per capita income data were used in the construction of the sd model due to the limitation of data sources therefore the projected water demand for 2100 was on an annual scale and the annual scale water demand was equally distributed among the monthly scales to ensure the correspondence between water supply and water demand because the local government departments usually take the dongjiang river basin as a whole to manage and dispatch water resources in a unified way and the economic development and river water demand of guangdong province are relatively centralized according to the local water supply policy and actual situation the dongjiang basin was considered as a whole to assess socioeconomic drought 4 results and discussion 4 1 socioeconomic drought properties in order to further reveal the driving factors and propagation socioeconomic drought the properties of future socioeconomic drought were further statistically analyzed run theory was used to identify socioeconomic drought events according to the previous definition the drought duration and drought intensity of dongjiang basin from 2017 to 2099 were calculated fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the average drought durations under different scenarios was similar which were 4 54 4 31 4 20 and 4 35 months respectively indicating that the increase of radiation forcing had little impact on the drought duration however the increase of radiation forcing led to the increase of drought duration anomaly that is drought with higher severity occureds more under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the change of drought severity was mainly reflected in the drop intensity as shown in fig 3 b with the increase of radiation forcing the drop intensity gradually decreased but the decrease amplitude decreased on the whole the socioeconomic drought was significantly affected by radiation forcing which was mainly reflected in the higher radiation forcing causing more abnormal drought duration and lower drought intensity in addition future socioeconomic drought events were divided fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the future socioeconomic drought events in the dongjiang basin were evenly distributed throughout the year with the highest probability in march to april and september to october usually the alternating time of high flow period and low flow period since water conservancy facilities such as reservoirs are usually required to supply water to the downstream in the low flow period to meet normal human activities and economic development of the downstream in the high water period water conservancy facilities such as reservoirs need to store water to meet the water supply requirements in the next low flow period resulting in more socioeconomic drought events in the transition time between the high flow period and the low flow period for the humid area in the south the higher radiation forcing brings more precipitation thus increasing runoff and water supply however the population is restricted by urban development and policies resulting in a lower increase in water demand than water supply thus reducing the number of socioeconomic droughts in the dry season in the future in general radiation forcing has little effect on the distribution of socioeconomic drought events but it leads to the relative lag of socioeconomic drought under the scenario of high radiation forcing the interannual distribution of socioeconomic droughts is more concentrated and short term and continuous socioeconomic droughts are more likely to occur 4 2 driving factors of socioeconomic drought in order to further clarify the mechanism of socioeconomic drought the influencing factors of socioeconomic drought under different climate models were identified by the xgboost model fig 5 the relative contributions of different influencing factors are obtained by xgboost model table 1 meteorological factors include precipitation prcp air temperature ta evaporation evspsbl surface downwelling shortwave radiation rsds relative humidity hur and near surface wind speed sfcwind the soil moisture mrso represents the hydrological factors geopotential height zg and bare soil percentage area coverage bareoilfrac constitute geographical factors ecological factors include percentage crop cover cropfrac leaf area index lai and total vegetated percentage cover vegfrac socioeconomic factors are composed of urban population up rural population rp urban per capita income upci and rural per capita income rpci as shown in fig 5 a under the ssp1 2 6 scenario meteorological factors were the dominant factors affecting socioeconomic drought and hydrological factor had low impact on the formation of socioeconomic drought the main reason for this phenomenon was that the hydrological factor shows a low contribution due to its factor of soil moisture which was not directly used by social production according to the composition of swsdi surface runoff and subsurface runoff which can be directly used by production and living were closely related to socioeconomic drought but the source of the above water resources was precipitation therefore precipitation shows an extremely high contribution in the assessment of socioeconomic drought impact factor the relative impact of economic factors ranked the second among all influencing factors which was similar to that of meteorological factors the relative impacts of topography and ecological factors on socioeconomic drought were 0 138 and 0 200 respectively among the meteorological factors prcp and sfcwind were the main factors and the relative effects of other meteorological factors were similar among the ecological factors cropfrac and lai as the dominant factors had almost the same impact on socioeconomic drought vegfrac had little impact on socioeconomic drought the relative impact of all economic factors was similar and upci was slightly higher than other factors as shown in fig 5 b under the ssp2 4 5 scenario meteorological factors were still the dominant factors affecting the socioeconomic drought the relative impact of economic factors on socioeconomic drought was lower than that of the ssp1 2 6 scenario but it was still in the second place of all impact factors the relative effects of topography and ecological factors on socioeconomic drought were similar which were 0 204 and 0 196 respectively the impact of hydrological factors on socioeconomic drought was still low prcp was the main meteorological factor and the relative impact of evspsbl on socioeconomic drought increased up and rp played a dominant role in economic factors at the same time bareoilfrac dominated the impact of topographic factors on the socioeconomic drought as shown in fig 5 c under the ssp3 7 0 scenario the relative impact of meteorological factors on the socioeconomic drought was 0 339 of which prcp hur and evspsbl were the main influencing factors and the relative impacts of the three factors were similar which were 0 066 0 060 and 0 062 respectively the relative impact of ecological factors on socioeconomic drought was 0 221 which improved compared with the ssp1 2 6 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios cropfrac is the main factor of ecological factors the proportion of economic factors was 0 245 and the relative impact of the four economic factors was similar as shown in fig 5 d under the ssp5 8 5 scenario meteorological and economic factors were the dominant factors and the relative impact was 0 363 and 0 304 respectively the impact of ecological factors on socioeconomic drought was 0 229 which was the highest among all scenarios the relative impact of topographic factors on socioeconomic drought reduced to 0 176 the relative influence of ta in meteorological factors was 0 070 higher than that of prcp and both dominated meteorological factors bareoilfrac cropfrac and rpci dominated the topographic ecological and economic factors respectively on the whole the socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin was mainly affected by meteorological and economic factors followed by ecological and topographic factors and the relative impact of hydrological factors was small the influence of different factors on socioeconomic drought and the definition of socioeconomic drought were mutually corroborated meteorological factors increased the supply side of water resources and economic factors controlled the consumption side of water resources both of them dominated the occurrence of socioeconomic drought as the storage end of water resources ecological and topographic factors havd affected the intensity and occurrence time of socioeconomic drought to a certain extent since only natural runoff was considered in the process of constructing swsdi in this paper the hydrological factors were only used as process variables and there was no ability to consume and supply water resources separately thus reducing the relative impact of hydrological factors on the socioeconomic drought from the perspective of different scenarios the relative impact of meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic factors was less affected by radiation forcing the impact of ecological factors on socioeconomic drought increased with the increase of radiation forcing while it was opposite for the topographic factors among the meteorological factors prcp was dominant in all scenarios with the increase of radiation forcing the relative influence of ta gradually increased and the relative influence of evspsbl gradually decreased among the ecological factors the relative impact of cropfrac increased with the increase of radiation forcing and the relative impact of lai was opposite among the topographic factors the relative impact of bareoilfrac reached the maximum in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios and decreased in the ssp5 8 5 scenario among the economic factors the relative impact of rpci increased significantly with the increase of radiation forcing the reasons for the differences between various factors and radiation forcing were analyzed from the perspective of economy and life first of all as an economically developed area the highly dense population and the acceleration of urbanization in the dongjiang basin have brought more favorable economic development however this development is only limited by the area and population pressure of the urban agglomeration resulting in that up and rp hardly change with the change of radiation forcing secondly the increase of radiation forcing has led to more heat island effect which has prompted human beings to need a larger urban agglomeration to cope with this change thus briefly leading to the relative impact change of bareoilfrac third the increase of radiative forcing directly causes the rise of temperature the growth and development of vegetation and temperature show an obvious unimodal curve that is too high or too low temperature will inhibit the growth of vegetation resulting in the change of ecological factors with radiative forcing finally as a humid area the increase of radiative forcing indirectly increases prcp and makes water resources more abundant at the same time the increase of temperature promotes the change of evspsbl resulting in different impacts of meteorological factors on socioeconomic drought in different scenarios 4 3 propagation of socioeconomic drought through the analysis of relationship between the driving factors of socioeconomic drought as the main factor affecting socioeconomic drought the propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought is of more concern at the same time hydrological factors are of great significance to the reservoir water transfer and the construction of water conservancy facilities runoff also serves as the supply side to directly supply water resources to economic development therefore analyzing the transmission from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought has a significant role in analyzing the evolution mechanism of socioeconomic drought in the future different spi n and sri n were calculated and then the correlation between them and swsdi was calculated separately to determine the optimal drought propagation time fig 6 more information is given in table s1 s2 fig 6 shows the spearman correlation between spi n and sri n and swsdi as shown in fig 6 the maximum correlation between swsdi and spi n was considered as the propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought and the maximum correlation between swsdi and sri n was considered as the propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the best propagation time from meteorology and hydrology to socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin ranged from 1 month to 12 months under the ssp1 2 6 scenario the shortest propagation time of meteorological drought in dongjiang basin was april 1 month and the longest propagation time was march june and september 8 months the best propagation time in most months was relatively concentrated in 6 8 months the best propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin was the shortest in may 1 month and the longest in february to march 12 months and the best propagation time in most months was relatively concentrated in 4 6 months under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the shortest propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was february and august september 1 2 months and the longest propagation time was from october to december 11 12 months the shortest propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was from january to march and from may to august 1 2 months under the ssp3 7 0 scenario the shortest propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was december 1 month and the longest propagation time was may august september and november 11 12 months the shortest propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was from february to march and from june to july 1 2 months and the longest propagation time was from may 12 months under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the shortest propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was march and august 1 month and the longest propagation time was january to february and from october to december 12 months the shortest propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was march and from june to august 1 3 months and the longest propagation time was february and may 11 12 months on the whole there were significant seasonal differences in the propagation of meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in the dongjiang basin the propagation time in the wet season from april to september was lower than that in the dry season from october to march and the correlation between swsdi spi and sri were higher in the wet season than in the dry season the difference between water supply and water demand was considered as the basis for the occurrence of socioeconomic drought water supply was directly affected by runoff precipitation in the rainy season of dongjiang basin accounts for more than 70 of the annual precipitation which is of great significance for the generation of runoff in the rainy season therefore the correlation between swsdi and spi and sri was stronger in the wet season compared with the best propagation time of meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the best propagation time of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was 6 8 months on average the best propagation time of hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was 4 6 months on average and the propagation time of meteorological drought was 2 3 months longer than that of hydrological drought this was because in the process of water circulation precipitation needed to form runoff through the process of production and concentration to supply the social and economic development in different scenarios the increase of radiative forcing would lead to more discrete optimal propagation time from meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought that is the months with shorter propagation time were shorter the months with longer propagation time were longer and the continuous short propagation time and continuous long propagation time would become more common this is because with the increase of radiative forcing the time distribution of annual precipitation would be more uneven and the long lasting and high intensity abnormal precipitation in the wet season would increase resulting in the acceleration of the process of runoff generation and concentration runoff would be directly utilized by the economic development to a certain extent and the propagation time of meteorological and hydrological drought with short propagation time would be further reduced in the dry season with the increase of radiation forcing the uncertainty of precipitation increased and the drought duration and frequency of meteorological and hydrological droughts increased which promoted the extension of propagation time 4 4 discussion according to the influencing factors of socioeconomic drought under different scenarios the transmission process from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was analyzed and good analysis results were obtained however the spread of socio economic drought should be a linear or non linear process zhou et al 2020 2021 and the spread of hydrological drought and agricultural drought to socio economic drought should also be emphasized including groundwater drought han et al 2019 limited by space and cmip6 data the transmission of other types of drought to socioeconomic drought would become the topic of research in the next stage in addition the socioeconomic drought was seriously affected by human activities liu et al 2020 in addition to the analysis of the transmission process on the supply side analysis on the demand side was also emphasized from the perspective of river basin the change of demand measurement directly affected the severity of socioeconomic drought resulting in different spatial distribution properties of socioeconomic drought from the perspective of cities changes in demand side factors including heat island effect and urban greening would lead to fluctuations in socioeconomic drought results showed that the socioeconomic drought severity in the area where the reservoir is located and economically developed areas was significantly different from that in other areas indicating that changes in the underlying surface and human activities had a significant impact on socioeconomic drought and further research is needed to quantify this impact in addition human activities have accelerated the spread of meteorological droughts to socioeconomic droughts which does not mean that human activities are completely negative but indirectly indicates that the utilization rate of water resources is improved which is beneficial to economic development how to balance socioeconomic drought and economic development is a key namely managing socioeconomic drought socioeconomic drought management and water scarcity management are conceptually different although both are processes of water regulation they need to be distinguished in terms of potential causes and regulation results in the process of socioeconomic drought management it is not only necessary to consider adjusting the water supply capacity of the basin building reservoirs to adjust the distribution of runoff within a year improving the quality of water resources so that more water resources can be used but also considering the production of water resources under the condition of limited water resources and higher economic benefits improving industrial efficiency enhancing people s awareness of water conservation etc 5 conclusions this study calculated swsdi in dongjiang basin analyzed the socioeconomic drought properties identified the socioeconomic drought influencing factors under different climate scenarios through xgboost model and identified the meteorological economic hydrological ecological and geographical factors that drive the occurrence of socioeconomic drought further it explored the transmission process of socioeconomic drought clarified the transmission process of meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought made up for the lack of transmission mechanism analysis of socioeconomic drought and strengthened the analysis of socioeconomic drought mechanism the main contributions are as follows 1 the socioeconomic drought duration and severity in dongjiang basin were analyzed the socioeconomic drought events with higher severity had longer drought duration and greater drought intensity the severity of socioeconomic drought events in dry season was higher and the drought duration and drought intensity distribution of socioeconomic drought events with higher severity were more discrete 2 the main factors affecting the socioeconomic drought in the dongjiang basin in the future were meteorological and economic factors and the hydrological factors had the least impact on the socioeconomic drought the change of radiative forcing hardly affected the relative influence of meteorological hydrologic and socioeconomic factors in socioeconomic drought precipitation was dominant in climate scenarios with the increase of radiative forcing the relative influence of rural per capita income and vegetation coverage gradually increased 3 there were significant seasonal differences in the propagation of meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin and the propagation time of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was higher than that of hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the propagation time and correlation of meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in wet season were higher than that in dry season the increase of radiation forcing would further reduce the short term propagation time and prolong the long term propagation time and the continuous short propagation time and continuous long propagation time would be more common declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2370,socioeconomic drought can directly affect human survival and economic development however existing literature lacks information related to the formation and development of socioeconomic drought and mainly deals with drought index and its properties we used coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 system dynamics sd method and soil and water assessment tools swat to calculate the standardized water supply and demand index swsdi the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model was applied to identify the driving factors of socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin and predict its future properties then propagation and the time from meteorological and hydrological to socioeconomic drought were predicted the duration and intensity of socioeconomic drought events were lower in the wet season than in the dry season and those having higher severity were more discrete among different factors precipitation exerted more pronounced impacts than radiation forcing similarly positive correlations between total vegetated percentage cover rural per capita income and radiation forcing were observed to be affecting the socioeconomic drought whereas leaf area index was negatively correlated seasonal variations significantly affected the propagation time where the time for the wet season was less than for the dry season moreover intensive radiative forcing would momentarily shorten the optimal propagation time in the wet season and extend it in the dry season results of this study provide a theoretical basis for understanding the causes mechanisms and factors responsible for socioeconomic drought and also provides insights on its transmission mechanism keywords socioeconomic drought driving factors propagation swsdi xgboost cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is considered as a complex natural disaster from the perspective of impact impact time and consequences drought has a great destructive effect on people s lives and ecological environment wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 generally drought is divided into four types meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic all types of drought are induced by the imbalance of water supply and demand wilhite and glantz 1985 sun et al 2022 zhang et al 2019a previous studies have focused more on meteorology hydrology and agricultural drought the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 yu et al 2019 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are the most widely used indexes for monitoring meteorological drought in addition the standardized runoff index sri which uses runoff data to calculate the hydrological drought index has been widely used in hydrological research shukla and wood 2008 the vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci are widely used in agricultural drought monitoring and prediction song et al 2008 unlike meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts socioeconomic drought did not receive much attention until 2015 most scholars defined socioeconomic drought as the inability of water supply of water resources systems to meet the water demand of social development which is an abnormal water deficit caused by the imbalance between supply and demand indexes describing socioeconomic drought mainly include the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri mehran et al 2015 socioeconomic drought index sedi shi et al 2018 and the improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri guo et al 2018 however these indexes have the disadvantages of complex construction large data demand and complex calculation in addition msrri imsrri and sedi were required to rely on reservoir information for socioeconomic drought assessment and when reservoirs do not exist or were not considered in the study area the above indices will not be calculated the recently proposed the standardized water supply and demand index swsdi wang et al 2022 has effectively made up for these deficiencies in addition to building a reasonable socioeconomic drought index the lack of analysis of socioeconomic drought factors restricts the development of socioeconomic drought research according to the definition of socioeconomic drought socioeconomic drought is limited by water supply and water demand but the current understanding of the relationship between supply and demand is less than complete under the background of global climate change the hydrologic cycle is accelerating resulting in a significant change in water supply at the same time lifestyle changes with the development of economy and science and technology resulting in the change of water demand therefore it is necessary to discuss the factors affecting socioeconomic drought in the context of climate change fraser et al 2008 the drought propagation is considered as a necessary means to clarify the process of drought formation guo et al 2019 at present most studies on drought propagation mainly focus on the propagation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought huang et al 2016 limited by the construction mode of socioeconomic drought index and the limited research there are few reports on the transmission process of meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought however transmission between different drought types plays an important role in clarifying the drought evolution mechanism climate change has a significant impact on the water cycle causing changes in water availability by affecting the temporal and spatial distribution of atmospheric water holding capacity which in turn induces more droughts human activities and environmental degradation have caused large scale changes in climate which not only increase the difficulty of drought assessment but also clarify the need for future drought assessment ipcc 2012 with the impact of climate change future meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts will be more severe wang et al 2011 and the evolution law of future socioeconomic droughts is still in the exploratory stage the coupled model inter comparison project cmip driven by the world climate research program wcrp is one of the most influential data sources in the world meehl et al 2000 since its implementation in 1995 more than 20 years of hydrometeorological data have been accumulated which can help predict future scenarios these future data have been used in drought assessment climate change simulation flood forecasting etc since cmip3 dai 2013 the applicability of cmip6 data released in 2020 in simulating future meteorological and hydrological droughts has been demonstrated wang et al 2021 in view of this future socioeconomic drought evolution drivers and propagation were carried out by relying on cmip6 hence research on the influencing factors of future socioeconomic drought and the propagate of socioeconomic drought will help promote understanding of socioeconomic drought this study employs dongjiang basin as a research area and according to the definition of socioeconomic drought swsdi is constructed to explore the change of socioeconomic drought under climate change the factors affecting socioeconomic drought are identified by the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model and the process of propagation between meteorological drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought is analyzed to explore the mechanism of formation of socioeconomic drought this study supplements the socioeconomic drought research le and theoretical support for subsequent socioeconomic drought prediction and management 2 methodology based on the existing research on socioeconomic drought this study aims to explore the evolution driving factors and propagation of socioeconomic drought supplementing the lack and insufficiency of current socioeconomic drought research the socioeconomic drought status is expressed by the socioeconomic drought index swsdi based on the water cycle then the properties of future socioeconomic drought are explored using run theory and the evolution of socioeconomic drought is analyzed the deep learning model xgboost was introduced into the analysis of socioeconomic drought drivers to identify quantify and rank all factors that may affect socioeconomic drought finally the propagation of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought is demonstrated by linear analysis fig 1 2 1 construction of socioeconomic drought index a new standardized water supply and demand index swsdi based on water balance and water cycle was proposed the swsdi was constructed based on the inherent properties of data it ensures that the results are stable across study areas and periods the process of socioeconomic drought event levels being identified by run theory does not require subjective evaluation and does not mandate the presence of reservoirs and impoundments in the study area the swsdi is relevant to a variety of research areas the evaluation results are accurate and the computation process is straightforward thus this index can be used to assess socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin furthermore the sedi approach proposed by shi 2018 was used to extract socioeconomic drought events for the dongjiang basin and the swsdi results were validated from three perspectives socioeconomic drought levels drought durations and drought onset the swsdi achieved satisfactory results wang et al 2022 the standardized water supply and demand index is divided into three modules in the calculation process namely water supply module water demand module and index calculation module the water supply module is calculated by the the soil and water assessment tool swat model and the water demand module is calculated by the system dynamics sd method 2 1 1 water supply module swat model was selected to calculate the water supply capacity of the basin because it has the advantages of visualization multi scale multi variable and multi module and is more suitable for assessing the water supply capacity of the basin eini et al 2019 yang et al 2022 boluo station was selected as the outlet of the basin and the outlet of the monitoring section for simulation and calibration of runoff first digital elevation model dem and river network data were added to the swat model to divide into sub basins secondly land use soil type and corresponding attribute database were added to swat model to establish the geographic information module land use is usually reclassified into water forest and agricultural land and soil types are classified into luvisols lvh eutric regosols rge and cumulic anthrosols atc according to the corresponding attributes third meteorological factors such as precipitation evaporation and radiation were added to swat model to establish meteorological data module the runoff at the outlet of dongjiang basin was simulated through the above three steps the swat cup software was used in the calibration of runoff to adjust and verify model results the parameters calibrated by swat cup software were added to swat model again and the natural runoff of dongjiang basin i e water supply of dongjiang basin was finally obtained it should be noted that the measured runoff of the selected hydrological station was reduced to natural runoff for the calibration of swat model to ensure that runoff results were not affected by the reservoir operation this practice was to better identify the impact factors and the propagation of socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin chen et al 2016 at this point the basin water supply module was fully calculated and the water supply was marked as qs 2 1 2 water demand module when simulating the water demand of the basin the water demand module can generally be divided into two parts in channel water demand and off channel water demand in channel water demand refers to the amount of water required for ship navigation water quality maintenance ecological protection and salt tide suppression and off channel water demand refers to the amount of water required for daily production and lives of residents shi et al 2018 the water demand was calculated using the following formula 1 q d q in q off 2 q in m a x q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 where q1 q2 q3 and q4 are the minimum streamflow required for maintaining water quality standard minimum ecological streamflow minimum streamflow for navigation minimum streamflow for pressure brackish respectively which were collectively referred to as the in channel water demand qin qoff refers to the amount of water needed for people s living and human related activities that is off channel water demand in channel water demand includes requirements for water quality and quantity in general the amount of water required to maintain the stability of river is called in channel water demand according to guangdong province s current comprehensive resources planning the biological environment and navigation seawater flows through the river channel of boluo station in the dongjiang basin at a rate of 203 m3 s tu et al 2015 i e qin 203 m3 s the off channel water demand includes the water quantity related to social economy and people s lives the system dynamics sd method was used to calculate the off channel water demand this method has an excellent accuracy in the prediction of population economy and water resources carrying capacity and other data related to residents lives and is suitable for solving the water demand problem yi et al 2020 therefore the sd method was selected for the simulation and prediction of off channel water demand specifically the original data such as population urbanization rate and resident income were adopted to evaluate the off channel water demand in dongjiang basin based on the cause and effect relationship the prediction model for the expression of the socioeconomic water demand relationship was constructed as follows 3 δ u r w d u p i δ u r p ϕ 1 p ϕ 2 4 δ r u w d r p i δ r u p ϕ 1 p ϕ 1 5 δ d w d δ u r w d δ r u w d 6 dw d t d w d t 1 δ d w d 7 δ u r p t p k δ δ 8 δ r u p δ t p k δ u r p where δ u r w d δ r u w d δ d w d are the increase of urban water demand increase increase of rural water demand increase and increase of total water demand respectively dw d t is the increase of total water demand for year t upi and rpi are the urban per capita income and rural per capita income respectively δ u r p and δ r u p are the increase of urban population and the increase of rural population respectively δ t p k is the increase of population δ δ is the increase of urbanization growth rate p is the water price is the income elasticity coefficient ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the urban population adjustment coefficient and the rural population adjustment coefficient respectively and k is the accommodation coefficient using 2016 as the base year the sd method predicted that the dongjiang basin s water demand in 2099 would be 4 822 billion m3 or 152 90 m3 s details can be referred to the method part of yi 2020 and wang 2022 i e qoff 152 90 m3 s therefore considering all water demands the total water demand at the outlet of dongjiang basin was 355 90 m3 s qd 2 1 3 index calculation module swsdi is calculated by normalizing the probability density function of water supply and demand difference wsdd and converting it into standard normal distribution the swsdi was calculated by the following formula 9 q wsdd q s q d 10 i s w s d i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 where w 2 ln p for p 0 5 if p 0 5 then p was replaced by p 1 p and the sign of the resultant swsdi was reversed the constants were c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 2 2 analysis of socioeconomic drought properties the swsdi was used to identify and assess socioeconomic droughts and can also provide early warning for socioeconomic droughts and coordinate reservoir operation to supplement water demand for the problem of drought properties run theory was generally accepted this method can identify the properties of socioeconomic drought events tu et al 2017 2018 wang et al 2017 including drought duration drought intensity drought start and end time and drought severity therefore this study explains the properties of a drought event drought duration d was defined as the duration from the beginning to the end of the drought event drought severity s was defined as the cumulative sum of the difference between the drought index value and the drought threshold in the drought event drought intensity i was defined as the ratio of drought severity to drought duration of the drought event 2 3 identification of factors driving socioeconomic drought identifying the driving factors of socioeconomic drought was a key link to predicting socioeconomic drought and analysing the socioeconomic drought propagation process the accuracy of identifying the driving factors will directly affect the subsequent processing direction of the socioeconomic drought propagation process the traditional identification methods of drought driving factors include building regression equations of multiple factors or comparing the correlation between them the above method has the disadvantage that the accuracy will be greatly reduced when more driving factors are introduced at the same time the two methods will ignore the problem of there being sno linear relationship between multiple drivers therefore xgboost was introduced into the analysis of drought driving factors this method was employed to predict swsdi through the numerical value of multiple driving factors through a deep learning algorithm when the predicted swsdi was the same as the actual swsdi the contribution of multiple driving factors to swsdi was obtained to obtain the driving factors of socioeconomic drought this relationship is usually nonlinear xgboost is a machine learning technology used for regression and classification which belongs to a class of integrated learning models friedman 2001 the algorithm completes the learning task by constructing and combining multiple regression tree models with good performance and speed on the basis of the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithm a regularization term was added which reduces the risk of overfitting the model and improves the accuracy of the model zhang et al 2019b the process of identifying socioeconomic drought influencing factors through xgboost model was as follows first given a sample x i y i i 1 2 n a regression tree was constructed for the identification of each sample and then n regression trees were constructed expressed as 11 y i i 1 n f k x i f k f where xi is the i th sample and yi is the predicted value of the i th sample f k x i is the regression equation corresponding to the k th regression tree of the i th variable and f is the set of all regression trees secondly the objective function was constructed which is composed of loss function and regularization term the loss function was to fit the training data and the regularization term was used to simplify the model the specific formula was as follows 12 l ϕ i 1 n l y i y i t 1 f t x i k ω f k where l ϕ is the objective function l y i y i t 1 f t x i is the loss function ω f k is the regularization term and yi is the true value of the sample third the real value of the loss function was approximated by the taylor expansion loss function the formula is as follows 13 l y i y i t 1 f t x i l y i y i t 1 g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i where y i y i t 1 is the loss value of t 1 tree before the i th sample g i f t x i is the first partial derivative of y i t 1 and 1 2 h i f t 2 x i is the second order partial derivative of y i t 1 fourth the final objective function was obtained as follows 14 obj t i 1 n g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i ω f t finally by calculating the number of occurrences of the i th input factor xi in all regression trees the importance score of the input factor in the whole model was obtained the calculation formula was as follows 15 score x i n 1 n t score n x i n t where n is the number of trees in the xgboost model and nt is the number of trees in the xgboost model 2 4 propagation of socioeconomic drought spi is a dimensionless meteorological drought index which characterizes the abundance of precipitation in a specific period through the fitting of precipitation probability and captures the precipitation deficit in that period usually in months sri is the hydrological drought index obtained by normal normalization after assuming that the runoff meets the gamma distribution which is used to characterize the abundance of the runoff in a specific period spi and sri can capture the meteorological and hydrological drought properties at different time scales usually 1 48 months and have been widely used in the analysis of meteorological and hydrological drought properties and the description of drought conditions this study calculated the spi of 1 12 months in 2017 2099 through precipitation data under different scenarios in the cmip6 data set and calculated the sri of 1 12 months in 2017 2099 through the swat model to simulate the runoff under different scenarios in the previous analysis of drought transmission the transmission process from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was usually the main one and the relationship between spi and sri was considered as the transmission of drought from meteorology to hydrology considering the time scale of socioeconomic drought the correlation between spi n n month spi and sri n n month sri and swsdi was used to characterize the propagation time from meteorological drought to socio economic drought the time scale n with the strongest correlation with swsdi was considered to represent the best propagation time the spearman correlation coefficient was selected as the criterion for correlation barker et al 2015 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 the specific formula is as follows 16 ρ 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where n is the sample and di is the difference between the ranks of the swsdi and spi n sequences 3 study area and data river basin basin is located between 21 31 and 26 49 n and 102 14 and 115 53 e with a drainage area of 453 690 km3 fig 2 it is one of the three major basins in china along with the yangtze river and the yellow river it includes the pearl river delta xijiang river beijiang river and dongjiang river it is the source of water supply for six provinces and regions including yunnan province guangdong province and guizhou province as well as the hong kong special administrative region hong kong and macao the total water supply population is nearly 40 million and the per capita water resource is about 800 m3 the terrain of dongjiang basin is high in the northeast and low in the southwest the annual average precipitation of dongjiang basin is 1500 2400 mm from the perspective of spatial distribution it is more in the southwest and less in the northeast the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang basin are economically developed in 2019 the total gdp of each region supported by the dongjiang river reached 4 17 trillion yuan in this study monthly scale meteorological data were obtained from bcc csm2 mr cmip6 https esgfnode llnl gov search cmip6 to calculate accurately runoff with swat the 1 125 1 121 grid of precipitation data was uniformly interpolated by latitude and longitude on a 0 5 0 5 grid by bilinear interpolation four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios were used ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively wang et al 2021 the dem and land use into the swat model were from geospatial data clouds https www gscloud cn and landsat satellite remote sensing images https landsat gsfc nasa gov respectively soil properties were from harmonized world soil database hwsd which provided information on soil types soil phases soil physical and chemical properties at each grid point based on all the above data the runoff of dongjiang basin was calculated population and socioeconomics were obtained from the guang zhou statistical yearbook 2020 development data it should be noted that annual scale population gdp and per capita income data were used in the construction of the sd model due to the limitation of data sources therefore the projected water demand for 2100 was on an annual scale and the annual scale water demand was equally distributed among the monthly scales to ensure the correspondence between water supply and water demand because the local government departments usually take the dongjiang river basin as a whole to manage and dispatch water resources in a unified way and the economic development and river water demand of guangdong province are relatively centralized according to the local water supply policy and actual situation the dongjiang basin was considered as a whole to assess socioeconomic drought 4 results and discussion 4 1 socioeconomic drought properties in order to further reveal the driving factors and propagation socioeconomic drought the properties of future socioeconomic drought were further statistically analyzed run theory was used to identify socioeconomic drought events according to the previous definition the drought duration and drought intensity of dongjiang basin from 2017 to 2099 were calculated fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the average drought durations under different scenarios was similar which were 4 54 4 31 4 20 and 4 35 months respectively indicating that the increase of radiation forcing had little impact on the drought duration however the increase of radiation forcing led to the increase of drought duration anomaly that is drought with higher severity occureds more under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the change of drought severity was mainly reflected in the drop intensity as shown in fig 3 b with the increase of radiation forcing the drop intensity gradually decreased but the decrease amplitude decreased on the whole the socioeconomic drought was significantly affected by radiation forcing which was mainly reflected in the higher radiation forcing causing more abnormal drought duration and lower drought intensity in addition future socioeconomic drought events were divided fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the future socioeconomic drought events in the dongjiang basin were evenly distributed throughout the year with the highest probability in march to april and september to october usually the alternating time of high flow period and low flow period since water conservancy facilities such as reservoirs are usually required to supply water to the downstream in the low flow period to meet normal human activities and economic development of the downstream in the high water period water conservancy facilities such as reservoirs need to store water to meet the water supply requirements in the next low flow period resulting in more socioeconomic drought events in the transition time between the high flow period and the low flow period for the humid area in the south the higher radiation forcing brings more precipitation thus increasing runoff and water supply however the population is restricted by urban development and policies resulting in a lower increase in water demand than water supply thus reducing the number of socioeconomic droughts in the dry season in the future in general radiation forcing has little effect on the distribution of socioeconomic drought events but it leads to the relative lag of socioeconomic drought under the scenario of high radiation forcing the interannual distribution of socioeconomic droughts is more concentrated and short term and continuous socioeconomic droughts are more likely to occur 4 2 driving factors of socioeconomic drought in order to further clarify the mechanism of socioeconomic drought the influencing factors of socioeconomic drought under different climate models were identified by the xgboost model fig 5 the relative contributions of different influencing factors are obtained by xgboost model table 1 meteorological factors include precipitation prcp air temperature ta evaporation evspsbl surface downwelling shortwave radiation rsds relative humidity hur and near surface wind speed sfcwind the soil moisture mrso represents the hydrological factors geopotential height zg and bare soil percentage area coverage bareoilfrac constitute geographical factors ecological factors include percentage crop cover cropfrac leaf area index lai and total vegetated percentage cover vegfrac socioeconomic factors are composed of urban population up rural population rp urban per capita income upci and rural per capita income rpci as shown in fig 5 a under the ssp1 2 6 scenario meteorological factors were the dominant factors affecting socioeconomic drought and hydrological factor had low impact on the formation of socioeconomic drought the main reason for this phenomenon was that the hydrological factor shows a low contribution due to its factor of soil moisture which was not directly used by social production according to the composition of swsdi surface runoff and subsurface runoff which can be directly used by production and living were closely related to socioeconomic drought but the source of the above water resources was precipitation therefore precipitation shows an extremely high contribution in the assessment of socioeconomic drought impact factor the relative impact of economic factors ranked the second among all influencing factors which was similar to that of meteorological factors the relative impacts of topography and ecological factors on socioeconomic drought were 0 138 and 0 200 respectively among the meteorological factors prcp and sfcwind were the main factors and the relative effects of other meteorological factors were similar among the ecological factors cropfrac and lai as the dominant factors had almost the same impact on socioeconomic drought vegfrac had little impact on socioeconomic drought the relative impact of all economic factors was similar and upci was slightly higher than other factors as shown in fig 5 b under the ssp2 4 5 scenario meteorological factors were still the dominant factors affecting the socioeconomic drought the relative impact of economic factors on socioeconomic drought was lower than that of the ssp1 2 6 scenario but it was still in the second place of all impact factors the relative effects of topography and ecological factors on socioeconomic drought were similar which were 0 204 and 0 196 respectively the impact of hydrological factors on socioeconomic drought was still low prcp was the main meteorological factor and the relative impact of evspsbl on socioeconomic drought increased up and rp played a dominant role in economic factors at the same time bareoilfrac dominated the impact of topographic factors on the socioeconomic drought as shown in fig 5 c under the ssp3 7 0 scenario the relative impact of meteorological factors on the socioeconomic drought was 0 339 of which prcp hur and evspsbl were the main influencing factors and the relative impacts of the three factors were similar which were 0 066 0 060 and 0 062 respectively the relative impact of ecological factors on socioeconomic drought was 0 221 which improved compared with the ssp1 2 6 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios cropfrac is the main factor of ecological factors the proportion of economic factors was 0 245 and the relative impact of the four economic factors was similar as shown in fig 5 d under the ssp5 8 5 scenario meteorological and economic factors were the dominant factors and the relative impact was 0 363 and 0 304 respectively the impact of ecological factors on socioeconomic drought was 0 229 which was the highest among all scenarios the relative impact of topographic factors on socioeconomic drought reduced to 0 176 the relative influence of ta in meteorological factors was 0 070 higher than that of prcp and both dominated meteorological factors bareoilfrac cropfrac and rpci dominated the topographic ecological and economic factors respectively on the whole the socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin was mainly affected by meteorological and economic factors followed by ecological and topographic factors and the relative impact of hydrological factors was small the influence of different factors on socioeconomic drought and the definition of socioeconomic drought were mutually corroborated meteorological factors increased the supply side of water resources and economic factors controlled the consumption side of water resources both of them dominated the occurrence of socioeconomic drought as the storage end of water resources ecological and topographic factors havd affected the intensity and occurrence time of socioeconomic drought to a certain extent since only natural runoff was considered in the process of constructing swsdi in this paper the hydrological factors were only used as process variables and there was no ability to consume and supply water resources separately thus reducing the relative impact of hydrological factors on the socioeconomic drought from the perspective of different scenarios the relative impact of meteorological hydrological and socioeconomic factors was less affected by radiation forcing the impact of ecological factors on socioeconomic drought increased with the increase of radiation forcing while it was opposite for the topographic factors among the meteorological factors prcp was dominant in all scenarios with the increase of radiation forcing the relative influence of ta gradually increased and the relative influence of evspsbl gradually decreased among the ecological factors the relative impact of cropfrac increased with the increase of radiation forcing and the relative impact of lai was opposite among the topographic factors the relative impact of bareoilfrac reached the maximum in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios and decreased in the ssp5 8 5 scenario among the economic factors the relative impact of rpci increased significantly with the increase of radiation forcing the reasons for the differences between various factors and radiation forcing were analyzed from the perspective of economy and life first of all as an economically developed area the highly dense population and the acceleration of urbanization in the dongjiang basin have brought more favorable economic development however this development is only limited by the area and population pressure of the urban agglomeration resulting in that up and rp hardly change with the change of radiation forcing secondly the increase of radiation forcing has led to more heat island effect which has prompted human beings to need a larger urban agglomeration to cope with this change thus briefly leading to the relative impact change of bareoilfrac third the increase of radiative forcing directly causes the rise of temperature the growth and development of vegetation and temperature show an obvious unimodal curve that is too high or too low temperature will inhibit the growth of vegetation resulting in the change of ecological factors with radiative forcing finally as a humid area the increase of radiative forcing indirectly increases prcp and makes water resources more abundant at the same time the increase of temperature promotes the change of evspsbl resulting in different impacts of meteorological factors on socioeconomic drought in different scenarios 4 3 propagation of socioeconomic drought through the analysis of relationship between the driving factors of socioeconomic drought as the main factor affecting socioeconomic drought the propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought is of more concern at the same time hydrological factors are of great significance to the reservoir water transfer and the construction of water conservancy facilities runoff also serves as the supply side to directly supply water resources to economic development therefore analyzing the transmission from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought has a significant role in analyzing the evolution mechanism of socioeconomic drought in the future different spi n and sri n were calculated and then the correlation between them and swsdi was calculated separately to determine the optimal drought propagation time fig 6 more information is given in table s1 s2 fig 6 shows the spearman correlation between spi n and sri n and swsdi as shown in fig 6 the maximum correlation between swsdi and spi n was considered as the propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought and the maximum correlation between swsdi and sri n was considered as the propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the best propagation time from meteorology and hydrology to socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin ranged from 1 month to 12 months under the ssp1 2 6 scenario the shortest propagation time of meteorological drought in dongjiang basin was april 1 month and the longest propagation time was march june and september 8 months the best propagation time in most months was relatively concentrated in 6 8 months the best propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin was the shortest in may 1 month and the longest in february to march 12 months and the best propagation time in most months was relatively concentrated in 4 6 months under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the shortest propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was february and august september 1 2 months and the longest propagation time was from october to december 11 12 months the shortest propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was from january to march and from may to august 1 2 months under the ssp3 7 0 scenario the shortest propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was december 1 month and the longest propagation time was may august september and november 11 12 months the shortest propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was from february to march and from june to july 1 2 months and the longest propagation time was from may 12 months under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the shortest propagation time from meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was march and august 1 month and the longest propagation time was january to february and from october to december 12 months the shortest propagation time from hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was march and from june to august 1 3 months and the longest propagation time was february and may 11 12 months on the whole there were significant seasonal differences in the propagation of meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in the dongjiang basin the propagation time in the wet season from april to september was lower than that in the dry season from october to march and the correlation between swsdi spi and sri were higher in the wet season than in the dry season the difference between water supply and water demand was considered as the basis for the occurrence of socioeconomic drought water supply was directly affected by runoff precipitation in the rainy season of dongjiang basin accounts for more than 70 of the annual precipitation which is of great significance for the generation of runoff in the rainy season therefore the correlation between swsdi and spi and sri was stronger in the wet season compared with the best propagation time of meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the best propagation time of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was 6 8 months on average the best propagation time of hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was 4 6 months on average and the propagation time of meteorological drought was 2 3 months longer than that of hydrological drought this was because in the process of water circulation precipitation needed to form runoff through the process of production and concentration to supply the social and economic development in different scenarios the increase of radiative forcing would lead to more discrete optimal propagation time from meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought that is the months with shorter propagation time were shorter the months with longer propagation time were longer and the continuous short propagation time and continuous long propagation time would become more common this is because with the increase of radiative forcing the time distribution of annual precipitation would be more uneven and the long lasting and high intensity abnormal precipitation in the wet season would increase resulting in the acceleration of the process of runoff generation and concentration runoff would be directly utilized by the economic development to a certain extent and the propagation time of meteorological and hydrological drought with short propagation time would be further reduced in the dry season with the increase of radiation forcing the uncertainty of precipitation increased and the drought duration and frequency of meteorological and hydrological droughts increased which promoted the extension of propagation time 4 4 discussion according to the influencing factors of socioeconomic drought under different scenarios the transmission process from meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought was analyzed and good analysis results were obtained however the spread of socio economic drought should be a linear or non linear process zhou et al 2020 2021 and the spread of hydrological drought and agricultural drought to socio economic drought should also be emphasized including groundwater drought han et al 2019 limited by space and cmip6 data the transmission of other types of drought to socioeconomic drought would become the topic of research in the next stage in addition the socioeconomic drought was seriously affected by human activities liu et al 2020 in addition to the analysis of the transmission process on the supply side analysis on the demand side was also emphasized from the perspective of river basin the change of demand measurement directly affected the severity of socioeconomic drought resulting in different spatial distribution properties of socioeconomic drought from the perspective of cities changes in demand side factors including heat island effect and urban greening would lead to fluctuations in socioeconomic drought results showed that the socioeconomic drought severity in the area where the reservoir is located and economically developed areas was significantly different from that in other areas indicating that changes in the underlying surface and human activities had a significant impact on socioeconomic drought and further research is needed to quantify this impact in addition human activities have accelerated the spread of meteorological droughts to socioeconomic droughts which does not mean that human activities are completely negative but indirectly indicates that the utilization rate of water resources is improved which is beneficial to economic development how to balance socioeconomic drought and economic development is a key namely managing socioeconomic drought socioeconomic drought management and water scarcity management are conceptually different although both are processes of water regulation they need to be distinguished in terms of potential causes and regulation results in the process of socioeconomic drought management it is not only necessary to consider adjusting the water supply capacity of the basin building reservoirs to adjust the distribution of runoff within a year improving the quality of water resources so that more water resources can be used but also considering the production of water resources under the condition of limited water resources and higher economic benefits improving industrial efficiency enhancing people s awareness of water conservation etc 5 conclusions this study calculated swsdi in dongjiang basin analyzed the socioeconomic drought properties identified the socioeconomic drought influencing factors under different climate scenarios through xgboost model and identified the meteorological economic hydrological ecological and geographical factors that drive the occurrence of socioeconomic drought further it explored the transmission process of socioeconomic drought clarified the transmission process of meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought made up for the lack of transmission mechanism analysis of socioeconomic drought and strengthened the analysis of socioeconomic drought mechanism the main contributions are as follows 1 the socioeconomic drought duration and severity in dongjiang basin were analyzed the socioeconomic drought events with higher severity had longer drought duration and greater drought intensity the severity of socioeconomic drought events in dry season was higher and the drought duration and drought intensity distribution of socioeconomic drought events with higher severity were more discrete 2 the main factors affecting the socioeconomic drought in the dongjiang basin in the future were meteorological and economic factors and the hydrological factors had the least impact on the socioeconomic drought the change of radiative forcing hardly affected the relative influence of meteorological hydrologic and socioeconomic factors in socioeconomic drought precipitation was dominant in climate scenarios with the increase of radiative forcing the relative influence of rural per capita income and vegetation coverage gradually increased 3 there were significant seasonal differences in the propagation of meteorological drought and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in dongjiang basin and the propagation time of meteorological drought to socioeconomic drought was higher than that of hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought the propagation time and correlation of meteorological and hydrological drought to socioeconomic drought in wet season were higher than that in dry season the increase of radiation forcing would further reduce the short term propagation time and prolong the long term propagation time and the continuous short propagation time and continuous long propagation time would be more common declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2371,rainfall nowcasting supports emergency decision making in hydrological agricultural and economical sectors however short term prediction is challenging because meteorological variables are strongly interconnected and rapidly change during an event since machine learning do not require any previous physical assumption this study investigates their ability to provide reliable and quick forecasts this paper proposes a machine learning model for probabilistic rainfall nowcasting at 10 min intervals for short lead times from 30 min up to 6 h the model employs cumulative rainfall fields from station data as inputs for a feed forward neural network to predict rainfall interval and the corresponding probability of occurrence cumulative rainfall depths from station data were used to overcome the lack of temporal memory of the feed forward neural networks in this way using only the current rain field as input the model exploited pattern recognition techniques combining both temporal cumulative rainfall depth and spatial cumulative rainfall field information based on 359 rain events observed in an area of 1619 km2 in southern italy 95 machine learning models were independently trained for 19 recording stations and for each target lead time 30 60 120 180 and 360 min comprehensive nowcasts verification was performed to analyse the reliability of probabilistic nowcasts using both continuous rmse and rae and categorical pod far and csi indicators the performance of the models was also compared with the results of eulerian persistence all the models produced consistent nowcasts and learnt the complex relationship describing space time rainfall evolution as expected predictive accuracy gradually decreased as the lead time increase according to physically based models results showed that the use of both temporal and spatial information enables the model to predict short term rainfall using only the current measurements as input resulting in a rapid easily replicable and convenient nowcasting approach the procedure is an effective way to predict multi step rainfall fields and is suitable for operational early warning system keywords precipitation nowcasting multi step predictions rain gauge measurements pattern recognition feed forward neural networks cumulative rainfall fields data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction nowcasting models use real time data to predict rainfall with short lead times from few minutes up to six hours they influence many aspects of daily life especially during emergency which can affect human life and environmental issues indeed operational short term rainfall forecasting are essential for early warning systems to reduce fatalities and economic losses caused by flooding landslides and other rainfall induced hazards parmar and kinjal mistree 2017 ayzel et al 2020 barrera animas et al 2022 chen et al 2022 foresti et al 2016 hammad et al 2021 liu et al 2021 luo et al 2022 ravuri et al 2021 wmo 2017 to evaluate possible critical situations an effective nowcasting model requires a succession of nowcasts characterized by high update frequency and short computational time imhoff et al 2022 wmo 2017 prior investigations queried several approaches to meet nowcasting models requirements the prevailing are 1 model driven methods mdms which entail the identification of the relationships among variables involved 2 data driven methods ddms which comprise all the models that employ available data in order to identify patterns and classify new ones without making a priori assumptions de luca and capparelli 2022 mdms encompass numerical weather prediction nwp models which are appealing in water community because of their proven effectiveness and robustness through the years de luca and capparelli 2022 liu et al 2021 nwp models solve mathematical equations to simulate the dynamics and physics of the atmosphere producing reliable forecasts regardless of their exact applications nwp implementation is nontrivial due to the high dimensionality of the spatiotemporal relationship between meteorological variables they represent a valid rainfall forecasting tools for daily temporal scale and over spatial scale of the order of 1000 km de luca and capparelli 2022 however nwp models can capture mesoscale weather patterns such as fronts but not the smaller scale convective patterns that occur within mesoscale systems chao et al 2018 as a result convective heavy precipitation cells are difficult to predict with nwp models mainly because their lifetimes are often shorter than 30 min jasper tönnies et al 2018 thus a level of nowcast accuracy at the convective scale is challenging to reach with nwp simonin et al 2017 moreover adequate observations of meteorological variables are not regularly available within the area of interest which makes it difficult to define accurate initial and boundary conditions dolciné et al 1997 on the other hand ddms have also been widely used to unravel hydrological problems including rainfall forecasting hong 2008 ridwan et al 2021 valverde ramírez et al 2005 they can identify the relationships between input and output data without making a priori assumption about the physical processes they are willing when is not easy to recognise all the existing complex and typically non linear relationships of the dynamical process disadvantages of ddms include their black box nature proneness to over fitting and the empirical nature of model development bai et al 2021 liong and he 2010 among ddms machine learning ml techniques has propelled to the forefront in investigations of nowcasting methods prudden et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 chang et al 2014b illustrate the benefit of using a hybrid ml model based on self organizing map som and dynamic neural networks for forecasting inundation maps based solely on rainfall data and historical inundation depths chang and tsai 2016 propose an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model for flood forecasting and demonstrate its capability in modelling the complex rainfall runoff process with a with a temporal resolution of 10 min and a spatial resolution of 1 25 km they reveal that the approach alleviates the timing error problem and improves the accuracy and reliability of the forecast a ml model to estimate 6 hour precipitation at a spatial resolution of 5 km based on himawari 8 and ground stations data over china was recently developed by zhou et al 2022 also liu et al 2022 show how a deep neural network model for hourly rainfall forecasting using radar echo images can predict over 40 of rainfall events and forecast well on small scale intense rainfall it is still unknown whether the ddms will gradually prevail over the mdms or vice versa and how the traditional models will further develop given the distinct philosophy used in those two groups of models kim et al 2021b in some recent studies researchers have used ml techniques to rainfall nowcasting and some studies have achieved better performances than traditional methods kim et al 2021a indeed the flexibility and conceptual simplicity of ml makes them attractive for nowcasting purposes asghari and nasseri 2015 despite recent advances in weather forecasting models based on ml techniques precipitation nowcasting is still a challenge for researchers and operational weather services kim et al 2021a lengfeld et al 2020 a further distinction within nowcasting models depends on the spatial scale and mostly on the data availability different input data may be used they include gridded data from radars satellites or rain gauges radar based models use a sequence of radar images to extrapolate the rainfall distribution at future time steps and produce rainfall forecasts in the short term and at fine temporal and spatial scales yang et al 2020 they assume that over the time frame of a few hours the evolution of precipitation can be captured by moving the radar echoes along a stationary motion field without changes in intensity pulkkinen et al 2019 even though radar based models can capture the initial precipitation state as the lead time increases the skill of the nowcasting models rapidly decreases mainly because growth and decay precipitation processes are not considered moreover weather radar measurements show non negligible and sometimes even large errors which propagate and increase with the lead time as a result radar based models have a predictability limit up to 30 min lead time and can be referred to as a qualitative semi quantitative measurement device shehu and haberlandt 2021 sokol et al 2021 thorndahl et al 2017 in contrast to qualitative radar data nowcasting models can also employ rain gauge one which are considered the reference devices for the measurement of the amount of precipitation at ground level duan et al 2021 moraux et al 2019 shehu and haberlandt 2021 rain gauges report precipitation rate and accumulation and provide information on instantaneous rainfall intensity and heavy rainfall over short periods the main drawback of rain gauges is their lack of spatial representatively being point measurements yang et al 2020 indeed if a storm occurs between the rain gauges they can miss the peak rainfall intensity which will automatically lead to an underestimation of the forecast however if a particularly dense network of rain gauges is available it is possible to use it for detection and nowcasting purposes wmo 2017 since accurate predictions influence the quality of the nowcasting and thus the efficiency of security measures and related impacts imhoff et al 2020 this study employs quantitative measurements registered by rain gauge ones moreover valid rainfall estimates govern real time early warning system and weather radar real time adjustment is challenging at the beginning of rainfall events with no prior rain gauge data recordings however if the performance of the radar compared to the gauge data is valid radar data could be suitable too to provide a cost effective and rapid nowcasting model this study investigates the enhancement that can be reached in rainfall nowcasting exploiting ml methods and using rain gauge measurements as inputs the study proposes a probabilistic machine learning approach for rainfall nowcasting at 10 min intervals for short lead times from 30 min to 6 h the model is based on 19 recording station and their cumulative rainfall depths classified in 20 classes which serve as an input for a feed forward neural network model feed forward neural networks have recently achieved outstanding predictive performance and have become an indispensable tool in a wide range of pattern recognition applications bai et al 2021 bishop 2006 stated that the most successful model in the context of pattern recognition are the feed forward neural networks however feed forward neural networks do not have a temporary memory thus they can not be trained to learn sequential or time varying patterns chang et al 2014a to overcome this drawback this study employs cumulative rainfall depths which are non decreasing variables unlike rainfall depths which can vary during an event cumulative rainfall depth cannot decrease likewise the model employs rainfall depths measured in adjacent gauges which also provide valuable spatial information as a result temporal memory is achieved through both cumulative rainfall depth and cumulative rainfall depth from adjiancet gauges in this way the model predicts short term punctual rainfall using only the current measurement as input indeed pattern recognition techniques aim exactly at the automatic detection of regularities in data in order to classifying them into different categories according to found regularities see appendix a pattern recognition techniques for further details in this way the model results in a rapid easily repicable and convenient nowcasting approach moreover since precipitation nowcasts issued by ml systems are often subject to uncertainties the proposed model associates to them a probability of occurrence indeed it is crucial to provide together with a nowcast an estimation of its uncertainty foresti et al 2016 since there are many forms of uncertainty in modelling any sensible model will be uncertain when predicting unobserved data at the lowest level model uncertainty is introduced from measurement noise at higher levels a model may have many parameters and there is uncertainty about which values of these parameters will be good at predicting new data the probabilistic approach to modelling uses probability theory to express forms of uncertainty in this study the probabilistic prediction is achieved employing the softmax function in the ml model which is used to solve nonlinear multiple classification problems huang and xiang 2018 the softmax function turns a real values vector into a vector of real values between 0 and 1 that sum 1 so that they can be interpreted as probabilities therefore the model supplies the most likely forecast as long with the associate probability since probabilistic predictions provides greater economic and decision making value than deterministic ones ravuri et al 2021 this approach enhances model operational utility and reliability to conclude the flexibility and conceptual simplicity of the proposed approach makes it a promising tool for nowcasting purposes 2 study area and dataset the campania region southern italy which has an area of 13 600 km2 and a population of about 5 8 million of peoples is currently divided into 8 meteorological warning zones according to homogeneity criteria which consider the following factors hydrography morphology rainfall geology land use hydraulic and hydrogeological events administrative boundaries piciullo et al 2016 the study area is zone 1 of the campania region fig 1 it covers 1619 km2 and includes 109 municipalities and 19 rain gauges fig 1 the area has a complex system of highlands and two main volcanic structures vesuvius and the phlegrean fields these two orographic features constitute an important factor in the mesoscale meteorology of the region enhancing convection systems development especially in summer season the study area is in the proximity of the mediterranean sea and thus the dominant climate is the mediterranean characterized by long dry summer periods and rainy winters with mild temperatures in particular the winter period is dominated by stratiform rainfall events which can last up to a few days in summer there are stratiform events convective events and combinations of these furthermore in cold season the region is sometimes affected by polar maritime air masses coming from the north atlantic which can lead to the development of thunderstorm cells over the sea surface and the coastal sectors on the other hand in the warm season the thunderstorm events are mainly triggered by the interaction between small scale mechanism and synoptic scale flow capozzi et al 2018 for every rain gauge station over the study area table 1 the campania region department of civil protection dpc provided rainfall measurements every 10 min with 0 2 mm resolution in events determination all intervals with only 0 2 mm in 10 min were ignored because these are often artefacts of condensation at the end of events which increase the duration of events with minimal increase in rainfall depth gaál et al 2014 2 1 rainfall events rain events are a convenient way of summarizing rainfall time series into entities that are meaningful in terms of a particular application haile et al 2011 therefore it is important to define a rain event and the time duration considered to distinguish it since this study aims at predicting punctual rainfall with short lead times to later upgrade the model into an operative early warning system the definition of spatial events was revised it is common to define punctual rainfall events by the minimum inter arrival time index hereafter referred as mit with regards to a single station a storm is as a period of rainfall with preceding and succeeding dry periods more than mit heneker et al 2001 many application based criteria for identifying rainfall events using a fixed mit exist in literature with values ranging from 3 min to 24 h since the model employs precipitation fields the mit criteria was adapted for them thus with regards to meteorological stations over an area a rainfall event is defined as a period of rainfall with preceding and succeeding dry periods more than mit for the whole number of stations existing in the area according to climate characteristics precipitation events were identified separately for the warm april september and cold october march season a mit of 2 h was chosen for warm season and of 1 h for cold one fig 2 depicts two so defined rainfall event almost 32 events per years for a total of 359 rainfall events occurred in the study area from 2009 to 2019 and were registered by the 19 rain gauge stations fig 3 for each month the main statistics of the selected rainfall events were computed fig 4 a rain event duration t 1 t 2 t m where m is the number of events b maximum total rainfall volume registered during the m rain events h max 1 h max 2 h max m 1 1 h

depth registered by the i th station during k th rain event most of the events were contemporary registered by all the stations which is typical to stratiform events however during some events more than one convective cell was observed in particular during the winter period rain events have smaller rain depths and can last up to few days which is typical to stratiform events while in summer rain events occur predominantly in the form of more localized rain showers with shorter durations and higher rain depths according to convective event type formation 3 methodology the machine learning model the ml model employs cumulative rainfall depth from recording stations over the study area as inputs to predict rainfall interval and the corresponding probability of occurrence in one of the stations after dt lead time in particular for each of the 19 stations and for each of the 5 lead times 30 60 120 180 and 360 min a model was independently developed and trained from the others for a total of 95 models fig 5 shows nowcasts workflow with regards to one station and one lead time let t0 be the time when a rain event starts the first step is reading the cumulative rainfall depths observation of the stations over the study area 5 h t 0 h 1 h 2 h n where n is the number of the stations according to contingency table 2 the observations h t 0 are discretized into rain intervals or rain classes x t 0 as better explained in section 3 1 input variable pre processing to form the input pattern after the discretization the difference between two values within the same interval is neglected 6 x t 0 x 1 x 2 x n where n is the number of the stations the input pattern at t0 x t 0 pass through the nowcasting model section 3 2 to predict the probabilities of occurrence p y t 0 d t for every rain interval y t 0 d t at t0 dt with dt being equal to the lead time section 3 3 7 p y t 0 d t p y 1 p y 2 p y n where y i is the rain interval n is the number of rain intervals and p y i the probability of occurrence of y i the probability of occurrence p y i is calculated through the softmax function more details about models set up are given in appendix b model structure which ensures that the sum of the p y i is equal to one 8 i 1 n p y i 1 finally the model selects the rain class y t with the highest probability 9 y t p y t max p y 1 p y 2 p y n where n is the number of rain classes at time t1 new registrations are available h t 1 which are added up to the previous registrations h 0 and discretised in x t 1 according to corresponding rain class then x t 1 are employed by the model to provide new nowcasts thus the associated probability of occurrence p y t 1 d t the update frequency is 10 min thus t0 t1 10 min each model has its own parameters but the input pattern is the same for each of them which means that the input at time t0 vector xt0 is passed through each model but each model predicts different outputs a numerical example of the input output pattern is given below assuming that the vector ht is ht 0 2 1 0 3 2 0 2 4 2 4 6 5 8 1 2 1 2 0 2 0 4 1 4 1 6 2 4 1 2 0 2 0 4 0 2 0 4 it will be discretised into the corresponding vector xt xt 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 the nowcast after dt lead time for the station number 4 will be the vector py4 t dt py4 t dt 0 0 02 0 04 0 89 0 01 0 01 0 01 0 01 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 thus the highest probability for the station number 4 is associated to the class third 89 i e the most probable rain interval is between 5 and 10 mm according to contingency table 2 3 1 input variables pre processing according to moon et al 2019 we discretized continuous data h t into intervals x t thus after the discretization the difference between two values within the same interval is neglected table 2 is the contingency table for the discretized intervals of precipitation hereafter referred as rain classes or classes 20 classes with different width ranging from 2 mm to 25 mm were defined the upper limit of the highest class is 200 mm which depends on the employed data set thus on the rainfall events according to mit criteria for rainfall events determination section 2 1 the maximum total rainfall volume observed during the 359 events was almost of 194 mm fig 4 as a result when an observed value is higher than 200 mm the rainfall event is considered finished our discretization is narrower than the ones done by moon et al 2019 suyatno et al 2018 resulting in a higher number of intervals and accuracy it is worth highlighting that the 20 classes have different percentage of examples resulting in an asymmetrical distribution with higher frequency for the firsts classes to achieve a uniform distribution interval should have been narrower for lower classes and wider for higher ones however on one hand a further discrimination among firsts classes would have led to interval of less than 1 mm width resulting in a useless precision for operational nowcasting on the other hand higher classes would have been joint into a wider one leaking valuable information therefore rather than a uniform classes distribution this study prefers intervals with variable width 3 2 model set up and training strategy once pre processed the input data x t are passed through each of the feed forward neural network models a neural network is defined by its structure including the number of hidden layers the number of nodes in each hidden layer how the layers are linked which activation function is used and the weights for each station and for each lead time a feed forward neural network was independently developed and trained from the others more details about models set up are given in appendix b model structure the training problem consists of finding the optimal combination of weights of the ml model the most common training strategy is the backpropagation which adjusts the weights of connections between neurons in hidden and output layers to reduce the error in the output however when the dataset consists of experimental points normally there is some noise in the data therefore reproducing the dataset exactly as it is not the best strategy because the noise will be reproduced too moreover one of the main drawbacks of ml models is overfitting which happens when the model is performing well on the dataset but performs poorly on new unseen data to avoid those problems early stop technique is applied while training the models the dataset and thus the rainfall events were split into three groups the period 2009 2014 was used for training 60 the period 2015 2016 for validation 10 while 2017 2019 for testing 30 the training set was used to train the model by tuning its parameters with the back propagation algorithm validation set asserted generalizing ability and avoid overfitting which happens when the model is performing well on the data used during training but performs poorly on new unseen data nguyen and bae 2020 as shown in fig 6 the network stops training when the error over the validation set red line increase while the error over training set blue line is still decreasing in this way the network avoids over fitting evaluating the performance on the validation set is done to determine and optimize different network architectures and training strategies selecting the model and training method performing the best on the validation set introduce the risk of overfitting this dataset finally testing set is needed for final model evaluation we trained all the models by minimizing the cross entropy loss 10 which is most commonly used for classification zhang and sabuncu 2018 10 los s j o j ln p j 1 o j ln 1 p j where pj is the corresponding predicted value to oj observed value at epoch j an epoch refers to one cycle through the dataset is passed forward and backward the neural network 3 3 output variables post processing probabilistic approach once trained each ml model predicts an output vector of probability of occurrence p y t d t associated to the vector of rain classes y t d t the probabilistic output from ml models is achieved employing softmax function in the output layer appendix b the softmax is useful because provides a normalized probability distribution conditioned on the input huang and xiang 2018 the input values can be positive negative zero or greater than one but the softmax transforms them into values between 0 and 1 many multi layer neural networks end in a penultimate layer which outputs real valued scores that are not conveniently scaled and which may be difficult to work with the probability of occurrence enhances ml model operational utility and reliability from operational perspective it is crucial to provide together with the nowcast an estimation of its uncertainty hence probabilistic predictions provide greater economic and decision making value than deterministic ones 3 4 performance criteria for the testing dataset the nowcasts are verified against the observed values using both continuous and categorical scores the continuous scores include the root mean square error rmse and root square error rse since the model predicts a rain class thus an interval the continuous metrics are evaluated with regards to the mean values of the classes 11 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n mm 12 rse i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n μ o o i 2 where pi and oi are the predicted and observed rainfall classes n is the number of observations μ is the mean of observations μo the categorical scores include three indicators commonly used in the meteorological community probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi they are skill scores similar to precision and recall commonly used by machine learning researchers kim et al 2017 the values of the scoring indicators range from 0 to 1 the lower far the better and the higher the value of csi and pod the better 13 pod hits hits misses 14 far false alarm false alarm hits 15 csi hits hits false alarm misses where hit indicates that observed rainfall class is correctly predicted false alarm indicates that predicted rainfall class is greater than the observed one miss indicates that predicted rainfall interval is lower than the observed one table 3 according to how categorical indicators were defined a threshold was not needed indeed the model nowcasts a rainfall class thus a categorical value all the performance criteria are calculated per each station by pooling together the information from all the events moreover confusion matrix is used to find the level of accuracy of the multiclass classification model it shows the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm especially in the supervised learning method suyatno et al 2018 the confusion matrix consists of columns that represent predicted data classes and rows that represent the original data class finally the verification results are compared with those from eulerian persistence ep which assumes that for any lead time t dt the nowcasts are the observation at time t 4 result and discussion the first section 4 1 presents models performances with regards to all the events from the testing set while section 4 2 focus separately on some rainfall events 4 1 nowcast performance and skill evaluation of the 95 models for the testing set years 2017 2018 and 2019 the rmse and rse for all the 95 ml models were computed fig 7 rmse mean values increase from 1 67 mm to 6 15 mm while rse values range between 0 158 and 0 186 from 30 minutes to 6 hours lead time models respectively table 3 the interquartile range iqr of the boxplots is narrow for 30 min lead times but becomes wider for 6 h lead times this suggests that the models perform similarly for all rain gauges at short lead times but differently for higher lead times the rmse and rse of the ep nowcast are significantly higher than the one obtained by the proposed models the difference is accentuated for increasing lead times and highlights the ability of the proposed models to provide better estimation than the simple ep model as expected 30 minutes lead time models produce the best performance while 6 hours ones perform the worst these trends are broadly consistent with physical behaviour thus it is widely recognised that as the nowcast lead time increases the correlation between desired output and available input decreases lin et al 2009 and rainfall nowcasts deteriorate heuvelink et al 2020 model accuracy analysis reveals the same trends mentioned above pod and csi decrease from 0 5 h to 6 h lead time model while far increase fig 8 the 30 minutes lead times models achieve the highest csi 90 94 and pod 91 64 and lowest far 0 82 giving better performance table 4 notwithstanding the decreasing trend pod and csi are all higher than 74 45 and 67 48 and far lower than 12 25 which means they all are on average close their ideal values 100 100 and 0 respectively confirming the goodness of fit of the models in particular low values of far are desirable for early warning systems since they cause financial losses and may result in people losing their confidence in weather services and civil protection authorities liu et al 2021 the proposed models outperformed the benchmark ep for all the lead time and performance criteria fig 8 indeed the ep approach is suitable for precipitation fields with negligible advection but can lead to large errors in predicting intensity of moving rainfall patterns moreover the models show an underestimation of the observations as better depicted in confusion matrixes fig 9 the dispersion of the values from the main diagonal provides accurate insights about the error made by the models even though the dispersion from the correctly predicted class diagonal cells is slightly appreciable for 30 min lead times model it considerably increases for the higher lead times models also heuvelink et al 2020 found that the rainfall forecasting skill was found to decrease with increasing lead time often associated with an underestimation of the nowcasted rainfall this was probably related to the fact that the nowcasting schemes do not explicitly take the possible growth of rain cells into account in the proposed models the observed tendency to underestimate is mainly due to one reason first the output variables were discretized into intervals which have different number of examples almost 60 of the time steps table 2 fall in the first three classes 1 2 3 consequently the models have more low classes examples and are willing to predict them rather than higher classes to have equally size interval boundary intervals might have been set differently however this would have given too wide intervals and would have been useless for nowcasting purpose thus confusion matrixes highlighted that the model is influenced by the discretization of the rainfall into classes the result of the proposed model could be compared with the ones obtained by shehu 2021 who investigated how to extend the predictability limit of rainfall at fine scale 5 min and 1 km2 by improving the radar rainfall field fed into the nowcast models with regards to a lead time up to 3 h shehu 2021 illustrated that the temporal rmse between nowcasted time series and real input field varies up to 0 5 mm 5min 6 mm h on the other hand the rmse obtained with our model ranges between 3 64 and 5 53 mm 10 min i e 21 84 and 33 18 mm h fig 7 according to the results shehu s model provided better result than ours an explanation why the rmse of our models were higher lies in the way they were calculated indeed the rmse considered the mean of the rainfall classes therefore even though a hit is registered in terms of categorical criteria the observed intensities can still deviate from the rainfall class mean however even though this comparison may not be entirely reliable since the spatial resolution of our model is coarser than shehu 2021 our model is competitive for several reasons first we employed rain gauge data which are the reference devices for hydrological application thus the nowcasts were not affected by the error of conversion from radar measurement which allowed our model to obtain reliable prediction in real time without further processing of the data furthermore weather radar real time adjustment is particularly difficult at the beginning of rainfall events with no prior rain gauge data recordings while shehu 2021 used radar data which certainly offered almost a full spatial coverage but inevitably displays a discrepancy with the gauge that will propagate and increase with the lead time as a result shehu 2021 identified a predictability limit of the model which was up to 3 h lead time moreover not only our models provided a nowcast but also the corresponding probability of occurrence this is probably the main strength of the model since it allows an estimation of the uncertainty of the nowcast which is crucial for early warning purpose another advantage could be attributed to the easy replicability and cost effective times to run indeed once the models are trained the nowcasts are provided in real time i e the computational time is of the order of the millisecond our models seem promising but further correction needs to be performed in order to account for the lack of spatial representatively since the models make punctual prediction if a storm occurs between the rain gauges they can miss the peak rainfall intensity and automatically lead to an underestimation of the forecast indeed depending to the specific velocity or advection when at some stations a storm is captured the others will capture it with a time shift however since our models do not consider the time shift the performance criteria penalised the results if criteria with a specific threshold were implemented and time independent then the performance would have been different according to overall result it is evident that there is a consistent physical behaviour which is not obvious when dealing with machine learning techniques liu et al 2022 as already stated one of the main drawbacks of artificial intelligence algorithms is their tendency to produce results that cannot be rationally explained as a result users are unwilling to use them in addition it can be said that the training strategy was successful not only the model allows evaluation of rainfall information but also the estimation of the transition from non rain to rain conditions and prediction of short rainfall patterns which are not easy to evaluate in advance these features allow good quality in rainfall nowcasting ensuring an effective warning issue 4 2 event based performance on testing set to highlight the ability of the model to predict different types of events the performances of the proposed nowcasting models are shown and compared for two of them that differ in terms of 1 duration 2 average total rain depth among the stations 3 maximum total rain depth 4 maximum 10 min rain depth and 5 average 10 min rain depth table 5 the characteristics of the rain depth registered during event n 311 were similar to convective cells characterized by high intensities and short durations even though the event lasted almost 19 h the measurements were intermittent and lasted around one hour fig 10 on the other hand event n 357 was related to the mechanism that generate a stratiform rainfall characterized by greater areas of influences higher durations and lower rainfall intensities as compared to the convective precipitation fig 10 4 2 1 event on 1 october 2018 the event of 1st october 2018 occurred with two earlier rain bursts followed by almost 7 h of continuous rain period discontinuously measured by the stations over the study area fig 10 left an average of 26 16 mm fell in 19 h with the highest total depth value of 59 60 mm registered by station number 6 while station number 3 detected the highest peak at 12 50 cet central european time of 16 40 mm fig 10 the peak value lasted less than 1 h and was particularly high the maximum annual value registered by the station to emphasize the ability of the models to detect local peaks results are presented in terms of the mean values of the rain depth between observed and predicted rain classes fig 11 among the 5 models 30 min lead time one performed the greatest result it achieved a rmse of 1 92 mm and a rse of 2 79 in contrast 6 hours lead time model nowcasts deviated from the observed data resulting in a rmse of 11 50 mm and a rse of 16 71 similarly pod decreased from 100 to 13 csi from 96 to 9 and the far increased from 4 to 75 table 6 the decline of the performance criteria within the 5 models was partly due to the sharp evolution of the rainfall registered by station 3 indeed the peak value occurred quickly after a period of no rain burst which is besides typical of convective cells capozzi et al 2018 as a result the 6 hours models had not enough stored information about the prior time step thus the cumulative rain depths registered by station 3 were zero even though the proposed models failed to nowcast the real values at the correct time for higher lead times they provided notable nowcasts for a lead time up to 1 h which are valuable for dispatching decision making pod csi and far suggest that the models could support early warning systems to increase preparedness until more data becomes available we believe that these results were possible thanks to the joint use of cumulative rain depth from nearby stations even though station 3 started recording no zero value of rain depths only around 12 00 cet the models already provided nowcasts because the rain event already started over the study area according to rain event identification section 2 1 this performance is also consistent with the result obtained by ghaemi et al 2021 who evaluated the nowcasting product of 2 km resolution gridded data from 2007 to 2018 they observed that during four extreme convective short duration events there was a time shift in peak intensity detection as happened in our models fig 11 it is worth highlighting that without the further information from the nearby stations the nowcast of such isolated peak would have been trivial the introduction of cumulative rain depths from nearby stations as inputs to the model allowed to capture spatiotemporal features in this way the models learnt the rainfall process without storing antecedent time steps but according to the spatial characteristics 4 2 2 event on 19 december 2019 the event on 19th december 2019 was homogenously registered by all stations over the study area an average of 50 57 mm fell in 22 h with the highest values detected during the ten central hours from 11 00 to 21 00 fig 10 results are shown for meteorological station number 5 that registered the highest cumulative rain depth value of 122 00 mm almost gradually increasing during the event fig 12 to highlight the ability of the model to predict the increasing rain depth during the event results are presented in terms of cumulative rain depth between observed and predicted rain classes all the models recognised the increasing rainfall pattern registered by station n 5 however for higher lead times models the nowcasts were greater than the observed values resulting in an overestimation once again as the lead time increased the performance of the models decreased the 30 min lead time model showed a rmse of 0 35 mm which increased to 4 50 mm for the 6 h lead time one table 7 while rse increased from 3 to 36 also meteorological indicators trends are consistent with previous results pod far and csi changed from 98 3 and 95 to 69 29 and 53 respectively comparing the evaluation metric between the events on the 1st october 2018 and on the 19th of december 2019 we found that the 2nd was better predicted than the 1st we believe that these results were possible thank to gradual light rain evolution not only the stratiform events display higher correlation than the simple convective ones thus a higher predictability should be expected from these storms but they also have many more timesteps to choose from in the training phase as a result the models are favouring the stratiform ones moreover results obtained are compatible with imhoff et al 2020 who showed that longer rain events durations consisting of larger more persistent systems have a higher predictability than the shortest durations that generally consist of short lifetime high intensity convective precipitation events they demonstrated that the average mean absolute error mae of the nowcasting model for stratiform rainfall becomes 3 times lower than the ones achieved during more convective rainfall with higher intensities ayzel et al 2020 proposed a neural network for radar based precipitation nowcasting to predict continuous precipitation intensities at a lead time of five minutes they found that the models had a limited ability to predict high rainfall intensities probably due to a remarkable level of spatial smoothing in its predictions moreover that smoothing becomes increasingly apparent at longer lead times as suggested by their results the nowcast performance is quite sensitive to type of the event and thus the results shown here do not contradict the fact that stratiform type events may perform better than the convective type to conclude the comparison between the analysed events the models provided better precipitation nowcasts when the extension of the event is homogeneous but failed to successfully catch local precipitation events sufficiently in advance thus as expected for convective rain events where the rain evolves rapidly the potential lead time is short dolciné et al 1998 5 conclusions this study investigated rainfall nowcasting performance exploiting machine learning techniques using cumulative precipitation fields from rain gauge stations 95 feed forward neural networks were independently trained and tested on 359 rainfall events that occurred over the study area one of the eight warning zones of the campania region in southern italy the model employed cumulative rainfall depths of the recording stations classified in 20 classes as an input for the feed forward neural network which nowcasted probable rain interval after 30 60 120 180 and 360 min the idea of using cumulative rain depth from nearby stations was due to lack of temporal memory of feed forward neural network this allowed to store antecedent time steps and to use only the current rain field as input resulting in a rapid and easy replicable method on the other hand the probabilistic nowcast was achieved by employing the softmax function in the machine learning model which is widely used to solve nonlinear multiple classification problems therefore the model supplied the most likely nowcast as long with the associate probability to provide a valid training strategy avoiding overfitting while preserving generalization abilities the dataset was split into two parts years 2009 to 2016 were used to train the models while 2017 to 2019 to test the performance of each model was evaluated and compared using different metrics both continuous rmse and rse and categorical pod csi and far in addition the eulerian persistence ep was considered as a benchmark model generally the models with a lead time up to 2 h produced consistent nowcasts and learnt the complex relationship describing space time rainfall evolution as expected predictive accuracy gradually decreased as the lead time increase according to physically based models notwithstanding the decreasing trend the performance indicators were all close their optimal range confirming the goodness of fit of the models the rmse mean values increased from 1 67 mm to 6 15 mm while rse ranged between 1 58 and 18 64 from 30 minutes to 6 hours lead time models respectively model accuracy analysis revealed similar trends pod and csi decreased from 0 5 h to 6 h lead time model while far increased the 30 minutes lead times models achieved the highest csi 90 94 and pod 91 64 and lowest far 0 82 giving better performance the proposed models outperformed the benchmark ep for all the lead times and performance criteria results showed that it was possible to make a nowcast better than the ep by considering the cumulative rainfall depth from adjacent stations thus the use of both temporal and spatial information for precipitation nowcasting allowed an extension of the lead time up to which a reliable forecast may be issued providing a quick prediction based on actual values solely to the authors knowledge this study is the first to present a comparative analysis of the performance of rainfall nowcasting models based on rain gauge information and on modern machine learning algorithms in predicting probable rainfall interval with 10 minutes update frequency moreover the ability of the model to predict different types of events was investigated the performances of the proposed nowcasting models were compared for two events of the testing set whose characteristics were similar to convective events characterized by high intensities and short durations and stratiform ones characterized by greater areas of influences higher durations and lower rainfall intensities respectively according to the results the models provided better nowcasts when the extension of the event is homogeneous but failed to successfully catch local precipitation events sufficiently in advance thus as expected for convective rain events where the rain evolves rapidly the potential lead time is short even though the models detected the increasing rainfall pattern registered for higher lead times models the nowcasts were greater than the observed values resulting in an overestimation to contrast the stratiform event was better predicted than the convective one we believe that these results were possible thank to gradual light rain evolution consisting of larger more persistent systems for future work a study regarding how the location of the station influences the model performances will be carried out one idea is to group the results according to the relative distance between the stations or according to the area of influences of each station which could be the thiessen polygon area moreover the results would also be grouped according to the type of the event convective stratiform or mixed as well as the duration of the event this would be an interesting comparison which may help future research to identify certain patterns that need to be incorporated into future models from an operational perspective the proposed methodology presents some advantages that enable it to be upgraded into an early warning system for hydrological applications firstly it employed punctual rainfall information and does not use areal data that inevitably provides averaged results consequently it accounts local characteristic detected by rain gauges such as convective cells which feature high intensity and short durations moreover the model has 10 minutes temporal resolution which is comparable to convective cells lives then the model provided a probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation that allows the assessment of different scenarios indeed the predictions are not specific values but rain intervals with associated probabilities of occurrence finally the high update frequency 10 minutes is a fair trade off between the optimal 5 minutes and the sufficient 15 minutes consequently the predicted precipitation fields are available to the forecasters in real time for a quick assessment of the current weather situation in conclusion findings suggest that the model is suitable for real time early warning system especially for catchment with small area and short response time funding this work was supported by the inspiring prin project 2020 funded by the

the authors would also like to thank the referees for their thorough reviews and constructive comments appendix a pattern recognition techniques pattern recognition is the scientific discipline whose goal is the classification of objects into categories or classes depending on the application the objects can be images signals or any measurements that need to be classified the objects are usually referred to as patterns hence the name pattern recognition theodoridis and koutroumbas 2009 even though the specific pattern recognition technique varies depending on the structure of the problem the aim is always concerned with the development of algorithms and decision rules that classify patterns into different categories fogler 1974 according to mcarthur 1987 the typical approach to develop pattern recognition techniques is bottom up a set of processes is established in order to identify all features of interest in a dataset and aggregate them into patterns if the approach is based on rules it may lead to a proliferation of rules and of exceptions to the rules and so on since machine learning do not require any previous assumption they have become an indispensable tool in a wide range of pattern recognition applications in particular the feed forward neural networks are considered one of the most successful model in pattern recognition field bishop 2006 the implementation of a feed forward neural network for pattern recognition techniques requires examples of patterns thanks to which the network can learn and apply the leant rule to future unseen examples if the examples of patterns input vectors are provided along with their corresponding categories target the learning process is known as supervised learning the concept of supervised learning encompasses the use of the examples to develop a tool which can identify and extract regularities in input vectors to classify them into the corresponding target vectors according to found regularities once the learning process is completed the tool will classify new unseen data into different categories according to found regularities a model is considered well defined if it can make forecasts or predictions about unobserved data having been trained on observed data appendix b model structure feed forward neural networks pass the data forward from input to output as illustrated in fig a1 it consists of

2371,rainfall nowcasting supports emergency decision making in hydrological agricultural and economical sectors however short term prediction is challenging because meteorological variables are strongly interconnected and rapidly change during an event since machine learning do not require any previous physical assumption this study investigates their ability to provide reliable and quick forecasts this paper proposes a machine learning model for probabilistic rainfall nowcasting at 10 min intervals for short lead times from 30 min up to 6 h the model employs cumulative rainfall fields from station data as inputs for a feed forward neural network to predict rainfall interval and the corresponding probability of occurrence cumulative rainfall depths from station data were used to overcome the lack of temporal memory of the feed forward neural networks in this way using only the current rain field as input the model exploited pattern recognition techniques combining both temporal cumulative rainfall depth and spatial cumulative rainfall field information based on 359 rain events observed in an area of 1619 km2 in southern italy 95 machine learning models were independently trained for 19 recording stations and for each target lead time 30 60 120 180 and 360 min comprehensive nowcasts verification was performed to analyse the reliability of probabilistic nowcasts using both continuous rmse and rae and categorical pod far and csi indicators the performance of the models was also compared with the results of eulerian persistence all the models produced consistent nowcasts and learnt the complex relationship describing space time rainfall evolution as expected predictive accuracy gradually decreased as the lead time increase according to physically based models results showed that the use of both temporal and spatial information enables the model to predict short term rainfall using only the current measurements as input resulting in a rapid easily replicable and convenient nowcasting approach the procedure is an effective way to predict multi step rainfall fields and is suitable for operational early warning system keywords precipitation nowcasting multi step predictions rain gauge measurements pattern recognition feed forward neural networks cumulative rainfall fields data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction nowcasting models use real time data to predict rainfall with short lead times from few minutes up to six hours they influence many aspects of daily life especially during emergency which can affect human life and environmental issues indeed operational short term rainfall forecasting are essential for early warning systems to reduce fatalities and economic losses caused by flooding landslides and other rainfall induced hazards parmar and kinjal mistree 2017 ayzel et al 2020 barrera animas et al 2022 chen et al 2022 foresti et al 2016 hammad et al 2021 liu et al 2021 luo et al 2022 ravuri et al 2021 wmo 2017 to evaluate possible critical situations an effective nowcasting model requires a succession of nowcasts characterized by high update frequency and short computational time imhoff et al 2022 wmo 2017 prior investigations queried several approaches to meet nowcasting models requirements the prevailing are 1 model driven methods mdms which entail the identification of the relationships among variables involved 2 data driven methods ddms which comprise all the models that employ available data in order to identify patterns and classify new ones without making a priori assumptions de luca and capparelli 2022 mdms encompass numerical weather prediction nwp models which are appealing in water community because of their proven effectiveness and robustness through the years de luca and capparelli 2022 liu et al 2021 nwp models solve mathematical equations to simulate the dynamics and physics of the atmosphere producing reliable forecasts regardless of their exact applications nwp implementation is nontrivial due to the high dimensionality of the spatiotemporal relationship between meteorological variables they represent a valid rainfall forecasting tools for daily temporal scale and over spatial scale of the order of 1000 km de luca and capparelli 2022 however nwp models can capture mesoscale weather patterns such as fronts but not the smaller scale convective patterns that occur within mesoscale systems chao et al 2018 as a result convective heavy precipitation cells are difficult to predict with nwp models mainly because their lifetimes are often shorter than 30 min jasper tönnies et al 2018 thus a level of nowcast accuracy at the convective scale is challenging to reach with nwp simonin et al 2017 moreover adequate observations of meteorological variables are not regularly available within the area of interest which makes it difficult to define accurate initial and boundary conditions dolciné et al 1997 on the other hand ddms have also been widely used to unravel hydrological problems including rainfall forecasting hong 2008 ridwan et al 2021 valverde ramírez et al 2005 they can identify the relationships between input and output data without making a priori assumption about the physical processes they are willing when is not easy to recognise all the existing complex and typically non linear relationships of the dynamical process disadvantages of ddms include their black box nature proneness to over fitting and the empirical nature of model development bai et al 2021 liong and he 2010 among ddms machine learning ml techniques has propelled to the forefront in investigations of nowcasting methods prudden et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 chang et al 2014b illustrate the benefit of using a hybrid ml model based on self organizing map som and dynamic neural networks for forecasting inundation maps based solely on rainfall data and historical inundation depths chang and tsai 2016 propose an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis model for flood forecasting and demonstrate its capability in modelling the complex rainfall runoff process with a with a temporal resolution of 10 min and a spatial resolution of 1 25 km they reveal that the approach alleviates the timing error problem and improves the accuracy and reliability of the forecast a ml model to estimate 6 hour precipitation at a spatial resolution of 5 km based on himawari 8 and ground stations data over china was recently developed by zhou et al 2022 also liu et al 2022 show how a deep neural network model for hourly rainfall forecasting using radar echo images can predict over 40 of rainfall events and forecast well on small scale intense rainfall it is still unknown whether the ddms will gradually prevail over the mdms or vice versa and how the traditional models will further develop given the distinct philosophy used in those two groups of models kim et al 2021b in some recent studies researchers have used ml techniques to rainfall nowcasting and some studies have achieved better performances than traditional methods kim et al 2021a indeed the flexibility and conceptual simplicity of ml makes them attractive for nowcasting purposes asghari and nasseri 2015 despite recent advances in weather forecasting models based on ml techniques precipitation nowcasting is still a challenge for researchers and operational weather services kim et al 2021a lengfeld et al 2020 a further distinction within nowcasting models depends on the spatial scale and mostly on the data availability different input data may be used they include gridded data from radars satellites or rain gauges radar based models use a sequence of radar images to extrapolate the rainfall distribution at future time steps and produce rainfall forecasts in the short term and at fine temporal and spatial scales yang et al 2020 they assume that over the time frame of a few hours the evolution of precipitation can be captured by moving the radar echoes along a stationary motion field without changes in intensity pulkkinen et al 2019 even though radar based models can capture the initial precipitation state as the lead time increases the skill of the nowcasting models rapidly decreases mainly because growth and decay precipitation processes are not considered moreover weather radar measurements show non negligible and sometimes even large errors which propagate and increase with the lead time as a result radar based models have a predictability limit up to 30 min lead time and can be referred to as a qualitative semi quantitative measurement device shehu and haberlandt 2021 sokol et al 2021 thorndahl et al 2017 in contrast to qualitative radar data nowcasting models can also employ rain gauge one which are considered the reference devices for the measurement of the amount of precipitation at ground level duan et al 2021 moraux et al 2019 shehu and haberlandt 2021 rain gauges report precipitation rate and accumulation and provide information on instantaneous rainfall intensity and heavy rainfall over short periods the main drawback of rain gauges is their lack of spatial representatively being point measurements yang et al 2020 indeed if a storm occurs between the rain gauges they can miss the peak rainfall intensity which will automatically lead to an underestimation of the forecast however if a particularly dense network of rain gauges is available it is possible to use it for detection and nowcasting purposes wmo 2017 since accurate predictions influence the quality of the nowcasting and thus the efficiency of security measures and related impacts imhoff et al 2020 this study employs quantitative measurements registered by rain gauge ones moreover valid rainfall estimates govern real time early warning system and weather radar real time adjustment is challenging at the beginning of rainfall events with no prior rain gauge data recordings however if the performance of the radar compared to the gauge data is valid radar data could be suitable too to provide a cost effective and rapid nowcasting model this study investigates the enhancement that can be reached in rainfall nowcasting exploiting ml methods and using rain gauge measurements as inputs the study proposes a probabilistic machine learning approach for rainfall nowcasting at 10 min intervals for short lead times from 30 min to 6 h the model is based on 19 recording station and their cumulative rainfall depths classified in 20 classes which serve as an input for a feed forward neural network model feed forward neural networks have recently achieved outstanding predictive performance and have become an indispensable tool in a wide range of pattern recognition applications bai et al 2021 bishop 2006 stated that the most successful model in the context of pattern recognition are the feed forward neural networks however feed forward neural networks do not have a temporary memory thus they can not be trained to learn sequential or time varying patterns chang et al 2014a to overcome this drawback this study employs cumulative rainfall depths which are non decreasing variables unlike rainfall depths which can vary during an event cumulative rainfall depth cannot decrease likewise the model employs rainfall depths measured in adjacent gauges which also provide valuable spatial information as a result temporal memory is achieved through both cumulative rainfall depth and cumulative rainfall depth from adjiancet gauges in this way the model predicts short term punctual rainfall using only the current measurement as input indeed pattern recognition techniques aim exactly at the automatic detection of regularities in data in order to classifying them into different categories according to found regularities see appendix a pattern recognition techniques for further details in this way the model results in a rapid easily repicable and convenient nowcasting approach moreover since precipitation nowcasts issued by ml systems are often subject to uncertainties the proposed model associates to them a probability of occurrence indeed it is crucial to provide together with a nowcast an estimation of its uncertainty foresti et al 2016 since there are many forms of uncertainty in modelling any sensible model will be uncertain when predicting unobserved data at the lowest level model uncertainty is introduced from measurement noise at higher levels a model may have many parameters and there is uncertainty about which values of these parameters will be good at predicting new data the probabilistic approach to modelling uses probability theory to express forms of uncertainty in this study the probabilistic prediction is achieved employing the softmax function in the ml model which is used to solve nonlinear multiple classification problems huang and xiang 2018 the softmax function turns a real values vector into a vector of real values between 0 and 1 that sum 1 so that they can be interpreted as probabilities therefore the model supplies the most likely forecast as long with the associate probability since probabilistic predictions provides greater economic and decision making value than deterministic ones ravuri et al 2021 this approach enhances model operational utility and reliability to conclude the flexibility and conceptual simplicity of the proposed approach makes it a promising tool for nowcasting purposes 2 study area and dataset the campania region southern italy which has an area of 13 600 km2 and a population of about 5 8 million of peoples is currently divided into 8 meteorological warning zones according to homogeneity criteria which consider the following factors hydrography morphology rainfall geology land use hydraulic and hydrogeological events administrative boundaries piciullo et al 2016 the study area is zone 1 of the campania region fig 1 it covers 1619 km2 and includes 109 municipalities and 19 rain gauges fig 1 the area has a complex system of highlands and two main volcanic structures vesuvius and the phlegrean fields these two orographic features constitute an important factor in the mesoscale meteorology of the region enhancing convection systems development especially in summer season the study area is in the proximity of the mediterranean sea and thus the dominant climate is the mediterranean characterized by long dry summer periods and rainy winters with mild temperatures in particular the winter period is dominated by stratiform rainfall events which can last up to a few days in summer there are stratiform events convective events and combinations of these furthermore in cold season the region is sometimes affected by polar maritime air masses coming from the north atlantic which can lead to the development of thunderstorm cells over the sea surface and the coastal sectors on the other hand in the warm season the thunderstorm events are mainly triggered by the interaction between small scale mechanism and synoptic scale flow capozzi et al 2018 for every rain gauge station over the study area table 1 the campania region department of civil protection dpc provided rainfall measurements every 10 min with 0 2 mm resolution in events determination all intervals with only 0 2 mm in 10 min were ignored because these are often artefacts of condensation at the end of events which increase the duration of events with minimal increase in rainfall depth gaál et al 2014 2 1 rainfall events rain events are a convenient way of summarizing rainfall time series into entities that are meaningful in terms of a particular application haile et al 2011 therefore it is important to define a rain event and the time duration considered to distinguish it since this study aims at predicting punctual rainfall with short lead times to later upgrade the model into an operative early warning system the definition of spatial events was revised it is common to define punctual rainfall events by the minimum inter arrival time index hereafter referred as mit with regards to a single station a storm is as a period of rainfall with preceding and succeeding dry periods more than mit heneker et al 2001 many application based criteria for identifying rainfall events using a fixed mit exist in literature with values ranging from 3 min to 24 h since the model employs precipitation fields the mit criteria was adapted for them thus with regards to meteorological stations over an area a rainfall event is defined as a period of rainfall with preceding and succeeding dry periods more than mit for the whole number of stations existing in the area according to climate characteristics precipitation events were identified separately for the warm april september and cold october march season a mit of 2 h was chosen for warm season and of 1 h for cold one fig 2 depicts two so defined rainfall event almost 32 events per years for a total of 359 rainfall events occurred in the study area from 2009 to 2019 and were registered by the 19 rain gauge stations fig 3 for each month the main statistics of the selected

depth registered by the i th station during k th rain event most of the events were contemporary registered by all the stations which is typical to stratiform events however during some events more than one convective cell was observed in particular during the winter period rain events have smaller rain depths and can last up to few days which is typical to stratiform events while in summer rain events occur predominantly in the form of more localized rain showers with shorter durations and higher rain depths according to convective event type formation 3 methodology the machine learning model the ml model employs cumulative rainfall depth from recording stations over the study area as inputs to predict rainfall interval and the corresponding probability of occurrence in one of the stations after dt lead time in particular for each of the 19 stations and for each of the 5 lead times 30 60 120 180 and 360 min a model was independently developed and trained from the others for a total of 95 models fig 5 shows nowcasts workflow with regards to one station and one lead time let t0 be the time when a rain event starts the first step is reading the cumulative rainfall depths observation of the stations over the study area 5 h t 0 h 1 h 2 h n where n is the number of the stations according to contingency table 2 the observations h t 0 are discretized into rain intervals or rain classes x t 0 as better explained in section 3 1 input variable pre processing to form the input pattern after the discretization the difference between two values within the same interval is neglected 6 x t 0 x 1 x 2 x n where n is the number of the stations the input pattern at t0 x t 0 pass through the nowcasting model section 3 2 to predict the probabilities of occurrence p y t 0 d t for every rain interval y t 0 d t at t0 dt with dt being equal to the lead time section 3 3 7 p y t 0 d t p y 1 p y 2 p y n where y i is the rain interval n is the number of rain intervals and p y i the probability of occurrence of y i the probability of occurrence p y i is calculated through the softmax function more details about models set up are given in appendix b model structure which ensures that the sum of the p y i is equal to one 8 i 1 n p y i 1 finally the model selects the rain class y t with the highest probability 9 y t p y t max p y 1 p y 2 p y n where n is the number of rain classes at time t1 new registrations are available h t 1 which are added up to the previous registrations h 0 and discretised in x t 1 according to corresponding rain class then x t 1 are employed by the model to provide new nowcasts thus the associated probability of occurrence p y t 1 d t the update frequency is 10 min thus t0 t1 10 min each model has its own parameters but the input pattern is the same for each of them which means that the input at time t0 vector xt0 is passed through each model but each model predicts different outputs a numerical example of the input output pattern is given below assuming that the vector ht is ht 0 2 1 0 3 2 0 2 4 2 4 6 5 8 1 2 1 2 0 2 0 4 1 4 1 6 2 4 1 2 0 2 0 4 0 2 0 4 it will be discretised into the corresponding vector xt xt 1 1 2 1

highest probability for the station number 4 is associated to the class third 89 i e the most probable rain interval is between 5 and 10 mm according to contingency table 2 3 1 input variables pre processing according to moon et al 2019 we discretized continuous data h t into intervals x t thus after the discretization the difference between two values within the same interval is neglected table 2 is the contingency table for the discretized intervals of precipitation hereafter referred as rain classes or classes 20 classes with different width ranging from 2 mm to 25 mm were defined the upper limit of the highest class is 200 mm which depends on the employed data set thus on the rainfall events according to mit criteria for rainfall events determination section 2 1 the maximum total rainfall volume observed during the 359 events was almost of 194 mm fig 4 as a result when an observed value is higher than 200 mm the rainfall event is considered finished our discretization is narrower than the ones done by moon et al 2019 suyatno et al 2018 resulting in a higher number of intervals and accuracy it is worth highlighting that the 20 classes have different percentage of examples resulting in an asymmetrical distribution with higher frequency for the firsts classes to achieve a uniform distribution interval should have been narrower for lower classes and wider for higher ones however on one hand a further discrimination among firsts classes would have led to interval of less than 1 mm width resulting in a useless precision for operational nowcasting on the other hand higher classes would have been joint into a wider one leaking valuable information therefore rather than a uniform classes distribution this study prefers intervals with variable width 3 2 model set up and training strategy once pre processed the input data x t are passed through each of the feed forward neural network models a neural network is defined by its structure including the number of hidden layers the number of nodes in each hidden layer how the layers are linked which activation function is used and the weights for each station and for each lead time a feed forward neural network was independently developed and trained from the others more details about models set up are given in appendix b model structure the training problem consists of finding the optimal combination of weights of the ml model the most common training strategy is the backpropagation which adjusts the weights of connections between neurons in hidden and output layers to reduce the error in the output however when the dataset consists of experimental points normally there is some noise in the data therefore reproducing the dataset exactly as it is not the best strategy because the noise will be reproduced too moreover one of the main drawbacks of ml models is overfitting which happens when the model is performing well on the dataset but performs poorly on new unseen data to avoid those problems early stop technique is applied while training the models the dataset and thus the rainfall events were split into three groups the period 2009 2014 was used for training 60 the period 2015 2016 for validation 10 while 2017 2019 for testing 30 the training set was used to train the model by tuning its parameters with the back propagation algorithm validation set asserted generalizing ability and avoid overfitting which happens when the model is performing well on the data used during training but performs poorly on new unseen data nguyen and bae 2020 as shown in fig 6 the network stops training when the error over the validation set red line increase while the error over training set blue line is still decreasing in this way the network avoids over fitting evaluating the performance on the validation set is done to determine and optimize different network architectures and training strategies selecting the model and training method performing the best on the validation set introduce the risk of overfitting this dataset finally testing set is needed for final model evaluation we trained all the models by minimizing the cross entropy loss 10 which is most commonly used for classification zhang and sabuncu 2018 10 los s j o j ln p j 1 o j ln 1 p j where pj is the corresponding predicted value to oj observed value at epoch j an epoch refers to one cycle through the dataset is passed forward and backward the neural network 3 3 output variables post processing probabilistic approach once trained each ml model predicts an output vector of probability of occurrence p y t d t associated to the vector of rain classes y t d t the probabilistic output from ml models is achieved employing softmax function in the output layer appendix b the softmax is useful because provides a normalized probability distribution conditioned on the input huang and xiang 2018 the input values can be positive negative zero or greater than one but the softmax transforms them into values between 0 and 1 many multi layer neural networks end in a penultimate layer which outputs real valued scores that are not conveniently scaled and which may be difficult to work with the probability of occurrence enhances ml model operational utility and reliability from operational perspective it is crucial to provide together with the nowcast an estimation of its uncertainty hence probabilistic predictions provide greater economic and decision making value than deterministic ones 3 4 performance criteria for the testing dataset the nowcasts are verified against the observed values using both continuous and categorical scores the continuous scores include the root mean square error rmse and root square error rse since the model predicts a rain class thus an interval the continuous metrics are evaluated with regards to the mean values of the classes 11 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n mm 12 rse i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n μ o o i 2 where pi and oi are the predicted and observed rainfall classes n is the number of observations μ is the mean of observations μo the categorical scores include three indicators commonly used in the meteorological community probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi they are skill scores similar to precision and recall commonly used by machine learning researchers kim et al 2017 the values of the scoring indicators range from 0 to 1 the lower far the better and the higher the value of csi and pod the better 13 pod hits hits misses 14 far false alarm false alarm hits 15 csi hits hits false alarm misses where hit indicates that observed rainfall class is correctly predicted false alarm indicates that predicted rainfall class is greater than the observed one miss indicates that predicted rainfall interval is lower than the observed one table 3 according to how categorical indicators were defined a threshold was not needed indeed the model nowcasts a rainfall class thus a categorical value all the performance criteria are calculated per each station by pooling together the information from all the events moreover confusion matrix is used to find the level of accuracy of the multiclass classification model it shows the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm especially in the supervised learning method suyatno et al 2018 the confusion matrix consists of columns that represent predicted data classes and rows that represent the original data class finally the verification results are compared with those from eulerian persistence ep which assumes that for any lead time t dt the nowcasts are the observation at time t 4 result and discussion the first section 4 1 presents models performances with regards to all the events from the testing set while section 4 2 focus separately on some rainfall events 4 1 nowcast performance and skill evaluation of the 95 models for the testing set years 2017 2018 and 2019 the rmse and rse for all the 95 ml models were computed fig 7 rmse mean values increase from 1 67 mm to 6 15 mm while rse values range between 0 158 and 0 186 from 30 minutes to 6 hours lead time models respectively table 3 the interquartile range iqr of the boxplots is narrow for 30 min lead times but becomes wider for 6 h lead times this suggests that the models perform similarly for all rain gauges at short lead times but differently for higher lead times the rmse and rse of the ep nowcast are significantly higher than the one obtained by the proposed models the difference is accentuated for increasing lead times and highlights the ability of the proposed models to provide better estimation than the simple ep model as expected 30 minutes lead time models produce the best performance while 6 hours ones perform the worst these trends are broadly consistent with physical behaviour thus it is widely recognised that as the nowcast lead time increases the correlation between desired output and available input decreases lin et al 2009 and rainfall nowcasts deteriorate heuvelink et al 2020 model accuracy analysis reveals the same trends mentioned above pod and csi decrease from 0 5 h to 6 h lead time model while far increase fig 8 the 30 minutes lead times models achieve the highest csi 90 94 and pod 91 64 and lowest far 0 82 giving better performance table 4 notwithstanding the decreasing trend pod and csi are all higher than 74 45 and 67 48 and far lower than 12 25 which means they all are on average close their ideal values 100 100 and 0 respectively confirming the goodness of fit of the models in particular low values of far are desirable for early warning systems since they cause financial losses and may result in people losing their confidence in weather services and civil protection authorities liu et al 2021 the proposed models outperformed the benchmark ep for all the lead time and performance criteria fig 8 indeed the ep approach is suitable for precipitation fields with negligible advection but can lead to large errors in predicting intensity of moving rainfall patterns moreover the models show an underestimation of the observations as better depicted in confusion matrixes fig 9 the dispersion of the values from the main diagonal provides accurate insights about the error made by the models even though the dispersion from the correctly predicted class diagonal cells is slightly appreciable for 30 min lead times model it considerably increases for the higher lead times models also heuvelink et al 2020 found that the rainfall forecasting skill was found to decrease with increasing lead time often associated with an underestimation of the nowcasted rainfall this was probably related to the fact that the nowcasting schemes do not explicitly take the possible growth of rain cells into account in the proposed models the observed tendency to underestimate is mainly due to one reason first the output variables were discretized into intervals which have different number of examples almost 60 of the time steps table 2 fall in the first three classes 1 2 3 consequently the models have more low classes examples and are willing to predict them rather than higher classes to have equally size interval boundary intervals might have been set differently however this would have given too wide intervals and would have been useless for nowcasting purpose thus confusion matrixes highlighted that the model is influenced by the discretization of the rainfall into classes the result of the proposed model could be compared with the ones obtained by shehu 2021 who investigated how to extend the predictability limit of rainfall at fine scale 5 min and 1 km2 by improving the radar rainfall field fed into the nowcast models with regards to a lead time up to 3 h shehu 2021 illustrated that the temporal rmse between nowcasted time series and real input field varies up to 0 5 mm 5min 6 mm h on the other hand the rmse obtained with our model ranges between 3 64 and 5 53 mm 10 min i e 21 84 and 33 18 mm h fig 7 according to the results shehu s model provided better result than ours an explanation why the rmse of our models were higher lies in the way they were calculated indeed the rmse considered the mean of the rainfall classes therefore even though a hit is registered in terms of categorical criteria the observed intensities can still deviate from the rainfall class mean however even though this comparison may not be entirely reliable since the spatial resolution of our model is coarser than shehu 2021 our model is competitive for several reasons first we employed rain gauge data which are the reference devices for hydrological application thus the nowcasts were not affected by the error of conversion from radar measurement which allowed our model to obtain reliable prediction in real time without further processing of the data furthermore weather radar real time adjustment is particularly difficult at the beginning of rainfall events with no prior rain gauge data recordings while shehu 2021 used radar data which certainly offered almost a full spatial coverage but inevitably displays a discrepancy with the gauge that will propagate and increase with the lead time as a result shehu 2021 identified a predictability limit of the model which was up to 3 h lead time moreover not only our models provided a nowcast but also the corresponding probability of occurrence this is probably the main strength of the model since it allows an estimation of the uncertainty of the nowcast which is crucial for early warning purpose another advantage could be attributed to the easy replicability and cost effective times to run indeed once the models are trained the nowcasts are provided in real time i e the computational time is of the order of the millisecond our models seem promising but further correction needs to be performed in order to account for the lack of spatial representatively since the models make punctual prediction if a storm occurs between the rain gauges they can miss the peak rainfall intensity and automatically lead to an underestimation of the forecast indeed depending to the specific velocity or advection when at some stations a storm is captured the others will capture it with a time shift however since our models do not consider the time shift the performance criteria penalised the results if criteria with a specific threshold were implemented and time independent then the performance would have been different according to overall result it is evident that there is a consistent physical behaviour which is not obvious when dealing with machine learning techniques liu et al 2022 as already stated one of the main drawbacks of artificial intelligence algorithms is their tendency to produce results that cannot be rationally explained as a result users are unwilling to use them in addition it can be said that the training strategy was successful not only the model allows evaluation of rainfall information but also the estimation of the transition from non rain to rain conditions and prediction of short rainfall patterns which are not easy to evaluate in advance these features allow good quality in rainfall nowcasting ensuring an effective warning issue 4 2 event based performance on testing set to highlight the ability of the model to predict different types of events the performances of the proposed nowcasting models are shown and compared for two of them that differ in terms of 1 duration 2 average total rain depth among the stations 3 maximum total rain depth 4 maximum 10 min rain depth and 5 average 10 min rain depth table 5 the characteristics of the rain depth registered during event n 311 were similar to convective cells characterized by high intensities and short durations even though the event lasted almost 19 h the measurements were intermittent and lasted around one hour fig 10 on the other hand event n 357 was related to the mechanism that generate a stratiform rainfall characterized by greater areas of influences higher durations and lower rainfall intensities as compared to the convective precipitation fig 10 4 2 1 event on 1 october 2018 the event of 1st october 2018 occurred with two earlier rain bursts followed by almost 7 h of continuous rain period discontinuously measured by the stations over the study area fig 10 left an average of 26 16 mm fell in 19 h with the highest total depth value of 59 60 mm registered by station number 6 while station number 3 detected the highest peak at 12 50 cet central european time of 16 40 mm fig 10 the peak value lasted less than 1 h and was particularly high the maximum annual value registered by the station to emphasize the ability of the models to detect local peaks results are presented in terms of the mean values of the rain depth between observed and predicted rain classes fig 11 among the 5 models 30 min lead time one performed the greatest result it achieved a rmse of 1 92 mm and a rse of 2 79 in contrast 6 hours lead time model nowcasts deviated from the observed data resulting in a rmse of 11 50 mm and a rse of 16 71 similarly pod decreased from 100 to 13 csi from 96 to 9 and the far increased from 4 to 75 table 6 the decline of the performance criteria within the 5 models was partly due to the sharp evolution of the rainfall registered by station 3 indeed the peak value occurred quickly after a period of no rain burst which is besides typical of convective cells capozzi et al 2018 as a result the 6 hours models had not enough stored information about the prior time step thus the cumulative rain depths registered by station 3 were zero even though the proposed models failed to nowcast the real values at the correct time for higher lead times they provided notable nowcasts for a lead time up to 1 h which are valuable for dispatching decision making pod csi and far suggest that the models could support early warning systems to increase preparedness until more data becomes available we believe that these results were possible thanks to the joint use of cumulative rain depth from nearby stations even though station 3 started recording no zero value of rain depths only around 12 00 cet the models already provided nowcasts because the rain event already started over the study area according to rain event identification section 2 1 this performance is also consistent with the result obtained by ghaemi et al 2021 who evaluated the nowcasting product of 2 km resolution gridded data from 2007 to 2018 they observed that during four extreme convective short duration events there was a time shift in peak intensity detection as happened in our models fig 11 it is worth highlighting that without the further information from the nearby stations the nowcast of such isolated peak would have been trivial the introduction of cumulative rain depths from nearby stations as inputs to the model allowed to capture spatiotemporal features in this way the models learnt the rainfall process without storing antecedent time steps but according to the spatial characteristics 4 2 2 event on 19 december 2019 the event on 19th december 2019 was homogenously registered by all stations over the study area an average of 50 57 mm fell in 22 h with the highest values detected during the ten central hours from 11 00 to 21 00 fig 10 results are shown for meteorological station number 5 that registered the highest cumulative rain depth value of 122 00 mm almost gradually increasing during the event fig 12 to highlight the ability of the model to predict the increasing rain depth during the event results are presented in terms of cumulative rain depth between observed and predicted rain classes all the models recognised the increasing rainfall pattern registered by station n 5 however for higher lead times models the nowcasts were greater than the observed values resulting in an overestimation once again as the lead time increased the performance of the models decreased the 30 min lead time model showed a rmse of 0 35 mm which increased to 4 50 mm for the 6 h lead time one table 7 while rse increased from 3 to 36 also meteorological indicators trends are consistent with previous results pod far and csi changed from 98 3 and 95 to 69 29 and 53 respectively comparing the evaluation metric between the events on the 1st october 2018 and on the 19th of december 2019 we found that the 2nd was better predicted than the 1st we believe that these results were possible thank to gradual light rain evolution not only the stratiform events display higher correlation than the simple convective ones thus a higher predictability should be expected from these storms but they also have many more timesteps to choose from in the training phase as a result the models are favouring the stratiform ones moreover results obtained are compatible with imhoff et al 2020 who showed that longer rain events durations consisting of larger more persistent systems have a higher predictability than the shortest durations that generally consist of short lifetime high intensity convective precipitation events they demonstrated that the average mean absolute error mae of the nowcasting model for stratiform rainfall becomes 3 times lower than the ones achieved during more convective rainfall with higher intensities ayzel et al 2020 proposed a neural network for radar based precipitation nowcasting to predict continuous precipitation intensities at a lead time of five minutes they found that the models had a limited ability to predict high rainfall intensities probably due to a remarkable level of spatial smoothing in its predictions moreover that smoothing becomes increasingly apparent at longer lead times as suggested by their results the nowcast performance is quite sensitive to type of the event and thus the results shown here do not contradict the fact that stratiform type events may perform better than the convective type to conclude the comparison between the analysed events the models provided better precipitation nowcasts when the extension of the event is homogeneous but failed to successfully catch local precipitation events sufficiently in advance thus as expected for convective rain events where the rain evolves rapidly the potential lead time is short dolciné et al 1998 5 conclusions this study investigated rainfall nowcasting performance exploiting machine learning techniques using cumulative precipitation fields from rain gauge stations 95 feed forward neural networks were independently trained and tested on 359 rainfall events that occurred over the study area one of the eight warning zones of the campania region in southern italy the model employed cumulative rainfall depths of the recording stations classified in 20 classes as an input for the feed forward neural network which nowcasted probable rain interval after 30 60 120 180 and 360 min the idea of using cumulative rain depth from nearby stations was due to lack of temporal memory of feed forward neural network this allowed to store antecedent time steps and to use only the current rain field as input resulting in a rapid and easy replicable method on the other hand the probabilistic nowcast was achieved by employing the softmax function in the machine learning model which is widely used to solve nonlinear multiple classification problems therefore the model supplied the most likely nowcast as long with the associate probability to provide a valid training strategy avoiding overfitting while preserving generalization abilities the dataset was split into two parts years 2009 to 2016 were used to train the models while 2017 to 2019 to test the performance of each model was evaluated and compared using different metrics both continuous rmse and rse and categorical pod csi and far in addition the eulerian persistence ep was considered as a benchmark model generally the models with a lead time up to 2 h produced consistent nowcasts and learnt the complex relationship describing space time rainfall evolution as expected predictive accuracy gradually decreased as the lead time increase according to physically based models notwithstanding the decreasing trend the performance indicators were all close their optimal range confirming the goodness of fit of the models the rmse mean values increased from 1 67 mm to 6 15 mm while rse ranged between 1 58 and 18 64 from 30 minutes to 6 hours lead time models respectively model accuracy analysis revealed similar trends pod and csi decreased from 0 5 h to 6 h lead time model while far increased the 30 minutes lead times models achieved the highest csi 90 94 and pod 91 64 and lowest far 0 82 giving better performance the proposed models outperformed the benchmark ep for all the lead times and performance criteria results showed that it was possible to make a nowcast better than the ep by considering the cumulative rainfall depth from adjacent stations thus the use of both temporal and spatial information for precipitation nowcasting allowed an extension of the lead time up to which a reliable forecast may be issued providing a quick prediction based on actual values solely to the authors knowledge this study is the first to present a comparative analysis of the performance of rainfall nowcasting models based on rain gauge information and on modern machine learning algorithms in predicting probable rainfall interval with 10 minutes update frequency moreover the ability of the model to predict different types of events was investigated the performances of the proposed nowcasting models were compared for two events of the testing set whose characteristics were similar to convective events characterized by high intensities and short durations and stratiform ones characterized by greater areas of influences higher durations and lower rainfall intensities respectively according to the results the models provided better nowcasts when the extension of the event is homogeneous but failed to successfully catch local precipitation events sufficiently in advance thus as expected for convective rain events where the rain evolves rapidly the potential lead time is short even though the models detected the increasing rainfall pattern registered for higher lead times models the nowcasts were greater than the observed values resulting in an overestimation to contrast the stratiform event was better predicted than the convective one we believe that these results were possible thank to gradual light rain evolution consisting of larger more persistent systems for future work a study regarding how the location of the station influences the model performances will be carried out one idea is to group the results according to the relative distance between the stations or according to the area of influences of each station which could be the thiessen polygon area moreover the results would also be grouped according to the type of the event convective stratiform or mixed as well as the duration of the event this would be an interesting comparison which may help future research to identify certain patterns that need to be incorporated into future models from an operational perspective the proposed methodology presents some advantages that enable it to be upgraded into an early warning system for hydrological applications firstly it employed punctual rainfall information and does not use areal data that inevitably provides averaged results consequently it accounts local characteristic detected by rain gauges such as convective cells which feature high intensity and short durations moreover the model has 10 minutes temporal resolution which is comparable to convective cells lives then the model provided a probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation that allows the assessment of different scenarios indeed the predictions are not specific values but rain intervals with associated probabilities of occurrence finally the high update frequency 10 minutes is a fair trade off between the optimal 5 minutes and the sufficient 15 minutes consequently the predicted precipitation fields are available to the forecasters in real time for a quick assessment of the current weather situation in conclusion findings suggest that the model is suitable for real time early warning system especially for catchment with small area and short response time funding this work was supported by the inspiring prin project 2020 funded by the

the authors would also like to thank the referees for their thorough reviews and constructive comments appendix a pattern recognition techniques pattern recognition is the scientific discipline whose goal is the classification of objects into categories or classes depending on the application the objects can be images signals or any measurements that need to be classified the objects are usually referred to as patterns hence the name pattern recognition theodoridis and koutroumbas 2009 even though the specific pattern recognition technique varies depending on the structure of the problem the aim is always concerned with the development of algorithms and decision rules that classify patterns into different categories fogler 1974 according to mcarthur 1987 the typical approach to develop pattern recognition techniques is bottom up a set of processes is established in order to identify all features of interest in a dataset and aggregate them into patterns if the approach is based on rules it may lead to a proliferation of rules and of exceptions to the rules and so on since machine learning do not require any previous assumption they have become an indispensable tool in a wide range of pattern recognition applications in particular the feed forward neural networks are considered one of the most successful model in pattern recognition field bishop 2006 the implementation of a feed forward neural network for pattern recognition techniques requires examples of patterns thanks to which the network can learn and apply the leant rule to future unseen examples if the examples of patterns input vectors are provided along with their corresponding categories target the learning process is known as supervised learning the concept of supervised learning encompasses the use of the examples to develop a tool which can identify and extract regularities in input vectors to classify them into the corresponding target vectors according to found regularities once the learning process is completed the tool will classify new unseen data into different categories according to found regularities a model is considered well defined if it can make forecasts or predictions about unobserved data having been trained on observed data appendix b model structure feed forward neural networks pass the data forward from input to output as illustrated in fig a1 it consists of interconnected layers with nodes and weights where the flow of information is in the forward direction only likewise there is no backward flow hence name feed forward network is justified the n number of input data are assigned to the nodes in the input layer xi i 1 2 n and are propagated through the interconnected nodes in the hidden layer with weight parameters and biases each j hidden node j 1 2 p receives the weighted sum of the input nodes adds the bias and transfers to the output layer through an activation function it can be described in 1 z j f z i 1 n x i w ij c j f z u j where zj is the j th node in the hidden layer j 1 2 p wji is the weight parameter between hidden and input node cj is the bias uj is the symbol for term in brackets and fz is the activation function which is the hyperbolic tangent function 2 f z u j 2 1 e 2 u j 1 similarly this process is also performed between hidden and output layer 3 p y k f y j 1 p z i w kj b k f y s k where yk is the output variable k 1

graphical abstract longitudinal patterns of dissolved organic matter dom influence the biogeochemical cycle in river ecosystems yet linkages between dom quality and bacterial degradation of emerging contaminants over a river continuum are unclear in combination with dom characterization bioassay and microbial analysis this study unraveled the spatial variations of dom composition and biodegradability as well as bacterial community structures which determined the estrone biodegradation potential ebp along the mainstream in three gorges reservoir during impoundment period while urban and agricultural utilization increased the protein like and biodegradable dom components bdoc in upstream the in situ biotransformation preferentially utilized tryptophan like substances followed by tyrosine like substances resulting in the accumulated recalcitrant dom with higher aromaticity molecular weight and humic like components in downstream due to the promotion of biodegradable dom on bacterial abundances a significant and positive correlation was constructed between bdoc and ebp p 0 001 r 2 0 56 both of which were controlled by the ratio of fresh to humic like fluorescence nevertheless a higher biomass normalized ebp was found under recalcitrant conditions in downstream demonstrating that the degradation function was also associated with the biogeographical distribution of bacterial communities results of microbial ecology revealed that the in situ transformation of aromatic and humic like dom exhibited more correlations with bacterial taxa than protein like dom leading to increased diversity and decreased niche breadths along the mainstream the triggered deterministic selection of community assemblages in downstream favored potential estrone degraders and up regulated their specific metabolic capacity these findings will provide critical insights toward understanding the crucial role of dom in biogeochemical cycles and the self purification of emerging contaminants along the river continuum keywords river continuum biodegradation optical properties bacterial community dissolved organic matter data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction upstream downstream gradients include the consistent patterns of loading transport and utilization of organic matter as well as the turnover of functional groups within bacterial communities along the length of a river vannote et al 1980 wang et al 2021 dissolved organic matter dom the primary energy source for heterotrophic bacteria is a significant factor shaping bacterial abundances and communities in water environments kamjunke et al 2019 muscarella et al 2019 the associations with dom composition also contribute to material circulation and energy flow affecting the functional variables of aquatic ecosystems for example the adaption and degradation capacity of bacterial communities for emerging contaminants was previously enhanced by proteinaceous organics in freshwater lakes bai et al 2020 dom was also reported as a vital proxy for assessing emerging contaminant fate in rivers tang et al 2019 estrone e1 a representative emerging contaminant occurring in global river systems chafi et al 2022 nazifa et al 2020 sta ana and espino 2020 exhibits adverse impacts on hormonal control sexual differentiation and reproductive success of aquatic organisms colborn et al 1993 considering bacterial degradation is the prominent mechanism for the self purification process of e1 in water environments yu et al 2013 it is appropriate to target e1 as the model compound for demonstrating linkages between bacterial degradation function of emerging contaminant and longitudinal patterns of dom quality through a river continuum in river ecosystems dom is composed of aromatic and aliphatic moieties with various molecular structures and functionalities influenced by allochthonous sources e g plant litter and soil organic matter autochthonous sources e g bacteria and phytoplankton and anthropogenic activities e g effluent organic matter and manure he et al 2021 while autochthonous dom enriched in proteins and polysaccharides is generally biodegradable the terrestrial dom composed of more humic substances and structural polysaccharides exhibits lower biodegradabilities hansen et al 2016 during fluvial transport various in situ biogeochemical processes such as sorption photodegradation and biotransformation ultimately alter dom composition and reactivity maisonneuve et al 2022 it was reported that in situ biodegradation on average 95 selectively removed the biodegradable dom with higher molecular diversity resulting in increased recalcitrant pools such as humic acids and lignins maisonneuve et al 2022 sipler et al 2017 however the relationship between regular variations of dom and bacterial community is complicated and bidirectional along the river continuum on the one hand bacterial communities are critical biogeochemical reagents for dom production conversion and mineralization logue et al 2016 on the other hand changes in dom quantity and quality induce diverse responses of bacterial taxa with distinct abundance patterns as reflected by growth respiration and enzymatic degradation kamjunke et al 2019 community members constantly interact with each other rather than live in isolation thereby contributing to the nonrandom co occurrence patterns and modular structures of bacterial communities within decomposing dom muscarella et al 2019 so far many studies have demonstrated that the heterogeneous dom structures which encompass the abundance and biodegradability of carbon and other resources were a potent force influencing bacterial clades in different water areas traving et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 however the bacterial community structure and interspecific interactions in response to longitudinal patterns of dom are largely ignored over a river continuum in depth characterization of dom complex composition is the foundation of linking its occurrence with impacts on bacterial communities due to the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of dom components absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy have been increasingly used to track the source migration and transformation of dom wang et al 2019 optical parameters and indices including the absolute absorbance or fluorescence intensity at specific wavelengths and ratios of different wavelengths can support high resolution fingerprints of dom molecules hansen et al 2016 meanwhile changes in dom optical signals can be resolved to indicate concurrent effects on bacterial community assemblages and degradation functions for instance correlation based network analysis revealed that interactions between fluorescent dom and bacterial taxa controlled community aggregations zhang et al 2020 three gorges reservoir tgr the largest water reservoir in terms of installed electric generating capacity on earth covers the district from chongqing to the three gorge dam with a mainstream of over 670 km and an area of 1 084 km2 since 2010 the water level of tgr has fluctuated periodically between 145 and 175 m each year due to the periodic water impoundment the impoundment period or the wet period of tgr occurs in the autumn winter season and manifests as a water level increase which not only decreases flow velocity but also causes water quality deterioration in downstream xiang et al 2021 previous studies have pointed out bacterial degradation played a more crucial role than photochemical degradation and particulate removal in affecting dom quality during impoundment periods jiang et al 2018 however the contaminant biodegradation following the longitudinal gradient of dom quality and bacterial community has thus far remained unclear in this study the mainstream in the tgr was used as a model to ascertain the longitudinal patterns of dom concentration composition and biodegradability as well as bacterial abundance and community composition the spatial variation of in situ e1 biodegradation potential ebp was further assessed to test the hypothesis that e1 biodegradation would decrease with the decline in dom biodegradability and bacterial abundance over the river continuum the results of this study will contribute to understanding dom biogeochemical cycles and supply the fundamental data for the environmental protection agencies to establish effective regulations to alleviate the emerging contamination in river ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 research sites and sampling the cruise activity was launched in november 2019 when the impoundment of tgr raised the water level to 174 m the average discharge during the cruise was 8350 m3 s the annual precipitation 1035 1 mm average temperature 17 5 c annual discharge 4 02 1011 m3 and annual runoff depth 534 2 mm in 2019 were close to the long term average in tgr table s1 a total of 12 sampling sites cj1 cj12 were selected along the mainstream from the center to the rural area of chongqing and ended before the three gorges dam fig 1 according to their locations sampling sites were further separated into two groups upstream cj1 cj6 and downstream cj7 cj12 table s2 in supporting information si provides the basic information of sampling sites at each site triplicate surface water

part of the filtered sample was added into acid cleaned brown glass bottles to conduct the bioassay of emerging contaminant biodegradation potential another part was subsequently filtrated through 0 22 µm membranes and the filtrates and membranes were stored at 20 c before the dom characterization and microbial analysis 2 2 bioassay of emerging contaminant biodegradation potential for the assessment of in situ ebp water samples were filtered by 1 6 μm because bacteria could pass through a pore size of 1 6 μm five brown glass bottles containing 1 l filtered water samples were prepared for each site then 1 ml of e1 stock solutions 250 μg l 1 was added to each bottle to make a final e1 concentration of 250 ng l 1 nutrients were also added to exclude the interference of nutrient

bottles of each water sample were incubated at room temperature 19 2 c for 7 days in the dark during the incubation the bottles were loosely capped and shaken daily to ensure an adequate oxygen supply

murphy et al 2014 the humification index hix biological index bix fluorescence index fi and the specific ratios of traditional fluorescence peaks including t c a c and a t were calculated table s4 hansen et al 2016 the parafac was also performed and validated through the extended s4c6t3 validation using the dreem toolbox the maximal fluorescence intensity f max of each fluorescent component was assumed to be positively correlated with their real concentrations two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was applied to fluorescence spectra by taking the emission intensity as the response variable and the spatial distribution of sampling sites as the discrete disturbance factor li et al 2021 the dom biodegradability bdoc was determined as the loss of doc in a 28 day bio incubation according to the published method zhou et al 2020 an expanded description of the experimental procedures is provided in chapter s2 of si 2 4 microbial analysis bacterial abundances in water samples

testing correction by the benjaminie hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 3 results 3 1 longitudinal patterns of dom 3 1 1 bulk doc and optical parameters the bulk doc concentrations of water samples ranged from 1 93 to 2 91 mg l 1 fig s2a while there was no significant difference in doc concentrations between upstream and downstream fig s2b higher suva254 a 254 a 204 a 400 a 300 and a 254 a 436 values were observed in downstream fig 2 a and b the elevated aromaticity also contributed to the increased suva350 that was reflective of light absorbing organics along the flow in contrast higher values of s r a 210 a 254 and a 254 a 436 were observed in upstream fig 2c the eems of water samples presented two major fluorescence peaks peak a and peak t whereas peak b and peak c were weak or absent from visual inspection fig s3 spatially the decreased tryptophan like fluorescence protein and peptide like led to lower ratios of peak t and a average value of 0 53 in downstream than in upstream average value of 0 72 fig 3 a in contrast the average value of c t 0 83 in upstream was higher than that in downstream 0 63 as shown in fig 3b the ranges of bix value 0 85 to 1 04 and fi value 1 9 manifested the mixing of weak microbial sources and strong terrestrial sources along the flow the significantly increased hix values p 0 001 were associated with the decreased ratio of h c and increased humification degree in downstream the emission spectra from 280 to 550 nm at an excitation wavelength of 275 nm were further incorporated to perform 2d cos in the synchronous map fig 3c two cross peaks with positive signals were located at 340 305 nm and 415 305 nm respectively based on noda s rules the positive peak at 340 305 nm and the negative peak at 415 340 nm in the asynchronous map revealed that the priority of peak change followed the order of 340 nm tryptophan like 305 nm tyrosine like 415 nm humic like fig 3d 3 1 2 parafac components a total of 6 fluorescent components were identified and matched with other published models in the openfluor database similarity score 0 95 murphy et al 2014 fig 4 a and s4 component 1 c1 component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 were considered as tyrosine tryptophan and tryptophan like substances respectively component 4 c4 component 5 c5 and component 6 c6 were considered as microbial humic terrestrial humic and humic like substances respectively based on the f max of parafac components the relative abundance of c1 c2 and c3 decreased from upstream to downstream fig 4b following the trend of protein like fluorescence peaks in contrast the relative abundance of humic like components presented an increasing trend along the mainstream according to the pair wise correlation analysis fig 4c the protein like components were inversely correlated with humic like components and c t but showed positive relationships with t a the indicators of humic like dom including hix c t c4 c5 and c6 were positively related moreover the a 210 a 254 a 254 a 436 a 250 a 365 and s r were positively correlated with each other but negatively correlated with other absorbance indices including a 400 a 300 a 254 a 204 suva254 and suva350 furthermore suva350 and suva254 exhibited negative relationships with c2 c3 and t a and were positively correlated with c t hix c4 c5 and c6 while the positive relationship between bix and fi relied on the significant contribution of autochthonous sources to fresh like dom no correlation was observed between protein like indicators and bix or fi 3 1 3 dom biodegradability and its effects on estrone biodegradation the bdoc in downstream was in the range of 9 6 to 19 0 significantly lower than those in upstream 21 4 5 6 p 0 001 fig 5 a spearman s rank correlation displayed that the dom biodegradability was negatively correlated with the indicators of humic like components such as hix c t c4 c5 and c6 whereas the a 210 a 254 a 254 a 436 t a c2 and c3 showed positive correlations with bdoc p 0 001 fig 5c the determined ebp in upstream 27 38 5 95 ng mg 1 c was significantly higher than those in downstream 18 66 6 16 ng mg 1 c fig 5a meanwhile a significant and positive correlation was observed between ebp and bdoc p 0 001 fig 5b it was also noted that the slope of the fitted linear relationship between ebp and bdoc was larger in downstream than in upstream fig s5 spearman s rank correlation further stated that the ebp was positively related to fi t a c1 and c2 but negatively associated with c t hix and humic like components among them the ratio of peak t and peak a was identified as the most decisive factor however the biomass normalized ebp showed distinguished spatial variations compared to ebp b ebp was significantly higher in downstream than in upstream p 0 027 and positively correlated with aromatic and humic related indices including suva254 suva350 a 400 a 300 and a 254 a 204 fig 5c 3 2 geographical distributions of bacterial community 3 2 1 bacterial community abundances and compositions the average bacterial abundances ranged from 1 32 109 to 0 51 109 cells l 1 exhibiting a decreasing trend along the downstream direction fig s6 the 959 938 high quality sequences were obtained and then rarefied to an even depth of 15 454 per sample based on the lowest sequence reads the coverage of each sample 0 97 indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient and some rare species were also included a total of 536 otus were assigned from the sequences at a 3 dissimilarity level while shannon index did not exhibit remarkable spatial variation the values of chao and invsimpson index generally increased indicating a more diverse bacterial population in downstream zhou et al 2020 fig 6 a the nmds analysis further demonstrated a much broader disparity in upstream especially cj1 and cj5 were distinctly different from others fig s7 by contrast the bacterial communities displayed higher homogeneity at downstream sites also the lower normalized stochasticity ratio 36 4 supported that the deterministic process was more robust in the assembly and turnover of bacterial communities in downstream fig s8 at the phylum level proteobacteria was identified as the most diverse 45 group and exhibited a slightly decreasing trend along the mainstream fig 6b in contrast the relative abundances of cyanobacteria and firmicutes were much higher at the cj10 and cj11 in downstream the actinobacteriota 33 and bacteroidota 10 did not show regular spatial variations at the class level proteobacteria was mainly composed of gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria and the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria was higher in upstream fig s9a in contrast a higher abundance of cyanobacteriia kapabacteria and bacilli was observed at downstream sites 3 2 2 interactions of bacterial community and dom compositions the spearman s rank correlations between the fluorescence intensity of parafac components and the abundance of bacterial taxa at class levels showed that actinobacteria acidimicrobiia deinococci and bacilli were more closely related to the humic like components fig s9b which exhibited negative correlations with gammaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae the alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidia were positively correlated with protein like components besides the protein like c1 and c2 also showed negative correlations with cyanobacteriia deinococci and vicinamibacteria network analysis provided more detailed information about the direct associations between dom components and abundances of the major otu as well as the bacterial community assembly rules reflecting ecological processes fig 6c positive correlations accounted for more than 96 of the total correlations suggesting the dominance of cooperation in the interspecies interactions table s5 diverse bacterial taxa belonging to different clades tended to co occur and interact with dom components forming modular structures with a small world topology in the different regions of the network the three protein like components were divided into the same module fig s10 exhibiting positive correlations with bacteroidia and actinobacteria and negative correlations with gammaproteobacteria and cyanobacteriia fig 6d similarly the humic like c3 c4 and c5 were all clustered into one module showing positive correlations with the bacterial otus belonging to alphaproteobacteria and actinobacteria the number of connections of fluorescent components followed the order of c1 25 c4 21 c5 20 c6 17 c2 13 c3 11 notably more positive correlations were observed between otus and humic like components than with protein like components 4 discussion 4 1 longitudinal patterns of dom quality along the mainstream as a river across a large geographic area the yangtze river presents a continuous system of hydrological and biotic processes in the tgr spatially urbanization and cultivation are more robust in upstream whereas forests cover a larger area in downstream ma et al 2021 the anthropogenic derived organics in urban land use and farmland led to the lower light absorbing and aromatic compounds decreased suva350 and suva254 and greater protein and amino acid like moieties shifting dom composition toward a strong autochthonous origin with a higher a 254 a 436 li et al 2021 zhou et al 2021b fig 2 in contrast the positive correlations between humic like indicators suggested the conservative behavior of allochthonous dom which was fueled by deforestation in downstream drake et al 2019 moreover the in situ biological and photolytic transformation associated with regional dom consumption may have masked the information reflected by fluorescent indices hansen et al 2016 resulting in a minor variation of dom source indicators since the optical radiation was low during the sampling season in situ microbial degradation was considered more crucial in controlling dom quantity and quality the preferential variation of protein like substances with higher biodegradability confirmed robust microbial utilization fig 3c and d humic like substances often exhibit a stronger photochemical reactivity than protein like substances maisonneuve et al 2022 and they would preferential change if strong photochemical transformation occurs the coincidence of allochthonous input and in situ degradation also contributed to the similar doc concentrations from upstream to downstream li et al 2021 bacteria utilized the biodegradable substances leading to the relative accumulation of utilization associated products such as tyrosine like c1 and microbial humic like c4 in transit the increased suva254 suva350 a 254 a 204 a 400 a 300 hix and humic like components further illustrated that the cumulation of byproducts and recalcitrant substances enhanced dom aromaticity hydrophobicity and humification in downstream this result was consistent with our previous findings that the hydrophilic less aromatic and fresh dom was more ready for biodegradation than the hydrophobic compounds containing condensed aromatic structures bai et al 2017 the selective utilization of small molecules and production of high molecular weight byproducts within in situ biodegradation also accounted for the increased dom molecular weight decreased s r and a 250 a 365 along the flow helms et al 2008 fig 2b and 2c furthermore the downstream close to the dam had a prolonged water residence time compared to the upstream facilitating the in situ humification of biodegradable organic compounds therefore aquatic metabolism was a primary driver of dom quality and the longitudinal pattern depended on dom productivity and transformation compared to the small coastal temperate streams fellman et al 2008 and glacial fed stream ecosystems spencer et al 2014 the dom biodegradability was relatively lower in the tgr another research reported the dom biodegradability in the yangtze river ranged from 12 to 18 during a 28 day bio incubation zhou et al 2021b while the bdoc may be overestimated because the bioassay was performed at room temperature slightly higher than real water temperatures the stronger dom biodegradability in upstream was associated with the disproportionate inputs of highly labile dom derived from anthropogenic activity greater dom biodegradabilities were often found in urbanized streams with increasing proportions of protein like dom hosen et al 2014 in contrast the profoundly recalcitrant dom pools in downstream provided direct evidence that bacteria metabolized the biodegradable components along the flow direction meanwhile the decreased dom biodegradability occurred in parallel with changes in dom quality as shown by the increase in aromaticity and humification in downstream the positive correlations between bdoc and t a and c2 and the negative correlations with suva254 suva350 hix c t and humic like components uncovered the diverse dom components predicting biodegradability for instance the increased abundance of aromatic and lignin fraction contributed to a lower dom biodegradability bai et al 2022b also the negative linkages between hix and bdoc stated that the high proportion of recalcitrant compounds presumably inhibited biodegradation lower hix and higher t a values have suggested enhanced bacterial productivity in a stream kamjunke et al 2019 however the in situ biotransformation can regulate dom biodegradability without changing fi values hansen et al 2016 masking the correlations between bdoc and origin related optical parameters overall the comprehensive behaviors of dom optical properties constructed a longitudinal gradient of dom loading transport utilization and accumulation over the river continuum 4 2 responses of bacterial community to dom quality recent catchment scale studies highlighted that the predictable gradient of bacterial community structure was driven by the relative importance of terrestrial inputs and species sorting along the river continuum gweon et al 2021 henson et al 2018 the passive dispersal transfer of upstream bacterial diversity could increase the diversity in a downstream direction wang et al 2021 moreover the similar land use and the longer water residence time contributed to the more similar bacterial community between the downstream sites the interactive relationship between local water properties and watershed characteristics affected the geographical clustering of bacterial communities liu et al 2018 concurrently the high sensitivity to organic carbon gradients also contributed to the diverse and dynamic bacterial communities as suggested by the increased bacterial diversities and decreased abundances accompanying decreased bdoc the bacterial community depended more on the quality of dom than the quantity species groups clustering in the same module are considered to share similar niches and perform similar functions so dom components located in different modules inferred bacterial metabolic preferences and transformations proteobacteria generally harbored versatile capacities in chemical compound utilization including autochthonous fresh like compounds and terrestrial humic like compounds amaral et al 2016 in particular the growth of alphaproteobacteria could be favored in the presence of proteinaceous matter bai et al 2020 thus the decreased protein like c1 c2 and c3 was accompanied by a slight decline of proteobacteria along the mainstream similarly bacteroidia belonging to bacteroidota responded rapidly to labile dom such as starch polysaccharides and carbohydrates traving et al 2017 although humic like dom coagulated through abiotic self assembly and showed strong resistance to biodegradation bacteria could rework humic like matter together with most protein or tyrosine like substances docherty et al 2006 for example actinobacteria could degrade various humic matter and be related to molecular weight in limnetic environments hutalle schmelzer et al 2010 the explosion of bacilli under humic conditions also led to its positive connections with humic like components yang et al 2020 adding humic acid was previously found favorable to the survival of deinococci shabbir et al 2022 because of the influence of various anthropogenic sources in upstream stochastic processes played a more critical role in shaping bacterial communities gweon et al 2021 however the accumulated recalcitrant substances caused resource depletion and limitation manifesting that deterministic selection became progressively more important at downstream sites driving the community assembly to a determinism stage by the increasing selection stress usually results in selecting populations better adapted to the corresponding ecological niches and creating a more homogeneous assembly zhou et al 2021a alternatively the less biodegradable dom favored species equipped with specific metabolic capabilities and more habitat specialists with narrow niche breadths in downstream fig s11 the environmental filtering by carbon sources also regulated the co occurrence of bacterial taxa which not only suggested the species segregation and the cooperation tendency yan et al 2021 the higher number of positive connections between humic like components and bacterial taxa implied that the subcommunity tended to develop more aggregations when exposed to humic like structures in contrast the lower positive degrees of protein like components may be attributed to the competition of species for biodegradable carbon sources it was speculated that a few taxa e g alphaproteobacteria and bacterodia participated in the utilization of protein like substances additionally the more substantial variability of dom optical parameters than of bacterial community indicated the high versatility of bacteria to fluctuating carbon availability without significant quantitative changes in main subgroups as a whole the longitudinal patterns of dom quality induced drastic changes in the assemblage and structure of bacterial communities exerting significant impacts on the metabolic balance of river ecosystems 4 3 implications for emerging contaminant biodegradation emerging contaminants are of eco toxicological concern and the high persistence of some chemicals in river ecosystems poses issues for drinking water production schaper et al 2019 generally the concentrations of emerging contaminants are too low for maximal induction of or recognition by bacterial enzymes and dom increases bacterial carrying capacity by providing a substantial subsidy in such circumstances egli 2010 considering the similar doc concentrations in upstream and downstream the spatial variations of ebp should be induced by the longitudinal patterns of dom quality the microbial cycling of biodegradable dom could stimulate bacterial respiration increase bacterial abundances and accelerate e1 biodegradation through priming effects bai et al 2022a hence the ebp was positively correlated with bdoc which was also observed in an additional bioassay using the same bacterial inoculum fig s12 previous studies have reported a parallel decrease in contaminants and biogeochemical reaction rates due to the coupling of priming processes in river ecosystems schaper et al 2019 the different influences of protein and humic like dom on the activity of carbon acquiring enzymes resulted in the different relationships between ebp and protein and humic like optical parameters parr et al 2015 moreover the presence of various reactive groups such as carboxylic phenolic and quinones in humic acid could also bind and decrease the availability of estrogens to bacteria lee et al 2011 the different longitudinal patterns of b ebp and ebp verified that e1 biodegradation strongly depended on bacterial community composition and structure for instance numerous members of bacilli which were more abundant in downstream have been reported with the ability to decompose e1 zhang et al 2016 under recalcitrant conditions firmicutes and actinobacteria had a high biotransformation capability for xenobiotics due to the abundant cytochrome p450 genes in these phyla li et al 2014 moreover the complex interactions within bacterial communities regulated their ability to handle refractory contaminants due to functional redundancy yan et al 2021 as suggested by the network analysis exposure to humic like components could increase the metabolic plasticity of bacterial communities through enhancing interspecies synergism whose niche space might be relatively complementary one previous study reported that the co occurrence interactions between bacteria orchestrated subcommunities to develop spontaneous adaptation and selection to degrade contaminants bai et al 2022a the stronger sensitivity of bacterial community to available carbon was also confirmed by the steeper slope of the fitted linear relationship between bdoc and ebp in downstream fig s5 therefore the more diverse and selective community assemblages may also contribute to the higher b ebp in downstream in contrast the increasing proportion of nonfunctional taxa derived from stochastic processes is not favorable to the specific metabolic functions of bacterial communities resulting in the lower b ebp at upstream sites rivers act as active pipes that process contaminants rather than passively channel them in this study the longitudinal patterns of ebp and b ebp reflected the degradation function of bacterial communities in distinct habitats that occur across a gradient of carbon sources while a greater e1 biodegradation occurred with higher bdoc and bacterial abundances in upstream the bacterial community adapted to humic like dom exhibited a stronger degradation capacity of e1 in downstream the versatility of bacterial communities to variable dom quality led to the spatial variation of bdoc and ebp without significant quantitative changes in the main phyla over the river continuum nevertheless it should be noted that one sampling during the impoundment period of tgr is not enough to demonstrate the dom quality and bacterial degradation function under all scenarios considering that human activities contaminants inputs microbial activity and dom transformation are sensitive to seasonal and hydrological patterns ma et al 2021 future studies will be performed to ascertain how other environmental and hydrological factors such as temperature nutrients flow velocity and water level modulate the dom characteristics and bacterial degradation of emerging contaminants 5 conclusions this study showed for the first time that responses of bacterial communities to the longitudinal pattern of dom quality mediated their degradation function of estrone via different mechanisms along the mainstream in tgr the land use and in situ biotransformation regulated the composition structure and biodegradability of dom leading to stronger growth carbon utilization and e1 biodegradation of bacterial communities in upstream than in downstream nevertheless the accumulation of recalcitrant and aromatic components in transit triggered a deterministic selection of bacterial assemblages favored the potential e1 degraders facilitated interspecies cooperations and resulted in the higher biomass normalized ebp in downstream combined results have implications for understanding river continuums as transporters vs processors of organic carbon and emerging contaminants which is helpful for water quality

graphical abstract longitudinal patterns of dissolved organic matter dom influence the biogeochemical cycle in river ecosystems yet linkages between dom quality and bacterial degradation of emerging contaminants over a river continuum are unclear in combination with dom characterization bioassay and microbial analysis this study unraveled the spatial variations of dom composition and biodegradability as well as bacterial community structures which determined the estrone biodegradation potential ebp along the mainstream in three gorges reservoir during impoundment period while urban and agricultural utilization increased the protein like and biodegradable dom components bdoc in upstream the in situ biotransformation preferentially utilized tryptophan like substances followed by tyrosine like substances resulting in the accumulated recalcitrant dom with higher aromaticity molecular weight and humic like components in downstream due to the promotion of biodegradable dom on bacterial abundances a significant and positive correlation was constructed between bdoc and ebp p 0 001 r 2 0 56 both of which were controlled by the ratio of fresh to humic like fluorescence nevertheless a higher biomass normalized ebp was found under recalcitrant conditions in downstream demonstrating that the degradation function was also associated with the biogeographical distribution of bacterial communities results of microbial ecology revealed that the in situ transformation of aromatic and humic like dom exhibited more correlations with bacterial taxa than protein like dom leading to increased diversity and decreased niche breadths along the mainstream the triggered deterministic selection of community assemblages in downstream favored potential estrone degraders and up regulated their specific metabolic capacity these findings will provide critical insights toward understanding the crucial role of dom in biogeochemical cycles and the self purification of emerging contaminants along the river continuum keywords river continuum biodegradation optical properties bacterial community dissolved organic matter data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction upstream downstream gradients include the consistent patterns of loading transport and utilization of organic matter as well as the turnover of functional groups within bacterial communities along the length of a river vannote et al 1980 wang et al 2021 dissolved organic matter dom the primary energy source for heterotrophic bacteria is a significant factor shaping bacterial abundances and communities in water environments kamjunke et al 2019 muscarella et al 2019 the associations with dom composition also contribute to material circulation and energy flow affecting the functional variables of aquatic ecosystems for example the adaption and degradation capacity of bacterial communities for emerging contaminants was previously enhanced by proteinaceous organics in freshwater lakes bai et al 2020 dom was also reported as a vital proxy for assessing emerging contaminant fate in rivers tang et al 2019 estrone e1 a representative emerging contaminant occurring in global river systems chafi et al 2022 nazifa et al 2020 sta ana and espino 2020 exhibits adverse impacts on hormonal control sexual differentiation and reproductive success of aquatic organisms colborn et al 1993 considering bacterial degradation is the prominent mechanism for the self purification process of e1 in water environments yu et al 2013 it is appropriate to target e1 as the model compound for demonstrating linkages between bacterial degradation function of emerging contaminant and longitudinal patterns of dom quality through a river continuum in river ecosystems dom is composed of aromatic and aliphatic moieties with various molecular structures and functionalities influenced by allochthonous sources e g plant litter and soil organic matter autochthonous sources e g bacteria and phytoplankton and anthropogenic activities e g effluent organic matter and manure he et al 2021 while autochthonous dom enriched in proteins and polysaccharides is generally biodegradable the terrestrial dom composed of more humic substances and structural polysaccharides exhibits lower biodegradabilities hansen et al 2016 during fluvial transport various in situ biogeochemical processes such as sorption photodegradation and biotransformation ultimately alter dom composition and reactivity maisonneuve et al 2022 it was reported that in situ biodegradation on average 95 selectively removed the biodegradable dom with higher molecular diversity resulting in increased recalcitrant pools such as humic acids and lignins maisonneuve et al 2022 sipler et al 2017 however the relationship between regular variations of dom and bacterial community is complicated and bidirectional along the river continuum on the one hand bacterial communities are critical biogeochemical reagents for dom production conversion and mineralization logue et al 2016 on the other hand changes in dom quantity and quality induce diverse responses of bacterial taxa with distinct abundance patterns as reflected by growth respiration and enzymatic degradation kamjunke et al 2019 community members constantly interact with each other rather than live in isolation thereby contributing to the nonrandom co occurrence patterns and modular structures of bacterial communities within decomposing dom muscarella et al 2019 so far many studies have demonstrated that the heterogeneous dom structures which encompass the abundance and biodegradability of carbon and other resources were a potent force influencing bacterial clades in different water areas traving et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 however the bacterial community structure and interspecific interactions in response to longitudinal patterns of dom are largely ignored over a river continuum in depth characterization of dom complex composition is the foundation of linking its occurrence with impacts on bacterial communities due to the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of dom components absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy have been increasingly used to track the source migration and transformation of dom wang et al 2019 optical parameters and indices including the absolute absorbance or fluorescence intensity at specific wavelengths and ratios of different wavelengths can support high resolution fingerprints of dom molecules hansen et al 2016 meanwhile changes in dom optical signals can be resolved to indicate concurrent effects on bacterial community assemblages and degradation functions for instance correlation based network analysis revealed that interactions between fluorescent dom and bacterial taxa controlled community aggregations zhang et al 2020 three gorges reservoir tgr the largest water reservoir in terms of installed electric generating capacity on earth covers the district from chongqing to the three gorge dam with a mainstream of over 670 km and an area of 1 084 km2 since 2010 the water level of tgr has fluctuated periodically between 145 and 175 m each year due to the periodic water impoundment the impoundment period or the wet period of tgr occurs in the autumn winter season and manifests as a water level increase which not only decreases flow velocity but also causes water quality deterioration in downstream xiang et al 2021 previous studies have pointed out bacterial degradation played a more crucial role than photochemical degradation and particulate removal in affecting dom quality during impoundment periods jiang et al 2018 however the contaminant biodegradation following the longitudinal gradient of dom quality and bacterial community has thus far remained unclear in this study the mainstream in the tgr was used as a model to ascertain the longitudinal patterns of dom concentration composition and biodegradability as well as bacterial abundance and community composition the spatial variation of in situ e1 biodegradation potential ebp was further assessed to test the hypothesis that e1 biodegradation would decrease with the decline in dom biodegradability and bacterial abundance over the river continuum the results of this study will contribute to understanding dom biogeochemical cycles and supply the fundamental data for the environmental protection agencies to establish effective regulations to alleviate the emerging contamination in river ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 research sites and sampling the cruise activity was launched in november 2019 when the impoundment of tgr raised the water level to 174 m the average discharge during the cruise was 8350 m3 s the annual precipitation 1035 1 mm average temperature 17 5 c annual discharge 4 02 1011 m3 and annual runoff depth 534 2 mm in 2019 were close to the long term average in tgr table s1 a total of 12 sampling sites cj1 cj12 were selected along the mainstream from the center to the rural area of chongqing and ended before the three gorges dam fig 1 according to their locations sampling sites were further separated into two groups upstream cj1 cj6 and downstream cj7 cj12 table s2 in supporting information si provides the basic information of sampling sites at each site triplicate surface water samples were taken within a 2 3 m radius to provide a representative sample once collected the water sample was filtrated through 1 6 µm membranes to remove large suspended solids and zooplankton a part of the filtered sample was added into acid cleaned brown glass bottles to conduct the bioassay of emerging contaminant biodegradation potential another part was subsequently filtrated through 0 22 µm membranes and the filtrates and membranes were stored at 20 c before the dom characterization and microbial analysis 2 2 bioassay of emerging contaminant biodegradation potential for the assessment of in situ ebp water samples were filtered by 1 6 μm because bacteria could pass through a pore size of 1 6 μm five brown glass bottles containing 1 l filtered water samples were prepared for each site then 1 ml of e1 stock solutions 250 μg l 1 was added to each bottle to make a final e1 concentration of 250 ng l 1 nutrients were also added to exclude the interference of nutrient

the r software and the interactive platform gephi webatlas paris france valid co occurrences with r 0 8 and p value 0 05 were incorporated into the network the p value was pre adjusted with a multiple testing correction by the benjaminie hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 3 results 3 1 longitudinal patterns of dom 3 1 1 bulk doc and optical parameters the bulk doc concentrations of water samples ranged from 1 93 to 2 91 mg l 1 fig s2a while there was no significant difference in doc concentrations between upstream and downstream fig s2b higher suva254 a 254 a 204 a 400 a 300 and a 254 a 436 values were observed in downstream fig 2 a and b the elevated aromaticity also contributed to the increased suva350 that was reflective of light absorbing organics along the flow in contrast higher values of s r a 210 a 254 and a 254 a 436 were observed in upstream fig 2c the eems of water samples presented two major fluorescence peaks peak a and peak t whereas peak b and peak c were weak or absent from visual inspection fig s3 spatially the decreased tryptophan like fluorescence protein and peptide like led to lower ratios of peak t and a average value of 0 53 in downstream than in upstream average value of 0 72 fig 3 a in contrast the average value of c t 0 83 in upstream was higher than that in downstream 0 63 as shown in fig 3b the ranges of bix value 0 85 to 1 04 and fi value 1 9 manifested the mixing of weak microbial sources and strong terrestrial sources along the flow the significantly increased hix values p 0 001 were associated with the decreased ratio of h c and increased humification degree in downstream the emission spectra from 280 to 550 nm at an excitation wavelength of 275 nm were further incorporated to perform 2d cos in the synchronous map fig 3c two cross peaks with positive signals were located at 340 305 nm and 415 305 nm respectively based on noda s rules the positive peak at 340 305 nm and the negative peak at 415 340 nm in the asynchronous map revealed that the priority of peak change followed the order of 340 nm tryptophan like 305 nm tyrosine like 415 nm humic like fig 3d 3 1 2 parafac components a total of 6 fluorescent components were identified and matched with other published models in the openfluor database similarity score 0 95 murphy et al 2014 fig 4 a and s4 component 1 c1 component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 were considered as tyrosine tryptophan and tryptophan like substances respectively component 4 c4 component 5 c5 and component 6 c6 were considered as microbial humic terrestrial humic and humic like substances respectively based on the f max of parafac components the relative abundance of c1 c2 and c3 decreased from upstream to downstream fig 4b following the trend of protein like fluorescence peaks in contrast the relative abundance of humic like components presented an increasing trend along the mainstream according to the pair wise correlation analysis fig 4c the protein like components were inversely correlated with humic like components and c t but showed positive relationships with t a the indicators of humic like dom including hix c t c4 c5 and c6 were positively related moreover the a 210 a 254 a 254 a 436 a 250 a 365 and s r were positively correlated with each other but negatively correlated with other absorbance indices including a 400 a 300 a 254 a 204 suva254 and suva350 furthermore suva350 and suva254 exhibited negative relationships with c2 c3 and t a and were positively correlated with c t hix c4 c5 and c6 while the positive relationship between bix and fi relied on the significant contribution of autochthonous sources to fresh like dom no correlation was observed between protein like indicators and bix or fi 3 1 3 dom biodegradability and its effects on estrone biodegradation the bdoc in downstream was in the range of 9 6 to 19 0 significantly lower than those in upstream 21 4 5 6 p 0 001 fig 5 a spearman s rank correlation displayed that the dom biodegradability was negatively correlated with the indicators of humic like components such as hix c t c4 c5 and c6 whereas the a 210 a 254 a 254 a 436 t a c2 and c3 showed positive correlations with bdoc p 0 001 fig 5c the determined ebp in upstream 27 38 5 95 ng mg 1 c was significantly higher than those in downstream 18 66 6 16 ng mg 1 c fig 5a meanwhile a significant and positive correlation was observed between ebp and bdoc p 0 001 fig 5b it was also noted that the slope of the fitted linear relationship between ebp and bdoc was larger in downstream than in upstream fig s5 spearman s rank correlation further stated that the ebp was positively related to fi t a c1 and c2 but negatively associated with c t hix and humic like components among them the ratio of peak t and peak a was identified as the most decisive factor however the biomass normalized ebp showed distinguished spatial variations compared to ebp b ebp was significantly higher in downstream than in upstream p 0 027 and positively correlated with aromatic and humic related indices including suva254 suva350 a 400 a 300 and a 254 a 204 fig 5c 3 2 geographical distributions of bacterial community 3 2 1 bacterial community abundances and compositions the average bacterial abundances ranged from 1 32 109 to 0 51 109 cells l 1 exhibiting a decreasing trend along the downstream direction fig s6 the 959 938 high quality sequences were obtained and then rarefied to an even depth of 15 454 per sample based on the lowest sequence reads the coverage of each sample 0 97 indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient and some rare species were also included a total of 536 otus were assigned from the sequences at a 3 dissimilarity level while shannon index did not exhibit remarkable spatial variation the values of chao and invsimpson index generally increased indicating a more diverse bacterial population in downstream zhou et al 2020 fig 6 a the nmds analysis further demonstrated a much broader disparity in upstream especially cj1 and cj5 were distinctly different from others fig s7 by contrast the bacterial communities displayed higher homogeneity at downstream sites also the lower normalized stochasticity ratio 36 4 supported that the deterministic process was more robust in the assembly and turnover of bacterial communities in downstream fig s8 at the phylum level proteobacteria was identified as the most diverse 45 group and exhibited a slightly decreasing trend along the mainstream fig 6b in contrast the relative abundances of cyanobacteria and firmicutes were much higher at the cj10 and cj11 in downstream the actinobacteriota 33 and bacteroidota 10 did not show regular spatial variations at the class level proteobacteria was mainly composed of gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria and the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria was higher in upstream fig s9a in contrast a higher abundance of cyanobacteriia kapabacteria and bacilli was observed at downstream sites 3 2 2 interactions of bacterial community and dom compositions the spearman s rank correlations between the fluorescence intensity of parafac components and the abundance of bacterial taxa at class levels showed that actinobacteria acidimicrobiia deinococci and bacilli were more closely related to the humic like components fig s9b which exhibited negative correlations with gammaproteobacteria and verrucomicrobiae the alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidia were positively correlated with protein like components besides the protein like c1 and c2 also showed negative correlations with cyanobacteriia deinococci and vicinamibacteria network analysis provided more detailed information about the direct associations between dom components and abundances of the major otu as well as the bacterial community assembly rules reflecting ecological processes fig 6c positive correlations accounted for more than 96 of the total correlations suggesting the dominance of cooperation in the interspecies interactions table s5 diverse bacterial taxa belonging to different clades tended to co occur and interact with dom components forming modular structures with a small world topology in the different regions of the network the three protein like components were divided into the same module fig s10 exhibiting positive correlations with bacteroidia and actinobacteria and negative correlations with gammaproteobacteria and cyanobacteriia fig 6d similarly the humic like c3 c4 and c5 were all clustered into one module showing positive correlations with the bacterial otus belonging to alphaproteobacteria and actinobacteria the number of connections of fluorescent components followed the order of c1 25 c4 21 c5 20 c6 17 c2 13 c3 11 notably more positive correlations were observed between otus and humic like components than with protein like components 4 discussion 4 1 longitudinal patterns of dom quality along the mainstream as a river across a large geographic area the yangtze river presents a continuous system of hydrological and biotic processes in the tgr spatially urbanization and cultivation are more robust in upstream whereas forests cover a larger area in downstream ma et al 2021 the anthropogenic derived organics in urban land use and farmland led to the lower light absorbing and aromatic compounds decreased suva350 and suva254 and greater protein and amino acid like moieties shifting dom composition toward a strong autochthonous origin with a higher a 254 a 436 li et al 2021 zhou et al 2021b fig 2 in contrast the positive correlations between humic like indicators suggested the conservative behavior of allochthonous dom which was fueled by deforestation in downstream drake et al 2019 moreover the in situ biological and photolytic transformation associated with regional dom consumption may have masked the information reflected by fluorescent indices hansen et al 2016 resulting in a minor variation of dom source indicators since the optical radiation was low during the sampling season in situ microbial degradation was considered more crucial in controlling dom quantity and quality the preferential variation of protein like substances with higher biodegradability confirmed robust microbial utilization fig 3c and d humic like substances often exhibit a stronger photochemical reactivity than protein like substances maisonneuve et al 2022 and they would preferential change if strong photochemical transformation occurs the coincidence of allochthonous input and in situ degradation also contributed to the similar doc concentrations from upstream to downstream li et al 2021 bacteria utilized the biodegradable substances leading to the relative accumulation of utilization associated products such as tyrosine like c1 and microbial humic like c4 in transit the increased suva254 suva350 a 254 a 204 a 400 a 300 hix and humic like components further illustrated that the cumulation of byproducts and recalcitrant substances enhanced dom aromaticity hydrophobicity and humification in downstream this result was consistent with our previous findings that the hydrophilic less aromatic and fresh dom was more ready for biodegradation than the hydrophobic compounds containing condensed aromatic structures bai et al 2017 the selective utilization of small molecules and production of high molecular weight byproducts within in situ biodegradation also accounted for the increased dom molecular weight decreased s r and a 250 a 365 along the flow helms et al 2008 fig 2b and 2c furthermore the downstream close to the dam had a prolonged water residence time compared to the upstream facilitating the in situ humification of biodegradable organic compounds therefore aquatic metabolism was a primary driver of dom quality and the longitudinal pattern depended on dom productivity and transformation compared to the small coastal temperate streams fellman et al 2008 and glacial fed stream ecosystems spencer et al 2014 the dom biodegradability was relatively lower in the tgr another research reported the dom biodegradability in the yangtze river ranged from 12 to 18 during a 28 day bio incubation zhou et al 2021b while the bdoc may be overestimated because the bioassay was performed at room temperature slightly higher than real water temperatures the stronger dom biodegradability in upstream was associated with the disproportionate inputs of highly labile dom derived from anthropogenic activity greater dom biodegradabilities were often found in urbanized streams with increasing proportions of protein like dom hosen et al 2014 in contrast the profoundly recalcitrant dom pools in downstream provided direct evidence that bacteria metabolized the biodegradable components along the flow direction meanwhile the decreased dom biodegradability occurred in parallel with changes in dom quality as shown by the increase in aromaticity and humification in downstream the positive correlations between bdoc and t a and c2 and the negative correlations with suva254 suva350 hix c t and humic like components uncovered the diverse dom components predicting biodegradability for instance the increased abundance of aromatic and lignin fraction contributed to a lower dom biodegradability bai et al 2022b also the negative linkages between hix and bdoc stated that the high proportion of recalcitrant compounds presumably inhibited biodegradation lower hix and higher t a values have suggested enhanced bacterial productivity in a stream kamjunke et al 2019 however the in situ biotransformation can regulate dom biodegradability without changing fi values hansen et al 2016 masking the correlations between bdoc and origin related optical parameters overall the comprehensive behaviors of dom optical properties constructed a longitudinal gradient of dom loading transport utilization and accumulation over the river continuum 4 2 responses of bacterial community to dom quality recent catchment scale studies highlighted that the predictable gradient of bacterial community structure was driven by the relative importance of terrestrial inputs and species sorting along the river continuum gweon et al 2021 henson et al 2018 the passive dispersal transfer of upstream bacterial diversity could increase the diversity in a downstream direction wang et al 2021 moreover the similar land use and the longer water residence time contributed to the more similar bacterial community between the downstream sites the interactive relationship between local water properties and watershed characteristics affected the geographical clustering of bacterial communities liu et al 2018 concurrently the high sensitivity to organic carbon gradients also contributed to the diverse and dynamic bacterial communities as suggested by the increased bacterial diversities and decreased abundances accompanying decreased bdoc the bacterial community depended more on the quality of dom than the quantity species groups clustering in the same module are considered to share similar niches and perform similar functions so dom components located in different modules inferred bacterial metabolic preferences and transformations proteobacteria generally harbored versatile capacities in chemical compound utilization including autochthonous fresh like compounds and terrestrial humic like compounds amaral et al 2016 in particular the growth of alphaproteobacteria could be favored in the presence of proteinaceous matter bai et al 2020 thus the decreased protein like c1 c2 and c3 was accompanied by a slight decline of proteobacteria along the mainstream similarly bacteroidia belonging to bacteroidota responded rapidly to labile dom such as starch polysaccharides and carbohydrates traving et al 2017 although humic like dom coagulated through abiotic self assembly and showed strong resistance to biodegradation bacteria could rework humic like matter together with most protein or tyrosine like substances docherty et al 2006 for example actinobacteria could degrade various humic matter and be related to molecular weight in limnetic environments hutalle schmelzer et al 2010 the explosion of bacilli under humic conditions also led to its positive connections with humic like components yang et al 2020 adding humic acid was previously found favorable to the survival of deinococci shabbir et al 2022 because of the influence of various anthropogenic sources in upstream stochastic processes played a more critical role in shaping bacterial communities gweon et al 2021 however the accumulated recalcitrant substances caused resource depletion and limitation manifesting that deterministic selection became progressively more important at downstream sites driving the community assembly to a determinism stage by the increasing selection stress usually results in selecting populations better adapted to the corresponding ecological niches and creating a more homogeneous assembly zhou et al 2021a alternatively the less biodegradable dom favored species equipped with specific metabolic capabilities and more habitat specialists with narrow niche breadths in downstream fig s11 the environmental filtering by carbon sources also regulated the co occurrence of bacterial taxa which not only suggested the species segregation and the cooperation tendency yan et al 2021 the higher number of positive connections between humic like components and bacterial taxa implied that the subcommunity tended to develop more aggregations when exposed to humic like structures in contrast the lower positive degrees of protein like components may be attributed to the competition of species for biodegradable carbon sources it was speculated that a few taxa e g alphaproteobacteria and bacterodia participated in the utilization of protein like substances additionally the more substantial variability of dom optical parameters than of bacterial community indicated the high versatility of bacteria to fluctuating carbon availability without significant quantitative changes in main subgroups as a whole the longitudinal patterns of dom quality induced drastic changes in the assemblage and structure of bacterial communities exerting significant impacts on the metabolic balance of river ecosystems 4 3 implications for emerging contaminant biodegradation emerging contaminants are of eco toxicological concern and the high persistence of some chemicals in river ecosystems poses issues for drinking water production schaper et al 2019 generally the concentrations of emerging contaminants are too low for maximal induction of or recognition by bacterial enzymes and dom increases bacterial carrying capacity by providing a substantial subsidy in such circumstances egli 2010 considering the similar doc concentrations in upstream and downstream the spatial variations of ebp should be induced by the longitudinal patterns of dom quality the microbial cycling of biodegradable dom could stimulate bacterial respiration increase bacterial abundances and accelerate e1 biodegradation through priming effects bai et al 2022a hence the ebp was positively correlated with bdoc which was also observed in an additional bioassay using the same bacterial inoculum fig s12 previous studies have reported a parallel decrease in contaminants and biogeochemical reaction rates due to the coupling of priming processes in river ecosystems schaper et al 2019 the different influences of protein and humic like dom on the activity of carbon acquiring enzymes resulted in the different relationships between ebp and protein and humic like optical parameters parr et al 2015 moreover the presence of various reactive groups such as carboxylic phenolic and quinones in humic acid could also bind and decrease the availability of estrogens to bacteria lee et al 2011 the different longitudinal patterns of b ebp and ebp verified that e1 biodegradation strongly depended on bacterial community composition and structure for instance numerous members of bacilli which were more abundant in downstream have been reported with the ability to decompose e1 zhang et al 2016 under recalcitrant conditions firmicutes and actinobacteria had a high biotransformation capability for xenobiotics due to the abundant cytochrome p450 genes in these phyla li et al 2014 moreover the complex interactions within bacterial communities regulated their ability to handle refractory contaminants due to functional redundancy yan et al 2021 as suggested by the network analysis exposure to humic like components could increase the metabolic plasticity of bacterial communities through enhancing interspecies synergism whose niche space might be relatively complementary one previous study reported that the co occurrence interactions between bacteria orchestrated subcommunities to develop spontaneous adaptation and selection to degrade contaminants bai et al 2022a the stronger sensitivity of bacterial community to available carbon was also confirmed by the steeper slope of the fitted linear relationship between bdoc and ebp in downstream fig s5 therefore the more diverse and selective community assemblages may also contribute to the higher b ebp in downstream in contrast the increasing proportion of nonfunctional taxa derived from stochastic processes is not favorable to the specific metabolic functions of bacterial communities resulting in the lower b ebp at upstream sites rivers act as active pipes that process contaminants rather than passively channel them in this study the longitudinal patterns of ebp and b ebp reflected the degradation function of bacterial communities in distinct habitats that occur across a gradient of carbon sources while a greater e1 biodegradation occurred with higher bdoc and bacterial abundances in upstream the bacterial community adapted to humic like dom exhibited a stronger degradation capacity of e1 in downstream the versatility of bacterial communities to variable dom quality led to the spatial variation of bdoc and ebp without significant quantitative changes in the main phyla over the river continuum nevertheless it should be noted that one sampling during the impoundment period of tgr is not enough to demonstrate the dom quality and bacterial degradation function under all scenarios considering that human activities contaminants inputs microbial activity and dom transformation are sensitive to seasonal and hydrological patterns ma et al 2021 future studies will be performed to ascertain how other environmental and hydrological factors such as temperature nutrients flow velocity and water level modulate the dom characteristics and bacterial degradation of emerging contaminants 5 conclusions this study showed for the first time that responses of bacterial communities to the longitudinal pattern of dom quality mediated their degradation function of estrone via different mechanisms along the mainstream in tgr the land use and in situ biotransformation regulated the composition structure and biodegradability of dom leading to stronger growth carbon utilization and e1 biodegradation of bacterial communities in upstream than in downstream nevertheless the accumulation of recalcitrant and aromatic components in transit triggered a deterministic selection of bacterial assemblages favored the potential e1 degraders facilitated interspecies cooperations and resulted in the higher biomass normalized ebp in downstream combined results have implications for understanding river continuums as transporters vs processors of organic carbon and emerging contaminants which is helpful for water quality

2373,in the case of increasingly serious river pollution worldwide aeration in channels is an effective way to solve water pollution however traditional aeration research is aimed mainly at nonvegetated channels and there is relatively little research in vegetated channels aeration contributes to the absorption of pollutants by vegetation so studying the mass transfer of dissolved oxygen in vegetated channels is of great significance this paper innovatively studies the variation law and formula of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient in vegetated channels through an experiment and theoretical analysis through flume experiments this study examines the bubble size and oxygen transfer coefficient under different vegetation densities and establishes a formula to simulate the oxygen transfer coefficient under different vegetation densities the results show that vegetation has little effect on bubble diameter and the main effect on bubble diameter is the aeration rate the existence of vegetation significantly increases the mass transfer of oxygen and the higher the vegetation density is the greater the oxygen transfer coefficient transfer is at the same time a formula predicting the oxygen transfer coefficient is proven and the simulation results are good in which the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9535 and the mean absolute error mae reached 0 0857 this study provides a theoretical basis for the selection and layout of aeration systems in vegetated channels keywords vegetated channel aeration rate bubble diameter dissolved oxygen oxygen mass transfer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the increase in production and living activities an increasing number of pollutants are discharged into rivers resulting in serious deterioration of river water quality how to remove pollutants in rivers is also an important issue that people have been addressing wu et al 2015 shao et al 2014 artificial aeration is an effective way to increase the oxygen content in water the increase in dissolved oxygen content in water helps to improve the activity of microorganisms and aquatic plants and increases their degradation of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutants saeed and sun 2012 jia et al 2011 li et al 2014 kumar et al 2021a b aeration affects the hydraulic conditions in the channel and the characteristics of bubbles in aerated channels have been widely studied in the past wang et al 1987 studied the local gas holdup liquid velocity and reynolds stress of gas liquid two phase flow in a circulating water tank kitagawa et al 2004 studied the interaction between bubbles by particle image velocimetry piv and obtained the rising velocity of bubble groups by calculating the resistance coefficient based on the average diameter of bubbles revankar and ishii 1992 analysed the movement law of bubbles under turbulence by statistical methods and obtained experimental images of bubble growth at different speeds lee et al 2009 photographed the movement of bubbles in an oxidation ditch using high speed photography technology and obtained the bubble velocity under different aspect ratios loubière et al 2004 studied the effect of transverse flow on bubble formation in oxidation ditches by high speed photography and found that the rising deformation of bubbles is related to the change in liquid viscosity zoheidi et al 2017 provided the relationship between bubble size distribution and gas and liquid volume flow to solve the bubble size distribution of bubble slug transition flow in a narrow rectangular channel two group bubble fitting for transition flow was proposed by zhang et al 2022 there are many factors affecting oxygen mass transfer in water higbie provides a model of gas conduction into a stationary liquid over a short time period table 1 danckwerts 1951 first proposed a surface renewal sr model based on diffusive boundary layer dbl theory and the higbie 1935 model to estimate the interfacial gas transport rate on this basis tamburrino and gulliver 2002 and sanjou et al 2017 considered the influence of turbulence in the fluid on oxygen mass transfer based on the surface divergence sd model and gave the corresponding equations table 1 tseng and tinoco 2020 combined sr and sd models to define the oxygen mass transfer coefficient in the case of turbulence caused by vegetation in rigid vegetation channels table 1 however this model does not consider the influence of bubble size and aeration volume under aeration conditions among which the bubble diameter is an important factor affecting dissolved oxygen transmission burris et al 2002 chen and shao 2006 gave the representative bubble diameter in aerated water flow in shallow water bubbles rush to the water surface quickly breaking and splitting the water surface increasing the turbulence intensity of the water surface huang et al 2021 and increasing the contact area between the water surface and air which is also conducive to oxygen mass transfer on the water surface the diameter of bubbles is related to the aeration device and aeration efficiency and oxygen transfer efficiency increases with increasing aeration rate burris et al 2002 boog et al 2019 the flow rate is also an important factor affecting dissolved oxygen transfer fayolle et al 2010 demonstrated that the total oxygen transfer coefficient increased by 29 when the flow rate varied between 0 and 0 42 m s gillot et al 2000 showed that when the flow rate is 0 44 m s the oxygen transfer efficiency of the aerator is increased by 38 and the bubble diameter is reduced by 24 compared with static water vermande et al 2007 showed that the flow velocity changed the shape of bubbles and the oxygen transfer capacity and the formula of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient combined with the hi model is given table 1 terashima et al 2016 proposed a more accurate oxygen mass transfer coefficient model considering the ratio between gas and liquid table 1 numerical simulation is also often used in the study of oxygen mass transfer in aerated water flow wang and shen 2020 bodana et al 2020 kumar et al 2022b santarelli and fröhlich 2016 present two direct numerical simulations of bubble swarms in a vertical turbulent channel flow maleewong and hasadsri 2013 proposed mathematical models of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand in nonuniform open channels and this model can be used to study the transport process in one dimensional flow luxmi et al 2022a adapted the neuro fuzzy inference system anfis multilinear regression mlr and multi nonlinear regression mnlr to develop the model and predict aeration efficiency kumar et al 2022a used machine learning methods to estimate the oxygenation performance of various configurations of plunging hollow jet aerators vegetated channels have a great impact on water flow and affect the river s hydrological process aeration contributes to the growth of river vegetation and then affects the river s hydrological status therefore the study of aerated vegetation flow is very important to the hydrological process however the research is usually carried out in a flume or plexiglass bucket without vegetation or considers vegetation without considering bubbles for natural rivers there is usually a large amount of vegetation coverage and vegetation coverage will also affect hydrodynamic and bubble transport at the same time vegetation also has a large demand for dissolved oxygen it is necessary to study the migration of bubbles and the interfacial transfer of dissolved oxygen do in vegetated channels based on previous research this paper innovatively studies the law of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient in vegetated channels and proposes a solution formula of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient combined with flume experiments this paper explores the migration and distribution law of artificial aeration bubbles in a rigid vegetation flume and theoretically analyses and numerically simulates the migration process of the dissolved oxygen transfer process in the channel it can provide a theoretical basis for the application of artificial aeration in the vegetation channel 2 measured method 2 1 flume experiment the experiment was carried out in a circulating plexiglass flume in the laboratory fig 1 the flume is 10 m long 40 cm wide 50 cm high with a 0 0005 slope the water level in the flume is adjusted through the gate at the tail of the flume and the water flowing out of the flume is pumped into the high level tank through the water pump to circulate the water measuring instruments for velocity bubbles and dissolved oxygen are set in the water tank the velocity was measured by an ls300 a intelligent portable velocimeter with a propeller diameter of 12 mm the velocity measurement error is less than 1 5 and the sampling time is 1 min at the same time rigid vegetation with different densities was placed at the bottom of the flume and cylindrical wooden rods with a diameter of 8 mm were used to represent rigid vegetation the rigid vegetation was arranged on the flume bed an aeration device that can adjust the aeration rate was arranged in front of the flume according to changing the flume flow rate vegetation density and aeration capacity the experiment was divided into 36 treatments as shown in table 2 the vegetation density often ranges from 7 85 m2 to 625 m2 according to previous literature bai and xuan 2022 tang and knight 2009 li et al 2020 hui et al 2010 kim and stoesser 2011 van rooijen et al 2018 ferreira et al 2009 and 25 m2 44 4 m2 and 100 m2 were selected as vegetation densities in this study 2 2 measurement and prediction methods of dissolved oxygen the dissolved oxygen concentration was measured at six points using a dissolved oxygen probe ysi 57 which was located on six measuring points arranged along the water flow direction 5 cm below the water surface and 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m and 6 m away from the diffuser shown in fig 1 the sampling frequency was set to 5 s according to the method proposed by the american society of civil engineers stenstrom et al 2006 and the mean value of the six probes was used to obtain k l a assuming that the conduction mechanism of oxygen from the air water interface conforms to fick s law it can be expressed by the following formula 1 f c do t k l a c sat c do where c sat is the saturated dissolved oxygen concentration we can obtain k l a by solving the obtained curve using nonlinear regression analysis as shown in fig 2 the initial concentration of oxygen in the calculation is calculated as the 0 point and the oxygen concentration and saturated oxygen concentration are fitted by subtracting the initial value 2 c do c sat 1 e x p k l a t in the following the oxygen transfer coefficient is expressed under standard conditions 20 c 1013 hpa as follows he et al 2003 3 k l a k l a t 1 024 20 t where k l a t is the oxygen transfer coefficient at temperature t c and k l a h 1 is the oxygen transfer coefficient at 20 c 2 2 bubble size measurement the bubble diameter was determined from the image obtained by the high speed camera canon powershot g6 which was located on the right side of the water tank see fig 1 the lighting was provided by a 600 w laser lamp installed on the left side of the water tank the bubble size measurement scale was used to obtain the equivalent diameter of each bubble by matlab image analysis matlab identifies the boundary of the bubble by the major axis of the ellipsoidal bubble a i and the minor axis of the ellipsoidal bubble b i the bubble size is measured once every 5 cm which is 0 5 cm d 5 5 10 cm d 10 and 10 15 cm d 15 the determination of the sauter diameter requires size determination of a minimum of 100 bubbles fayolle et al 2006 the equivalent diameter d eq i is defined as the diameter of a spherical bubble with the same volume as the ellipsoid as shown below 4 d eq i a i 2 b i 3 where a i and b i are the major and minor axes of the ellipsoidal bubble i m respectively the sauter diameter d s required to determine the gas liquid interface area is calculated as follows 5 d s i 1 n d eq i 3 i 1 n d eq i 2 where d eq i is the equivalent diameter of bubble i and n is the total number of bubbles 2 3 modified prediction formula of the oxygen transfer coefficient considering the air and fluid volumes and bubble diameters that change with the density of rigid vegetation the basic form of the prediction formula of the oxygen transfer coefficient can be given by the following formula terashima et al 2016 cockx et al 2001 fayolle et al 2007 6 k l a 2 d l v r π d b 6 α g d b 1 α g first considering that vegetation will occupy the volume of water bodies the volume of water bodies in the channel needs to subtract the volume occupied by vegetation π α d 200 2 d b is calculated as the average d s along the water depth 7 a 6 α g d b 1 α g π α d v 2000 2 in the second part the vegetation in the river will significantly increase the disturbance in the flow and then affect the mass transfer of oxygen the diffusion coefficient of oxygen is divided into three parts the molecular diffusion coefficient turbulent diffusion coefficient and mechanical diffusion coefficient the turbulent diffusion coefficient is caused by the diffusion caused by the turbulence generated by the cylinder and the form is given by the right second item in eq 8 the velocity of flow is hindered by vegetation resulting in a reduction in the advection transport rate of fluid particles however due to the vegetation stem wake the propagation path of fluid particles in the vegetation zone will be extended as shown in fig 3 this results in another significant turbulent diffusion called mechanical dispersion nepf et al 1997 to describe this process nepf et al 1997 proposed a model right third item in eq 8 based on the random walk of fluid particles in vegetation total dispersion in vegetation can be described by vegetation resistance and vegetation density as follows 8 d t d l ε c d α d s 2 1 3 u m d s β 2 2 α u m d s 3 where ε 0 81 and β 2 are constants used by nepf 1999 and lu and dai 2017 and c d is the drag coefficient of rigid vegetation and was defined as 1 by bai and zeng 2019 v r in still water is the rising speed of bubbles which can be deduced from haberman 1954 9 v r 0 52 g d b 2 14 δ ρ d b where δ is the surface tension with its value assumed as 0 0732 n m and ρ is the density of water however when the flow velocity is high and the turbulence is intense the influencing factors of the upwards floating speed are much more complex than those in still water so the upwards floating speed of bubbles can be calculated by the following formula lian et al 2021 falvey 1980 10 v rt 1 α g π α d v 2000 2 0 52 g d b 2 14 δ ρ d b considering the above factors the formula can be changed into the following form 11

bubble size the relationship between bubble size and flow velocity and air flow rate is shown in fig 4 the bubble size is small at the bottom of the flume and large at the top of the flume but there is little difference from top to bottom d 5 changes between 2 13 and 3 28 mm d 10 changes between 2 19 and 3 26 mm and d 15 changes between 2 20 and 3 27 mm under different total air flow rates with the increase in the total air flow rate the bubble size also increases and the change in bubble diameter with air flow rate and r ed is very significant table 3 the relationship between bubble size and flow velocity is not obvious 3 2 dissolved oxygen transfer coefficient the relationship between the oxygen transfer coefficients k l a and u m and vegetation density is shown in fig 5 with the increase in vegetation density k l a increases significantly and the change in k l a with the increase in u m is not very significant table 3 k l a ranged from 4 08 to 11 97 h 1 at 25 vegetation densities ranged from 4 46 to 22 9 h 1 at 44 4 vegetation densities ranged from 5 2 to 24 68 h 1 at 100 vegetation densities and ranged from 5 76 to 28 95 h 1 at 400 vegetation densities the relationship between the oxygen transfer coefficients k l a and r ed and vegetation density is shown in fig 6 with the increase in vegetation density k l a increases significantly and the change in k l a with the increase in r ed is significantly correlated table 3 3 3 formula calculation result the simulation effect of eq 11 is shown in fig 7 the simulation effect of the formula is relatively good with r2 and mae reaching 0 9535 and 0 0857 respectively for the simulated and measured points under different vegetation densities we use different colours the measured data and simulated data are relatively close to the 1 1 line and the distribution is relatively uniform 4 discussion the bubble size increases with increasing air flow rate consistent with previous studies the larger the air flow rate of the same aerator is the larger the bubble diameter produced amaral et al 2018 bouaifi et al 2001 duran et al 2016 because bubble diameter is an important factor affecting oxygen mass transfer to improve oxygen mass transfer efficiency an aerator with suitable bubble diameter is used the bubble size does not change much with increasing flow velocity which is slightly different from previous studies fayolle et al 2010 gillot et al 2000 the reason may be that their research velocity changes directly from 0 to 0 42 or 0 44 m s fayolle et al 2010 gillot et al 2000 while our velocity changes between 0 10 and 0 26 m s and the small velocity range leads to little change in bubbles as the bubbles rise in the flume the size will increase slightly with the increase in the bubble size the floating resistance encountered will increase and the bubble rising speed will slowly decrease vermande et al 2007 the water pressure which decreases leads to a very small increase in the diameter simple calculation and treating air as a perfect gas shows that the reduction in diameter will be approximately 3 for 1 m of water hence this effect can be ignored if in a deeper river the diameter change due to the rise of bubbles can be deduced from the following formula vermande et al 2007 12 d z d a p atm ρ g a p atm ρ g z 3 where d z m and d a m are the respective sizes of the bubble at depth z and reference location a respectively and d a presents the corresponding bubble size p atm pa is the atmospheric pressure ρ kg m3 is the density of the liquid g m s2 is the gravitational constant and z and a are the respective depths z and a as measured from the liquid surface with the increase in the air flow rate the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen greatly increases which is also consistent with previous studies because the increase in air volume will also increase oxygen conduction behnisch et al 2018 amaral et al 2018 with the increase in flow velocity the mass coefficient will increase to a certain extent but the increase range is not large 9 03 20 17 cm s of flow velocity in this study which may be because the change in flow velocity is small compared with previous studies 0 to 42 cm s burris et al 2002 compared with 23 32 cm s of flow velocity in vermande et al 2007 the oxygen transfer coefficient ranges from 6 74 to 7 98 h 1 it does not vary greatly which is identical to our research the oxygen transfer coefficient is affected greatly by vegetation on the one hand vegetation will occupy part of the water body and increase the proportion of oxygen and water flow under the same air flow rate on the other hand vegetation will cause severe disturbance of water flow which acts on the bubble surface and increases the mass transfer of oxygen the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen in rigid vegetation channels is proposed by tseng and tinoco 2020 but the influence of bubble diameter on the oxygen mass transfer coefficient is not considered for the turbulence caused by vegetation we represent the influence of vegetation on oxygen diffusion by considering the turbulent diffusion coefficient of oxygen and the mechanical diffusion coefficient caused by vegetation the traditional model is improved and a good simulation effect is obtained our research focuses on parallel vegetated channels there are also staggered and randomly arranged vegetation forms in nature nepf et al 2007 liu et al 2008 ferreira et al 2009 schoneboom et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 the main difference between these layout forms and our research is the change in the vegetation drag force coefficient zhang et al 2018 showed that the drag force coefficient in a staggered rigid vegetation channel is greater than 1 tanino and nepf 2008 showed that the drag force coefficient is related to the reynolds number in a randomly distributed vegetated channel for different vegetation layout forms the drag force coefficient needs to be substituted into the formula of oxygen turbulent diffusion coefficient eq 8 then the oxygen mass transfer coefficients under different vegetation arrangements are calculated in addition to artificial aeration there are some environmental measures that can also increase the oxygen content of the river such as gabion weirs verma et al 2022 previous scholars have used a variety of methods natural fuzzy natural network and gaussian process regions to evaluate the oxygen mass transfer efficiency in gabion weir channels luxmi et al 2022b srinivas and tiwari 2022 tiwari et al 2022 the performance in estimating the oxygen aeration efficiency of gabion weirs was tested in future research we can combine this environmental measure with the study of vegetated channels to establish the oxygen mass transfer coefficient under this condition due to the existence of the turbulent diffusion coefficient and mechanical diffusion coefficient in vegetated channels the oxygen mass transfer coefficient is significantly higher than that in nonvegetated channels at which time the oxygen concentration in rivers is higher zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2017 with the increase in dissolved oxygen the activity of vegetation and microorganisms also increases and their removal of pollutants also increases liu et al 2017 chen et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 this study uses artificial vegetation which does not consume oxygen in real rivers the consumption of oxygen by vegetation and microorganisms should also be taken into account the results of this study are based on flume experiments in the laboratory the situation in the natural river is more complex including the uneven diameter shape and distribution of vegetation devi et al 2019 qu et al 2020 in this case the effect of oxygen transfer needs to be further discussed at the same time we should add this process of vegetation consumption into the water model in the future in the future more outdoor experiments need to be carried out for further research 5 conclusions based on the flume experiment the influence of the air flow rate on oxygen mass transfer in vegetated channels was studied and the influence of vegetation on bubble size and oxygen transfer coefficient was analysed the following results were obtained 1 the influence of the vegetation root system on bubble diameter is not significant the bubble from the bottom of the channel to the water surface shows a large trend from top to bottom and the bubble size does not change significantly with the flow velocity but increases with the increase in air flow rate 2 the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen is mainly related to bubble size flow velocity air flow rate and vegetation density with increasing aeration volume the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen increases rapidly and the change is not obvious with increasing flow velocity vegetation helps to increase the mass transfer of oxygen and the greater the vegetation density is the greater the oxygen transfer coefficient 3 the effect of vegetation is not considered in the traditional prediction formula of the oxygen transfer coefficient based on the experimental data and optimization software this study obtained the coefficient of the influence of vegetation on oxygen mass transfer and demonstrated high simulation accuracy it can provide help for the selection and layout of aeration systems in vegetated channel

2373,in the case of increasingly serious river pollution worldwide aeration in channels is an effective way to solve water pollution however traditional aeration research is aimed mainly at nonvegetated channels and there is relatively little research in vegetated channels aeration contributes to the absorption of pollutants by vegetation so studying the mass transfer of dissolved oxygen in vegetated channels is of great significance this paper innovatively studies the variation law and formula of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient in vegetated channels through an experiment and theoretical analysis through flume experiments this study examines the bubble size and oxygen transfer coefficient under different vegetation densities and establishes a formula to simulate the oxygen transfer coefficient under different vegetation densities the results show that vegetation has little effect on bubble diameter and the main effect on bubble diameter is the aeration rate the existence of vegetation significantly increases the mass transfer of oxygen and the higher the vegetation density is the greater the oxygen transfer coefficient transfer is at the same time a formula predicting the oxygen transfer coefficient is proven and the simulation results are good in which the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9535 and the mean absolute error mae reached 0 0857 this study provides a theoretical basis for the selection and layout of aeration systems in vegetated channels keywords vegetated channel aeration rate bubble diameter dissolved oxygen oxygen mass transfer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the increase in production and living activities an increasing number of pollutants are discharged into rivers resulting in serious deterioration of river water quality how to remove pollutants in rivers is also an important issue that people have been addressing wu et al 2015 shao et al 2014 artificial aeration is an effective way to increase the oxygen content in water the increase in dissolved oxygen content in water helps to improve the activity of microorganisms and aquatic plants and increases their degradation of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutants saeed and sun 2012 jia et al 2011 li et al 2014 kumar et al 2021a b aeration affects the hydraulic conditions in the channel and the characteristics of bubbles in aerated channels have been widely studied in the past wang et al 1987 studied the local gas holdup liquid velocity and reynolds stress of gas liquid two phase flow in a circulating water tank kitagawa et al 2004 studied the interaction between bubbles by particle image velocimetry piv and obtained the rising velocity of bubble groups by calculating the resistance coefficient based on the average diameter of bubbles revankar and ishii 1992 analysed the movement law of bubbles under turbulence by statistical methods and obtained experimental images of bubble growth at different speeds lee et al 2009 photographed the movement of bubbles in an oxidation ditch using high speed photography technology and obtained the bubble velocity under different aspect ratios loubière et al 2004 studied the effect of transverse flow on bubble formation in oxidation ditches by high speed photography and found that the rising deformation of bubbles is related to the change in liquid viscosity zoheidi et al 2017 provided the relationship between bubble size distribution and gas and liquid volume flow to solve the bubble size distribution of bubble slug transition flow in a narrow rectangular channel two group bubble fitting for transition flow was proposed by zhang et al 2022 there are many factors affecting oxygen mass transfer in water higbie provides a model of gas conduction into a stationary liquid over a short time period table 1 danckwerts 1951 first proposed a surface renewal sr model based on diffusive boundary layer dbl theory and the higbie 1935 model to estimate the interfacial gas transport rate on this basis tamburrino and gulliver 2002 and sanjou et al 2017 considered the influence of turbulence in the fluid on oxygen mass transfer based on the surface divergence sd model and gave the corresponding equations table 1 tseng and tinoco 2020 combined sr and sd models to define the oxygen mass transfer coefficient in the case of turbulence caused by vegetation in rigid vegetation channels table 1 however this model does not consider the influence of bubble size and aeration volume under aeration conditions among which the bubble diameter is an important factor affecting dissolved oxygen transmission burris et al 2002 chen and shao 2006 gave the representative bubble diameter in aerated water flow in shallow water bubbles rush to the water surface quickly breaking and splitting the water surface increasing the turbulence intensity of the water surface huang et al 2021 and increasing the contact area between the water surface and air which is also conducive to oxygen mass transfer on the water surface the diameter of bubbles is related to the aeration device and aeration efficiency and oxygen transfer efficiency increases with increasing aeration rate burris et al 2002 boog et al 2019 the flow rate is also an important factor affecting dissolved oxygen transfer fayolle et al 2010 demonstrated that the total oxygen transfer coefficient increased by 29 when the flow rate varied between 0 and 0 42 m s gillot et al 2000 showed that when the flow rate is 0 44 m s the oxygen transfer efficiency of the aerator is increased by 38 and the bubble diameter is reduced by 24 compared with static water vermande et al 2007 showed that the flow velocity changed the shape of bubbles and the oxygen transfer capacity and the formula of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient combined with the hi model is given table 1 terashima et al 2016 proposed a more accurate oxygen mass transfer coefficient model considering the ratio between gas and liquid table 1 numerical simulation is also often used in the study of oxygen mass transfer in aerated water flow wang and shen 2020 bodana et al 2020 kumar et al 2022b santarelli and fröhlich 2016 present two direct numerical simulations of bubble swarms in a vertical turbulent channel flow maleewong and hasadsri 2013 proposed mathematical models of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand in nonuniform open channels and this model can be used to study the transport process in one dimensional flow luxmi et al 2022a adapted the neuro fuzzy inference system anfis multilinear regression mlr and multi nonlinear regression mnlr to develop the model and predict aeration efficiency kumar et al 2022a used machine learning methods to estimate the oxygenation performance of various configurations of plunging hollow jet aerators vegetated channels have a great impact on water flow and affect the river s hydrological process aeration contributes to the growth of river vegetation and then affects the river s hydrological status therefore the study of aerated vegetation flow is very important to the hydrological process however the research is usually carried out in a flume or plexiglass bucket without vegetation or considers vegetation without considering bubbles for natural rivers there is usually a large amount of vegetation coverage and vegetation coverage will also affect hydrodynamic and bubble transport at the same time vegetation also has a large demand for dissolved oxygen it is necessary to study the migration of bubbles and the interfacial transfer of dissolved oxygen do in vegetated channels based on previous research this paper innovatively studies the law of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient in vegetated channels and proposes a solution formula of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient combined with flume experiments this paper explores the migration and distribution law of artificial aeration bubbles in a rigid vegetation flume and theoretically analyses and numerically simulates the migration process of the dissolved oxygen transfer process in the channel it can provide a theoretical basis for the application of artificial aeration in the vegetation channel 2 measured method 2 1 flume experiment the experiment was carried out in a circulating plexiglass flume in the laboratory fig 1 the flume is 10 m long 40 cm wide 50 cm high with a 0 0005 slope the water level in the flume is adjusted through the gate at the tail of the flume and the water flowing out of the flume is pumped into the high level tank through the water pump to circulate the water measuring instruments for velocity bubbles and dissolved oxygen are set in the water tank the velocity was measured by an ls300 a intelligent portable velocimeter with a propeller diameter of 12 mm the velocity measurement error is less than 1 5 and the sampling time is 1 min at the same time rigid vegetation with different densities was placed at the bottom of the flume and cylindrical wooden rods with a diameter of 8 mm were used to represent rigid vegetation the rigid vegetation was arranged on the flume bed an aeration device that can adjust the aeration rate was arranged in front of the flume according to changing the flume flow rate vegetation density and aeration capacity the experiment was divided into 36 treatments as shown in table 2 the vegetation density often ranges from 7 85 m2 to 625 m2 according to previous literature bai and xuan 2022 tang and knight 2009 li et al 2020 hui et al 2010 kim and stoesser 2011 van rooijen et al 2018 ferreira et al 2009 and 25 m2 44 4 m2 and 100 m2 were selected as vegetation densities in this study 2 2 measurement and prediction methods of dissolved oxygen the dissolved oxygen concentration was measured at six points using a dissolved oxygen probe ysi 57 which was located on six measuring points arranged along the water flow direction 5 cm below the water surface and 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m and 6 m away from the diffuser shown in fig 1 the sampling frequency was set to 5 s according to the method proposed by the american society of civil engineers stenstrom et al 2006 and the mean value of the six probes was used to obtain k l a assuming that the conduction mechanism of oxygen from the air water interface conforms to fick s law it can be expressed by the following formula 1 f c do t k l a c sat c do where c sat is the saturated dissolved oxygen concentration we can obtain k l a by solving the obtained curve using nonlinear regression analysis as shown in fig 2 the initial concentration of oxygen in the calculation is calculated as the 0 point and the oxygen concentration and saturated oxygen concentration are fitted by subtracting the initial value 2 c do c sat 1 e x p k l a t in the following the oxygen transfer coefficient is expressed under standard conditions 20 c 1013 hpa as follows he et al 2003 3 k l a k l a t 1 024 20 t where k l a t is the oxygen transfer coefficient at temperature t c and k l a h 1 is the oxygen transfer coefficient at 20 c 2 2 bubble size measurement the bubble diameter was determined from the image obtained by the high speed camera canon powershot g6 which was located on the right side of the water tank see fig 1 the lighting was provided by a 600 w laser lamp installed on the left side of the water tank the bubble size measurement scale was used to obtain the equivalent diameter of each bubble by matlab image analysis matlab identifies the boundary of the bubble by the major axis of the ellipsoidal bubble a i and the minor axis of the ellipsoidal bubble b i the bubble size is measured once every 5 cm which is 0 5 cm d 5 5 10 cm d 10 and 10 15 cm d 15 the determination of the sauter diameter requires size determination of a minimum of 100 bubbles fayolle et al 2006 the equivalent diameter d eq i is defined as the diameter of a spherical bubble with the same volume as the ellipsoid as shown below 4 d eq i a i 2 b i 3 where a i and b i are the major and minor axes of the ellipsoidal bubble i m respectively the sauter diameter d s required to determine the gas liquid interface area is calculated as follows 5 d s i 1 n d eq i 3 i 1 n d eq i 2 where d eq i is the equivalent diameter of bubble i and n is the total number of bubbles 2 3 modified prediction formula of the oxygen transfer coefficient considering the air and fluid volumes and bubble diameters that change with the density of rigid vegetation the basic form of the prediction formula of the oxygen transfer coefficient can be given by the following formula terashima et al 2016 cockx et al 2001 fayolle et al 2007 6 k l a 2 d l v r π d b 6 α g d b 1 α g first considering that vegetation will occupy the volume of water bodies the volume of water bodies in the channel needs to subtract the volume occupied by vegetation π α d 200 2 d b is calculated as the average d s along the water depth 7 a 6 α g d b 1 α g π α d v 2000 2 in the second part the vegetation in the river will significantly increase the disturbance in the flow and then affect the mass transfer of oxygen the diffusion coefficient of oxygen is divided into three parts the molecular diffusion coefficient turbulent diffusion coefficient and mechanical diffusion coefficient the turbulent diffusion coefficient is caused by the diffusion caused by the turbulence generated by the cylinder and the form is given by the right second item in eq 8 the velocity of flow is hindered by vegetation resulting in a reduction in the advection transport rate of fluid particles however due to the vegetation stem wake the propagation path of fluid particles in the vegetation zone will be extended as shown in fig 3 this results in another significant turbulent diffusion called mechanical dispersion nepf et al 1997 to describe this process nepf et al 1997 proposed a model right third item in eq 8 based on the random walk of fluid particles in vegetation total dispersion in vegetation can be described by vegetation resistance and vegetation density as follows 8 d t d l ε c d α d s 2 1 3 u m d s β 2 2 α u m d s 3 where ε 0 81 and β 2 are constants used by nepf 1999 and lu and dai 2017 and c d is the drag coefficient of rigid vegetation and was defined as 1 by bai and zeng 2019 v r in still water is the rising speed of bubbles which can be deduced from haberman 1954 9 v r 0 52 g d b 2 14 δ ρ d b where δ is the surface tension with its value assumed as 0 0732 n m and ρ is the density of water however when the flow velocity is high and the turbulence is intense the influencing factors of the upwards floating speed are much more complex than those in still water so the upwards floating speed of bubbles can be

good with r2 and mae reaching 0 9535 and 0 0857 respectively for the simulated and measured points under different vegetation densities we use different colours the measured data and simulated data are relatively close to the 1 1 line and the distribution is relatively uniform 4 discussion the bubble size increases with increasing air flow rate consistent with previous studies the larger the air

conclusions based on the flume experiment the influence of the air flow rate on oxygen mass transfer in vegetated channels was studied and the influence of vegetation on bubble size and oxygen transfer coefficient was analysed the following results were obtained 1 the influence of the vegetation root system on bubble diameter is not significant the bubble from the bottom of the channel to the water surface shows a large trend from top to bottom and the bubble size does not change significantly with the flow velocity but increases with the increase in air flow rate 2 the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen is mainly related to bubble size flow velocity air flow rate and vegetation density with increasing aeration volume the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen increases rapidly and the change is not obvious with increasing flow velocity vegetation helps to increase the mass transfer of oxygen and the greater the vegetation density is the greater the oxygen transfer coefficient 3 the effect of vegetation is not considered in the traditional prediction formula of the oxygen transfer coefficient based on the experimental data and optimization software this study obtained the coefficient of the influence of vegetation on oxygen mass transfer and demonstrated high simulation accuracy it can provide help for the selection and layout of aeration systems in vegetated channel

2374,discontinuities in flood frequency curves here referred to as flood divides hinder the estimation of rare floods in this paper we develop an automated methodology for the detection of flood divides from observations and models and apply it to a large set of case studies in the usa and germany we then assess the reliability of the physically based extreme value phev distribution of river flows to identify catchments that might experience a flood divide validating its results against observations this tool is suitable for the identification of flood divides with a high correct detection rate especially in the autumn and summer seasons it instead tends to indicate the emergence of flood divides not visible in the observations in spring and winter we examine possible reasons of this behavior finding them in the typical streamflow dynamics of the concerned case studies by means of a controlled experiment we also re evaluate detection capabilities of observations and phev after discarding the highest maxima for all cases where both empirical and theoretical estimates display flood divides phev mostly confirms its capability to detect a flood divide as observed in the original flood frequency curve even if the shortened one does not show it these findings prove its reliability for the identification of flood divides and set the premises for a deeper investigation of physiographic and hydroclimatic attributes controlling the emergence of discontinuities in flood frequency curves keywords extreme floods flood hazard flood divide flood frequency curves physically based framework detection method data availability data are freely accessible online as indicated in the acknowledgments 1 introduction despite considerable efforts to achieve reliable estimation of rare floods these events are still among the most common natural disasters wallemacq and house 2018 the evaluation of their hazard is however crucial for several applications including the design of hydraulic structures risk planning and mitigation and computation of premiums in the insurance industry appraisal of the flood hazard is especially difficult when the magnitude of the rarer floods can take values which are several times to orders of magnitude larger than commonly observed floods resulting in a marked uprise of the flood frequency curve beyond certain return periods rogger et al 2012 smith et al 2018 cognitive biases often lead to downplay the occurrence of such extreme events merz et al 2015 2021 although the scientific literature repeatedly signaled the pervasiveness of these behaviors terming them in various ways in fact heavy tailed distributions of floods farquharson et al 1992 bernardara et al 2008 villarini and smith 2010 inversions of concavity and step changes in flood magnitude frequency curves rogger et al 2012 guo et al 2014 basso et al 2016 and large values of the ratios between the maximum flood of record and the sample flood with a specified recurrence time smith et al 2018 and between empirical high flow percentiles mushtaq et al 2022 are all manifestations of a marked increase of the magnitude of the rarer floods highlighted by means of different approaches to further stress the common nature of all these phenomena in this study we favor none of the previous locutions and instead label them as flood divides the term was chosen to highlight the existence of a discharge threshold which marks the rise of progressively larger floods red square in fig 1d and thus distinguishes between common and increasingly extreme floods that may occur in river basins rogger et al 2012 investigated marked uprises i e discontinuities in the slope of flood frequency curves which they called step changes by leveraging information collected from field surveys in two small alpine catchments to calibrate a distributed deterministic rainfall runoff model they suggested that step changes occur when a threshold of the catchment storage capacity is exceeded and performed a synthetic experiment rogger et al 2013 to examine the effect of catchment storage thresholds and combined multiple controls e g the temporal variability of antecedent soil storage and the size of the saturated regions on the return period of the step change they also highlighted important implications of the presence or absence of flood divides for estimation and design purposes further stressing the need for a robust method to identify their possible occurrence in fact misidentifying the presence of flood divides may either lead to overestimation of rare floods if large recorded outliers are considered in the analyses or to their underestimation in case events larger than the flood divide were not yet recorded or are regarded as outliers guo et al 2014 basso et al 2016 instead linked different shapes of flood frequency curves and a marked growth of the magnitude of the rarer floods to the catchment water balance the former justified these features through the aridity index i e the ratio between mean annual potential evaporation and precipitation budyko 1974 showing that flood frequency curves characterized by increasing aridity index are steeper the latter explained them by means of the persistency index i e the ratio between mean catchment response time and runoff frequency botter et al 2013 and highlighted that the concavity of the flood frequency curve changes from downward to upward shifting from persistent to erratic regimes thus causing the emergence of flood divides smith et al 2018 computed the ratio between the maximum flood of record and the sample 10 year flood for thousands of gauges across the usa finding large values for a substantial amount of them different flood generating processes merz and blöschl 2003 berghuijs et al 2014 tarasova et al 2020 or mixtures of flood event types hirschboeck 1987 villarini and smith 2010 smith et al 2018 were indicated by other studies as possible causes of these marked increases of the magnitude of the rarer floods finally a rather common approach to study this phenomenon consists in evaluating the shape parameter of generalized extreme value distributions fitted to observed annual maximum series farquharson et al 1992 bernardara et al 2008 villarini and smith 2010 smith et al 2018 notwithstanding the drawbacks of such a parametric approach applied in association with limited records of annual maxima these studies highlighted the ubiquitous occurrence of flood divides and flood distributions characterized by thick upper tails as indicated by widespread positive values of the shape parameter moreover smith et al 2018 showed that the values of the shape parameter significantly increase with longer data records their findings thus suggest that uprises of flood frequency curves may be the norm rather than rare conditions pointing to the limited data record as the reason for the latter belief although former research hints at the ubiquitousness of flood divides in flood frequency curves and provide indications of their possible drivers a quantitative methodology to identify flood divides which is robust to sampling uncertainty and tested in a large set of case studies is still lacking the relevance of our study is thus twofold i we develop such a methodology for the detection of flood divides and evaluate their emergence across the us and germany in a large set of catchments with contrasting physio climatic features ii we examine the reliability of a process based stochastic framework for the estimation of flood frequency curves to detect flood divides and infer their occurrence benchmarking its results against observations 2 methodology and data 2 1 the physically based extreme value distribution of river flows 2 1 1 theoretical framework the physically based extreme value phev distribution of river flows is a parsimonious mechanistic stochastic formulation of flood frequency curves basso et al 2016 2021 that stems from a rigorous mathematical description of catchment scale daily soil moisture and streamflow dynamics in river basins laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2004 botter et al 2007 in this framework daily precipitation is represented as a marked poisson process with frequency λ p t 1 and exponentially distributed depths with average value α l soil moisture decreases due to evapotranspiration and is replenished by precipitation events that eventually trigger runoff pulses when an upper wetness threshold is crossed these pulses which feed water to a hydrologic storage are also a poisson process with frequency λ λ p t 1 and an exponential distribution of magnitudes with mean α l a non linear i e power law storage discharge relation with parameters a and k epitomizes the hydrological response of the catchment and encompasses the joint effect of different flow components brutsaert and nieber 1977 basso et al 2015b the above summarized mechanistic stochastic description of runoff generation processes allows for expressing the probability distributions of daily flows botter et al 2009 and peak flows i e local flow peaks occurring as a result of streamflow producing rainfall events as a function of a few physically meaningful parameters basso et al 2016 it also enables characterizing hydrologic regimes according to their typical streamflow dynamics which are summarized by the persistency index botter et al 2013 this is defined as the ratio between runoff frequency and the mean hydrograph recession rate i e λ k α λ a 1 basso et al 2016 deal et al 2018 an erratic regime lower values of the persistency index which is commonly found during dry seasons very hot humid seasons with intense evapotranspiration or in fast responding catchments is characterized by periods between the arrival of runoff producing rainfall events which are longer than the typical duration of flow pulses conversely a persistent regime higher values of the persistency index typically occurring in cold humid seasons and lowland catchments is characterized by frequent rainfall events and a rather constant water supply to the catchment considering that peak flows in a given reference period e g a season are poisson distributed and postulating their independence yield the probability distribution of flow maxima i e maximum values in a specified timespan the return period is finally obtained as the inverse of the exceedance cumulative probability of flow maxima thus providing an expression of the flood frequency curve which reads basso et al 2016 1 t r q 1 1 e x p λ τ d j q where τ t is the duration in days of the reference period used in the analyses d j q q p j q d q is the exceedance cumulative probability of peak flows p j is the probability density function of peak flows p j q c q 1 a exp λ q 1 a k 1 a q 2 a α k 2 a α and λ are the aforementioned parameters describing poisson distributed runoff events a and k are the parameters of the power law storage discharge relation and c is a normalization constant 2 1 2 parameter estimation the four parameters of phev α λ a k are rather straightforward to estimate at the catchment scale they are indeed directly derived from the observed time series of precipitation and streamflow α is computed as the mean daily rainfall depth in rainy days while λ frequency of streamflow producing rainfall as the ratio between the long term mean daily flow q and α botter et al 2007 the parameters of the power law storage discharge relation i e the recession exponent a and coefficient k are estimated through hydrograph recession analysis brutsaert and nieber 1977 following the approach proposed by biswal and marani 2010 finally the recession coefficient is not directly used as input in eq 1 but it is replaced by its maximum likelihood estimation on the observed seasonal flood frequency curve basso et al 2016 2 2 identification of flood divides to identify flood divides we start from the method proposed by rogger et al 2013 a flood divide is defined as the sharpest bend of the flood frequency curve here considered in terms of rescaled streamflow maxima i e seasonal maxima divided by the long term mean daily flow q as a function of the return period the latter represented in logarithmic scale we then develop a new methodology dedicated to its identification from both empirical estimates of the flood frequency curve obtained by means of weibull plotting position and models such as phev the resulting approach which can be employed without depending on subjective evaluation is detailed in the following 1 the curvature of the flood frequency curve of which we show an example in fig 1 is computed as l o g t r 1 l o g t r 2 3 2 where the apex indicates the derivation operation with respect to the rescaled streamflow for both the observations and phev in the former case we use the method developed by jianchun et al 1995 for computing derivatives in non equally spaced points while for phev we employ the python routine from the scipy library misc derivative which uses a central difference formula with spacing dx to compute the n t h derivative at a specified point 2 as the noise associated to computing the curvature on a discrete and rather sparse set of points seasonal maxima might lead to identification errors a heuristic filter is applied on the curvature calculated from observations only points on the right hand side of the last value of the curvature exceeding the range σ where σ indicates the standard deviation of the curvature itself are considered fig 1c 3 the mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 is applied on the values of the first derivatives on the left and right hand sides of each potential flood divide identified at point 2 to check if their distributions are statistically different at a significant level equals to 0 05 in other words if the slope of the curve significantly differs between the left and right hand side of the flood divide the effect size is then computed by means of the cohen s d cohen 1974 to evaluate if the magnitude of the difference is relevant sullivan and feinn 2012 for phev this step is performed on a dense set of values equally spaced with an interval δ q 0 05 up to a value of rescaled streamflow equal to 200 i e 200 times the long term average streamflow the relative increment of the slope between the left and right hand side of a potential phev flood divide is also evaluated within the observational range 4 we finally identify as flood divide the point for which the p value of the mann whitney test is the lowest provided that the cohen s d is greater than 0 4 moderate effect size gignac and szodorai 2016 lovakov and agadullina 2021 and the slope increment exceeds a value of 1 fig 1 visually exemplifies the application of the developed approach for flood divides detection to the flood frequency curve of the rott river at kinning bavaria id 18801005 in the summer season in fig 1a the flood frequency curve is represented with switched axes i e the logarithm of the return period is represented on the y axis whereas the rescaled seasonal maxima on the x axis as streamflow is the independent variable in eq 1 the red square in fig 1a d represents the selected flood divide i e the one associated to the lowest p value of the mann whitney u test applied to the distributions of the first derivatives fig 1b and fulfilling the additional criterion on the cohen s d we also show points that are initially analyzed as potential flood divides i e all the points with a mann whitney p value lower than 0 05 orange squares in fig 1a 2 3 datasets we use daily rainfall and streamflow time series from the model parameter estimation experiment dataset mopex data from 1948 to 2003 duan et al 2005 schaake et al 2006 and from germany 1951 2013 tarasova et al 2018 streamflow is measured at the gauging stations whose geographical coordinates are listed in table s1 whereas the corresponding rainfall records are spatially averaged values for the upstream drainage areas derived from gridded datasets we perform all analyses in a seasonal time frame spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november winter december to february to account for the seasonality of rainfall and runoff allamano et al 2011 baratti et al 2012 to assure that phev suitably represents the key processes of streamflow generation in the set of case studies we only consider catchments with low human impact weak or absent inter seasonal snow dynamics botter et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 and hydrograph recession properties which are independent of the peak flow basso et al 2021 similarly to previous studies merz et al 2020 we as well restrict our analysis to cases for which the root mean square error r m s e between the predicted and observed flood frequency curve is limited i e lower than 0 3 as a fairly accurate estimation of the flood frequency curve is a precondition to investigate if phev is able to correctly identify flood divides and whether their occurrence is affected by physio climatic catchment attributes figure s1 provides a summary of the performance of phev quantified by means of varied error metrics see supplementary material in reproducing observed flood frequency curves in the considered set of case studies this selection yields a set of 101 case studies i e catchment season combinations divided into 23 29 23 and 26 cases respectively in the spring summer autumn and winter seasons the median length of the considered data series is 54 years min 34 max 55 for the mopex and 58 years min 40 max 63 for the german case studies their catchment areas vary between 43 and 9052 km 2 median 865 km 2 the locations of their outlets are displayed in fig 2 3 results and discussion we apply the methodology for the identification of flood divides introduced in the previous section to each observed and analytic seasonal flood frequency curve thus allowing for evaluating the flood divide detection of phev against observations which we consider as benchmark fig 3 the bar plots in fig 3 show the percentages of case studies for which a flood divide is identified from both phev and the observational records true positives dark green color those which display a flood divide neither in the empirical nor in the analytic flood frequency curves true negatives light green the percentages of cases where a flood divide is detected from the observations but not from the analytical model false negatives red and those where the analytical model has foreseen the occurrence of a flood divide which is not confirmed by the available observations false positives orange the existence of both true positives and true negatives emphasizes the capability of phev to mimic varied observed shapes of flood frequency curves basso et al 2016 and to identify both the presence and the absence of a flood divide the bar plots in fig 3a and 3b differ for the criteria applied in the flood divide identification methodology in fig 3a only the controls on the p value of the mann whitney u test mentioned in section 2 2 are considered whereas the additional requirements on the effect size and slope increment are as well used in fig 3b true positives dark green prevail in the summer 18 cases and autumn 14 cases seasons of fig 3a amounting to about 60 of the cases false positives constitute instead a sizable share of the cases in spring 12 cases and winter 21 cases when more stringent requirements for the identification of flood divides are used by accounting for the mentioned additional criteria the percentage of true positives decreases fig 3b dark green respectively 3 11 12 and 1 cases in spring summer autumn and winter a few cases of those shifting category become true negatives for an overall number of 2 3 1 and 1 cases in spring summer autumn and winter indicating that the slope of the flood frequency curve does not substantially increases on the right hand side of the potential flood divide thus not representing a noteworthy hazard most of them however become false positives orange color in fig 3b respectively 18 15 9 and 24 cases in spring summer autumn and winter as the identified changes of the slope of the observed flood frequency curve are not substantial according to the limited amount of available observations whereas phev confirms the existence of a flood divide thanks to its evaluation in an unlimited number of points consistent results are also found when considering different significant levels for the mann whitney test the strictest the level the highest the share of cases shifting between true and false positives which once again points to the unfeasibility of detecting flood divides with confidence from plain observations the predominance of false positives in spring 18 cases and winter 24 cases orange color in fig 3b calls for further investigation of their causes we therefore hypothesize that phev by leveraging the embedded mechanistic description of hydro climatic dynamics taking place in watersheds and the information gained from analyzing daily rainfall and streamflow series might indicate the possible emergence of flood divides that are not yet displayed by the observed flood frequency curves in fact these empirical estimates are likely affected by small sizes of the samples of large events i e those on the right hand side of each potential flood divide see fig 1a and by the specific character of catchments which may have a more or less enhanced propensity to exhibit extreme floods and thus display them in a limited data record we then perform the following experiment to test this hypothesis we consider the set of true positives i e the 27 cases for which both phev as well as the observed flood frequency curve show a flood divide and retain only maxima with return periods below 5 years see an explanatory example in fig 4a where the maxima retained are represented by gray filled circles with blue contours in so doing we approximately discard in each case the largest ten points and their corresponding years of occurrence thereby fictitious flood frequency curves only comprising maxima with smaller magnitudes and return periods are created thus reproducing the conditions we hypothesized as possible reasons of the emergence of false positives we then apply the usual methodology for identifying flood divides on these fictitious flood frequency curves and the corresponding shortened data records phev detects a true flood divide i e true positives in 81 of the cases 22 case studies even when the largest points are removed whereas the observations only in 40 11 cases the maps in fig 4b and 4c summarize this result half circles are colored either in green if a flood divide is successfully detected from the shortened flood frequency curve or in red in the opposite case the left half of the circle depicts the detection capability of phev while the right side the results obtained from the observations it can be easily seen that most left halves of the circles are colored in green and most of the right ones are instead red thus indicating a high success rate of phev and a significantly lower one of observations in inferring the emergence of flood divides from shortened records a similar result is obtained by discarding maxima with return period greater than 10 years i e discarding about five six points instead of the highest ten when phev correctly detects 85 of true flood divides 23 cases in comparison to a correct detection rate from observations of 60 16 cases the outcome of this experiment strongly suggests that the detected false positives orange color in fig 3 indeed arise because of the statistical uncertainty of limited data records and the capability of phev to infer the occurrence of flood divides from short series rather than by its inability to correctly identify inflection points which were detected or not in the observed flood frequency curves a physical explanation of the reason why some observational series might not exhibit a flood divide which shall be expected is provided by considering typical streamflow dynamics occurring for distinct river flow regimes here characterized by means of the persistency index botter et al 2013 when streamflow values weakly oscillate around their mean persistent regimes the probability of occurrence of relatively large flows is very low and extreme events are unlikely to be captured by short time series on the contrary erratic regimes are composed of a sequence of high flows interspersed in between prolonged periods of low flows events which are several times i e order of magnitudes higher than the average flow are thus more likely to occur in these regimes basso et al 2015a in the context of this study false positives shall therefore mostly occur for persistent regimes as such large events enabling detection of flood divides from empirical flood frequency curves are less likely to have been observed during the available data record fig 5a displays the percentages of true positives dark green color from left to right 9 10 6 2 and 0 cases true negatives light green respectively 5 1 0 0 1 cases false negatives red 1 0 0 0 0 cases and false positives orange from left to right 6 9 14 18 and 19 cases for five ranges of the persistency index set so as to have an equal number of values 20 per bin the number of false positives consistently increases with the persistency index thus corroborating the above reasoning no clear patterns are instead observed with e g the drainage area and the average rainfall magnitude in the catchment figure s3 which are sometimes regarded as possible drivers of a marked increase of the magnitude of the rarer floods gaume 2006 villarini and smith 2010 a recent review of the current scientific knowledge merz et al 2022 suggests explanations for these results it signals an unlikely direct role of catchment size in determining tail behaviors of flood distributions as increasing drainage areas entail both spatial aggregation which may cause lighter tails and shifts of dominant processes e g different precipitation types and runoff generation mechanisms which may lead in the opposite direction it also reports robust evidences against a dominant role of rainfall characteristics for the emergence of heavy tailed flood distributions as runoff generation processes strongly modulate the hydrologic response on the contrary the available literature emphasizes the role of non linear hydrological responses and the catchment water balance for the emergence of heavy tails these are the two key processes described by phev and summarized by the persistency index which thus arises as a pivotal indicator of the possibility to detect flood divides from data records to further highlight the relation between typical river flow dynamics recapped in the persistency index and the occurrence of false positives we compare in fig 5b the cumulative distributions of the persistency index for true cases green and false positives orange the distributions clearly differ true cases feature more erratic regimes which facilitate their identification from data records whereas false positives mostly occur for persistent regimes this qualitative evaluation is validated by applying the 2 sample kolmogorov smirnov test which evaluates if two samples come from the same distribution null hypothesis to the sets of true and false positives the same is obtained by comparing true negatives and false positives we can reject the null hypothesis at the 0 01 significance level meaning that the two samples are drawn from different distributions and false positives are significantly more likely to occur for persistent regimes the same cannot be proved for the cumulative distributions of catchment area p value 0 44 and average rainfall magnitude p value 0 34 for the sets of true and false positives remarkably the seasons characterized by the larger portion of false positives are spring and winter during which regimes tend to be more persistent the physical explanation provided here of the different telling power of streamflow data for rivers characterized by distinctively different streamflow dynamics agrees with the results of previous research for example botter et al 2013 showed less variable streamflow distributions across years in erratic regimes compared to persistent ones which determines higher representativeness of their estimates in the former case for a given length of the data record smith et al 2018 also demonstrated that upper tail ratios grow with the length of data and for a given data length are larger i e flood divides are more often identified in arid and semiarid regions than in humid ones their results jointly suggest that given similarly long data records the typical erratic flow dynamics of drier areas enable more reliable characterization of the whole range of values possibly spanned by streamflow and of the presence or absence of flood divides according to the physical explanation provided above 4 concluding remarks in this work we examine the occurrence of marked uprises of flood frequency curves termed flood divides which are pivotal for a correct estimation of river flood hazard we develop a robust methodology to identify them from observational records and models and evaluate the capability of the physically based extreme value distribution of river flows phev to reliably detect flood divides results show that phev is consistently able to recognize the presence and absence of flood divides in a large set of case studies from the us and germany possible reasons for the occurrence of a sizeable number of false positives are investigated by accounting for both the statistical uncertainty of relatively short observational records and the typical hydro climatic variability of different river basins which affects the information content of these limited data series to this end we perform a controlled experiment in which we remove the highest flow maxima in the flood frequency curves of the true positive cases and repeat the flood divide detection analysis on the shorter series showing that phev can foresee the emergence of true flood divides in more than 80 of the cases even if the shortened observations do not display them the result supports claims of the dependability of flood divides initially classified as false positives an investigation of the intrinsic dynamics of streamflows in the set of true and false positives further elucidates the issue false positives are indeed preferentially found for more persistent regimes 87 of the false positives have persistency index above two as opposed to only 11 of true positives the overall number of cases with persistency index above two is 55 which by their nature rarely exhibit large extreme flow values the limited length of the available observed time series might be thus constraining the possibility to observe expected flood divides analogously to what occurs when we artificially reduce the size of the observational sample the present analysis performed on a wide set of catchments characterized by different hydroclimatic features reveals phev as a reliable tool to identify and foresee the occurrence of flood divides and consequently unveil the propensity of rivers to large floods the method is especially relevant in data scarce conditions although limitations linked to the domain of applicability of this tools exist and have been recalled in this work the study lays the foundations for a better comprehension of climate and landscape controls of observed marked rises of the magnitude of the

exceeded and performed a synthetic experiment rogger et al 2013 to examine the effect of catchment storage thresholds and combined multiple controls e g the temporal variability of antecedent soil storage and the size of the saturated regions on the return period of the step change they also highlighted important implications of the presence or absence of flood divides for estimation and design purposes further stressing the need for a robust method to identify their possible occurrence in fact misidentifying the presence of flood divides may either lead to overestimation of rare floods if large recorded outliers are considered in the analyses or to their underestimation in case events larger than the flood divide were not yet recorded or are regarded as outliers guo et al 2014 basso et al 2016 instead linked different shapes of flood frequency curves and a marked growth of the magnitude of the rarer floods to the catchment water balance the former justified these features through the aridity index i e the ratio between mean annual potential evaporation and precipitation budyko 1974 showing that flood frequency curves characterized by increasing aridity index are steeper the latter explained them by means of the persistency index i e the ratio between mean catchment response time and runoff frequency botter et al 2013 and highlighted that the concavity of the flood frequency curve changes from downward to upward shifting from persistent to erratic regimes thus causing the emergence of flood divides smith et al 2018 computed the ratio between the maximum flood of record and the sample 10 year flood for thousands of gauges across the usa finding large values for a substantial amount of them different flood generating processes merz and blöschl 2003 berghuijs et al 2014 tarasova et al 2020 or mixtures of flood event types hirschboeck 1987 villarini and smith 2010 smith et al 2018 were indicated by other studies as possible causes of these marked increases of the magnitude of the rarer floods finally a rather common approach to study this phenomenon consists in evaluating the shape parameter of generalized extreme value distributions fitted to observed annual maximum series farquharson et al 1992 bernardara et al 2008 villarini and smith 2010 smith et al 2018 notwithstanding the drawbacks of such a parametric approach applied in association with limited records of annual maxima these studies highlighted the ubiquitous occurrence of flood divides and flood distributions characterized by thick upper tails as indicated by widespread positive values of the shape parameter moreover smith et al 2018 showed that the values of the shape parameter significantly increase with longer data records their findings thus suggest that uprises of flood frequency curves may be the norm rather than rare conditions pointing to the limited data record as the reason for the latter belief although former research hints at the ubiquitousness of flood divides in flood frequency curves and provide indications of their possible drivers a quantitative methodology to identify flood divides which is robust to sampling uncertainty and tested in a large set of case studies is still lacking the relevance of our study is thus twofold i we develop such a methodology for the detection of flood divides and evaluate their emergence across the us and germany in a large set of catchments with contrasting physio climatic features ii we examine the reliability of a process based stochastic framework for the estimation of flood frequency curves to detect flood divides and infer their occurrence benchmarking its results against observations 2 methodology and data 2 1 the physically based extreme value distribution of river flows 2 1 1 theoretical framework the physically based extreme value phev distribution of river flows is a parsimonious mechanistic stochastic formulation of flood frequency curves basso et al 2016 2021 that stems from a rigorous mathematical description of catchment scale daily soil moisture and streamflow dynamics in river basins laio et al 2001 porporato et al 2004 botter et al 2007 in this framework daily precipitation is represented as a marked poisson process with frequency λ p t 1 and exponentially distributed depths with average value α l soil moisture decreases due to evapotranspiration and is replenished by precipitation events that eventually trigger runoff pulses when an upper wetness threshold is crossed these pulses which feed water to a hydrologic storage are also a poisson process with frequency λ λ p t 1 and an exponential distribution of magnitudes with mean α l a non linear i e power law storage discharge relation with parameters a and k epitomizes the hydrological response of the catchment and encompasses the joint effect of different flow components brutsaert and nieber 1977 basso et al 2015b the above summarized mechanistic stochastic description of runoff generation processes allows for expressing the probability distributions of daily flows botter et al 2009 and peak flows i e local flow peaks occurring as a result of streamflow producing rainfall events as a function of a few physically meaningful parameters basso et al 2016 it also enables characterizing hydrologic regimes according to their typical streamflow dynamics which are summarized by the persistency index botter et al 2013 this is defined as the ratio between runoff frequency and the mean hydrograph recession rate i e λ k α λ a 1 basso et al 2016 deal et al 2018 an erratic regime lower values of the persistency index which is commonly found during dry seasons very hot humid seasons with intense evapotranspiration or in fast responding catchments is characterized by periods between the arrival of runoff producing rainfall events which are longer than the typical duration of flow pulses conversely a persistent regime higher values of the persistency index typically occurring in cold humid seasons and lowland catchments is characterized by frequent rainfall events and a rather constant water supply to the catchment considering that peak flows in a given reference period e g a season are poisson distributed and postulating their independence yield the probability distribution of flow maxima i e maximum values in a specified timespan the return period is finally obtained as the inverse of the exceedance cumulative probability of flow maxima thus providing an expression of the flood frequency curve which reads basso et al 2016 1 t r q 1 1 e x p λ τ d j q where τ t is the duration in days of the reference period used in the analyses d j q q p j q d q is the exceedance cumulative probability of peak flows p j is the probability density function of peak flows p j q c q 1 a exp λ q 1 a k 1 a q 2 a α k 2 a α and λ are the aforementioned parameters describing poisson distributed runoff events a and k are the parameters of the power law storage discharge relation and c is a normalization constant 2 1 2 parameter estimation the four parameters of phev α λ a k are rather straightforward to estimate at the catchment scale they are indeed directly derived from the observed time series of precipitation and streamflow α is computed as the mean daily rainfall depth in rainy days while λ frequency of streamflow producing rainfall as the ratio between the long term mean daily flow q and α botter et al 2007 the parameters of the power law storage discharge relation i e the recession exponent a and coefficient k are estimated through hydrograph recession analysis brutsaert and nieber 1977 following the approach proposed by biswal and marani 2010 finally the recession coefficient is not directly used as input in eq 1 but it is replaced by its maximum likelihood estimation on the observed seasonal flood frequency curve basso et al 2016 2 2 identification of flood divides to identify flood divides we start from the method proposed by rogger et al 2013 a flood divide is defined as the sharpest bend of the flood frequency curve here considered in terms of rescaled streamflow maxima i e seasonal maxima divided by the long term mean daily flow q as a function of the return period the latter represented in logarithmic scale we then develop a new methodology dedicated to its identification from both empirical estimates of the flood frequency curve obtained by means of weibull plotting position and models such as phev the resulting approach which can be employed without depending on subjective evaluation is detailed in the following 1 the curvature of the flood frequency curve of which we show an example in fig 1 is computed as l o g t r 1 l o g t r 2 3 2 where the apex indicates the derivation operation with respect to the rescaled streamflow for both the observations and phev in the former case we use the method developed by jianchun et al 1995 for computing derivatives in non equally spaced points while for phev we employ the python routine from the scipy library misc derivative which uses a central difference formula with spacing dx to compute the n t h derivative at a specified point 2 as the noise associated to computing the curvature on a discrete and rather sparse set of points seasonal maxima might lead to identification errors a heuristic filter is applied on the curvature calculated from observations only points on the right hand side of the last value of the curvature exceeding the range σ where σ indicates the standard deviation of the curvature itself are considered fig 1c 3 the mann whitney u test mann and whitney 1947 is applied on the values of the first derivatives on the left and right hand sides of each potential flood divide identified at point 2 to check if their distributions are statistically different at a significant level equals to 0 05 in other words if the slope of the curve significantly differs between the left and right hand side of the flood divide the effect size is then computed by means of the cohen s d cohen 1974 to evaluate if the magnitude of the difference is relevant sullivan and feinn 2012 for phev this step is performed on a dense set of values equally spaced with an interval δ q 0 05 up to a value of rescaled streamflow equal to 200 i e 200 times the long term average streamflow the relative increment of the slope between the left and right hand side of a potential phev flood divide is also evaluated within the observational range 4 we finally identify as flood divide the point for which the p value of the mann whitney test is the lowest provided that the cohen s d is greater than 0 4 moderate effect size gignac and szodorai 2016 lovakov and agadullina 2021 and the slope increment exceeds a value of 1 fig 1 visually exemplifies the application of the developed approach for flood divides detection to the flood frequency curve of the rott river at kinning bavaria id 18801005 in the summer season in fig 1a the flood frequency curve is represented with switched axes i e the logarithm of the return period is represented on the y axis whereas the rescaled seasonal maxima on the x axis as streamflow is the independent variable in eq 1 the red square in fig 1a d represents the selected flood divide i e the one associated to the lowest p value of the mann whitney u test applied to the distributions of the first derivatives fig 1b and fulfilling the additional criterion on the cohen s d we also show points that are initially analyzed as potential flood divides i e all the points with a mann whitney p value lower than 0 05 orange squares in fig 1a 2 3 datasets we use daily rainfall and streamflow time series from the model parameter estimation experiment dataset mopex data from 1948 to 2003 duan et al 2005 schaake et al 2006 and from germany 1951 2013 tarasova et al 2018 streamflow is measured at the gauging stations whose geographical coordinates are listed in table s1 whereas the corresponding rainfall records are spatially averaged values for the upstream drainage areas derived from gridded datasets we perform all analyses in a seasonal time frame spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november winter december to february to account for the seasonality of rainfall and runoff allamano et al 2011 baratti et al 2012 to assure that phev suitably represents the key processes of streamflow generation in the set of case studies we only consider catchments with low human impact weak or absent inter seasonal snow dynamics botter et al 2013 wang and hejazi 2011 and hydrograph recession properties which are independent of the peak flow basso et al 2021 similarly to previous studies merz et al 2020 we as well restrict our analysis to cases for which the root mean square error r m s e between the predicted and observed flood frequency curve is limited i e lower than 0 3 as a fairly accurate estimation of the flood frequency curve is a precondition to investigate if phev is able to correctly identify flood divides and whether their occurrence is affected by physio climatic catchment attributes figure s1 provides a summary of the performance of phev quantified by means of varied error metrics see supplementary material in reproducing observed flood frequency curves in the considered set of case studies this selection yields a set of 101 case studies i e catchment season combinations divided into 23 29 23 and 26 cases respectively in the spring summer autumn and winter seasons the median length of the considered data series is 54 years min 34 max 55 for the mopex and 58 years min 40 max 63 for the german case studies their catchment areas vary between 43 and 9052 km 2 median 865 km 2 the locations of their outlets are displayed in fig 2 3 results and discussion we apply the methodology for the identification of flood divides introduced in the previous section to each observed and analytic seasonal flood frequency curve thus allowing for evaluating the flood divide detection of phev against observations which we consider as benchmark fig 3 the bar plots in fig 3 show the percentages of case studies for which a flood divide is identified from both phev and the observational records true positives dark green color those which display a flood divide neither in the empirical nor in the analytic flood frequency curves true negatives light green the percentages of cases where a flood divide is detected from the observations but not from the analytical model false negatives red and those where the analytical model has foreseen the occurrence of a flood divide which is not confirmed by the available observations false positives orange the existence of both true positives and true negatives emphasizes the capability of phev to mimic varied observed shapes of flood frequency curves basso et al 2016 and to identify both the presence and the absence of a flood divide the bar plots in fig 3a and 3b differ for the criteria applied in the flood divide identification methodology in fig 3a only the controls on the p value of the mann whitney u test mentioned in section 2 2 are considered whereas the additional requirements on the effect size and slope increment are as well used in fig 3b true positives dark green prevail in the summer 18 cases and autumn 14 cases seasons of fig 3a amounting to about 60 of the cases false positives constitute instead a sizable share of the cases in spring 12 cases and winter 21 cases when more stringent requirements for the identification of flood divides are used by accounting for the mentioned additional criteria the percentage of true positives decreases fig 3b dark green respectively 3 11 12 and 1 cases in spring summer autumn and winter a few cases of those shifting category become true negatives for an overall number of 2 3 1 and 1 cases in spring summer autumn and winter indicating that the slope of the flood frequency curve does not substantially increases on the right hand side of the potential flood divide thus not representing a noteworthy hazard most of them however become false positives orange color in fig 3b respectively 18 15 9 and 24 cases in spring summer autumn and winter as the identified changes of the slope of the observed flood frequency curve are not substantial according to the limited amount of available observations whereas phev confirms the existence of a flood divide thanks to its evaluation in an unlimited number of points consistent results are also found when considering different significant levels for the mann whitney test the strictest the level the highest the share of cases shifting between true and false positives which once again points to the unfeasibility of detecting flood divides with confidence from plain observations the predominance of false positives in spring 18 cases and winter 24 cases orange color in fig 3b calls for further investigation of their causes we therefore hypothesize that phev by leveraging the embedded mechanistic description of hydro climatic dynamics taking place in watersheds and the information gained from analyzing daily rainfall and streamflow series might indicate the possible emergence of flood divides that are not yet displayed by the observed flood frequency curves in fact these empirical estimates are likely affected by small sizes of the samples of large events i e those on the right hand side of each potential flood divide see fig 1a and by the specific character of catchments which may have a more or less enhanced propensity to exhibit extreme floods and thus display them in a limited data record we then perform the following experiment to test this hypothesis we consider the set of true positives i e the 27 cases for which both phev as well as the observed flood frequency curve show a flood divide and retain only maxima with return periods below 5 years see an explanatory example in fig 4a where the maxima retained are represented by gray filled circles with blue contours in so doing we approximately discard in each case the largest ten points and their corresponding years of occurrence thereby fictitious flood frequency curves only comprising maxima with smaller magnitudes and return periods are created thus reproducing the conditions we hypothesized as possible reasons of the emergence of false positives we then apply the usual methodology for identifying flood divides on these fictitious flood frequency curves and the corresponding shortened data records phev detects a true flood divide i e true positives in 81 of the cases 22 case studies even when the largest points are removed whereas the observations only in 40 11 cases the maps in fig 4b and 4c summarize this result half circles are colored either in green if a flood divide is successfully detected from the shortened flood frequency curve or in red in the opposite case the left half of the circle depicts the detection capability of phev while the right side the results obtained from the observations it can be easily seen that most left halves of the circles are colored in green and most of the right ones are instead red thus indicating a high success rate of phev and a significantly lower one of observations in inferring the emergence of flood divides from shortened records a similar result is obtained by discarding maxima with return period greater than 10 years i e discarding about five six points instead of the highest ten when phev correctly detects 85 of true flood divides 23 cases in comparison to a correct detection rate from observations of 60 16 cases the outcome of this experiment strongly suggests that the detected false positives orange color in fig 3 indeed arise because of the statistical uncertainty of limited data records and the capability of phev to infer the occurrence of flood divides from short series rather than by its inability to correctly identify inflection points which were detected or not in the observed flood frequency curves a physical explanation of the reason why some observational series might not exhibit a flood divide which shall be expected is provided by considering typical streamflow dynamics occurring for distinct river flow regimes here characterized by means of the persistency index botter et al 2013 when streamflow values weakly oscillate around their mean persistent regimes the probability of occurrence of relatively large flows is very low and extreme events are unlikely to be captured by short time series on the contrary erratic regimes are composed of a sequence of high flows interspersed in between prolonged periods of low flows events which are several times i e order of magnitudes higher than the average flow are thus more likely to occur in these regimes basso et al 2015a in the context of this study false positives shall therefore mostly occur for persistent regimes as such large events enabling detection of flood divides from empirical flood frequency curves are less likely to have been observed during the available data record fig 5a displays the percentages of true positives dark green color from left to right 9 10 6 2 and 0 cases true negatives light green respectively 5 1 0 0 1 cases false negatives red 1 0 0 0 0 cases and false positives orange from left to right 6 9 14 18 and 19 cases for five ranges of the persistency index set so as to have an equal number of values 20 per bin the number of false positives consistently increases with the persistency index thus corroborating the above reasoning no clear patterns are instead observed with e g the drainage area and the average rainfall magnitude in the catchment figure s3 which are sometimes regarded as possible drivers of a marked increase of the magnitude of the rarer floods gaume 2006 villarini and smith 2010 a recent review of the current scientific knowledge merz et al 2022 suggests explanations for these results it signals an unlikely direct role of catchment size in determining tail behaviors of flood distributions as increasing drainage areas entail both spatial aggregation which may cause lighter tails and shifts of dominant processes e g different precipitation types and runoff generation mechanisms which may lead in the opposite direction it also reports robust evidences against a dominant role of rainfall characteristics for the emergence of heavy tailed flood distributions as runoff generation processes strongly modulate the hydrologic response on the contrary the available literature emphasizes the role of non linear hydrological responses and the catchment water balance for the emergence of heavy tails these are the two key processes described by phev and summarized by the persistency index which thus arises as a pivotal indicator of the possibility to detect flood divides from data records to further highlight the relation between typical river flow dynamics recapped in the persistency index and the occurrence of false positives we compare in fig 5b the cumulative distributions of the persistency index for true cases green and false positives orange the distributions clearly differ true cases feature more erratic regimes which facilitate their identification from data records whereas false positives mostly occur for persistent regimes this qualitative evaluation is validated by applying the 2 sample kolmogorov smirnov test which evaluates if two samples come from the same distribution null hypothesis to the sets of true and false positives the same is obtained by comparing true negatives and false positives we can reject the null hypothesis at the 0 01 significance level meaning that the two samples are drawn from different distributions and false positives are significantly more likely to occur for persistent regimes the same cannot be proved for the cumulative distributions of catchment area p value 0 44 and average rainfall magnitude p value 0 34 for the sets of true and false positives remarkably the seasons characterized by the larger portion of false positives are spring and winter during which regimes tend to be more persistent the physical explanation provided here of the different telling power of streamflow data for rivers characterized by distinctively different streamflow dynamics agrees with the results of previous research for example botter et al 2013 showed less variable streamflow distributions across years in erratic regimes compared to persistent ones which determines higher representativeness of their estimates in the former case for a given length of the data record smith et al 2018 also demonstrated that upper tail ratios grow with the length of data and for a given data length are larger i e flood divides are more often identified in arid and semiarid regions than in humid ones their results jointly suggest that given similarly long data records the typical erratic flow dynamics of drier areas enable more reliable characterization of the whole range of values possibly spanned by streamflow and of the presence or absence of flood divides according to the physical explanation provided above 4 concluding remarks in this work we examine the occurrence of marked uprises of flood frequency curves termed flood divides which are pivotal for a correct estimation of river flood hazard we develop a robust methodology to identify them from observational records and models and evaluate the capability of the physically based extreme value distribution of river flows phev to reliably detect flood divides results show that phev is consistently able to recognize the presence and absence of flood divides in a large set of case studies from the us and germany possible reasons for the occurrence of a sizeable number of false positives are investigated by accounting for both the statistical uncertainty of relatively short observational records and the typical hydro climatic variability of different river basins which affects the information content of these limited data series to this end we perform a controlled experiment in which we remove the highest flow maxima in the flood frequency curves of the true positive cases and repeat the flood divide detection analysis on the shorter series showing that phev can foresee the emergence of true flood divides in more than 80 of the cases even if the shortened observations do not display them the result supports claims of the dependability of flood divides initially classified as false positives an investigation of the intrinsic dynamics of streamflows in the set of true and false positives further elucidates the issue false positives are indeed preferentially found for more persistent regimes 87 of the false positives have persistency index above two as opposed to only 11 of true positives the overall number of cases with persistency index above two is 55 which by their nature rarely exhibit large extreme flow values the limited length of the available observed time series might be thus constraining the possibility to observe expected flood divides analogously to what occurs when we artificially reduce the size of the observational sample the present analysis performed on a wide set of catchments characterized by different hydroclimatic features reveals phev as a reliable tool to identify and foresee the occurrence of flood divides and consequently unveil the propensity of rivers to large floods the method is especially relevant in data scarce conditions although limitations linked to the domain of applicability of this tools exist and have been recalled in this work the study lays the foundations for a better comprehension of climate and landscape controls of observed marked rises of the magnitude of the
