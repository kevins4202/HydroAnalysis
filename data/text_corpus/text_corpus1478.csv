forestry university yangling shaanxi 712100 china this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of anne catherine favre associate editor probabilistic modelling of drought events is a significant aspect of water resources management and planning in this study popularly applied and several relatively new bivariate archimedean copulas were employed to derive regional and spatial based copula models to appraise drought risk in mainland china over 1961 2013 drought duration dd severity ds and peak dp as indicated by standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei were extracted according to the run theory and fitted with suitable marginal distributions the maximum likelihood estimation mle and curve fitting method cfm were used to estimate the copula parameters of nineteen bivariate archimedean copulas drought probabilities and return periods were analysed based on appropriate bivariate copula in sub region i vii and entire mainland china the goodness of fit tests as indicated by the cfm showed that copula nn19 in sub regions iii iv v vi and mainland china nn20 in sub region i and nn13 in sub region vii are the best for modeling drought variables bivariate drought probability across mainland china is relatively high and the highest drought probabilities are found mainly in the northwestern and southwestern china besides the result also showed that different sub regions might suffer varying drought risks the drought risks as observed in sub region iii vi and vii are significantly greater than other sub regions higher probability of droughts of longer durations in the sub regions also corresponds to shorter return periods with greater drought severity these results may imply tremendous challenges for the water resources management in different sub regions particularly the northwestern and southwestern china keywords drought spei archimedean copula drought probability drought return period water resources 1 introduction drought occurs when precipitation p is significantly below normal thereby resulting in numerous meteorological agricultural hydrological socio economic and stream health impacts sheffield and wood 2012 esfahanian et al 2016 drought affected areas have exceedingly increased over the past 50 years in china due to spatiotemporal variation in p and temperature t yang et al 2013 leng et al 2015 chang et al 2016 in the 2000s extreme winter spring droughts events occurred in southwest china from august 2009 to may 2010 lu et al 2011 2012 zhang et al 2012 yang et al 2013 while spring summer drought happened in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in 2011 lu et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 chang et al 2016 since 1990s various drought damages have resulted to economic losses in excess of us 12 billion xu et al 2015 qin et al 2015 chang et al 2016 therefore the understanding of drought risk is imperative in planning and efficient drought mitigation in china drought exhibits stochastic characteristics and the best approach to monitor and assess it is through probability and stochastic theories shiau 2006 in univariate probabilistic analysis drought variables are investigated separately cancelliere and salas 2004 serinaldi et al 2009 knowing that droughts are multiplex phenomena tsakiris et al 2016 xu et al 2015 univariate analysis cannot give an exhaustive appraisal of droughts and account for significant correlations among their characteristics genest and favre 2007 liu et al 2015 ayantobo et al 2017 therefore many efforts salas et al 2005 huang et al 2014a b zhang et al 2015a have been devoted to examining drought risk on multivariate probability levels to give a more outright drought characterization shiau et al 2007 mishra and singh 2010 among these methods the copula function initially introduced by sklar 1959 has been extensively employed in multivariate analysis because they can overcome major drawbacks inherent in the traditional methods salvadori and de michele 2015 zhang et al 2015a she et al 2016 hence the construction of joint distributions only reckons with the correlated pair of random drought variables shiau et al 2007 zhang and singh 2007 kao and govindaraju 2010 copulas have different families which includes 1 elliptical normal and student t 2 archimedean clayton gumbel frank and ali mikhail haq 3 extreme value gumbel husler reiss galambos tawn and t ev and 4 other families plackett and farlie gumbel morgenstern mirabbasi et al 2012 lee et al 2013 xu et al 2015 the nested archimedean copulas vine copula garch model and entropy copula have also been studied joe 1997 gräler et al 2013 grothe and hofert 2015 fan and qian 2016 recently copula has been broadly used in the analysis of multivariate flood frequency shiau et al 2006 kao and govindaraju 2007 fan and qian 2016 rainfall frequency zhang and singh 2007 groundwater parameters estimation bardossy 2006 remote sensed rainfall analysis aghakouchak et al 2010 and other multivariate extreme issues salvadori et al 2007 salvadori and de michele 2010 nested archimedean copulas have been used in sampling algorithms mcneil 2008 grothe and hofert 2015 and in the development of nacopula r package hofert and maechler 2011 gräler et al 2013 use vine copula garch model to construct a joint probability distribution for flood characteristics while bedford et al 2015 proposed a minimum informative pair copula using the vine structure to approximate any given multivariate copula to any required degree of approximation wong et al 2013 applied copulas to investigate the cross dependence between meteorological and hydrological drought while zhang et al 2015a used the bayesian approach to evaluate the uncertainties of copula based analysis of hydrological droughts as a result of marginal distribution and copulas selection for analysis of drought variables many studies have reported both bivariate shiau et al 2007 shiau and modarres 2009 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015b tsakiris et al 2016 as well as multivariate serinaldi et al 2009 song and singh 2010 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 drought frequency using copula functions lee et al 2013 utilized gumbel and frank copulas at four stations in canada and iran to fit drought variables in china xiao et al 2012 used the gumbel hougaard clayton and frank copulas to study the spatial evolution of drought in the pearl river basin while zhang et al 2017 used copula for concurrent hydrological drought in the poyang lake catchment river system other copula based drought related studies huang et al 2014a b zhao et al 2015 in wei river basin and guanzhong plain have also been reported results of these studies demonstrate that copulas are robust for drought analysis however there are more studies focused on station based and river basins than regional analysis while drought is often perceived as a regional event the regional frequency analysis of drought appears more significant in practice the multivariate l moments adjusted charge system search and fuzzy c means algorithm have been used with copula functions for regional analysis zhang et al 2015a abdi et al 2016 2017a b c to increase the accuracy of the multivariate l moment approach abdi et al 2017b proposed the optimization based and rank based method galambos bivariate copula functions were employed for regional drought analysis of sharafkhaneh in the northwest of iran mirabbasi et al 2012 in china yang et al 2010 studied the regional drought of pearl river basin using bivariate copulas xu et al 2015 used copulas to develop a regional drought model by considering drought duration severity and affected areas hao et al 2017 studied multivariate drought frequency in southwest china while zhang et al 2015b used gumbel copula for regional drought analysis in china since china has a diverse climate with large expanse and intricate topography zhai et al 2010a the identification of an appropriate copula function to capture the complexity and diversity of drought in the different climate is one of the significant limitations for previous studies although zhang et al 2015b compared three copulas for regional drought frequency in china however we improved the analysis firstly since the choice of copulas could be different from one climatic region to another khedun et al 2013 we tested the performances of nineteen bivariate archimedean copulas nelsen 1999 most of which have not been explored in literature for regional drought analysis secondly we estimated regional conditional probabilities and return periods which were not considered in the study therefore the scientific motivations behind this study reside in the appraisal of nineteen bivariate archimedean copula functions and the selection of the best fitted one for each climatic sub region in mainland china to objectively and comprehensively examine bivariate drought characteristics numerous drought indices have been developed globally to define drought characteristics examples of such indices their strengths weakness and limitations can be found in review studies by mishra and singh 2010 and zargar et al 2011 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been widely applied in various copula based drought related studies in china liu et al 2015 xu et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b hao et al 2017 mainly because it combines changes in evapotranspiration demand with the multi temporal nature vicente serrano et al 2010 our objectives are 1 to identify station based and regional drought duration dd severity ds and peak dp computed on spei 6 month timescale between 1961 and 2013 2 to compare the efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimation mle and curve fitting method cfm in copula parameter estimation 3 to appraise the performance of nineteen bivariate archimedean copulas and 4 to compute regional and spatial probabilistic drought properties bivariate probabilities and return periods conditional bivariate probabilities and return periods using the best fitted copula function results of this study will provide a framework for drought prediction and prevention in different climatic sub regions of mainland china 2 study area and data the climate zones of china fluctuate significantly from one sub region to another due to its enormous expanse and complex topography zhai et al 2010a the western and northern china is influenced by dry climate while semi humid and humid prevail over the eastern china wu et al 2011 based on topography and climate the entire mainland china was divided into seven sub regions zhao 1983 ayantobo et al 2017 including northeast humid semi humid warm region sub region i 72 stations north china humid semi humid temperate zone sub region ii 104 stations central and southern china humid subtropical zone sub region iii 165 stations south china humid tropical zone sub region iv 57 stations inner mongolia steppe zone sub region v 44 stations northwest desert areas sub region vi 61 stations and qinghai tibet plateau sub region vii 49 stations sub regions i iv v vi and vii are referred to the eastern monsoon northwestern and qinghai tibet plateau respectively the monthly fluctuation in p and t are evident since most of china s terrain is positioned within the east asian monsoon climatic belt wu et al 2011 the daily and monthly weather data from 552 national basic meteorological stations in china over 1961 2013 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing network the meteorological stations are not uniformly distributed as more stations are positioned in the east than western regions especially the qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 the quality and reliability of the climatic data were cross examined using nonparametric tests according to helsel and hirsch 1992 kendall autocorrelation test mann kendall trend test and mann whitney homogeneity tests for mean and variance were used to test for randomness homogeneity and absence of trends the results indicated that randomness and stationarity of the weather data were fixed between the critical points 5 statistical significance level 3 methods 3 1 drought index and drought event identification the spei describes the degree of deviation of regional dry and wet conditions from climatological mean ones by standardizing the difference between et o and p in this study spei is estimated for each station and seven sub regions using six month timescale denoted by spei 6 the six month timescale has been adopted because a short timescale would fail to detect longer periods of abnormal wet dry conditions while redundant information is likely to be included if a very long timescale is considered spei 6 is most useful for describing the shallow soil moisture available to crops reddy and singh 2014 abdi et al 2016 following the algorithm of vicente serrano et al 2010 spei 6 is calculated using the estimated monthly et o and p from each station and sub regions 3 1 1 potential evapotranspiration et o penman equation is applied to calculate et o penman 1948 used energy balance in combination with mass transfer to obtain an equation to evaluate the evapotranspiration from an open water surface from a standard climatic condition it can be given as shuttleworth

is cumulated from the e 0 values of 12 months 3 1 2 spei the differences between p and eto di at each station and sub region for ith month were calculated and aggregated at 6 month then the pdf f x of three parameter log logistic distribution is employed to consider the negative di as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 6 f x 1 α x λ β 1 where d i values ranged as d i λ the spei 6 can then be derived as the standardized values of f x in the wake of classical approximation abramowitz and stegun 1965 7 p r 1 f x where p r is probability of exceeding a determination value of d i 8 spei w c 0

432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 respectively the categorization standard of dryness wetness levels by spei is given in table 1 according to fig 2 a run is described as the segment of time series xt in which spei 6 are either beneath i e negative run or over i e positive run a chosen threshold level of x 0 0 yevjevich and ingenieur 1967 shiau 2006 mishra and singh 2010 so drought events are identified and drought variables i e dd ds dp dn and di extracted using the calculated spei 6 for each station and sub region see ayantobo et al 2017 for details 3 2 selection of appropriate marginal distribution for univariate analyses many marginal distributions have been recommended for fitting dd ds and dp shiau et al 2007 shiau and modarres 2009 however as shown in table 3 we adopted exponential weibull generalized pareto and gamma distributions as appropriate marginal distributions for fitting drought variables in different sub regions of mainland china to obtain these distributions ayantobo et al 2017 compared the suitability of several marginal distributions including exponential gamma weibull gaussian log normal logistic generalized pareto generalized extreme value and pearson type iii for regional drought analysis considering dd ds and dp in mainland china although all the distributions pass the kolmogorov smirnov ks test at the 99 a 0 01 significant level however the principle that the threshold of ks value should be as small as possible to retain the largest sample was employed abdi et al 2016 the fitted distributions were compared against the empirical non exceedance probabilities estimated by gringorten position plotting formula gringorten 1963 9 p k k 0 44 n 0 12 where pk is probability of the kth value k is the kth smallest value in the dataset arranged in ascending order and n is the sample size the cumulative distribution functions of exponential weibull generalized pareto and gamma are presented in eqs 10 13 respectively 10 f x 1 exp x β α 11 f x 1 exp x α β 12 f x 1 1 β x λ α 1 β 13 f x 0 x x α 1 β α γ α exp x β dx using the observed data x the mle is used to estimate the parameters of f x next proper copula functions are needed to integrate the dd ds and dp 3 3 theoretical aspects of copula functions sklar 1959 proposed a theorem which states that if two random variables x and y have their arbitrary marginal distribution functions f x x and f y y respectively then there is a copula c that links these two marginal distributions to form a joint distribution function f x y x y as follows nelsen 2006 14 f x y x y c f x x f y y further if the marginal distributions f x x and f y y are continuous the copula function c is unique and the joint probability density function can then be given as 15 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where f x x f y y and c are the density functions of f x x f y y and c respectively represented as 16 c u v 2 c u v u v where u and v are the univariate cdf 3 3 1 archimedean copulas bivariate archimedean copulas are more handy easy to build and have been broadly applied zhang and singh 2007 zhang et al 2012 according to nelsen 2006 one parameter bivariate archimedean copula can be expressed as 17 c θ x y φ θ t 1 φ θ t x φ θ t y for x 0 y 1 where φ θ t 1 0 continuous convex and factually reducing function such that φ θ t 1 0 φ θ t x 0 φ θ t x 0 for all 0 x 1 θ is is hidden in the φ θ t the θ helps to measures the extent of relationship between x and y many kinds of one parameter bivariate archimedean copulas exist nelsen 1999 a few of them have common names e g the first third fourth and fifth are referred to as clayton ali mikhail haq gumbel hougaard and frank s copula respectively but most of them don t therefore for simplicity we refer to them by their number in nelsen s table a very concise description of the bivariate copula functions as well as the corresponding c u v θ r and φ θ t used in this study are given in table 4 joe 1997 nelsen 2006 3 3 2 copulas parameter estimation the parameter θ of the bivariate copula is determined using two methods i e mle and cfm and requires the parametric approximation of the marginal distributions genest et al 1995 joe 1997 zhang and singh 2007 if u and u indicate random samples and arbitrary vectors respectively then the mle of the parameter θ n mle estimated from u u i j of size n is estimated by numerically maximizing 18 l u θ i 1 n log c u i 1 u i 2 θ where l denotes the log likelihood function θ θ r p p 1 is the parameter space of copula c u i u i 1 u i 2 t 0 1 2 is the i th sample from the copula and c is the copula s density parameterized by θ as 19 c u 1 u 2 θ c u 1 u 2 θ u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 0 1 the estimator is thus written as 20 θ n mle u arg max θ θ l u θ according to genest et al 1995 the mle is consistent and asymptotically normal under some regularity conditions analogous to the cfm method parameter θ is the minimum standards of squared residuals and calculated as follows 21 cfm 1 n i 1 n x c i x 0 i 2 where x c i represents ith calculated value x 0 i represents ith observed value and n is the sample size 3 3 3 selecting the best copula family the steps for selecting the best fitted copula in each station and climatic sub region are summarized as follows genest and rivest 1993 zhang and singh 2006 step 1 estimate spei 6 for each station and sub region and extract the corresponding dd ds and dp as in section 3 1 step 2 fit the dd ds and dp with their respective marginal distributions as in section 3 2 step 3 compare all the bivariate archimedean copulas described in section 3 3 1 step 4 obtain the parametric distribution function of pr c u v p represented as k φ p which is connected with a pair u v of uniform random drought variables with the selected archimedean copula as 22 k φ p pr c u v p p φ p φ p 1 p 0 where p constant value φ is the derivative of φ with respect to p nelsen 1999 step 5 derive a nonparametric value of the k φ p function k n p for separate drought variables x i y i where i 1 n 23 k n p i n δ p c x i y i n where k n p nonparametric value of k φ p δ the distribution function of a point mass at the origin n sample size c x i y i is estimated by using n set of values x1 y1 i 1 n as 24 c x i y i sum t i where t i 1 0 x j y j if x j x i and y j yi j 1 n else the k φ p and k n p are then compared graphically through probability plots quantile quantile plot and the best fit is indicated by the plot closest to the 45 line through the origin step 6 the goodness of fit assessment indices i e akaike information criterion aic and root mean square error rmse are calculated as follows akaike 1974 zhang and singh 2006 25 rmse e x c x 0 2 1 n k i 1 n x c i x 0 i 2 0 5 26 aic nlog mse 2 k where e mean square error mse is the expectation operator x c i represents the ith calculated value x 0 i represents the ith observed value k is the number of parameters used in deriving the calculated value n is the sample size the best copula should have the smallest values of rmse and aic immediately the best copulas are selected the copula based model can be built for each sub region and the entire mainland china 3 4 joint occurrence probabilities of drought events 3 4 1 bivariate joint occurrence probability two types of bivariate joint occurrence probabilities p d s and p dors are selected and represented as follows shiau 2006 27 p d s p d d d d s s 1 f d d f s s f d s d s 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s 28 p dors p d d d or d s s 1 f d s d s 1 c f d d f s s 3 4 2 conditional probability the conditional drought probabilities of drought variables were also obtained using the constructed copula based bivariate distribution the p d s s and p s d d are derived as follows shiau 2006 29 p d s s p d d d d s s f d d c f d d f s s 1 f s s 30 p s d d p d s s d d d f s s c f d d f s s 1 f d d 3 5 joint occurrence return period of drought events 3 5 1 univariate return period the t d t s and t p are described as a function of the e l d and cdf of dd ds and dp the formulas are expressed shiau 2006 ayantobo et al 2017 31 t d e l d 1 f d d t s e l d 1 f s s t p e l d 1 f p p where e l d is the expected inter arrival time l d the dd and dn durations have the same geometric distribution with parameters respectively p1 and po 1 p1 therefore the e l d is equal to the sum of the expected values of two geometric distributions namely 32 e l d e d d e d n 1 p 1 1 p 0 1 p 1 p 0 where p0 and p1 are probability of deficit and surplus respectively 3 5 2 bivariate return period using the copula based distribution the bivariate return periods can be obtained and defined for two cases t d s and t d or s they are denoted as salas et al 2005 shiau 2006 33 t d s e l d p d d s s e l d 1 f d d f s s c f

ord s s 3 5 3 conditional return period in like manner the conditional return periods can be described for two cases a t d s s and b t s d d these conditional return periods are calculated as follows shiau 2006 35 t d s s l s p d d s s e l 1 f s s 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s 36 t s d d l d p s s d d e l 1 f d d 1 f s s f d d c f d d f s s where t d s s symbolizes conditional return period considering d d d d s s while t s d d symbolizes conditional return period considering d s s d d d in this study all calculations were done using matlab 2014a the spatial interpolations of drought joint probability and return periods were performed using the inverse distance weighting idw method in arcgis 10 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of drought characteristics and marginal distributions according to the drought events identification in section 3 1 the number of drought events and corresponding characteristic variables were obtained fig 3 shows the historical time series of spei 6 for the seven sub regions and entire mainland china during 1961 2013 during the 53 year study period 68 52 51 63 63 43 64 and 53 drought events were recorded while the most severe drought events on record with the corresponding year are 2 75 2002 3 36 1999 2 97 2011 3 07 1963 3 36 1965 2 86 1962 2 58 1979 and 3 15 1963 for sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively it could be observed that virtually all regions had a record of extreme drought events spei 6 2 0 with the most critical events occurring at sub region ii vi v and entire mainland china adopting the run theory as shown in fig 2 drought variables including dd ds and dp were extracted from the drought events in each sub region and entire mainland china the statistical results given in table 2 showed that average dd ranged from 4 56 sub region i to 7 19 months sub region vi average ds ranged from 3 93 sub region iv to 7 29 sub region vi while average dp ranged from 0 85 sub region iv to 1 15 mainland china in general droughts in sub region vi are the most severe with average dd and ds value as high as 7 19 months and 7 29 respectively further following the recommendation of ayantobo et al 2017 on marginal distribution selection the dd ds and dp in each sub region are then fitted with their corresponding marginal distributions in each sub region the parameters are shown in table 3 the best fit distributions are used in the copula based joint distribution functions as marginal distributions 4 2 estimation of bivariate joint distributions the regional marginal distributions and bivariate archimedean copulas in tables 3 and 4 respectively were used to determine the best fitted copula for modeling bivariate joint distribution between drought variables using the procedure in section 3 3 3 one copula function was selected for each sub region in fig 4 the mle and cfm parameter estimation approach were first compared it was apparent that the cfm was better than the mle approach because they had the lowest rmse and aic values in all the sub region hence the cfm method was used further in our analysis the estimated parameters and goodness of fit test rmse and aic for the best fitted copula in each sub region are listed in table 5 in the case of dd and ds for example the nn19 copula in sub regions iii iv v vi and mainland china nn20 in sub region i and nn13 in sub region vii were the best functions because they had the lowest rmse and aic value akaike 1974 fig 5 shows the q q plot and the comparison plot between the theoretical and empirical probability of the selected copula for dd and ds in each sub region it could be observed that the theoretical probabilities and empirical probabilities were very close and their associations were close to the 45 diagonal line fig 6 depicts the pictorial representations of the bivariate copula based distribution of dd and ds in each sub region and results showed that copulas were a handy tool in exploring the associations between correlated drought variables details of the selected copulas for other pairs i e dd and dp dp and ds in each sub region are provided in table 5 it was worthy of note that copula nn19 appears to be a robust and proper function for modeling drought in many of the sub region the dependence structures of dd ds and dp can then be modeled using the selected copula in each sub region to obtain corresponding joint probabilities and return periods which is essential for evaluating and predicting the regional drought risks 4 3 regional joint probability of drought events the estimated joint probabilities p d s p dors of dd and ds are presented in fig 7 the bivariate probabilities are illustrated using contour lines because different dd and ds composite could re p dors sult in the same probability when the dd and ds exceed 2 months and 4 respectively two joint probabilities were associated with these drought events the p d s was 0 30 0 38 0 38 0 28 0 32 0 42 0 33 0 412 and the p dors was 0 62 0 69 0 72 0 67 0 66 0 77 0 66 and 0 75 in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively it could be observed that the joint probabilities are different among the sub regions with significantly higher than the corresponding p d s values sub region vi had the highest probability implying that drought risk varies from pattern to pattern and sub region to sub region across mainland china fig 8 shows the estimated conditional probabilities p s d d and p d s s in each sub region the conditional probability of ds and dd decreased with the increase in dd and ds respectively and were very handy for determining p s d d and p d s s for instance the conditional probabilities of ds less than 6 for a specific dd which exceeds 2 months in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china corresponds to 0 66 0 60 0 63 0 71 0 65 0 56 0 66 and 0 63 respectively also the conditional probabilities of dd less than 10 months for a specific ds which exceeds 4 corresponds to 0 81 0 70 0 64 0 70 0 71 0 58 0 74 and 0 70 in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively the relevance of these bivariate joint and conditional probabilities for drought assessments have also been reported by shiau 2006 and liu et al 2011 because the probabilities are very handy in providing valuable enlightenment for appraising water resources systems under severe and extreme drought conditions 4 4 regional bivariate return period of drought events the e l d values as estimated from the observed data were 0 78 1 02 1 04 0 84 0 84 1 23 0 83 and 1 months for sub region i vii and entire mainland china respectively the bivariate return periods t d s and t dors of dd and ds for each sub regions were computed and the contours i e 5 10 20 50 and 100 years are shown in fig 9 applying the contour plots results for a specific return period there are various associations of ds and dd for example for dd and ds exceeding 2 months and 4 the t d s were 2 5 2 7 2 8 3 0 2 6 2 9 2 5 and 2 4 years while the t dors w t s p ere 1 3 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 3 1 7 1 2 and 1 3 years in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively the univariate and bivariate drought return periods for possible pairs of drought variables in each sub region are illustrated in table 6 considering sub region i the t d s t d p and were 702 5 948 7 and 811 1 years when dd ds and dp exceeded 17 39 months 25 10 and 2 62 respectively for this particular event the univariate return period was 50 years while the t dors t dorp and t sorp were about 25 92 25 27 and 25 38 years respectively these results could be helpful in risk assessment of water resources systems under severe and extreme drought scenarios the conditional return period t d s s and t s d d were also estimated and results presented in fig 10 this figure provided an insight towards drought risk evaluation for instance when ds exceeds 8 for a given dd that exceeds 4 months the t d s s of such conditions are 37 9 23 0 27 4 43 7 29 2 17 5 30 3 and 24 8 years in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively fig 10a in another situation whereby dd exceeds 4 months for a given ds level that exceeds 10 the t s d d were evaluated as 20 0 13 2 13 7 18 4 14 7 10 2 15 2 and 12 3 years for sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively fig 10b both illustrated conditions showed that sub region vi had the shortest return periods compared to other sub regions therefore the estimated probabilities and return periods not only revealed the occurrence of sub regional meteorological drought but also presented a quantitative approach to analysing the probability and return periods of drought events under different dd and ds conditions 4 5 spatial distribution of drought probabilities given that the average dd ds and dp for mainland china are 5 81 months 4 96 and 1 15 respectively the bivariate droug p d p ht probabilities i e p dors and p d s p dorp and p d p p sorp and p d p were calculated and mapped in fig 11 it could be observed that the joint drought probabilities presented noticeable spatial variability among the seven sub regions the joint probabilities of p dors and p d s varied from 0 27 to 0 69 and from 0 22 to 0 52 respectively p dorp varied from 0 35 to 0 69 varied from 0 20 to 0 50 while p sorp and p d p varied from 0 33 to 0 60 and from 0 20 to 0 45 respectively this result implies that higher bivariate probabilities associating with dd and ds exceeding 5 81 months and 4 96 respectively are distributed in northwest china southwest china and south china i e sub region iii and v lower bivariate probabilities are dispersed in northeast china i e sub region i and ii and lower influence of the yangtze river for dd 5 81 months and dp 1 15 the higher probabilities from the northwestern china i e sub region vi extended gradually towards the northeastern china i e sub region i and more pronounced in the north and southern china in the case of ds 4 96 and dp 1 15 respectively the higher probabilities are recorded in most of the northeastern northern and southern china 4 6 spatial pattern of bivariate drought return period the spatial distributions of t dors and t d s t dorp and t d p t sorp and t s p were also evaluated and mapped in fig 12 two contours were added to the map to demarcate the short and long drought return periods the joint return periods of t dors t dorp and t sorp varied from 1 61 to 8 60 years 1 54 to 6 50 years and 1 68 to 7 06 years respectively while t d s t d p and t s p ranged from 1 84 to 10 85 years 2 27 to 11 23 years and 2 56 to 12 72 years respectively the spatial pattern of bivariate drought probabilities and return periods in different sub regions suggests huge variations as areas with high drought probabilities are often associated with short return periods and vice versa severe droughts are most liable to eventuate in sub region iii and vi and in the center and lower region of the yangtze river because of drought frequency short return periods and moderate severity for instance sub region iii experienced an extreme drought event between october and april 2010 because the aggregate rainfall was below 100 mm over seven successive months lu et al 2011 wu et al 2011 lu et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 chang et al 2016 according to cma 2011 the severe event at chuxiong station started around september 2009 and persisted till september 2010 with ds and dp of 19 5 and 1 93 respectively because this region is commercially advanced with huge populations severe drought events place grave danger on water resources therefore drought prevention measures should be strengthened in this region liu et al 2011 and zhang et al 2012 have also evaluated bivariate drought return period in china due to variations in methodology there are numerical disparities between this research and other previous studies however the spatial patterns were consistent therefore the selected copulas for each sub region can adequately be used for bivariate regional drought frequency analysis because their models provided vital information needed by water managers and other government agencies for adequate planning as well as management of water resources under severe drought scenarios 5 conclusions this study derived bivariate archimedean copula models for drought frequency analysis in different sub regions and entire mainland china between 1961 and 2013 nineteen copula functions were evaluated using the method of mle and cfm and we observed that the cfm was better using the rmse and aic goodness of fit tests based on statistical and graphical comparability copula nn19 in sub regions iii iv v vi and mainland china nn20 in sub region i and nn13 in sub region vii are the best fit in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively the average dd ds and dp in mainland china are 5 81 months 4 96 and 1 15 respectively the p dors and p d s varied from 0 27 to 0 69 and from 0 22 to 0 52 respectively p dorp varied from 0 35 to 0 69 p d p varied from 0 20 to 0 50 while p sorp and p d p varied from 0 33 to 0 60 and from 0 20 to 0 45 respectively associated with the probability are t dors and t d s which varied from 1 61 to 8 60 years and from 1 84 to 10 85 years respectively t dorp varied from 1 54 to 6 50 years t d p varied from 2 27 to 11 23 years while t sorp and t s p varied from 1 68 to 7 06 years and from 2 56 to 12 72 respectively the bivariate drought frequencies are helpful in investigating drought prone regions for instance the drought risks as observed in sub region iii iv and vi are significantly greater than other sub regions severe droughts events are most liable to eventuate because the higher drought probability in these sub regions corresponds to short return periods with greater severity knowing that these areas are advanced commercially with large populations more attention must be paid to the severe and extreme droughts in these regions to protect water resources this study provides a comprehensive understanding of regional drought events in mainland china and highlights the bivariate drought probabilities and return periods considering the multivariate characteristic nature of drought further investigation is required in the multivariate framework to adequately quantify the drought events for optimal marginal distribution selection the optimization based and rank based methods abdi et al 2017b are suggested for ensuring the accuracy of multivariate l moments approach studies have also showed the importance of taking into account the tail dependence in choosing a suitable copula family poulin et al 2007 she and xia 2017 therefore it s imperative to also verify if the tail dependence is reproduced by a given family of copula however for practical purposes the analysis discussed in this study could provide useful enlightenment in appraising the risk of drought maximising water resources and planning drought risk management

drought events is a significant aspect of water resources management and planning in this study popularly applied and several relatively new bivariate archimedean copulas were employed to derive regional and spatial based copula models to appraise drought risk in mainland china over 1961 2013 drought duration dd severity ds and peak dp as indicated by standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei were extracted according to the run theory and fitted with suitable marginal distributions the maximum likelihood estimation mle and curve fitting method cfm were used to estimate the copula parameters of nineteen bivariate archimedean copulas drought probabilities and return periods were analysed based on appropriate bivariate copula in sub region i vii and entire mainland china the goodness of fit tests as indicated by the cfm showed that copula nn19 in sub regions iii iv v vi and mainland china nn20 in sub region i and nn13 in sub region vii are the best for modeling drought variables bivariate drought probability across mainland china is relatively high and the highest drought probabilities are found mainly in the northwestern and southwestern china besides the result also showed that different sub regions might suffer varying drought risks the drought risks as observed in sub region iii vi and vii are significantly greater than other sub regions higher probability of droughts of longer durations in the sub regions also corresponds to shorter return periods with greater drought severity these results may imply tremendous challenges for the water resources management in different sub regions particularly the northwestern and southwestern china keywords drought spei archimedean copula drought probability drought return period water

impacts sheffield and wood 2012 esfahanian et al 2016 drought affected areas have exceedingly increased over the past 50 years in china due to spatiotemporal variation in p and temperature t yang et al 2013 leng et al 2015 chang et al 2016 in the 2000s extreme winter spring droughts events occurred in southwest china from august 2009 to may 2010 lu et al 2011 2012 zhang et al 2012 yang et al 2013 while spring summer drought happened in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river in 2011 lu et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 chang et al 2016 since 1990s various drought damages have resulted to economic losses in excess of us 12 billion xu et al 2015 qin et al 2015 chang et al 2016 therefore the understanding of drought risk is imperative in planning and efficient drought mitigation in china drought exhibits stochastic characteristics and the best approach to monitor and assess it is through probability and stochastic theories shiau 2006 in univariate probabilistic analysis drought variables are investigated separately cancelliere and salas 2004 serinaldi et al 2009 knowing that droughts are multiplex phenomena tsakiris et al 2016 xu et al 2015 univariate analysis cannot give an exhaustive appraisal of droughts and account for significant correlations among their characteristics genest and favre 2007 liu et al 2015 ayantobo et al 2017 therefore many efforts salas et al 2005 huang et al 2014a b zhang et al 2015a have been devoted to examining drought risk on multivariate probability levels to give a more outright drought characterization shiau et al 2007 mishra and singh 2010 among these methods the copula function initially introduced by sklar 1959 has been extensively employed in multivariate analysis because they can overcome major drawbacks inherent in the traditional methods salvadori and de michele 2015 zhang et al 2015a she et al 2016 hence the construction of joint distributions only reckons with the correlated pair of random drought variables shiau

vine copula garch model and entropy copula have also been studied joe 1997 gräler et al 2013 grothe and hofert 2015 fan and qian 2016 recently copula has been broadly used in the analysis of

grothe and hofert 2015 and in the development of nacopula r package hofert and maechler 2011 gräler et al 2013 use vine copula garch model to construct a joint probability distribution for flood characteristics while bedford et al 2015 proposed a minimum informative pair copula using the vine structure to approximate any given multivariate copula to any required degree of approximation wong et al 2013 applied copulas to investigate the cross dependence between meteorological and hydrological drought while zhang et al 2015a used the bayesian approach to evaluate the uncertainties of copula based analysis of hydrological droughts as a result of marginal distribution and copulas selection for analysis of drought variables many studies have reported both bivariate shiau et al 2007 shiau and modarres 2009 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015b tsakiris et al 2016 as well as multivariate serinaldi et al 2009 song and singh 2010 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 drought frequency using copula functions lee et al 2013 utilized gumbel and frank copulas at four stations in canada and iran to fit drought variables in china xiao et al 2012 used the gumbel hougaard clayton and frank copulas to study the spatial evolution of drought in the pearl river basin while zhang et al 2017 used copula for concurrent hydrological drought in the poyang lake catchment river system other copula based drought related studies huang et al 2014a b zhao et al 2015 in wei river basin and guanzhong plain have also been reported results of these studies demonstrate that copulas are robust for drought analysis however there are more studies focused on station based and river basins than regional analysis while drought is often perceived as a regional event the regional frequency analysis of drought appears more significant in practice the multivariate l moments adjusted charge system search and fuzzy c means algorithm have been used with copula functions for regional analysis zhang et al 2015a abdi et al 2016 2017a b c to increase the accuracy of the multivariate l moment approach abdi et al 2017b proposed the optimization based and rank based method galambos bivariate copula functions were employed for regional drought analysis of sharafkhaneh in the northwest of iran mirabbasi et al 2012 in china yang et al 2010 studied the regional drought of pearl river basin using bivariate copulas xu et al 2015 used copulas to develop a regional drought model by considering drought duration severity and affected areas hao et al 2017 studied multivariate drought frequency in southwest china while zhang et al 2015b used gumbel copula for regional drought analysis in china since china has a diverse climate with large expanse and intricate topography zhai et al 2010a the identification of an appropriate copula function to capture the complexity and diversity of drought in the different climate is one of the significant limitations for previous studies although zhang et al 2015b compared three copulas for regional drought frequency in china however we improved the analysis firstly since the choice of copulas could be different from one climatic region to another khedun et al 2013 we tested the performances of nineteen bivariate archimedean copulas nelsen 1999 most of which have not been explored in literature for regional drought analysis secondly we estimated regional conditional probabilities and return periods which were not considered in the study therefore the scientific motivations behind this study reside in the appraisal of nineteen bivariate archimedean copula functions and the selection of the best fitted one for each climatic sub region in mainland china to objectively and comprehensively examine bivariate drought characteristics numerous drought indices have been developed globally to define drought characteristics examples of such indices their strengths weakness and limitations can be found in review studies by mishra and singh 2010 and zargar et al 2011 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been widely applied in various copula based drought related studies in china liu et al 2015 xu et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b hao et al 2017 mainly because it combines changes in evapotranspiration demand with the multi temporal nature vicente serrano et al 2010 our objectives are 1 to identify station based and regional drought duration dd severity ds and peak dp computed on spei 6 month timescale between 1961 and 2013 2 to compare the efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimation mle and curve fitting method cfm in copula parameter estimation 3 to appraise the performance of nineteen bivariate archimedean copulas and 4 to compute regional and spatial probabilistic drought properties bivariate probabilities and return periods conditional bivariate probabilities and return periods using the best fitted copula function results of this study will provide a framework for drought prediction and prevention in different climatic sub regions of mainland china 2 study area and data the climate zones of china fluctuate significantly from one sub region to another due to its enormous expanse and complex topography zhai et al 2010a the western and northern china is influenced by dry climate while semi humid and humid prevail over the eastern china wu et al 2011 based on topography and climate the entire mainland china was divided into seven sub regions zhao 1983 ayantobo et al 2017 including northeast humid semi humid warm region sub region i 72 stations north china humid semi humid temperate zone sub region ii 104 stations central and southern china humid subtropical zone sub region iii 165 stations south china humid tropical zone sub region iv 57 stations inner mongolia steppe zone sub region v 44 stations northwest desert areas sub region vi 61 stations and qinghai tibet plateau sub region vii 49 stations sub regions i iv v vi and vii are referred to the eastern monsoon northwestern and qinghai tibet plateau respectively the monthly fluctuation in p and t are evident since most of china s terrain is positioned within the east asian monsoon climatic belt wu et al 2011 the daily and monthly weather data from 552 national basic meteorological stations in china over 1961 2013 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing network the meteorological stations are not uniformly distributed as more stations are positioned in the east than western regions especially the qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 the quality and reliability of the climatic data were cross examined using nonparametric tests according to helsel and hirsch 1992 kendall autocorrelation test mann kendall trend test and mann whitney homogeneity tests for mean and variance were used to test for randomness homogeneity and absence of trends the results indicated that randomness and stationarity of the weather data were fixed between the critical points 5 statistical significance level 3 methods 3 1 drought index and drought event identification the spei describes the degree of deviation of regional dry and wet conditions from climatological mean ones by standardizing the difference between et o and p in this study spei is estimated for each station and seven sub regions using six month timescale denoted by spei 6 the six month timescale has been adopted because a short timescale would fail to detect longer periods of abnormal wet dry conditions while redundant information is likely to be included if a very long timescale is considered spei 6 is most useful for describing the shallow soil moisture available to crops reddy and singh 2014 abdi et al 2016 following the algorithm of vicente serrano et al 2010 spei 6 is calculated using the estimated monthly et o and p from each station and sub regions 3 1 1 potential evapotranspiration et o penman equation is applied to calculate et o penman 1948 used

three parameter log logistic distribution is employed to consider the negative di as follows vicente serrano et al 2010 6 f x 1 α x λ β 1 where d i values ranged as d i λ the spei 6 can then be derived as the standardized values of f x in the wake of classical approximation abramowitz and stegun 1965 7 p r 1 f x where p r is probability of exceeding a determination value of d i 8 spei w c 0

432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 respectively the categorization standard of dryness wetness levels by spei is given in table 1 according to fig 2 a run is described as the segment of time series xt in which spei 6 are either beneath i e negative run or over i e positive run a chosen threshold level of x 0 0 yevjevich and ingenieur 1967 shiau 2006 mishra and singh 2010 so drought events are identified and drought variables i e dd ds dp dn and di extracted using the calculated spei 6 for each station and sub region see ayantobo et al 2017 for details 3 2 selection of appropriate marginal distribution for univariate analyses many marginal distributions have been recommended for fitting dd ds and dp shiau et al 2007 shiau and modarres 2009 however as shown in table 3 we adopted exponential weibull generalized pareto and gamma distributions as appropriate marginal distributions for fitting drought variables in different sub regions of mainland china to obtain these distributions ayantobo et al 2017 compared the suitability of several marginal distributions including exponential gamma weibull gaussian log normal logistic generalized pareto generalized extreme value and pearson type iii for regional drought analysis considering dd ds and dp in mainland china although all the distributions pass the kolmogorov smirnov ks test at the 99 a 0 01 significant level however the principle that the threshold of ks value should be as small as possible to retain the largest sample was employed abdi et al 2016 the fitted distributions were compared against the empirical non exceedance probabilities estimated by gringorten position plotting formula gringorten 1963 9 p k k 0 44 n 0 12 where pk is probability of the kth value k is the kth smallest value in the dataset arranged in ascending order and n is the sample size the cumulative distribution functions of exponential weibull generalized pareto and gamma are presented in eqs 10 13 respectively 10 f x 1 exp x β α 11 f x 1 exp x α β 12 f x 1 1 β x λ α 1 β 13 f x 0 x x α 1 β α γ α exp x β dx using the observed data x the mle is used to estimate the parameters of f x next proper copula functions are needed to integrate the dd ds and dp 3 3 theoretical aspects of copula functions sklar 1959 proposed a theorem which states that if two random variables x and y have their arbitrary marginal distribution functions f x x and f y y respectively then there is a copula c that links these two marginal distributions to form a joint distribution function f x y x y as follows nelsen 2006 14 f x y x y c f x x f y y further if the marginal distributions f x x and f y y are continuous the copula function c is unique and the joint probability density function can then be given as 15 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where f x x f y y and c are the density functions of f x x f y y and c respectively represented as 16 c u v 2 c u v u v where u and v are the univariate cdf 3 3 1 archimedean copulas bivariate archimedean copulas are more handy easy to build and have been broadly applied zhang and singh 2007 zhang et al 2012 according to nelsen 2006 one parameter bivariate archimedean copula can be expressed as 17 c θ x y φ θ t 1 φ θ t x φ θ t y for x 0 y 1 where φ θ t 1 0 continuous convex and factually reducing function such that φ θ t 1 0 φ θ t x 0 φ θ t x 0 for all 0 x 1 θ is is hidden in the φ θ t the θ helps to measures the extent of relationship between x and y many kinds of one parameter bivariate archimedean copulas exist nelsen 1999 a few of them have common names e g the first third fourth and fifth are referred to as clayton ali mikhail haq gumbel hougaard and frank s copula respectively but most of them don t therefore for simplicity we refer to them by their number in nelsen s table a very concise description of the bivariate copula functions as well as the corresponding c u v θ r and φ θ t used in this study are given in table 4 joe 1997 nelsen 2006 3 3 2 copulas parameter estimation the parameter θ of the bivariate copula is determined using two methods i e mle and cfm and requires the parametric approximation of the marginal distributions genest et al 1995 joe 1997 zhang and singh 2007 if u and u indicate random samples and arbitrary vectors respectively then the mle of the parameter θ n mle estimated from u u i j of size n is estimated by numerically maximizing 18 l u θ i 1 n log c u i 1 u i 2 θ where l denotes the log likelihood function θ θ r p p 1 is the parameter space of copula c u i u i 1 u i 2 t 0 1 2 is the i th sample from the copula and c is the copula s density parameterized by θ as 19 c u 1 u 2 θ c u 1 u 2 θ u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 0 1 the estimator is thus written as 20 θ n mle u arg max θ θ l u θ according to genest et al 1995 the mle is consistent and asymptotically normal under some regularity conditions analogous to the cfm method parameter θ is the minimum standards of squared residuals and calculated as follows 21 cfm 1 n i 1 n x c i x 0 i 2 where x c i represents ith calculated value x 0 i represents ith observed value and n is the sample size 3 3 3 selecting the best copula family the steps for selecting the best fitted copula in each station and climatic sub region are summarized as follows genest and rivest 1993 zhang and singh 2006 step 1 estimate spei 6 for each station and sub region and extract the corresponding dd ds and dp as in section 3 1 step 2 fit the dd ds and dp with their respective marginal distributions as in section 3 2 step 3 compare all the bivariate archimedean copulas described

joint probability and return periods were performed using the inverse distance weighting idw method in arcgis 10 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimation of drought characteristics and marginal distributions according to the drought events identification in section 3 1 the number of drought events and corresponding characteristic variables were obtained fig 3 shows the historical time series of spei 6 for the seven sub regions and entire mainland china during 1961 2013 during the 53 year study period 68 52 51 63 63 43 64 and 53 drought events were recorded while the most severe drought events on record with the corresponding year are 2 75 2002 3 36 1999 2 97 2011 3 07 1963 3 36 1965 2 86 1962 2 58 1979 and 3 15 1963 for sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively it could be observed that virtually all regions had a record of extreme drought events spei 6 2 0 with the most critical events occurring at sub region ii vi v and entire mainland china adopting the run theory as shown in fig 2 drought variables including dd ds and dp were extracted from the drought events in each sub region and entire mainland china the statistical results given in table 2 showed that average dd ranged from 4 56 sub region i to 7 19 months sub region vi average ds ranged from 3 93 sub region iv to 7 29 sub region vi while average dp ranged from 0 85 sub region iv to 1 15 mainland china in general droughts in sub region vi are the most severe with average dd and ds value as high as 7 19 months and 7 29 respectively further following the recommendation of ayantobo et al 2017 on marginal distribution selection the dd ds and dp in each sub region are then fitted with their corresponding marginal distributions in each sub region the parameters are shown in table 3 the best fit distributions are used in the copula based joint distribution functions as marginal distributions 4 2 estimation of bivariate joint distributions the regional marginal distributions and bivariate archimedean copulas in tables 3 and 4 respectively were used to determine the best fitted copula for modeling bivariate joint distribution between drought variables using the procedure in section 3 3 3 one copula function was selected for each sub region in fig 4 the mle and cfm parameter estimation approach were first compared it was apparent that the cfm was better than the mle approach because they had the lowest rmse and aic values in all the sub region hence the cfm method was used further in our analysis the estimated parameters and goodness of fit test rmse and aic for the best fitted copula in each sub region are listed in table 5 in the case of dd and ds for example the nn19 copula in sub regions iii iv v vi and mainland china nn20 in sub region i and nn13 in sub region vii were the best functions because they had the lowest rmse and aic value akaike 1974 fig 5 shows the q q plot and the comparison plot between the theoretical and empirical probability of the selected copula for dd and ds in each sub region it could be observed that the theoretical probabilities and empirical probabilities were very close and their associations were close to the 45 diagonal line fig 6 depicts the pictorial representations of the bivariate copula based distribution of dd and ds in each sub region and results showed that copulas were a handy tool in exploring the associations between correlated drought variables details of the selected copulas for other pairs i e dd and dp dp and ds in each sub region are provided in table 5 it was worthy of note that copula nn19 appears to be a robust and proper function for modeling drought in many of the sub region the dependence structures of dd ds and dp can then be modeled using the selected copula in each sub region to obtain corresponding joint probabilities and return periods which is essential for evaluating and predicting the regional drought risks 4 3 regional joint probability of drought events the estimated joint probabilities p d s p dors of dd and ds are presented in fig 7 the bivariate probabilities are illustrated using contour lines because different dd and ds composite could re p dors sult in the same probability when the dd and ds exceed 2 months and 4 respectively two joint probabilities were associated with these drought events the p d s was 0 30 0 38 0 38 0 28 0 32 0 42 0 33 0 412 and the p dors was 0 62 0 69 0 72 0 67 0 66 0 77 0 66 and 0 75 in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively it could be observed that the joint probabilities are different among the sub regions with significantly higher than the corresponding p d s values sub region vi had the highest probability implying that drought risk varies from pattern to pattern and sub region to sub region across mainland china fig 8 shows the estimated conditional probabilities p s d d and p d s s in each sub region the conditional probability of ds and dd decreased with the increase in dd and ds respectively and were very handy for determining p s d d and p d s s for instance the conditional probabilities of ds less than 6 for a specific dd which exceeds 2 months in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china corresponds to 0 66 0 60 0 63 0 71 0 65 0 56 0 66 and 0 63 respectively also the conditional probabilities of dd less than 10 months for a specific ds which exceeds 4 corresponds to 0 81 0 70 0 64 0 70 0 71 0 58 0 74 and 0 70 in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively the relevance of these bivariate joint and conditional probabilities for drought assessments have also been reported by shiau 2006 and liu et al 2011 because the probabilities are very handy in providing valuable enlightenment for appraising water resources systems under severe and extreme drought conditions 4 4 regional bivariate return period of drought events the e l d values as estimated from the observed data were 0 78 1 02 1 04 0 84 0 84 1 23 0 83 and 1 months for sub region i vii and entire mainland china respectively the bivariate return periods t d s and t dors of dd and ds for each sub regions were computed and the contours i e 5 10 20 50 and 100 years are shown in fig 9 applying the contour plots results for a specific return period there are various associations of ds and dd for example for dd and ds exceeding 2 months and 4 the t d s were 2 5 2 7 2 8 3 0 2 6 2 9 2 5 and 2 4 years while the t dors w t s p ere 1 3 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 3 1 7 1 2 and 1 3 years in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively the univariate and bivariate drought return periods for possible pairs of drought variables in each sub region are illustrated in table 6 considering sub region i the t d s t d p and were 702 5 948 7 and 811 1 years when dd ds and dp exceeded 17 39 months 25 10 and 2 62 respectively for this particular event the univariate return period was 50 years while the t dors t dorp and t sorp were about 25 92 25 27 and 25 38 years respectively these results could be helpful in risk assessment of water resources systems under severe and extreme drought scenarios the conditional return period t d s s and t s d d were also estimated and results presented in fig 10 this figure provided an insight towards drought risk evaluation for instance when ds exceeds 8 for a given dd that exceeds 4 months the t d s s of such conditions are 37 9 23 0 27 4 43 7 29 2 17 5 30 3 and 24 8 years in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively fig 10a in another situation whereby dd exceeds 4 months for a given ds level that exceeds 10 the t s d d were evaluated as 20 0 13 2 13 7 18 4 14 7 10 2 15 2 and 12 3 years for sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively fig 10b both illustrated conditions showed that sub region vi had the shortest return periods compared to other sub regions therefore the estimated probabilities and return periods not only revealed the occurrence of sub regional meteorological drought but also presented a quantitative approach to analysing the probability and return periods of drought events under different dd and ds conditions 4 5 spatial distribution of drought probabilities given that the average dd ds and dp for mainland china are 5 81 months 4 96 and 1 15 respectively the bivariate droug p d p ht probabilities i e p dors and p d s p dorp and p d p p sorp and p d p were calculated and mapped in fig 11 it could be observed that the joint drought probabilities presented noticeable spatial variability among the seven sub regions the joint probabilities of p dors and p d s varied from 0 27 to 0 69 and from 0 22 to 0 52 respectively p dorp varied from 0 35 to 0 69 varied from 0 20 to 0 50 while p sorp and p d p varied from 0 33 to 0 60 and from 0 20 to 0 45 respectively this result implies that higher bivariate probabilities associating with dd and ds exceeding 5 81 months and 4 96 respectively are distributed in northwest china southwest china and south china i e sub region iii and v lower bivariate probabilities are dispersed in northeast china i e sub region i and ii and lower influence of the yangtze river for dd 5 81 months and dp 1 15 the higher probabilities from the northwestern china i e sub region vi extended gradually towards the northeastern china i e sub region i and more pronounced in the north and southern china in the case of ds 4 96 and dp 1 15 respectively the higher probabilities are recorded in most of the northeastern northern and southern china 4 6 spatial pattern of bivariate drought return period the spatial distributions of t dors and t d s t dorp and t d p t sorp and t s p were also evaluated and mapped in fig 12 two contours were added to the map to demarcate the short and long drought return periods the joint return periods of t dors t dorp and t sorp varied from 1 61 to 8 60 years 1 54 to 6 50 years and 1 68 to 7 06 years respectively while t d s t d p and t s p ranged from 1 84 to 10 85 years 2 27 to 11 23 years and 2 56 to 12 72 years respectively the spatial pattern of bivariate drought probabilities and return periods in different sub regions suggests huge variations as areas with high drought probabilities are often associated with short return periods and vice versa severe droughts are most liable to eventuate in sub region iii and vi and in the center and lower region of the yangtze river because of drought frequency short return periods and moderate severity for instance sub region iii experienced an extreme drought event between october and april 2010 because the aggregate rainfall was below 100 mm over seven successive months lu et al 2011 wu et al 2011 lu et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 chang et al 2016 according to cma 2011 the severe event at chuxiong station started around september 2009 and persisted till september 2010 with ds and dp of 19 5 and 1 93 respectively because this region is commercially advanced with huge populations severe drought events place grave danger on water resources therefore drought prevention measures should be strengthened in this region liu et al 2011 and zhang et al 2012 have also evaluated bivariate drought return period in china due to variations in methodology there are numerical disparities between this research and other previous studies however the spatial patterns were consistent therefore the selected copulas for each sub region can adequately be used for bivariate regional drought frequency analysis because their models provided vital information needed by water managers and other government agencies for adequate planning as well as management of water resources under severe drought scenarios 5 conclusions this study derived bivariate archimedean copula models for drought frequency analysis in different sub regions and entire mainland china between 1961 and 2013 nineteen copula functions were evaluated using the method of mle and cfm and we observed that the cfm was better using the rmse and aic goodness of fit tests based on statistical and graphical comparability copula nn19 in sub regions iii iv v vi and mainland china nn20 in sub region i and nn13 in sub region vii are the best fit in sub regions i vii and entire mainland china respectively the average dd ds and dp in mainland china are 5 81 months 4 96 and 1 15 respectively the p dors and p d s varied from 0 27 to 0 69 and from 0 22 to 0 52 respectively p dorp varied from 0 35 to 0 69 p d p varied from 0 20 to 0 50 while p sorp and p d p varied from 0 33 to 0 60 and from 0 20 to 0 45 respectively associated with the probability are t dors and t d s which varied from 1 61 to 8 60 years and from 1 84 to 10 85 years respectively t dorp varied from 1 54 to 6 50 years t d p varied from 2 27 to 11 23 years while t sorp and t s p varied from 1 68 to 7 06 years and from 2 56 to 12 72 respectively the bivariate drought frequencies are helpful in investigating drought prone regions for instance the drought risks as observed in sub region iii iv and vi are significantly greater than other sub regions severe droughts events are most liable to eventuate because the higher drought probability in these sub regions corresponds to short return periods with greater severity knowing that these areas are advanced commercially with large populations more attention must be paid to the severe and extreme droughts in these regions to protect water resources this study provides a comprehensive understanding of regional drought events in mainland china and highlights the bivariate drought probabilities and return periods considering the multivariate characteristic nature of drought further investigation is required in the multivariate framework to adequately quantify the drought events for optimal marginal distribution selection the optimization based and rank based methods abdi et al 2017b are suggested for ensuring the accuracy of multivariate l moments approach studies have also showed the importance of taking into account the tail dependence in choosing a suitable copula family poulin et al 2007 she and xia 2017 therefore it s imperative to also verify if the tail dependence is reproduced by a given family of copula however for practical purposes the analysis discussed in this study could provide useful enlightenment in appraising the risk of drought maximising water resources and planning drought risk management

7391,previous studies have shown that geostatistics based transient hydraulic tomography tht is robust for subsurface heterogeneity characterization through the joint inverse modeling of multiple pumping tests however the hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss estimates can be smooth or even erroneous for areas where pumping observation densities are low this renders the imaging of interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of highly contrasting materials including their unit boundaries difficult in this study we further test the performance of tht by utilizing existing and newly collected pumping test data of longer durations that showed drawdown responses in both aquifer and aquitard units at a field site underlain by a highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposit the robust performance of the tht is highlighted through the comparison of different degrees of model parameterization including 1 the effective parameter approach 2 the geological zonation approach relying on borehole logs and 3 the geostatistical inversion approach considering different prior information with without geological data results reveal that the simultaneous analysis of eight pumping tests with the geostatistical inverse model yields the best results in terms of model calibration and validation we also find that the joint interpretation of long term drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard units is necessary in mapping their full heterogeneous patterns including intralayer variabilities moreover as geological data are included as prior information in the geostatistics based tht analysis the estimated k values increasingly reflect the vertical distribution patterns of permeameter estimated k in both aquifer and aquitard units finally the comparison of various tht approaches reveals that differences in the estimated k and ss tomograms result in significantly different transient drawdown predictions at observation ports keywords hydraulic tomography subsurface heterogeneity aquitard characterization model calibration and validation inverse modeling model comparison 1 introduction investigations of groundwater problems have relied heavily on the accurate knowledge of the subsurface parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss usually these hydraulic properties are determined by fitting pumping test data from individual tests to analytical solutions with the assumption that the subsurface is homogeneous estimates of such traditional analyses can yield biased parameter estimates e g wu et al 2005 wen et al 2010 illman et al 2010 alexander et al 2011 huang et al 2011 berg and illman 2011a b 2013 2015 due to the fact that the subsurface is heterogeneous at multiple scales alternatively small scale measurements of cores slug single hole and flowmeter tests require a large number of measurements in order to adequately characterize the subsurface heterogeneity thus carrera et al 2005 advocated the more common use of inverse models to estimate hydraulic parameters based on observations of ambient hydraulic heads artificial changes in heads as well as other data such as solute concentration through either stochastic or deterministic groundwater flow and transport models pool et al 2015 among the various techniques to characterize the subsurface pumping tests are considered to yield large scale estimates of hydraulic parameters through the interpretation of drawdowns in both aquifer and aquitard layers however drawdown responses to such tests are only typically monitored in aquifers in addition as the tests are usually not run long enough drawdown signals are detected only in high k zones connected to the pumped interval leading to parameter estimates only for aquifers fogg and zhang 2016 neuzil 1994 1986 while the characterization of aquifers is important the same applies to low k zones and aquitards and their connectivity for groundwater resource evaluation e g gurwin and lubczynski 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 solute transport e g johnson et al 1989 hendry and wassenaar 2000 land subsidence galloway and burbey 2011 zhuang et al 2017a b and also waste storage montazer and wilson 1984 neuzil 1994 aquitard hydraulic parameters are typically obtained by performing laboratory permeameter tests together with consolidation tests on small scale samples e g keller et al 1989 alexander et al 2011 however laboratory tests can yield hydraulic parameter estimates that may not be representative of field conditions as reviewed by van der kamp 2001 field testing methods for aquitard characterization include the analysis of slug and pumping tests e g neuman and witherspoon 1972 keller et al 1989 monitoring of pore pressure changes and settlement due to surface loading van der kamp and maathuis 1985 as well as monitoring of seasonal head fluctuations davis 1972 keller et al 1989 van der kamp 2001 noted that the most common methods provide only a one dimensional value of hydraulic diffusivity α kv ss of the aquitard where kv vertical hydraulic conductivity and a value of kv is inferred by relying on a laboratory estimate of ss he also noted that laboratory estimates of ss are typically several orders of magnitude larger than those estimated in the field the commingled use of field and laboratory values can be problematic and can result in inaccurate estimates of kv other information such as land subsidence data recorded by multiple vertical extensometers e g cleveland et al 1992 zhuang et al 2015 2017b could also be analyzed to determine aquitard hydraulic parameters however despite its importance very little work has been done to map the variability of hydraulic parameters in aquitards this may partly be a result of significant difficulties in obtaining even a single reliable hydraulic parameter estimate of aquitard units notwithstanding their heterogeneities clearly new methods are necessary for obtaining more reliable hydraulic parameter estimates within aquitards and mapping heterogeneities within them hydraulic tomography ht has become a mature inverse modeling technique to map both high and low k features of the subsurface it relies on the joint inverse modeling of multiple sets of pressure heads that are obtained from different observation intervals while pumping and or injecting water at different locations of target aquifers thus far ht has been investigated by several research groups through synthetic studies e g yeh and liu 2000 bohling et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 2006 cardiff et al 2009 2013 liu and kitanidis 2011 mao et al 2013b laboratory experiments e g liu et al 2002 2007 brauchler et al 2003 illman et al 2009 2008 2010 2012 berg and illman 2011a liu and kitanidis 2011 zhao et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 and testing at the field scale bohling et al 2007 cardiff et al 2009 2012 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 brauchler et al 2011 hochstetler et al 2016 paradis et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 compared to traditional aquifer characterization approaches ht has shown to be superior in recovering the heterogeneity as well as predicting independent pumping tests not used for model calibration illman et al 2010 2015 berg and illman 2011a b 2015 in order to interpret multiple pumping and observation data from ht tests different inverse modeling methods have been developed two most frequently used inverse modeling algorithms are the quasi linear geostatistical approach ql kitanidis 1995 and the successive linear estimator sle yeh et al 1996 both of which rely on the cross covariance between hydraulic head and aquifer parameters e g yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011a b cardiff and barrash 2011 mao et al 2013b alternatively the kalman filter kf as well as its low rank versions such as the ensemble kf e g nowak 2009 li et al 2012 schöniger et al 2012 generalized compressed state kf e g kitanidis 2015 li et al 2015 and the spectral kf e g ghorbanidehno et al 2015 2017 have also been increasingly used for hydraulic parameter estimation through a bayesian framework to continuously assimilate hydraulic head and or concentration data for the majority of the above ht studies geostatistics forms the backbone of various inverse methods while the geostatistics based ht offers many advantages yeh and šimůnek 2002 it could produce overly smooth distributions of subsurface heterogeneity when only few pumping tests and monitoring data are available yeh and liu 2000 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2017 for example in the field studies at the north campus research site ncrs located on the university of waterloo campus in waterloo ontario canada both the tht berg and illman 2011b and steady state hydraulic tomography ssht berg and illman 2013 analyses of four pumping tests captured the most salient heterogeneity patterns of the highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposits however despite the relatively large number of monitoring intervals installed within the well field stratigraphic boundaries between aquifer and aquitard units were ambiguous more importantly high k values were estimated for the lower portion of the model domain where the known geology indicates the presence of an aquitard consisting of clay berg and illman 2011b 2013 pointed out that little to no drawdown responses were observed in monitoring wells located in the low k material during the relatively short duration pumping tests thus leading to unsatisfactory results later berg and illman 2015 were able to map those low k zones but only after using permeameter k values for conditioning therefore one could question whether the geostatistics based inversion approach could be reliably used to map unit boundaries and more importantly aquitard units consisting of low k materials with pumping test data alone or not thus far ht studies have not been previously conducted to map both aquifer and aquitard units and their connectivity because geostatistics based ht yields smoothed hydraulic parameter distributions when data are sparse the inclusion of other types of information becomes necessary to map the various units i e interlayer heterogeneity and the heterogeneity within them i e intralayer heterogeneity lessons learned from our previous studies berg and illman 2011b 2013 also point to the need for longer pumping tests to stress the aquitard units to characterize them with pumping tests alone in order to overcome the issue of smooth hydraulic parameter estimates of the geostatistics based inversion approaches the importance of geological data was investigated for ht analyses in particular zhou et al 2014 proposed an image guided method which extracts the structure information from the cross sections of geology and incorporates it in the inversion process later zhou et al 2016 extended this method by including the markov chain monte carlo sampler to update and select the most plausible geological models for the inverse problem this image guided inversion approach was then tested in synthetic ht studies by soueid ahmed et al 2015 but not through laboratory sandbox or field experiments on the other hand illman et al 2015 compared the ssht analyses based on geostatistical inversion to those based on effective parameter and geological models to test whether subsurface conceptualizations of the k structure at lower resolutions for a sandbox aquifer could yield similar results to the geostatistical inverse modeling approach or not they found that the geostatistical inversion approach performed best in terms of model calibration and validation but the geological model with perfectly known stratigraphy came a close second then zhao et al 2016 evaluated the performances of geological zonation models of varying accuracy for ssht through the same laboratory sandbox and luo et al 2017 extended the work of zhao et al 2016 to the tht case results from the sandbox studies revealed that both accurate and inaccurate geological models could be well calibrated despite the estimated k values for the poor geological models being quite different from the actual values these studies also concluded that 1 using a geological model as prior mean k distributions in geostatistical inverse models resulted in the preservation of geological features especially in areas where drawdown data were not available and 2 transient inversions are necessary by treating both k and ss to be heterogeneous to jointly obtain reliable k and ss estimates for making accurate predictions of transient drawdown events the findings by zhao et al 2016 and luo et al 2017 were based on experiments conducted in a laboratory synthetic aquifer constructed with various types of sands which did not contain low k materials e g clay silty clay as encountered at the ncrs alexander et al 2011 berg and illman 2011b therefore efforts other than berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 are needed to examine whether the ht approach can map aquitard units consisting of low k materials through pumping tests alone most recently zhao and illman 2017 performed a new ssht study at the ncrs the unique contribution of zhao and illman 2017 was that they tried to stress the low k layers and included both steady and quasi steady state drawdown data from low k zones into the ssht analysis compared to the previous ht analyses of berg and illman 2011b 2013 in which the bottom aquitard layer was incorrectly mapped as a high k zone slight improvements in the characterization of the lower aquitard were obtained by zhao and illman 2017 yet the consistency between the estimated and permeameter test k values was still poor in silt and clay layers due to the fact that only late time pressure heads indicating steady or quasi steady state were selected for model calibration however when transient data are available from aquitard units more complete information could then be utilized for tht analysis following this line of thought the first purpose of this study is to perform tht analysis using long term transient drawdowns obtained from both aquifer and aquitard units to investigate whether more accurate maps of both units as well as their intralayer heterogeneity could be obtained through the inversion of pumping test data alone furthermore the importance of geological data for tht has not been investigated rigorously in the field in order to examine these issues the second purpose of the study is to extend the work of zhao and illman 2017 to the transient case and compare the model calibration and validation performances among several approaches 1 the effective parameter approach by treating the site to be homogeneous both isotropic and anisotropic 2 the geological zonation approach treating each layer to be homogeneous and 3 the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach 2 data used for analysis 2 1 site description and geology data for this tht study has been collected at the north campus research site ncrs located on the university of waterloo uw campus in waterloo ontario canada previous investigations revealed that the near surface is highly heterogeneous and composed of multiple layers of glacial tills karrow 1979 sebol 2000 alexander et al 2011 based on the continuous core samples of a 30 m deep borehole the geology beneath the ncrs consists of from younger to older age the tavistock till maryhill till and catfish creek till karrow 1979 the surface layer in our study area is recognized as the maryhill till which consists mainly of silty clay accompanied with few stones while the overlying tavistock till only exists as erosional remnants at the site the catfish creek till is composed of stiff stony silt to sandy silt which is hard and difficult to drill thus is treated to be the base of our groundwater models berg and illman 2011b the main aquifer zone of the ncrs composed of high k sand to sandy gravel is located from 8 to 13 m below ground surface mbgs detailed descriptions of core samples indicate that the aquifer zone consists of two high k units separated by a discontinuous low k layer the thin aquitard layer separating the two aquifers is discontinuous and is known to contain stratigraphic windows allowing for hydraulic connection alexander et al 2011 situated below and above the main aquifer zone are aquitard layers composed of low k silts and clays the overlying aquitard layer also is known to contain stratigraphic windows at various locations martin and frind 1998 previous pumping tests performed at the site alexander et al 2011 indicated that the aquifer at the ncrs behaves as a confined to semi confined system 2 2 field data for building groundwater models 2 2 1 collection of core samples and laboratory analyses in previous studies by alexander et al 2011 and berg and illman 2011b four continuous multichannel tubing wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 cmt4 three multi screened wells pw1 pw3 pw5 and two well clusters pw2 pw4 were installed in an area of 15 m by 15 m at the ncrs fig 1 a is a plan view showing well locations while fig 1b provides a three dimensional perspective view of wells corresponding pumping and observation intervals as well as intervals sealed with bentonite at the site each cmt well has seven 10 cm long screens and the screens are spaced 2 m apart the upper most screens are installed between 4 5 and 5 5 mbgs and the deepest screens are placed from 16 5 to 17 5 mbgs pw1 is completed to an approximate depth of 18 m and screens are placed at eight different elevations pw3 and pw5 are multi screened at five different elevations and extends approximately to 12 mbgs pw2 and pw4 are well clusters that each consists of three separate wells and screened over a 1 m interval screen elevations for pw2 are 4 7 and 8 mbgs while screen elevations for pw4 are 5 8 5 and 11 5 mbgs during the drilling and installation of all cmt and pw wells continuous cores were collected to characterize the site geology after splitting the core into half along its length soil texture was classified based on the layering observed at the scale of the core then samples were extracted at 10 or 50 cm intervals for laboratory falling head permeameter tests specifically core samples from five wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 cmt4 and pw1 were initially tested by alexander et al 2011 and samples from the other four wells pw2 pw3 pw4 pw5 were tested by zhao and illman 2017 these k values were used in later sections to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the k estimates from different approaches along each borehole the borehole logs of the above nine wells together with additional nine wells summarized from previous work by sebol 2000 were compiled to construct a geological model for the ncrs fig 1a shows the distribution of wells from which geological information was obtained based on the soil types and corresponding depth information 19 different layers representing seven different material types were defined along all boreholes 2 2 2 description of pumping tests to date a total of 15 pumping injection tests have been conducted at the ncrs to stress the multiple aquifer aquitard system in a tomographic fashion we have summarized the details to the pumping injection tests in table s1 nine pumping tests pw1 3 pw1 4 pw1 5 pw3 3 pw3 4 pw4 3 pw5 3 pw5 4 and pw5 5 have been conducted by berg and illman 2011b for previous ht analyses berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 these pumping tests mainly stressed the aquifer layers of the ncrs since groundwater can be readily pumped from these units although pressure transducers were installed in observation ports located in aquitard layers no drawdown responses have been observed by berg and illman 2011b from the bottom ports consisting of catfish creek till berg and illman 2013 suggested that it may take several days to even weeks to induce observable drawdowns in the lower aquitard zones of the system when pumping from the aquifer zones therefore to obtain more complete drawdown information six additional pumping and injection tests were conducted by zhao and illman 2017 to directly stress the aquitard zones at pw1 1 pw1 6 pw1 7 pw2 3 pw3 1 and pw5 1 due to the low permeable nature of surrounding deposits pumping and injection tests at these six well locations were conducted at flow rates that were generally no more than 2 0 l min as shown in table s1 noticeable drawdowns 0 1 m were generally observed within 6 5 h from the ports whose elevations were similar to the pumping port except for the test at pw1 7 which lasted up to 26 5 h in particular the pw1 6 and pw1 7 intervals could only be pumped at approximately 1 0 l min such low flow rates have induced measureable drawdowns at the bottom intervals within the lower aquitard zone i e cmt 6 and 7 ports while no drawdown has been observed from the upper intervals i e cmt 1 2 3 4 and 5 ports during each pumping injection test pressure transducers were placed at all available observation intervals specifically all cmt wells from the top to bottom intervals e g cmt1 1 to cmt1 7 were instrumented with 0 15 psig model mp100 micron systems pressure transducers while the bottom intervals e g cmt1 7 cmt2 7 cmt3 7 and cmt4 7 were monitored with an electronic water level tape by berg and illman 2011b pw2 and pw4 wells were monitored with 0 5 or 0 10 psig pressure transducers model 3001 lt leveloggers junior solinst flute water systems flute ltd were installed in the multi screened pumping wells e g pw1 pw3 and pw5 during pumping injection tests a blank flute liner was installed when the wells were not being pumped each flute water system contained five vented pressure transducers level troll in situ that were designed to fit the screened intervals of pw1 pw3 and pw5 the flute systems seal off the entire well to prevent short circuiting of pressure across the multiple open screened intervals we utilized data from 12 pumping injection tests to perform the tht analysis at the ncrs data from eight tests pw1 1 pw1 4 pw1 6 pw1 7 pw2 3 pw3 3 pw4 3 and pw5 3 were selected for model calibration while the other four tests pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 were reserved for model validation test data from pw3 1 pw3 4 and pw5 1 were not selected due to the fact that drawdowns were insignificant or only observed at very few ports in addition test data affected by the noordbergum effect verruijt 1969 berg et al 2011 2015 were not included in the analysis for the data recorded by the transducers in the cmt wells a 10 point centrally weighted moving average was applied to remove the static sensor noise since the data were collected at a high frequency 4 hz at early time and 1 hz at late time the application of this filter did not significantly impact the shape of the drawdown curve three to five points were selected manually from the early intermediate and late time of each transient drawdown curve in total we selected 522 pressure head data for model calibration and used 348 head data for model validation 3 description of models used for hydraulic tomography analysis we compared three approaches different in model conceptualizations and complexities for ht analysis namely 1 the effective parameter approach both isotropic and anisotropic 2 the geological zonation approach and 3 the highly parameterized geostatistical approach in order to simulate transient groundwater flow for all models a three dimensional model with dimensions of 70 m 70 m 17 m was constructed and discretized into 31 713 variably sized rectangular finite elements we note that the groundwater flow model did not consider poroelastic effects this model was larger than the 45 m 45 m 15 m model used by berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 such a new domain on one hand was designed to incorporate additional borehole logs for constructing a site geological model on the other hand this larger model minimizes the impacts of boundary conditions when including new pumping and injection tests of longer durations the elements were gradually refined from the model boundary to the central 15 m 15 m 17 m well clustering area with the block size decreasing from 5 m 5 m 0 5 m to 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m the top and bottom faces were defined as no flow boundaries due to the presence of low k units at the top and bottom areas of the modeling domain while constant heads were assigned to the remaining boundaries 3 1 case 1 effective parameter approach we first estimated the effective k and ss values for the multiple aquifer aquitard system by coupling the groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs therrien et al 2005 with the parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 two cases were considered in this approach case 1a treated the aquifer aquitard system as homogeneous isotropic in which only the effective k and ss values were estimated case 1b treated the system as being homogeneous anisotropic and the effective kx ky kz and ss values were estimated the initial values of k and kx ky kz were 8 0 10 6 m s with a minimum bound of 1 0 10 10 m s and a maximum bound of 1 0 10 1 m s the initial value of ss in both cases 1a and 1b was 1 0 10 4 m with minimum and maximum bounds of 1 0 10 8 m and 1 0 10 3 m respectively these initial values were geometric means of individual k and ss estimates obtained by berg and illman 2011b through matching the transient drawdown curve at each observation port for a pumping test conducted at pw1 3 3 2 case 2 geological zonation approach as introduced previously borehole logs of 18 wells completed to different depths were compiled based on determined soil type information in total 19 different layers representing seven different material types were defined along all boreholes to investigate the value of geological data for tht data interpretation we constructed a three dimensional geological model with dimensions of 70 m 70 m 17 m using a commercial software leapfrog hydro aranz geo limited 2015 leapfrog hydro utilizes the fast radial basis function method which is an effective way of implementing dual kriging to interpolate stratigraphy between boreholes based on the known geological layering information from available wells fig 2 shows four cross sections a a b b c c and d d as indicated in fig 1a extracted along different directions among the central nine wells to illustrate the interpolated geological layers we also present the locations of wells and screens for cross sections c c and d d based on the interpolated stratigraphy two geological models were built 1 a 5 layer geological model case 2a constructed by merging some layers with low k material specifically layers 1 through 10 as layer 1 layers 12 through 14 as layer 12 and layers 16 through 19 as layer 16 and 2 a 19 layer geological model case 2b to take full advantage of the available stratigraphy information both geological models were then utilized to create groundwater flow models using the same grid as described earlier calibrations of the 5 layer case 2a and the 19 layer case 2b geological models were also performed by coupling hgs with pest for both model calibrations the initial k value was set as 8 0 10 6 m s for all layers with a minimum bound of 1 0 10 10 m s and a maximum bound of 1 0 10 1 m s while the initial ss value was 1 0 10 4 m with minimum and maximum bounds of 1 0 10 8 m and 1 0 10 2 m respectively in both cases 2a and 2b the estimated parameters were treated to be uniform and isotopic in each layer 3 3 case 3 geostatistical inversion approach we analyzed the eight pumping tests using the geostatistics based simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code developed by xiang et al 2009 simsle inverts all the data sets simultaneously thus providing more constraints to the inverse problem xiang et al 2009 compared to the sequential inversion approach yeh and liu 2000 the model domain used for the simsle is identical to the one introduced for the other models and we assume that each element is isotropic during the estimation process in simsle natural log values of hydraulic parameters i e ln k and ln ss are treated as stochastic processes and the corresponding unconditional means spatial covariance functions and structure parameters correlation scales λx λy λz and the variances σ lnk 2 σ lnss 2 of hydraulic parameters are assumed to be known a priori the inversion process starts with cokriging using available measurements of hydraulic property and pressure heads to produce the conditional property field the stochastic conditional means of these parameters are used for predictions of pressure heads at observation ports the cokriged parameter field is then iteratively updated by simsle to minimize the differences between observed and simulated heads in this study the exponential covariance model is adopted for the parameter fields the initial correlation scales of the k and ss fields are assumed as λx λy 4 m λz 0 5 m and the variances are set to σlnk 2 σlnss 2 5 0 which are the values used in previous ht studies at the ncrs berg and illman 2011b 2013 zhao and illman 2017 other initial inputs to the inverse model include initial guesses for the k and ss fields zhao et al 2016 and luo et al 2017 through laboratory sandbox experiments as well as zhao and illman 2017 through their field study found that the geostatistical inversion approach using a geological model as prior information preserved geological features where drawdown measurements were lacking compared to using a homogenous k as a prior therefore we considered four scenarios cases 3a 3b 3c and 3d different in the initial guesses of k for the geostatistical inversion approach to meet our study purposes in case 3a the inversion starts with homogenous mean fields of k 8 0 10 6 m s and ss 1 0 10 4 m 1 which are the same as the initial values used in the effective parameter and geological zonation approaches for the other three cases cases 3b 3d heterogeneous mean k fields based on geological zonations are used as prior information specifically inverse estimations of k and ss distributions in cases 3b and 3c start with the estimated k values from model calibrations of cases 2a and 2b respectively in case 3d instead of starting from the calibrated k fields we use the 19 layer geological model populated with permeameter tested k values as the prior mean k distribution these permeameter test k values are geometric means calculated from laboratory measurements of soil samples located in the same layer of the geological model shown in table s2 supplementary information section for the layers that have no core sample data measurements of similar soil material are assigned 4 results and discussions 4 1 model calibration results tht analysis of eight tests for the effective parameter and geological zonation approaches were performed on a pc with a quad core cpu and 24 gb of ram the computational time increased with model complexity specifically case 1a took less than 2 5 h and case 1b took approximately 4 5 h calibration of the 5 layer geological model case 2a took approximately 11 5 h while the calibration of the 19 layer geological model case 2b was completed in seven days after 1075 pest model calls to estimate 38 unknowns note here that each model call consisted of transient forward simulation of eight tests and pest optimization sequentially which took about 9 5 min using a single cpu this long computational time could have been reduced if a parallel computing environment was implemented on the other hand geostatistical inversions cases 3a 3d using simsle were performed on a pc cluster using 16 processors with 192 gb of ram and all cases of the geostatistical inversion approach converged within two days 4 1 1 case 1 effective parameter approach the estimated k and ss values as well as their corresponding posterior 95 confidence intervals of the effective parameter models are summarized in table 1 examination of table 1 reveals that when treating the medium to be homogeneous isotropic case 1a yields a k value of 2 38 10 5 m s and a ss value of 9 34 10 6 m for the homogeneous anisotropic case case 1b kx ky and kz are estimated as 1 85 10 5 m s 2 55 10 5 m s and 3 77 10 7 m s respectively and ss is estimated as 1 39 10 5 m when the medium is treated to be homogeneous the estimated parameters are found to vary with the observation and pumping locations e g wen and chen 2006 liu et al 2007 huang et al 2011 by individually calibrating one anisotropic effective parameter model to four pumping test berg and illman 2015 estimated that kx ranged between 4 0 10 6 and 2 9 10 5 m s depending on the pumping locations ky ranged between 4 8 10 6 and 7 3 10 5 m s kz ranged between 3 0 10 8 and 1 0 10 6 m s and ss ranged between 1 0 10 7 and 6 8 10 4 m by performing grain size analyses of 270 core samples and permeameter test analyses for 471 core samples alexander et al 2011 obtained k estimates ranging from 3 2 10 11 m s to 2 5 10 3 m s and from 5 8 10 10 m s to 2 8 10 4 m s respectively our estimates of k and ss fall within the range of these previous studies suggesting the validity of the estimated values for cases 1a and 1b in a recent ssht study at the ncrs zhao and illman 2017 simultaneously calibrated the same effective parameter models but used steady state and quasi steady state data from seven pumping tests the estimated effective k value was 8 43 10 6 m s for the isotropic case for their anisotropic case kx ky kz were estimated as 1 04 10 5 m s 1 19 10 5 m s and 6 37 10 7 m s respectively through controlled sandbox studies illman et al 2015 concluded that when calibrated to a large number of observation data from multiple pumping tests instead of data from an individual pumping test the effective groundwater model yields improved drawdown predictions for pumping tests not used in the calibration effort yeh et al 2015 also stated that in order to predict the average spatial trend of observed heads in a heterogeneous aquifer many head measurements distributed in the aquifer must be used so that the effective hydraulic properties of the equivalent homogeneous groundwater model could be determined compared to all previous ht studies at the ncrs the tht analysis performed in this study included transient data from additional pumping tests performed in aquitard layers instead of selecting only one data point from each curve for the steady state case zhao and illman 2017 or transient data only from individual pumping tests berg and illman 2015 consequently the differences between the effective values of the current study and those of previous studies could be attributed to the inclusion of more transient drawdown data meanwhile we can expect that the estimated k and ss values to be more representative of the heterogeneous properties of the multiple aquifer aquitard system in an averaged sense than those obtained from previous ht studies 4 1 2 case 2 geological modeling approach calibrations of the geological models are performed by treating each layer to be homogeneous and isotropic the estimated k and ss distributions are plotted in figs 3 a and 4a for the 5 layer model and in figs 3b and 4b for the 19 layer model respectively the estimated values and their 95 confidence intervals are summarized in tables 2 and 3 as previously noted the main aquifer zone of the ncrs consists of two high k units separated by a thin discontinuous aquitard layer situated below and above the aquifer zone are aquitard layers composed mainly of low k silts and clays calibration results of the 5 layer geological model case 2a fig 3a and table 2 reveal that a high k value is estimated for the sand and gravel layer 15 of the aquifer zone in the middle model domain while relatively low k values are obtained for the merged aquitard layers 12 and 16 which consist of low permeable silt and clay for the merged layer 1 containing both low permeable silt and clay and high permeable sand layers the k estimate is close to the initial value of 8 0 10 6 m s which could be a result of using only one geological layer to represent multiple soil types however sand layer 11 expected to have a high k has the lowest k value among the five layers as shown in fig 3a which is inconsistent with geological data through a controlled laboratory sandbox study zhao et al 2016 showed that the estimated k values for some layers of a simplified geological model by merging layers of similar material can also be inconsistent with permeameter test values therefore this kind of inconsistency could potentially result through the use of a less complex geological model for the ncrs aquifer and aquitard system which contains both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity when the 19 layer geological model is used for model calibration we see from fig 3b and table 3 that although the general distribution pattern of k is similar to fig 3a there are more variations in k values compared to the 5 layer model specifically in the upper part of model domain low k layers are more clearly recovered in fig 3b the estimated ss values are found to vary in the range of 2 29 10 7 m and 9 28 10 6 m for the 5 layer geological model while for the 19 layer geological model ss varies between 1 02 10 6 m and 5 88 10 3 m in fig 4 a ss estimates obtained by calibrating the 5 layer geological model show a pattern of an obviously low value assigned to the top portion of the domain which may have resulted by merging layers 1 through 10 in contrast the ss distribution estimated by calibrating the 19 layer geological model case 2b shows a pattern with high ss values at the top and bottom areas and relatively low values in the central domain more specifically the estimated ss values for layers 17 and 18 are one order of magnitude higher than ss estimates of the other layers during the previous site characterization effort at the ncrs alexander et al 2011 obtained a range of ss estimates between 2 6 10 8 m and 3 8 10 3 m with a geometric mean of 3 1 10 5 m through type curve analyses of 11 individual drawdown curves from observation intervals when pumping at well pw1 4 by treating the medium to be homogeneous although the highest ss value 5 88 10 3 m for layer 18 of our case 2b is slightly higher it is still in a reasonable range from 9 19 10 4 m to 2 03 10 2 m as reported in batu 1998 for clayey material in later sections all these estimates are evaluated by comparing the performances of model calibrations and validations in terms of the reliability of estimated parameters tables 2 and 3 reveal that the estimated 95 confidence intervals of k and or ss are relatively large for some layers e g layers 1 and 11 in case 2a and layers 1 2 3 5 17 18 and 19 for case 2b which could be a result of merging layers and fixing the layer geometry during model calibrations pest then forcefully estimates k and ss for each layer and does not truncate the confidence intervals at the maximum and minimum bounds as assigned to parameters doherty 2005 the 95 confidence intervals are calculated on the basis of the linearity assumption that is used to derive the equations for parameter improvement in each optimization iteration while the relationships between hydraulic head and hydraulic parameters are non linear thus a breakdown in the underpinning linearity assumption considered to calculate the confidence intervals may exaggerate the widths of the confidence intervals christensen 1997 blessent et al 2011 meanwhile unreasonably large confidence intervals imply that information or measurements provided for the optimization process are insufficient to uniquely determine these parameters doherty 2005 therefore another possible reason for the unreasonably large confidence intervals in tables 2 and 3 is that relatively few observations or even no observation data are available for layers in which the hydraulic parameters are estimated as indicated in fig 2 large confidence intervals of k estimates were also found in a sandbox study for different geological models zhao et al 2016 however confidence interval widths have been found to be reduced by providing prior information of estimated parameters christensen 1997 blessent et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 4 1 3 case 3 geostatistical inversion approach four scenarios are considered in the geostatistical inversion approach cases 3a 3d to test the impact of using different prior information for parameter estimations specifically case 3a starts with homogenous prior mean k and ss fields cases 3b and 3c use heterogeneous prior mean k information based on geological zonations and estimated k and ss values from model calibrations of cases 2a and 2b respectively in case 3d the 19 layer geological model populated with k values obtained from permeameter tests is used as the prior mean k distribution the l2 norm changes are plotted in the supplementary section as fig s1 we select inversion results from iteration step 110 at which the l2 norm has stabilized indicating the convergence of the inversion process as suggested by xiang et al 2009 the estimated k and ss fields for all four cases are shown in figs 3c f and 4c f respectively in addition k estimates along the a a b b c c and d d cross sections as indicated on fig 1a are extracted from the estimated k distributions of cases 2 and 3 figs s3 s4 s5 and s6 in the supplementary information section meanwhile to facilitate the qualitative comparison of the site geology with the tht results from cases 2 and 3 stratigraphy slices along a a b b c c and d d cross sections fig 2 are included as figs s3g s6g in fig 3c case 3a we find that the estimated k distribution clearly shows the double aquifer feature in the centre of the modeling domain more importantly the bottom aquitard is now correctly identified as a low k zone instead of a high k zone as mapped in previous ht studies at the ncrs berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 zhao and illman 2017 when inversions relied solely on drawdown data unlike the previous works by berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 in which they used no drawdowns observed from the low k layers and the work by zhao and illman 2017 in which only limited number of steady state and quasi steady state drawdowns were used for the ssht analysis we used more transient data from the low k zone obtained through additional pumping tests conducted at pw1 6 and pw1 7 thus we fed the inverse analysis with additional drawdown responses from the low k clay layers which carry non redundant information regarding heterogeneity of the field site oliver 1993 wu et al 2005 mao et al 2013a the above results indicate that in order to obtain accurate k tomograms it is necessary for future field implementations of ht to monitor drawdowns from both aquifer and aquitard layers otherwise k estimates from permeameter berg and illman 2015 and or slug single hole tests could be used to condition the k tomogram alternatively complementary information other than pressure heads will have to be considered for jointly calibrating a geostatistical inverse model with pressure head data in ht analysis such as with flowmeter tests li et al 2008 zha et al 2014 seismic brauchler et al 2012 and or self potential surveys soueid ahmed et al 2014 other types of data may also be used for improving the inverse model as discussed by illman 2014 but this needs to be done carefully the estimated k distributions for cases 3b and 3c in which the calibrated geological models are included as prior mean k fields in the simsle inversion are shown in figs 3d and e respectively we see from case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d that the locations of high and low k zones in the domain centre are quite similar to those of case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c whereas the zone shapes outside the centre are quite different specifically a comparison of cases 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c and 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d reveals that 1 the low k zones at the top of model domain are similar in terms of locations and shapes 2 the high and low k layers at the middle of model domain are recovered only for the central 15 m 15 m area for case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c while heterogeneity features extend to domain boundaries for case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d and 3 the bottom aquitard layer is more clearly shown throughout the entire domain for case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d similar findings are evident when comparing case 3c figs 3e and s3e s6e with case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c in which the 19 layer geological model fig 3b is used as prior information for case 3c instead of the 5 layer model fig 3a as noted in section 4 1 2 the calibration of the 5 layer geological model yields a k value that is inconsistent with geological data for sand layer 11 due to the simplification of the geology and fixing the stratigraphy geometry a comparison of estimated k tomograms between cases 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a and 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d reveals that the low k zone representing layer 11 z 10 m in case 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a is preserved in case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d for regions near domain boundaries where no pumping test data are available since simsle iteratively updates the prior k fields based on the differences between simulated and observed pressure heads xiang et al 2009 it is reasonable that some stratigraphic features from prior k distributions are preserved in the estimated k tomograms where the monitoring ports are not dense enough as shown through the comparison of cases 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a and 2b figs 3b and s3b s6b the inconsistency between the estimated k value of the 5 layer model and geological data has to some extent been ameliorated when using the higher resolution 19 layer geological model for tht meanwhile refinement to the resolution of the k tomogram is evident within the central 15 m 15 m area for cases 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d and 3c figs 3e and s3e s6e when compared to the k tomograms for cases 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a and 2b figs 3b and s3b s6b this is due to the sequential updating of the calibrated parameter fields with the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach the estimated k distribution for case 3d is shown in figs 3f and s3f s6f we note from figs 3f and s3f s6f that the estimated k tomogram captures the double layer aquifer feature of the multi aquifer aquitard system as seen from the other three cases 3a 3b and 3c however the very top and bottom areas in case 3d figs 3f and s3f s6f are now more clearly recovered as low permeable zones than those in case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d and case 3c figs 3e and s3e s6e as previously mentioned case 3d uses the 19 layer geological model with each layer populated with the geometric mean of k values from the same layer obtained via permeameter tests as the prior mean k distribution for the simsle inversion this case represents a particular scenario which utilized the most field i e drawdowns and geological information and laboratory i e permeameter k data consequently we anticipate that case 3d to perform the best for purposes of model validation discussed later the estimated k tomograms of cases 3a through 3d collectively suggest that when more accurate geological data are incorporated into the inversion process the geostatistical approach yields a heterogeneity pattern more consistent with stratigraphy figs s3g s6g in areas both near and far away from the pumping and observation wells without incorporating additional data such as flowmeter and or geophysical surveys while the incorporation of geological data leads to more details in heterogeneity being recovered through simsle inversions we note that the 19 layer geological model and the stratigraphy map are also interpolated from borehole logs thus likely differ from the true stratigraphy therefore the ssht study by zhao et al 2016 and tht study by luo et al 2017 in the laboratory sandbox where stratigraphy could be accurately mapped were necessary in providing important insights on the usefulness of geological data for field ht analyses both studies found that ht analysis using accurate geological models yields results that are comparable to the highly parameterized geostatistical inverse models meanwhile the estimated ss tomograms for cases 3a 3d are shown in figs 4c f respectively we see from figs 4c f that although different prior mean k distributions are used for the four geostatistical inversion cases the estimated ss tomograms in general do not reveal too many differences all showing high values at the top and bottom of the domain while low values are found in the central portion physically this is reasonable since the top and bottom areas of the modeling domain are known to consist of low k silt and clay layers for which the ss values are considered to be relatively higher batu 1998 than the middle double aquifer layer materials in comparison to the k tomograms figs 3c f and s3 s6 the ss tomograms figs 4c f are very smooth and do not reflect the aquitard layers known to be present in the middle of the double layer aquifer zone as indicated in the geological model fig 2 these results suggest that pumping test data alone cannot yield finer resolution heterogeneity for ss estimates with current pumping and observation density additional information on ss will be needed to obtain estimates at finer resolutions and this will be a future research topic 4 2 performances of model calibrations performances of different approaches are next evaluated by comparing the simulated versus observed drawdowns of eight pumping tests used for model calibrations as plotted in figs 5 a h a linear model is fit and included in each plot to assess the performance generally the fit improves from the simple homogeneous models cases 1a and 1b to the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion models cases 3a through 3d with values of the coefficient of determination r2 increasing from 0 34 to 0 87 and the slopes of the linear model increasing from 0 19 to 0 87 this is consistent with the results obtained by zhao and illman 2017 whom calibrated the same models but to steady state and quasi steady state drawdown data next model calibration performances of the different tht analysis approaches are quantitatively assessed by comparing the mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 norms those quantities are computed as 1 l 1 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i l 2 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i 2 where n is the total number of pressure heads used for calibration ψ i is the ith observation head and ψ i is the corresponding simulated head the l1 and l2 norms of model calibrations as well as the corresponding ranks for all cases are provided in fig s2 of the supplementary information section the cells of each entry in the table are color coded to facilitate an easier comparison of different entries in particular we assign the minimum value in the table a color of green the maximum value a color of red and the 60 percentile value a color of yellow we utilize a 60 percentile value instead of the median to enhance the contrast in color we also calculate the arithmetic mean of the l1 and l2 norms to rank the various models examination of fig s2 reveals that model calibrations of the geostatistical inversion approach yield consistently better l1 and l2 ranking than the geological and effective parameter models such improvements could be attributed to the use of highly parameterized models which have larger degrees of freedom to adjust the model parameters to better fit the observation data in the previous ssht study for a sandbox illman et al 2015 the geological model faithfully representing the true stratigraphy was found to yield a model calibration result that was similar in quality when compared to the highly parameterized geostatistical model here the large difference of model calibration performances between the 19 layer geological model case 2b and the geostatistical models cases 3a 3d could be attributed to 1 the imperfect knowledge of geological zonations since we are using stratigraphy information interpolated from discrete borehole logs 2 calibration of a 19 layer geological model with transient data instead with steady state data as in illman et al 2015 3 the ncrs site is highly heterogeneous with the variance σ 2 lnk estimated to be 6 50 alexander et al 2011 while the variance σ 2 lnk of the sandbox investigated by illman et al 2015 is much lower estimated to be between 0 38 and 1 32 depending on the approach used for characterization berg and illman 2011a comparisons among different geostatistical inverse models in figs 5 and s2 reveal that when the geostatistical inversion approach starts from the geologically distributed k fields cases 3b 3c and 3d instead of the uniform k value case 3a the calibration performances are generally improved as indicated by the fitting parameters r2 l1 and l2 of the linear model previously berg and illman 2015 performed a comparative study of different traditional methods with tht in terms of characterizing the heterogeneity of the aquifer aquitard system specifically in order to correctly identify the low k clayey zones near the bottom of the modeling domain they conditioned the geostatistical model to the permeameter k data by fixing the k values of computational elements along five boreholes pw1 cmt1 to cmt4 during the inversion process although the estimated k distributions were found to be consistent with known geology the tht inversions also yielded slight deterioration in model calibration when permeameter k data were used to condition the model unlike the approach adopted by berg and illman 2015 geological information was used as the starting k distributions of the geostatistical inversions in this study and in zhao and illman 2017 thus the improved model calibration of cases 3b 3c and 3d compared to case 3a shown in fig 5 is a result of both including reliable geological data and enabling the pumping tests data to freely update the prior mean values here we need to clarify that due to the availability of a large number of borehole logs and laboratory measurement data at the ncrs the geological model based on the interpolation between wells may be more reliable in contrast at other sites the well network may be sparse and the geological data could contain large errors e g layer boundary locations zone structures misidentification of layers etc under such circumstances a general framework proposed by zha et al 2017 that allows the inclusion of site specific geologic features hydraulic properties as well as their associated uncertainties could be adopted to further improve ht results their framework adopts a nested covariance function to conceptualize the site heterogeneity which requires site specific geological information at both small and large scales to construct the prior mean and covariance unlike the approach proposed by zha et al 2017 the approach that we utilize in this study uses kriging of borehole data to construct geological models and is very practical 4 3 comparison of estimated k with permeameter test k in order to further examine the ability of geological and geostatistical inverse models to capture the heterogeneity of the ncrs the estimated k values are extracted from the tht tomograms and compared with permeameter test k values along all pw and cmt wells figs 6 and s7 meanwhile the k estimates from ssht analyses of seven pumping tests by zhao and illman 2017 are jointly plotted as red lines in figs 6 and s7 to provide direct comparisons with the tht estimates as seen in figs 6 and s7 calibrations of the 5 layer and 19 layer geological models to eight pumping tests yield k estimates blue lines that generally follow the vertical variations of permeameter test k values black dashed lines with dots however the intralayer heterogeneity in k values of each unit is not captured by both geological models due to the assumption of constant k values in each layer still the k profile estimated by the 19 layer geological model reveals more variations than the simplified 5 layer geological model we also see that the results of eight test tht analysis blue lines are quite similar to those of the seven test ssht steady state analysis red lines although there are minor differences this finding suggests that both geological models with low degrees of parameterizations for this highly heterogeneous site may be justified schöniger et al 2015 given the availability of multiple pumping test data to conduct the inverse modeling at the ncrs on the other hand the calibration of the highly parameterized geostatistical inverse model starting from the uniform mean k field case 3a captures the overall changes in the k profiles from the top to the bottom of all pw and cmt wells the most striking improvement is that the transient inversion results blue lines fit the permeameter k measurements quite well at depths of 0 5 m and 10 15 m above the bottom of the modeling domain whereas relatively high k values red lines are obtained by zhao and illman 2017 when only using steady state data this result indicates that the inclusion of additional pumping tests conducted at aquitard layers i e pw1 1 pw1 6 and pw1 7 and more transient drawdown data into the inversion has led to the correct identification of aquitard zones and the improved characterization of intralayer k heterogeneity in cases 3b 3c and 3d the geologically distributed prior k mean fields are used as starting values for the geostatistical inversion approach compared to the results of case 3a in figs 6 and s7 cases 3b 3c and 3d yield k profiles that are more consistent with the permeameter test k values in terms of the locations and thicknesses of aquifer and aquitard layers that is the boundaries between aquifer and aquitard layers are better delineated in cases 3b 3c and 3d than those in case 3a meanwhile unlike the significant differences between the results of steady state and transient analyses in case 3a the blue and red lines representing the vertical k variations in cases 3b 3c and 3d in general show satisfactory matches especially for cases 3c and 3d in which 19 layer geological models are used as prior k distributions these results collectively suggest that the inverse modeling of transient pumping test data can yield reliable heterogeneous distributions of k for both aquifer and aquitards including its intralayer heterogeneity even at a highly heterogeneous site such as at the ncrs joint inverse modeling of transient drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard layers is necessary in accurately characterizing the site with a highly parameterized geostatistical approach moreover using reliable geological models as initial distributions are helpful for the geostatistical inversion approach of tht in improving the correspondence of estimated k for both the aquifer and aquitard layers to those from permeameter tests 4 4 model validation results we next evaluate the performances of different models in their abilities of predicting pumping tests not used during the calibration process as previously noted four pumping tests pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 are selected for model validation purposes the drawdown predictions of different models and various tests are plotted as figs 7 pw1 3 s8 pw1 5 s9 pw5 4 and s10 pw5 5 meanwhile the simulated drawdowns are extracted at selected times and compared with corresponding observed drawdowns to provide more quantitative comparisons figs 8 and s11 in figs 7 s8 s9 and s10 the drawdown predictions of the homogeneous isotropic model case 1a solid gray lines the homogeneous anisotropic model case 1b dashed gray lines the 5 layer geological model case 2a dash dotted gray lines the 19 layer geological model case 2b dotted black lines and different geostatistical models cases 3a 3d lines in red color are compared to the drawdowns observed solid blue lines with open circles from different locations of the aquifer aquitard system through visual examinations of the match quality between different simulated drawdowns to observed curves in fig 7 for the pumping test at pw1 3 we find that geostatistical models of case 3 yield drawdown predictions that are close to each other and in general capture the blue lines observed from different observation intervals in contrast obvious poor matches are found between drawdown predictions of the homogeneous models solid and dashed gray lines and the observations blue lines either at early time or late time of the drawdown curves on the other hand the simplified 5 layer geological model case 2a consistently over predicts the drawdowns for observation ports e g cmt1 1 cmt2 1 and pw5 1 located within the top layer of the aquifer aquitard system and also yield poor matches to the blue curves in the rest of observation intervals as the homogeneous models cases 1a and 1b when the complex 19 layer geological model case 2b is used the match qualities improve for drawdown predictions over the 5 layer model case 2a at several observation intervals the matches are comparable to those of the highly parameterized geostatistical models cases 3a 3d in fig 8 the observed drawdowns are compared to the simulated values selected from different monitoring intervals and times indicated by blue circles in figs 7 s8 s9 and s10 the linear fits show that the homogeneous isotropic model case 1a yields biased predictions fig 8a and underestimates the drawdowns of four pumping tests with a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 23 and a slope of 0 08 for the linear model fit the prediction results are improved slightly when using either the homogeneous anisotropic model case 1b or the simplified 5 layer geological model case 2a as shown in figs 8b and c in addition performances of the 19 layer geological model case 2b show obvious improvements over the above three models cases 1a 1b and 2a with the r2 and the slope of the linear model fit increasing to 0 65 and 1 15 respectively it is worth noting that the 19 layer geological model case 2b performed closely to the geostatistical inversion approach case 3a starting with k 8 0 10 6 m s as a prior mean on the other hand compared to the effective parameter cases 1a and 1b and the geological modeling cases 2a and 2b approaches models of the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach using geologically distributed k prior means cases 3b 3d yield consistently improved r2 and l1 while the l2 ranking behaves differently the lowest l2 norm is reached by the geostatistical inversion model using the calibrated 19 layer geological model as prior k distribution case 3c since the l2 norm magnifies large discrepancies between the simulated and the observed drawdowns compared to the l1 norm the high l2 norm values in cases 3a 3b and 3d mainly represent the impact of poor fittings of drawdowns at several observation intervals such as at cmt2 2 and pw3 3 in fig 7 such an inconsistent l2 ranking among cases 3a 3d indicate that while the k fig 3 and ss fig 4 tomograms show similar overall patterns the fine scale differences in these k and ss tomograms could lead to drastically different drawdown predictions at some observation intervals thus the geostatistical inversion approach that can correctly capture both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity should be more favored for future ht applications 5 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated whether transient drawdown data collected in both the aquifer and aquitard units can be used in transient hydraulic tomography tht analysis to reliably map the interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of these units at a field site underlain by a highly heterogeneous multi aquifer aquitard system in addition we examined the value of geological data for tht analysis by constructing geological zonation models based on available stratigraphy information and using them as prior distributions for the geostatistical inversion approach we selected 12 pumping tests for model calibration and validation eight tests containing hydraulic response information observed in aquifer and aquitard layers are jointly used to calibrate groundwater models of different complexities and parameterization schemes including 1 two effective parameter models isotropic anisotropic 2 two geological zonation models of varying numbers of layers and 3 four highly parameterized geostatistical inverse models that consider different prior k means our study resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 despite the large number of data used for model calibration the effective parameter models calibrated to eight pumping tests yielded biased calibration and validation results in contrast tht analyses based on geological models and highly parameterized geostatistical models led to much improved model calibration and drawdown prediction performances this suggests that it may be difficult to represent site heterogeneity with an effective parameter model at the scale of site investigation conducted at the ncrs 2 although the layer boundaries were fixed geological models calibrated to eight pumping test data yielded k estimates that were close to the general patterns of vertical k distributions from permeameter tests meanwhile the calibration of the geostatistical inversion model to drawdown data with initially uniform hydraulic parameter fields correctly recovered both the low and high k zones within the well field although smoothed results were obtained for areas where no drawdown data were available 3 instead of using an effective k estimate calibrated groundwater models based on geological zonation used as an initial guess was very helpful for the geostatistical inversion approach in improving the correspondence of estimated k to those from permeameter tests and in preserving geological features connectivity in k heterogeneity patterns different from the previous hydraulic tomography study by zhao and illman 2017 who relied on steady state inversions the joint inverse modeling of transient drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard layers yielded reliable heterogeneous distributions of k and ss for both aquifer and aquitards even at a highly heterogeneous site 4 we conclude that the inclusion of reliable geological data is useful for tht analysis to better image the full heterogeneity patterns of complex groundwater systems in addition sufficiently long records of pumping and observation data should be collected not only from aquifer layers but also from aquitard layers for future ht studies when relying only on pumping test data 5 collection of long drawdown records will require the judicious selection of data that should be fed into inverse models to avoid information overload and inclusion of redundant as well as erroneous data therefore it is necessary to systematically examine the quality of data the information content of observed heads from both high and low k zones as well as the value of other types of complementary data data worth estimation methods such as the preposterior data impact assessor predia leube et al 2012 and the linear predictive uncertainty quantification predunc utility wöhling et al 2016 may be applied to evaluate monitoring strategies and to identify potentially redundant information both of which can potentially improve the quality of ht analyses acknowledgements this

7391,previous studies have shown that geostatistics based transient hydraulic tomography tht is robust for subsurface heterogeneity characterization through the joint inverse modeling of multiple pumping tests however the hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss estimates can be smooth or even erroneous for areas where pumping observation densities are low this renders the imaging of interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of highly contrasting materials including their unit boundaries difficult in this study we further test the performance of tht by utilizing existing and newly collected pumping test data of longer durations that showed drawdown responses in both aquifer and aquitard units at a field site underlain by a highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposit the robust performance of the tht is highlighted through the comparison of different degrees of model parameterization including 1 the effective parameter approach 2 the geological zonation approach relying on borehole logs and 3 the geostatistical inversion approach considering different prior information with without geological data results reveal that the simultaneous analysis of eight pumping tests with the geostatistical inverse model yields the best results in terms of model calibration and validation we also find that the joint interpretation of long term drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard units is necessary in mapping their full heterogeneous patterns including intralayer variabilities moreover as geological data are included as prior information in the geostatistics based tht analysis the estimated k values increasingly reflect the vertical distribution patterns of permeameter estimated k in both aquifer and aquitard units finally the comparison of various tht approaches reveals that differences in the estimated k and ss tomograms result in significantly different transient drawdown predictions at observation ports keywords hydraulic tomography subsurface heterogeneity aquitard characterization model calibration and validation inverse modeling model comparison 1 introduction investigations of groundwater problems have relied heavily on the accurate knowledge of the subsurface parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss usually these hydraulic properties are determined by fitting pumping test data from individual tests to analytical solutions with the assumption that the subsurface is homogeneous estimates of such traditional analyses can yield biased parameter estimates e g wu et al 2005 wen et al 2010 illman et al 2010 alexander et al 2011 huang et al 2011 berg and illman 2011a b 2013 2015 due to the fact that the subsurface is heterogeneous at multiple scales alternatively small scale measurements of cores slug single hole and flowmeter tests require a large number of measurements in order to adequately characterize the subsurface heterogeneity thus carrera et al 2005 advocated the more common use of inverse models to estimate hydraulic parameters based on observations of ambient hydraulic heads artificial changes in heads as well as other data such as solute concentration through either stochastic or deterministic groundwater flow and transport models pool et al 2015 among the various techniques to characterize the subsurface pumping tests are considered to yield large scale estimates of hydraulic parameters through the interpretation of drawdowns in both aquifer and aquitard layers however drawdown responses to such tests are only typically monitored in aquifers in addition as the tests are usually not run long enough drawdown signals are detected only in high k zones connected to the pumped interval leading to parameter estimates only for aquifers fogg and zhang 2016 neuzil 1994 1986 while the characterization of aquifers is important the same applies to low k zones and aquitards and their connectivity for groundwater resource evaluation e g gurwin and lubczynski 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 solute transport e g johnson et al 1989 hendry and wassenaar 2000 land subsidence galloway and burbey 2011 zhuang et al 2017a b and also waste storage montazer and wilson 1984 neuzil 1994 aquitard hydraulic parameters are typically obtained by performing laboratory permeameter tests together with consolidation tests on small scale samples e g keller et al 1989 alexander et al 2011 however laboratory tests can yield hydraulic parameter estimates that may not be representative of field conditions as reviewed by van der kamp 2001 field testing methods for aquitard characterization include the analysis of slug and pumping tests e g neuman and witherspoon 1972 keller et al 1989 monitoring of pore pressure changes and settlement due to surface loading van der kamp and maathuis 1985 as well as monitoring of seasonal head fluctuations davis 1972 keller et al 1989 van der kamp 2001 noted that the most common methods provide only a one dimensional value of hydraulic diffusivity α kv ss of the aquitard where kv vertical hydraulic conductivity and a value of kv is inferred by relying on a laboratory estimate of ss he also noted that laboratory estimates of ss are typically several orders of magnitude larger than those estimated in the field the commingled use of field and laboratory values can be problematic and can result in inaccurate estimates of kv other information such as land subsidence data recorded by multiple vertical extensometers e g cleveland et al 1992 zhuang et al 2015 2017b could also be analyzed to determine aquitard hydraulic parameters however despite its importance very little work has been done to map the variability of hydraulic parameters in aquitards this may partly be a result of significant difficulties in obtaining even a single reliable hydraulic parameter estimate of aquitard units notwithstanding their heterogeneities clearly new methods are necessary for obtaining more reliable hydraulic parameter estimates within aquitards and mapping heterogeneities within them hydraulic tomography ht has become a mature inverse modeling technique to map both high and low k features of the subsurface it relies on the joint inverse modeling of multiple sets of pressure heads that are obtained from different observation intervals while pumping and or injecting water at different locations of target aquifers thus far ht has been investigated by several research groups through synthetic studies e g yeh and liu 2000 bohling et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 2006 cardiff et al 2009 2013 liu and kitanidis 2011 mao et al 2013b

field scale bohling et al 2007 cardiff et al 2009 2012 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 brauchler et al 2011 hochstetler et al 2016 paradis et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 compared to traditional aquifer characterization approaches ht has shown to be superior in recovering the heterogeneity as well as predicting independent pumping tests not used for model calibration illman et al 2010 2015 berg and illman 2011a b 2015 in order to interpret multiple pumping and observation data from ht tests different inverse modeling methods have been developed two most frequently used inverse modeling algorithms are the quasi linear geostatistical approach ql kitanidis 1995 and the successive linear estimator sle yeh et al 1996 both of which rely on the cross covariance between hydraulic head and aquifer parameters e g yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011a b cardiff and barrash 2011 mao et al 2013b alternatively the kalman filter kf as well as its low rank versions such as the ensemble kf e g nowak 2009 li et al 2012 schöniger et al 2012 generalized compressed state kf e g kitanidis 2015 li et al 2015 and the spectral kf e g ghorbanidehno et al 2015 2017 have also been increasingly used for hydraulic parameter estimation through a bayesian framework to continuously assimilate hydraulic head and or concentration data for the majority of the above ht studies geostatistics forms the backbone of various inverse methods while the geostatistics based ht offers many advantages yeh and šimůnek 2002 it could produce overly smooth distributions of subsurface heterogeneity when only few pumping tests and monitoring data are available yeh and liu 2000 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2017 for example in the field studies at the north campus research site ncrs located on the university of waterloo campus in waterloo ontario canada both the tht berg and illman 2011b and steady state hydraulic tomography ssht berg and illman 2013 analyses of four pumping tests captured the most salient heterogeneity patterns of the highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposits however despite the relatively large number of monitoring intervals installed within the well field stratigraphic boundaries between aquifer and aquitard units were ambiguous more importantly high k values were estimated for the lower portion of the model domain where the known geology indicates the presence of an aquitard consisting of clay berg and illman 2011b 2013 pointed out that little to no drawdown responses were observed in monitoring wells located in the low k material during the relatively short duration pumping tests thus leading to unsatisfactory results later berg and illman 2015 were able to map those low k zones but only after using permeameter k values for conditioning therefore one could question whether the geostatistics based inversion approach could be reliably used to map unit boundaries and more importantly aquitard units consisting of low k materials with pumping test data alone or not thus far ht studies have not been previously conducted to map both aquifer and aquitard units and their connectivity because geostatistics based ht yields smoothed hydraulic parameter distributions when data are sparse the inclusion of other types of information becomes necessary to map the various units i e interlayer heterogeneity and the heterogeneity within them i e intralayer heterogeneity lessons learned from our previous studies berg and illman 2011b 2013 also point to the need for longer pumping tests to stress the aquitard units to characterize them with pumping tests alone in order to overcome the issue of smooth hydraulic parameter estimates of the geostatistics based inversion approaches the importance of geological data was investigated for ht analyses in particular zhou et al 2014 proposed an image guided method which extracts the structure information from the cross sections of geology and incorporates it in the inversion process later zhou et al 2016 extended this method by including the markov chain monte carlo sampler to update and select the most plausible geological models for the inverse problem this image guided inversion approach was then tested in synthetic ht studies by soueid ahmed et al 2015 but not through laboratory sandbox or field experiments on the other hand illman et al 2015 compared the ssht analyses based on geostatistical inversion to those based on effective parameter and geological models to test whether subsurface conceptualizations of the k structure at lower resolutions for a sandbox aquifer could yield similar results to the geostatistical inverse modeling approach or not they found that the geostatistical inversion approach performed best in terms of model calibration and validation but the geological model with perfectly known stratigraphy came a close second then zhao et al 2016 evaluated the performances of geological zonation models of varying accuracy for ssht through the same laboratory sandbox and luo et al 2017 extended the work of zhao et al 2016 to the tht case results from the sandbox studies revealed that both accurate and inaccurate geological models could be well calibrated despite the estimated k values for the poor geological models being quite different from the actual values these studies also concluded that 1 using a geological model as prior mean k distributions in geostatistical inverse models resulted in the preservation of geological features especially in areas where drawdown data were not available and 2 transient inversions are necessary by treating both k and ss to be heterogeneous to jointly obtain reliable k and ss estimates for making accurate predictions of transient drawdown events the findings by zhao et al 2016 and luo et al 2017 were based on experiments conducted in a laboratory synthetic aquifer constructed with various types of sands which did not contain low k materials e g clay silty clay as encountered at the ncrs alexander et al 2011 berg and illman 2011b therefore efforts other than berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 are needed to examine whether the ht approach can map aquitard units consisting of low k materials through pumping tests alone most recently zhao and illman 2017 performed a new ssht study at the ncrs the unique contribution of zhao and illman 2017 was that they tried to stress the low k layers and included both steady and quasi steady state drawdown data from low k zones into the ssht analysis compared to the previous ht analyses of berg and illman 2011b 2013 in which the bottom aquitard layer was incorrectly mapped as a high k zone slight improvements in the characterization of the lower aquitard were obtained by zhao and illman 2017 yet the consistency between the estimated and permeameter test k values was still poor in silt and clay layers due to the fact that only late time pressure heads indicating steady or quasi steady state were selected for model calibration however when transient data are available from aquitard units more complete information could then be utilized for tht analysis following this line of thought the first purpose of this study is to perform tht analysis using long term transient drawdowns obtained from both aquifer and aquitard units to investigate whether more accurate maps of both units as well as their intralayer heterogeneity could be obtained through the inversion of pumping test data alone furthermore the importance of geological data for tht has not been investigated rigorously in the field in order to examine these issues the second purpose of the study is to extend the work of zhao and illman 2017 to the transient case and compare the model calibration and validation performances among several approaches 1 the effective parameter approach by treating the site to be homogeneous both isotropic and anisotropic 2 the geological zonation approach treating each layer to be homogeneous and 3 the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach 2 data used for analysis 2 1 site description and geology data for this tht study has been collected at the north campus research site ncrs located on the university of waterloo uw campus in waterloo ontario canada previous investigations revealed that the near surface is highly heterogeneous and composed of multiple layers of glacial tills karrow 1979 sebol 2000 alexander et al 2011 based on the continuous core samples of a 30 m deep borehole the geology beneath the ncrs consists of from younger to older age the tavistock till maryhill till and catfish creek till karrow 1979 the surface layer in our study area is recognized as the maryhill till which consists mainly of silty clay accompanied with few stones while the overlying tavistock till only exists as erosional remnants at the site the catfish creek till is composed of stiff stony silt to sandy silt which is hard and difficult to drill thus is treated to be the base of our groundwater models berg and illman 2011b the main aquifer zone of the ncrs composed of high k sand to sandy gravel is located from 8 to 13 m below ground surface mbgs detailed descriptions of core samples indicate that the aquifer zone consists of two high k units separated by a discontinuous low k layer the thin aquitard layer separating the two aquifers is discontinuous and is known to contain stratigraphic windows allowing for hydraulic connection alexander et al 2011 situated below and above the main aquifer zone are aquitard layers composed of low k silts and clays the overlying aquitard layer also is known to contain stratigraphic windows at various locations martin and frind 1998 previous pumping tests performed at the site alexander et al 2011 indicated that the aquifer at the ncrs behaves as a confined to semi confined system 2 2 field data for building groundwater models 2 2 1 collection of core samples and laboratory analyses in previous studies by alexander et al 2011 and berg and illman 2011b four continuous multichannel tubing wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 cmt4 three multi screened wells pw1 pw3 pw5 and two well clusters pw2 pw4 were installed in an area of 15 m by 15 m at the ncrs fig 1 a is a plan view showing well locations while fig 1b provides a three dimensional perspective view of wells corresponding pumping and observation intervals as well as intervals sealed with bentonite at the site each cmt well has seven 10 cm long screens and the screens are spaced 2 m apart the upper most screens are installed between 4 5 and 5 5 mbgs and the deepest screens are placed from 16 5 to 17 5 mbgs pw1 is completed to an approximate depth of 18 m and screens are placed at eight different elevations pw3 and pw5 are multi screened at five different elevations and extends approximately to 12 mbgs pw2 and pw4 are well clusters that each consists of three separate wells and screened over a 1 m interval screen elevations for pw2 are 4 7 and 8 mbgs while screen elevations for pw4 are 5 8 5 and 11 5 mbgs during the drilling and installation of all cmt and pw wells continuous cores were collected to characterize the site geology after splitting the core into half along its length soil texture was classified based on the layering observed at the scale of the core then samples were extracted at 10 or 50 cm intervals for laboratory falling head permeameter tests specifically core samples from five wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 cmt4 and pw1 were initially tested by alexander et al 2011 and samples from the other four wells pw2 pw3 pw4 pw5 were tested by zhao and illman 2017 these k values were used in later sections to quantitatively and qualitatively compare the k estimates from different approaches along each borehole the borehole logs of the above nine wells together with additional nine wells summarized from previous work by sebol 2000 were compiled to construct a geological model for the ncrs fig 1a shows the distribution of wells from which geological information was obtained based on the soil types and corresponding depth information 19 different layers representing seven different material types were defined along all boreholes 2 2 2 description of pumping tests to date a total of 15 pumping injection tests have been conducted at the ncrs to stress the multiple aquifer aquitard system in a tomographic fashion we have summarized the details to the pumping injection tests in table s1 nine pumping tests pw1 3 pw1 4 pw1 5 pw3 3 pw3 4 pw4 3 pw5 3 pw5 4 and pw5 5 have been conducted by berg and illman 2011b for previous ht analyses berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 these pumping tests mainly stressed the aquifer layers of the ncrs since groundwater can be readily pumped from these units although pressure transducers were installed in observation ports located in aquitard layers no drawdown responses have been observed by berg and illman 2011b from the bottom ports consisting of catfish creek till berg and illman 2013 suggested that it may take several days to even weeks to induce observable drawdowns in the lower aquitard zones of the system when pumping from the aquifer zones therefore to obtain more complete drawdown information six additional pumping and injection tests were conducted by zhao and illman 2017 to directly stress the aquitard zones at pw1 1 pw1 6 pw1 7 pw2 3 pw3 1 and pw5 1 due to the low permeable nature of surrounding deposits pumping and injection tests at these six well locations were conducted at flow rates that were generally no more than 2 0 l min as shown in table s1 noticeable drawdowns 0 1 m were generally observed within 6 5 h from the ports whose elevations were similar to the pumping port except for the test at pw1 7 which lasted up to 26 5 h in particular the pw1 6 and pw1 7 intervals could only be pumped at approximately 1 0 l min such low flow rates have induced measureable drawdowns at the bottom intervals within the lower aquitard zone i e cmt 6 and 7 ports while no drawdown has been observed from the upper intervals i e cmt 1 2 3 4 and 5 ports during each pumping injection test pressure transducers were placed at all available observation intervals specifically all cmt wells from the top to bottom intervals e g cmt1 1 to cmt1 7 were instrumented with 0 15 psig model mp100 micron systems pressure transducers while the bottom intervals e g cmt1 7 cmt2 7 cmt3 7 and cmt4 7 were monitored with an electronic water level tape by berg and illman 2011b pw2 and pw4 wells were monitored with 0 5 or 0 10 psig pressure transducers model 3001 lt leveloggers junior solinst flute water systems flute ltd were installed in the multi screened pumping wells e g pw1 pw3 and pw5 during pumping injection tests a blank flute liner was installed when the wells were not being pumped each flute water system contained five vented pressure transducers level troll in situ that were designed to fit the screened intervals of pw1 pw3 and pw5 the flute systems seal off the entire well to prevent short circuiting of pressure across the multiple open screened intervals we utilized data from 12 pumping injection tests to perform the tht analysis at the ncrs data from eight tests pw1 1 pw1 4 pw1 6 pw1 7 pw2 3 pw3 3 pw4 3 and pw5 3 were selected for model calibration while the other four tests pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 were reserved for model validation test data from pw3 1 pw3 4 and pw5 1 were not selected due to the fact that drawdowns were insignificant or only observed at very few ports in addition test data affected by the noordbergum effect verruijt 1969 berg et al 2011 2015 were not included in the analysis for the data recorded by the transducers in the cmt wells a 10 point centrally weighted moving average was applied to remove the static sensor noise since the data were collected at a high frequency 4 hz at early time and 1 hz at late time the application of this filter did not significantly impact the shape of the drawdown curve three to five points were selected manually from the early intermediate and late time of each transient drawdown curve in total we selected 522 pressure head data for model calibration and used 348 head data for model validation 3 description of models used for hydraulic tomography analysis we compared three approaches different in model conceptualizations and complexities for ht analysis namely 1 the effective parameter approach both isotropic and anisotropic 2 the geological zonation approach and 3 the highly parameterized geostatistical approach in order to simulate transient groundwater flow for all models a three dimensional model with dimensions of 70 m 70 m 17 m was constructed and discretized into 31 713 variably sized rectangular finite elements we note that the groundwater flow model did not consider poroelastic effects this model was larger than the 45 m 45 m 15 m model used by berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 such a new domain on one hand was designed to incorporate additional borehole logs for constructing a site geological model on the other hand this larger model minimizes the impacts of boundary conditions when including new pumping and injection tests of longer durations the elements were gradually refined from the model boundary to the central 15 m 15 m 17 m well clustering area with the block size decreasing from 5 m 5 m 0 5 m to 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m the top and bottom faces were defined as no flow boundaries due to the presence of low k units at the top and bottom areas of the modeling domain while constant heads were assigned to the remaining boundaries 3 1 case 1 effective parameter approach we first estimated the effective k and ss values for the multiple aquifer aquitard system by coupling the groundwater flow model hydrogeosphere hgs therrien et al 2005 with the parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 two cases were considered in this approach case 1a treated the aquifer aquitard system as homogeneous isotropic in which only the effective k and ss values were estimated case 1b treated the system as being homogeneous anisotropic and the effective kx ky kz and ss values were estimated the initial values of k and kx ky kz were 8 0 10 6 m s with a minimum bound of 1 0 10 10 m s and a maximum bound of 1 0 10 1 m s the initial value of ss in both cases 1a and 1b was 1 0 10 4 m with minimum and maximum bounds of 1 0 10 8 m and 1 0 10 3 m respectively these initial values were geometric means of individual k and ss estimates obtained by berg and illman 2011b through matching the transient drawdown curve at each observation port for a pumping test conducted at pw1 3 3 2 case 2 geological zonation approach as introduced previously borehole logs of 18 wells completed to different depths were compiled based on determined soil type information in total 19 different layers representing seven different material types were defined along all boreholes to investigate the value of geological data for tht data interpretation we constructed a three dimensional geological model with dimensions of 70 m 70 m 17 m using a commercial software leapfrog hydro aranz geo limited 2015 leapfrog hydro utilizes the fast radial basis function method which is an effective way of implementing dual kriging to interpolate stratigraphy between boreholes based on the known geological layering information from available wells fig 2 shows four cross sections a a b b c c and d d as indicated in fig 1a extracted along different directions among the central nine wells to illustrate the interpolated geological layers we also present the locations of wells and screens for cross sections c c and d d based on the interpolated stratigraphy two geological models were built 1 a 5 layer geological model case 2a constructed by merging some layers with low k material specifically layers 1 through 10 as layer 1 layers 12 through 14 as layer 12 and layers 16 through 19 as layer 16 and 2 a 19 layer geological model case 2b to take full advantage of the available stratigraphy information both geological models were then utilized to create groundwater flow models using the same grid as described earlier calibrations of the 5 layer case 2a and the 19 layer case 2b geological models were also performed by coupling hgs with pest for both model calibrations the initial k value was set as 8 0 10 6 m s for all layers with a minimum bound of 1 0 10 10 m s and a maximum bound of 1 0 10 1 m s while the initial ss value was 1 0 10 4 m with minimum and maximum bounds of 1 0 10 8 m and 1 0 10 2 m respectively in both cases 2a and 2b the estimated parameters were treated to be uniform and isotopic in each layer 3 3 case 3 geostatistical inversion approach we analyzed the eight pumping tests using the geostatistics based simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code developed by xiang et al 2009 simsle inverts all the data sets simultaneously thus providing more constraints to the inverse problem xiang et al 2009 compared to the sequential inversion approach yeh and liu 2000 the model domain used for the simsle is identical to the one introduced for the other models and we assume that each element is isotropic during the estimation process in simsle natural log values of hydraulic parameters i e ln k and ln ss are treated as stochastic processes and the corresponding unconditional means spatial covariance functions and structure parameters correlation scales λx λy λz and the variances σ lnk 2 σ lnss 2 of hydraulic parameters are assumed to be known a priori the inversion process starts with cokriging using available measurements of hydraulic property and pressure heads to produce the conditional property field the stochastic conditional means of these parameters are used for predictions of pressure heads at observation ports the cokriged parameter field is then iteratively updated by simsle to minimize the differences between observed and simulated heads in this study the exponential covariance model is adopted for the parameter fields the initial correlation scales of the k and ss fields are assumed as λx λy 4 m λz 0 5 m and the variances are set to σlnk 2 σlnss 2 5 0 which are the values used in previous ht studies at the ncrs berg and illman 2011b 2013 zhao and illman 2017 other initial inputs to the inverse model include initial guesses for the k and ss fields zhao et al 2016 and luo et al 2017 through laboratory sandbox experiments as well as zhao and illman 2017 through their field study found that the geostatistical inversion approach using a geological model as prior information preserved geological features where drawdown measurements were lacking compared to using a homogenous k as a prior therefore we considered four scenarios cases 3a 3b 3c and 3d different in the initial guesses of k for the geostatistical inversion approach to meet our study purposes in case 3a the inversion starts with homogenous mean fields of k 8 0 10 6 m s and ss 1 0 10 4 m 1 which are the same as the initial values used in the effective parameter and geological zonation approaches for the other three cases cases 3b 3d heterogeneous mean k fields based on geological zonations are used as prior information specifically inverse estimations of k and ss distributions in cases 3b and 3c start with the estimated k values from model calibrations of cases 2a and 2b respectively in case 3d instead of starting from the calibrated k fields we use the 19 layer geological model populated with permeameter tested k values as the prior mean k distribution these permeameter test k values are geometric means calculated from laboratory measurements of soil samples located in the same layer of the geological model shown in table s2 supplementary information section for the layers that have no core sample data measurements of similar soil material are assigned 4 results and discussions 4 1 model calibration results tht analysis of eight tests for the effective parameter and geological zonation approaches were performed on a pc with a quad core cpu and 24 gb of ram the computational time increased with model complexity specifically case 1a took less than 2 5 h and case 1b took approximately 4 5 h calibration of the 5 layer geological model case 2a took approximately 11 5 h while the calibration of the 19 layer geological model case 2b was completed in seven days after 1075 pest model calls to estimate 38 unknowns note here that each model call consisted of transient forward simulation of eight tests and pest optimization sequentially which took about 9 5 min using a single cpu this long computational time could have been reduced if a parallel computing environment was implemented on the other hand geostatistical inversions cases 3a 3d using simsle were performed on a pc cluster using 16 processors with 192 gb of ram and all cases of the geostatistical inversion approach converged within two days 4 1 1 case 1 effective parameter approach the estimated k and ss values as well as their corresponding posterior 95 confidence intervals of the effective parameter models are summarized in table 1 examination of table 1 reveals that when treating the medium to be homogeneous isotropic case 1a yields a k value of 2 38 10 5 m s and a ss value of 9 34 10 6 m for the homogeneous anisotropic case case 1b kx ky and kz are estimated as 1 85 10 5 m s 2 55 10 5 m s and 3 77 10 7 m s respectively and ss is estimated as 1 39 10 5 m when the medium is treated to be homogeneous the estimated parameters are found to vary with the observation and pumping locations e g wen and chen 2006 liu et al 2007 huang et al 2011 by individually calibrating one anisotropic effective parameter model to four pumping test berg and illman 2015 estimated that kx ranged between 4 0 10 6 and 2 9 10 5 m s depending on the pumping locations ky ranged between 4 8 10 6 and 7 3 10 5 m s kz ranged between 3 0 10 8 and 1 0 10 6 m s and ss ranged between 1 0 10 7 and 6 8 10 4 m by performing grain size analyses of 270 core samples and permeameter test analyses for 471 core samples alexander et al 2011 obtained k estimates ranging from 3 2 10 11 m s to 2 5 10 3 m s and from 5 8 10 10 m s to 2 8 10 4 m s respectively our estimates of k and ss fall within the range of these previous studies suggesting the validity of the estimated values for cases 1a and 1b in a recent ssht study at the ncrs zhao and illman 2017 simultaneously calibrated the same effective parameter models but used steady state and quasi steady state data from seven pumping tests the estimated effective k value was 8 43 10 6 m s for the isotropic case for their anisotropic case kx ky kz were estimated as 1 04 10 5 m s 1 19 10 5 m s and 6 37 10 7 m s respectively through controlled sandbox studies illman et al 2015 concluded that when calibrated to a large number of observation data from multiple pumping tests instead of data from an individual pumping test the effective groundwater model yields improved drawdown predictions for pumping tests not used in the calibration effort yeh et al 2015 also stated that in order to predict the average spatial trend of observed heads in a heterogeneous aquifer many head measurements distributed in the aquifer must be used so that the effective hydraulic properties of the equivalent homogeneous groundwater model could be determined compared to all previous ht studies at the ncrs the tht analysis performed in this study included transient data from additional pumping tests performed in aquitard layers instead of selecting only one data point from each curve for the steady state case zhao and illman 2017 or transient data only from individual pumping tests berg and illman 2015 consequently the differences between the effective values of the current study and those of previous studies could be attributed to the inclusion of more transient drawdown data meanwhile we can expect that the estimated k and ss values to be more representative of the heterogeneous properties of the multiple aquifer aquitard system in an averaged sense than those obtained from previous ht studies 4 1 2 case 2 geological modeling approach calibrations of the geological models are performed by treating each layer to be homogeneous and isotropic the estimated k and ss distributions are plotted in figs 3 a and 4a for the 5 layer model and in figs 3b and 4b for the 19 layer model respectively the estimated values and their 95 confidence intervals are summarized in tables 2 and 3 as previously noted the main aquifer zone of the ncrs consists of two high k units separated by a thin discontinuous aquitard layer situated below and above the aquifer zone are aquitard layers composed mainly of low k silts and clays calibration results of the 5 layer geological model case 2a fig 3a and table 2 reveal that a high k value is estimated for the sand and gravel layer 15 of the aquifer zone in the middle model domain while relatively low k values are obtained for the merged aquitard layers 12 and 16 which consist of low permeable silt and clay for the merged layer 1 containing both low permeable silt and clay and high permeable sand layers the k estimate is close to the initial value of 8 0 10 6 m s which could be a result of using only one geological layer to represent multiple soil types however sand layer 11 expected to have a high k has the lowest k value among the five layers as shown in fig 3a which is inconsistent with geological data through a controlled laboratory sandbox study zhao et al 2016 showed that the estimated k values for some layers of a simplified geological model by merging layers of similar material can also be inconsistent with permeameter test values therefore this kind of inconsistency could potentially result through the use of a less complex geological model for the ncrs aquifer and aquitard system which contains both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity when the 19 layer geological model is used for model calibration we see from fig 3b and table 3 that although the general distribution pattern of k is similar to fig 3a there are more variations in k values compared to the 5 layer model specifically in the upper part of model domain low k layers are more clearly recovered in fig 3b the estimated ss values are found to vary in the range of 2 29 10 7 m and 9 28 10 6 m for the 5 layer geological model while for the 19 layer geological model ss varies between 1 02 10 6 m and 5 88 10 3 m in fig 4 a ss estimates obtained by calibrating the 5 layer geological model show a pattern of an obviously low value assigned to the top portion of the domain which may have resulted by merging layers 1 through 10 in contrast the ss distribution estimated by calibrating the 19 layer geological model case 2b shows a pattern with high ss values at the top and bottom areas and relatively low values in the central domain more specifically the estimated ss values for layers 17 and 18 are one order of magnitude higher than ss estimates of the other layers during the previous site characterization effort at the ncrs alexander et al 2011 obtained a range of ss estimates between 2 6 10 8 m and 3 8 10 3 m with a geometric mean of 3 1 10 5 m through type curve analyses of 11 individual drawdown curves from observation intervals when pumping at well pw1 4 by treating the medium to be homogeneous although the highest ss value 5 88 10 3 m for layer 18 of our case 2b is slightly higher it is still in a reasonable range from 9 19 10 4 m to 2 03 10 2 m as reported in batu 1998 for clayey material in later sections all these estimates are evaluated by comparing the performances of model calibrations and validations in terms of the reliability of estimated parameters tables 2 and 3 reveal that the estimated 95 confidence intervals of k and or ss are relatively large for some layers e g layers 1 and 11 in case 2a and layers 1 2 3 5 17 18 and 19 for case 2b which could be a result of merging layers and fixing the layer geometry during model calibrations pest then forcefully estimates k and ss for each layer and does not truncate the confidence intervals at the maximum and minimum bounds as assigned to parameters doherty 2005 the 95 confidence intervals are calculated on the basis of the linearity assumption that is used to derive the equations for parameter improvement in each optimization iteration while the relationships between hydraulic head and hydraulic parameters are non linear thus a breakdown in the underpinning linearity assumption considered to calculate the confidence intervals may exaggerate the widths of the confidence intervals christensen 1997 blessent et al 2011 meanwhile unreasonably large confidence intervals imply that information or measurements provided for the optimization process are insufficient to uniquely determine these parameters doherty 2005 therefore another possible reason for the unreasonably large confidence intervals in tables 2 and 3 is that relatively few observations or even no observation data are available for layers in which the hydraulic parameters are estimated as indicated in fig 2 large confidence intervals of k estimates were also found in a sandbox study for different geological models zhao et al 2016 however confidence interval widths have been found to be reduced by providing prior information of estimated parameters christensen 1997 blessent et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 4 1 3 case 3 geostatistical inversion approach four scenarios are considered in the geostatistical inversion approach cases 3a 3d to test the impact of using different prior information for parameter estimations specifically case 3a starts with homogenous prior mean k and ss fields cases 3b and 3c use heterogeneous prior mean k information based on geological zonations and estimated k and ss values from model calibrations of cases 2a and 2b respectively in case 3d the 19 layer geological model populated with k values obtained from permeameter tests is used as the prior mean k distribution the l2 norm changes are plotted in the supplementary section as fig s1 we select inversion results from iteration step 110 at which the l2 norm has stabilized indicating the convergence of the inversion process as suggested by xiang et al 2009 the estimated k and ss fields for all four cases are shown in figs 3c f and 4c f respectively in addition k estimates along the a a b b c c and d d cross sections as indicated on fig 1a are extracted from the estimated k distributions of cases 2 and 3 figs s3 s4 s5 and s6 in the supplementary information section meanwhile to facilitate the qualitative comparison of the site geology with the tht results from cases 2 and 3 stratigraphy slices along a a b b c c and d d cross sections fig 2 are included as figs s3g s6g in fig 3c case 3a we find that the estimated k distribution clearly shows the double aquifer feature in the centre of the modeling domain more importantly the bottom aquitard is now correctly identified as a low k zone instead of a high k zone as mapped in previous ht studies at the ncrs berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 zhao and illman 2017 when inversions relied solely on drawdown data unlike the previous works by berg and illman 2011b 2013 2015 in which they used no drawdowns observed from the low k layers and the work by zhao and illman 2017 in which only limited number of steady state and quasi steady state drawdowns were used for the ssht analysis we used more transient data from the low k zone obtained through additional pumping tests conducted at pw1 6 and pw1 7 thus we fed the inverse analysis with additional drawdown responses from the low k clay layers which carry non redundant information regarding heterogeneity of the field site oliver 1993 wu et al 2005 mao et al 2013a the above results indicate that in order to obtain accurate k tomograms it is necessary for future field implementations of ht to monitor drawdowns from both aquifer and aquitard layers otherwise k estimates from permeameter berg and illman 2015 and or slug single hole tests could be used to condition the k tomogram alternatively complementary information other than pressure heads will have to be considered for jointly calibrating a geostatistical inverse model with pressure head data in ht analysis such as with flowmeter tests li et al 2008 zha et al 2014 seismic brauchler et al 2012 and or self potential surveys soueid ahmed et al 2014 other types of data may also be used for improving the inverse model as discussed by illman 2014 but this needs to be done carefully the estimated k distributions for cases 3b and 3c in which the calibrated geological models are included as prior mean k fields in the simsle inversion are shown in figs 3d and e respectively we see from case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d that the locations of high and low k zones in the domain centre are quite similar to those of case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c whereas the zone shapes outside the centre are quite different specifically a comparison of cases 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c and 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d reveals that 1 the low k zones at the top of model domain are similar in terms of locations and shapes 2 the high and low k layers at the middle of model domain are recovered only for the central 15 m 15 m area for case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c while heterogeneity features extend to domain boundaries for case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d and 3 the bottom aquitard layer is more clearly shown throughout the entire domain for case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d similar findings are evident when comparing case 3c figs 3e and s3e s6e with case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c in which the 19 layer geological model fig 3b is used as prior information for case 3c instead of the 5 layer model fig 3a as noted in section 4 1 2 the calibration of the 5 layer geological model yields a k value that is inconsistent with geological data for sand layer 11 due to the simplification of the geology and fixing the stratigraphy geometry a comparison of estimated k tomograms between cases 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a and 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d reveals that the low k zone representing layer 11 z 10 m in case 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a is preserved in case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d for regions near domain boundaries where no pumping test data are available since simsle iteratively updates the prior k fields based on the differences between simulated and observed pressure heads xiang et al 2009 it is reasonable that some stratigraphic features from prior k distributions are preserved in the estimated k tomograms where the monitoring ports are not dense enough as shown through the comparison of cases 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a and 2b figs 3b and s3b s6b the inconsistency between the estimated k value of the 5 layer model and geological data has to some extent been ameliorated when using the higher resolution 19 layer geological model for tht meanwhile refinement to the resolution of the k tomogram is evident within the central 15 m 15 m area for cases 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d and 3c figs 3e and s3e s6e when compared to the k tomograms for cases 2a figs 3a and s3a s6a and 2b figs 3b and s3b s6b this is due to the sequential updating of the calibrated parameter fields with the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach the estimated k distribution for case 3d is shown in figs 3f and s3f s6f we note from figs 3f and s3f s6f that the estimated k tomogram captures the double layer aquifer feature of the multi aquifer aquitard system as seen from the other three cases 3a 3b and 3c however the very top and bottom areas in case 3d figs 3f and s3f s6f are now more clearly recovered as low permeable zones than those in case 3a figs 3c and s3c s6c case 3b figs 3d and s3d s6d and case 3c figs 3e and s3e s6e as previously mentioned case 3d uses the 19 layer geological model with each layer populated with the geometric mean of k values from the same layer obtained via permeameter tests as the prior mean k distribution for the simsle inversion this case represents a particular scenario which utilized the most field i e drawdowns and geological information and laboratory i e permeameter k data consequently we anticipate that case 3d to perform the best for purposes of model validation discussed later the estimated k tomograms of cases 3a through 3d collectively suggest that when more accurate geological data are incorporated into the inversion process the geostatistical approach yields a heterogeneity pattern more consistent with stratigraphy figs s3g s6g in areas both near and far away from the pumping and observation wells without incorporating additional data such as flowmeter and or geophysical surveys while the incorporation of geological data leads to more details in heterogeneity being recovered through simsle inversions we note that the 19 layer geological model and the stratigraphy map are also interpolated from borehole logs thus likely differ from the true stratigraphy therefore the ssht study by zhao et al 2016 and tht study by luo et al 2017 in the laboratory sandbox where stratigraphy could be accurately mapped were necessary in providing important insights on the usefulness of geological data for field ht analyses both studies found that ht analysis using accurate geological models yields results that are comparable to the highly parameterized geostatistical inverse models meanwhile the estimated ss tomograms for cases 3a 3d are shown in figs 4c f respectively we see from figs 4c f that although different prior mean k distributions are used for the four geostatistical inversion cases the estimated ss tomograms in general do not reveal too many differences all showing high values at the top and bottom of the domain while low values are found in the central portion physically this is reasonable since the top and bottom areas of the modeling domain are known to consist of low k silt and clay layers for which the ss values are considered to be relatively higher batu 1998 than the middle double aquifer layer materials in comparison to the k tomograms figs 3c f and s3 s6 the ss tomograms figs 4c f are very smooth and do not reflect the aquitard layers known to be present in the middle of the double layer aquifer zone as indicated in the geological model fig 2 these results suggest that pumping test data alone cannot yield finer resolution heterogeneity for ss estimates with current pumping and observation density additional information on ss will be needed to obtain estimates at finer resolutions and this will be a future research topic 4 2 performances of model calibrations performances of different approaches are next evaluated by comparing the simulated versus observed drawdowns of eight pumping tests used for model calibrations as plotted in figs 5 a h a linear model is fit and included in each plot to assess the performance generally the fit improves from the simple homogeneous models cases 1a and 1b to the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion models cases 3a through 3d with values of the coefficient of determination r2 increasing from 0 34 to 0 87 and the slopes of the linear model increasing from 0 19 to 0 87 this is consistent with the results obtained by zhao and illman 2017 whom calibrated the same models but to steady state and quasi steady state drawdown data next model calibration performances of the different tht analysis approaches are quantitatively assessed by comparing the mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 norms those quantities are computed as 1 l 1 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i l 2 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i 2 where n is the total number of pressure heads used for calibration ψ i is the ith observation head and ψ i is the corresponding simulated head the l1 and l2 norms of model calibrations as well as the corresponding ranks for all cases are provided in fig s2 of the supplementary information section the cells of each entry in the table are color coded to facilitate an easier comparison of different entries in particular we assign the minimum value in the table a color of green the maximum value a color of red and the 60 percentile value a color of yellow we utilize a 60 percentile value instead of the median to enhance the contrast in color we also calculate the arithmetic mean of the l1 and l2 norms to rank the various models examination of fig s2 reveals that model calibrations of the geostatistical inversion approach yield consistently better l1 and l2 ranking than the geological and effective parameter models such improvements could be attributed to the use of highly parameterized models which have larger degrees of freedom to adjust the model parameters to better fit the observation data in the previous ssht study for a sandbox illman et al 2015 the geological model faithfully representing the true stratigraphy was found to yield a model calibration result that was similar in quality when compared to the highly parameterized geostatistical model here the large difference of model calibration performances between the 19 layer geological model case 2b and the geostatistical models cases 3a 3d could be attributed to 1 the imperfect knowledge of geological zonations since we are using stratigraphy information interpolated from discrete borehole logs 2 calibration of a 19 layer geological model with transient data instead with steady state data as in illman et al 2015 3 the ncrs site is highly heterogeneous with the variance σ 2 lnk estimated to be 6 50 alexander et al 2011 while the variance σ 2 lnk of the sandbox investigated by illman et al 2015 is much lower estimated to be between 0 38 and 1 32 depending on the approach used for characterization berg and illman 2011a comparisons among different geostatistical inverse models in figs 5 and s2 reveal that when the geostatistical inversion approach starts from the geologically distributed k fields cases 3b 3c and 3d instead of the uniform k value case 3a the calibration performances are generally improved as indicated by the fitting parameters r2 l1 and l2 of the linear model previously berg and illman 2015 performed a comparative study of different traditional methods with tht in terms of characterizing the heterogeneity of the aquifer aquitard system specifically in order to correctly identify the low k clayey zones near the bottom of the modeling domain they conditioned the geostatistical model to the permeameter k data by fixing the k values of computational elements along five boreholes pw1 cmt1 to cmt4 during the inversion process although the estimated k distributions were found to be consistent with known geology the tht inversions also yielded slight deterioration in model calibration when permeameter k data were used to condition the model unlike the approach adopted by berg and illman 2015 geological information was used as the starting k distributions of the geostatistical inversions in this study and in zhao and illman 2017 thus the improved model calibration of cases 3b 3c and 3d compared to case 3a shown in fig 5 is a result of both including reliable geological data and enabling the pumping tests data to freely update the prior mean values here we need to clarify that due to the availability of a large number of borehole logs and laboratory measurement data at the ncrs the geological model based on the interpolation between wells may be more reliable in contrast at other sites the well network may be sparse and the geological data could contain large errors e g layer boundary locations zone structures misidentification of layers etc under such circumstances a general framework proposed by zha et al 2017 that allows the inclusion of site specific geologic features hydraulic properties as well as their associated uncertainties could be adopted to further improve ht results their framework adopts a nested covariance function to conceptualize the site heterogeneity which requires site specific geological information at both small and large scales to construct the prior mean and covariance unlike the approach proposed by zha et al 2017 the approach that we utilize in this study uses kriging of borehole data to construct geological models and is very practical 4 3 comparison of estimated k with permeameter test k in order to further examine the ability of geological and geostatistical inverse models to capture the heterogeneity of the ncrs the estimated k values are extracted from the tht tomograms and compared with permeameter test k values along all pw and cmt wells figs 6 and s7 meanwhile the k estimates from ssht analyses of seven pumping tests by zhao and illman 2017 are jointly plotted as red lines in figs 6 and s7 to provide direct comparisons with the tht estimates as seen in figs 6 and s7 calibrations of the 5 layer and 19 layer geological models to eight pumping tests yield k estimates blue lines that generally follow the vertical variations of permeameter test k values black dashed lines with dots however the intralayer heterogeneity in k values of each unit is not captured by both geological models due to the assumption of constant k values in each layer still the k profile estimated by the 19 layer geological model reveals more variations than the simplified 5 layer geological model we also see that the results of eight test tht analysis blue lines are quite similar to those of the seven test ssht steady state analysis red lines although there are minor differences this finding suggests that both geological models with low degrees of parameterizations for this highly heterogeneous site may be justified schöniger et al 2015 given the availability of multiple pumping test data to conduct the inverse modeling at the ncrs on the other hand the calibration of the highly parameterized geostatistical inverse model starting from the uniform mean k field case 3a captures the overall changes in the k profiles from the top to the bottom of all pw and cmt wells the most striking improvement is that the transient inversion results blue lines fit the permeameter k measurements quite well at depths of 0 5 m and 10 15 m above the bottom of the modeling domain whereas relatively high k values red lines are obtained by zhao and illman 2017 when only using steady state data this result indicates that the inclusion of additional pumping tests conducted at aquitard layers i e pw1 1 pw1 6 and pw1 7 and more transient drawdown data into the inversion has led to the correct identification of aquitard zones and the improved characterization of intralayer k heterogeneity in cases 3b 3c and 3d the geologically distributed prior k mean fields are used as starting values for the geostatistical inversion approach compared to the results of case 3a in figs 6 and s7 cases 3b 3c and 3d yield k profiles that are more consistent with the permeameter test k values in terms of the locations and thicknesses of aquifer and aquitard layers that is the boundaries between aquifer and aquitard layers are better delineated in cases 3b 3c and 3d than those in case 3a meanwhile unlike the significant differences between the results of steady state and transient analyses in case 3a the blue and red lines representing the vertical k variations in cases 3b 3c and 3d in general show satisfactory matches especially for cases 3c and 3d in which 19 layer geological models are used as prior k distributions these results collectively suggest that the inverse modeling of transient pumping test data can yield reliable heterogeneous distributions of k for both aquifer and aquitards including its intralayer heterogeneity even at a highly heterogeneous site such as at the ncrs joint inverse modeling of transient drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard layers is necessary in accurately characterizing the site with a highly parameterized geostatistical approach moreover using reliable geological models as initial distributions are helpful for the geostatistical inversion approach of tht in improving the correspondence of estimated k for both the aquifer and aquitard layers to those from permeameter tests 4 4 model validation results we next evaluate the performances of different models in their abilities of predicting pumping tests not used during the calibration process as previously noted four pumping tests pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 are selected for model validation purposes the drawdown predictions of different models and various tests are plotted as figs 7 pw1 3 s8 pw1 5 s9 pw5 4 and s10 pw5 5 meanwhile the simulated drawdowns are extracted at selected times and compared with corresponding observed drawdowns to provide more quantitative comparisons figs 8 and s11 in figs 7 s8 s9 and s10 the drawdown predictions of the homogeneous isotropic model case 1a solid gray lines the homogeneous anisotropic model case 1b dashed gray lines the 5 layer geological model case 2a dash dotted gray lines the 19 layer geological model case 2b dotted black lines and different geostatistical models cases 3a 3d lines in red color are compared to the drawdowns observed solid blue lines with open circles from different locations of the aquifer aquitard system through visual examinations of the match quality between different simulated drawdowns to observed curves in fig 7 for the pumping test at pw1 3 we find that geostatistical models of case 3 yield drawdown predictions that are close to each other and in general capture the blue lines observed from different observation intervals in contrast obvious poor matches are found between drawdown predictions of the homogeneous models solid and dashed gray lines and the observations blue lines either at early time or late time of the drawdown curves on the other hand the simplified 5 layer geological model case 2a consistently over predicts the drawdowns for observation ports e g cmt1 1 cmt2 1 and pw5 1 located within the top layer of the aquifer aquitard system and also yield poor matches to the blue curves in the rest of observation intervals as the homogeneous models cases 1a and 1b when the complex 19 layer geological model case 2b is used the match qualities improve for drawdown predictions over the 5 layer model case 2a at several observation intervals the matches are comparable to those of the highly parameterized geostatistical models cases 3a 3d in fig 8 the observed drawdowns are compared to the simulated values selected from different monitoring intervals and times indicated by blue circles in figs 7 s8 s9 and s10 the linear fits show that the homogeneous isotropic model case 1a yields biased predictions fig 8a and underestimates the drawdowns of four pumping tests with a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 23 and a slope of 0 08 for the linear model fit the prediction results are improved slightly when using either the homogeneous anisotropic model case 1b or the simplified 5 layer geological model case 2a as shown in figs 8b and c in addition performances of the 19 layer geological model case 2b show obvious improvements over the above three models cases 1a 1b and 2a with the r2 and the slope of the linear model fit increasing to 0 65 and 1 15 respectively it is worth noting that the 19 layer geological model case 2b performed closely to the geostatistical inversion approach case 3a starting with k 8 0 10 6 m s as a prior mean on the other hand compared to the effective parameter cases 1a and 1b and the geological modeling cases 2a and 2b approaches models of the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach using geologically distributed k prior means cases 3b 3d yield consistently improved r2 and l1 while the l2 ranking behaves differently the lowest l2 norm is reached by the geostatistical inversion model using the calibrated 19 layer geological model as prior k distribution case 3c since the l2 norm magnifies large discrepancies between the simulated and the observed drawdowns compared to the l1 norm the high l2 norm values in cases 3a 3b and 3d mainly represent the impact of poor fittings of drawdowns at several observation intervals such as at cmt2 2 and pw3 3 in fig 7 such an inconsistent l2 ranking among cases 3a 3d indicate that while the k fig 3 and ss fig 4 tomograms show similar overall patterns the fine scale differences in these k and ss tomograms could lead to drastically different drawdown predictions at some observation intervals thus the geostatistical inversion approach that can correctly capture both interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity should be more favored for future ht applications 5 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated whether transient drawdown data collected in both the aquifer and aquitard units can be used in transient hydraulic tomography tht analysis to reliably map the interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of these units at a field site underlain by a highly heterogeneous multi aquifer aquitard system in addition we examined the value of geological data for tht analysis by constructing geological zonation models based on available stratigraphy information and using them as prior distributions for the geostatistical inversion approach we selected 12 pumping tests for model calibration and validation eight tests containing hydraulic response information observed in aquifer and aquitard layers are jointly used to calibrate groundwater models of different complexities and parameterization schemes including 1 two effective parameter models isotropic anisotropic 2 two geological zonation models of varying numbers of layers and 3 four highly parameterized geostatistical inverse models that consider different prior k means our study resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 despite the large number of data used for model calibration the effective parameter models calibrated to eight pumping tests yielded biased calibration and validation results in contrast tht analyses based on geological models and highly parameterized geostatistical models led to much improved model calibration and drawdown prediction performances this suggests that it may be difficult to represent site heterogeneity with an effective parameter model at the scale of site investigation conducted at the ncrs 2 although the layer boundaries were fixed geological models calibrated to eight pumping test data yielded k estimates that were close to the general patterns of vertical k distributions from permeameter tests meanwhile the calibration of the geostatistical inversion model to drawdown data with initially uniform hydraulic parameter fields correctly recovered both the low and high k zones within the well field although smoothed results were obtained for areas where no drawdown data were available 3 instead of using an effective k estimate calibrated groundwater models based on geological zonation used as an initial guess was very helpful for the geostatistical inversion approach in improving the correspondence of estimated k to those from permeameter tests and in preserving geological features connectivity in k heterogeneity patterns different from the previous hydraulic tomography study by zhao and illman 2017 who relied on steady state inversions the joint inverse modeling of transient drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard layers yielded reliable heterogeneous distributions of k and ss for both aquifer and aquitards even at a highly heterogeneous site 4 we conclude that the inclusion of reliable geological data is useful for tht analysis to better image the full heterogeneity patterns of complex groundwater systems in addition sufficiently long records of pumping and observation data should be collected not only from aquifer layers but also from aquitard layers for future ht studies when relying only on pumping test data 5 collection of long drawdown records will require the judicious selection of data that should be fed into inverse models to avoid information overload and inclusion of redundant as well as erroneous data therefore it is necessary to systematically examine the quality of data the information content of observed heads from both high and low k zones as well as the value of other types of complementary data data worth estimation methods such as the preposterior data impact assessor predia leube et al 2012 and the linear predictive uncertainty quantification predunc utility wöhling et al 2016 may be applied to evaluate monitoring strategies and to identify potentially redundant information both of which can potentially improve the quality of ht analyses acknowledgements this

7392,for three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in inland waters the rapid changes with moving boundary and various input conditions should be considered some models are developed with moving boundary but the dynamic change of discharges is unresolved or ignored for better hydrodynamic simulation in inland waters the widely used 3d model ecomsed has been improved by moving confluence route mcr method with a wetting and drying scheme wad the fixed locations of water and pollutants inputs from tributaries point sources and non point sources have been changed to dynamic confluence routes as the boundary moving the improved model was applied in an inland water area qingshuihai reservoir kunming city china for a one year hydrodynamic simulation the results were verified by water level flow velocity and water mass conservation detailed water level variation analysis and velocity field comparison at different times showed that the improved model has better performance for simulating the boundary moving phenomenon and moving discharges along with water level changing than the original one the improved three dimensional model is available for hydrodynamics simulation in water bodies where water boundary shifts along with change of water level and have various inlets keywords moving boundary ecomsed wetting and drying scheme qingshuihai reservoir moving confluence route hydrodynamic simulation 1 introduction the characteristics with high elevation complex topography rapid changes in the fluid boundary and various discharges make it complicated for hydrodynamic simulation in inland waters the water surface elevation in the floodplains shores or dikes is in an ever changing and moving boundary situation the moving boundary will change locations of point source and non point source discharges if the moving boundary and discharges phenomenon are not considered in numerical models the model momentum equation and continuity equation will lose physical significance for dry land cells causing iterative fluctuation and numerical divergence schumm and khan 1971 zhou and derby 2001 as such moving boundary technology has been proposed and developed in 1968 in the explicit finite difference model reid and bodine 1968 until now many boundary technologies are developed and have been used in solving hydraulic problems liang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 gawlik and lew 2014 pangborn et al 2015 celli and kuznetsov 2018 the wetting and drying scheme wad using predetermined rules for judging wet or dry properties of grid cells is one of the most popular moving boundary technologies it can deal with complicated boundary conditions with a simple principle and strong applicability medeiros and hagen 2013 some state of the art and widely used three dimensionally 3d models have been improved with wad such as delft3d hydraulics 2011 mohid miranda et al 2000 environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hydro hamrick 1992 ji et al 2001 and princeton ocean model pom giunta et al 2007 oey 2005 while the dynamic changing of input outfall discharges from offshore branches non point sources and point sources along with moving boundary are not considered or ignored in these models the open source three dimensional hydrodynamic model ecomsed completely considering different discharges is based on the pom giunta et al 2007 and the coastal ocean reservoir and lake model ecom blumberg and mellor 1987 it takes the advantages of pom and ecom functions which can deal with significant topographical variability with sigma coordinate system and simulate water levels currents temperature cohesive and noncohesive sediments and waves in marine and inland fresh water areas blumberg 2002 to date the ecomsed has been widely used in numerical stimulation of offshore areas for tidal sun et al 2008 ma et al 2009 typhoon storm surge nie et al 2012 and sediment transport ma et al 2009 pang et al 2010 qiao et al 2011 while in the latest version of the ecomsed the fixed boundary scheme and fixed discharges are still used sun et al 2008 scholars have improved pom with wad scheme and used the improved model in tidal simulations such as the simulation in the san francisco bay in california usa the shenzhen bay in china and casco bay in new england usa oey et al 2010 saramul and ezer 2009 xue and du 2010 zhang et al 2009 several scholars tried to modify ecom with wad for tide or wave simulation sun et al 2008 zhang and shen 2015 these previous studies provided successful experiences in employing the moving boundary technology in these models for the changing process of boundaries in the floodplain or the dike simulation while the average depth of grid element in a specified datum such as ocean altitude datum was used to judge the wet or dry grids by counting up the water surface elevation above the specified datum and bathymetric depth below the specified datum which is reasonable in the sea or bay areas where the water surface is near sea level and the bottom elevation is negative but in the high altitude inland areas especially where water surface is gradients and water excessive oscillations the specified datum is hard to determine and the method will lead to numerical instability oey et al 2010 furthermore moving confluence location of discharges has not been mentioned in these studies for better hydrodynamic behavior of ecomsed in the inland water bodies establishing a new moving boundary method with wad and taking the moving confluence characteristic into account has attracted interests the present study was undertaken to perform better hydrodynamic simulation of the moving boundary and the discharge intersections location changing phenomenon in inland water areas based on the mature hydrodynamic model ecomsed according to the structure and details of technical characteristics sigma coordinate system existing boundary control mode and water depth control scheme of the ecomsed a specific wad scheme was proposed on account of the characteristics of inland water bodies and the wad scheme the moving boundary technology with the modified water depth control scheme and the moving confluence route method for discharges of ecomsed was put forward to test the performance of the improved ecomsed the model was applied in an inland reservoir the qingshuihai reservoir in kunming city china 2 methods 2 1 the ecomsed description the ecomsed contains five modules hydrodynamic module named ecom sediment transport module wind induced wave module heat flux module and particle tracking module the five modules can be conveniently turned on and off depending upon modeling needs and work in conjunction with another with output from one serving as input to another blumberg et al 2015 to overcome disadvantages in the vicinity of large bathymetric irregularities of the ordinary x y z coordinate system a sigma coordinate system is adopted similarly to make the grid match well with the complex topography and shoreline in offshore marine areas an orthogonal curvilinear grid is used overall three different boundary exchange modes are developed in ecom to completely reflect the influence of the discharge condition 2 1 1 the sigma coordinate system in the ecom module orthogonal curvilinear grid and sigma coordinate systems are applied in horizontal and vertical directions respectively for the convenience of using continental shelf terrain sun et al 2008 the sea surface and bottom are all horizontal in the sigma coordinate system as shown in fig 1 that simplifies establishing numerical models and shows its superiority in dealing with the boundary condition when the bottom topography is complicated along with the sigma coordinate system the orthogonal curvilinear and arakawa c staggered grid is used as its basic grid which ensures a higher grid resolution in offshore areas nie et al 2012 as shown in fig 1 in the x y z coordinate system the governing equations are continuity equation and reynolds momentum equation blumberg 2002 in the sigma coordinate system as shown in fig 1 the independent variable σ z η h η is used to replace the vertical coordinate z in the x y z coordinate system in oceanic regions the z of the mlw is always set as ocean altitude datum or specified datum where the water level z is zero and then z equals h x y at the btl therefore in the sigma coordinate system in ecom σ ranges from zero at the mlw to 1 at the btl set d h η with this change from x y z t coordinate system to sigma coordinate system x y σ t the governing equations and reynolds momentum equation are 1 η t ud x vd y ω σ 0 2 ud t u 2 d x uvd y u ω σ fvd gd η x σ k m d du d σ gd 2 ρ 0 x σ 0 ρ d σ gd ρ 0 d x σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ 3 vd t uvd x v 2 d y v ω σ fud gd η y σ k m d dv d σ gd 2 ρ 0 y σ 0 ρ d σ gd ρ 0 d y σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ where u is velocity vector in x direction v is velocity vector in y direction ρ o is the reference density ρ is density g is gravitational acceleration p is pressure k m is vertical eddy diffusivity of turbulent momentum mixing f is the latitudinal variation of the coriolis parameter 2 1 2 the water depth control scheme in the water depth control scheme of ecom the water depth of grid elements is set as d h η in ecom there is only one time for checking the wet and dry attribute of grid cells h is read from the model grid files named model grid if h is larger than zero the grids will be set as wet grids during the whole simulation period that will not make any sense when ecom is used in inland regions to simulate a long period of time across the dry season and the flood season as it is difficult to determine the mlw as shown in fig 1 if the water level line of the flood season is set at the mlw all grid elements below the flood season line will be wet grid cells in ecom the attribute of grid elements dry or wet is fixed and been set before iterating calculation while when the water level declines to the mlw line or the dry season line the grid elements between flood season line and the current water level line are dry elements which should be removed from computational but are still calculated in ecom as its fixed wet attribute conversely if the dry season line is set at the mlw the h of all the grid elements whose water level is higher than the dry season s level will be set as 1 0e 10 when the water level increases these wet elements should be set as the computational grids but with its fixed boundary scheme these grids cannot be set wet in the iterating calculation of ecom in this case the wad scheme is necessary for ecom 2 2 wetting and drying scheme it is a common and important phenomenon that flow boundaries move due to water level changes this process in numerical simulation is grid transformation from wet to dry or vice versa that often results in unsteady shallow water flows in models yuan et al 2008 when water level decreases some of the original wet grids will transform to dry land and these dry elements should be removed from computations conversely as the flood wave inundates a previously dry area dry grids will translate into wet grids and then the model must adapt to include these new wet areas in boundary areas the wet and dry elements may keep changing which may vastly influence the mass and momentum conservation and calculation accuracy of these models medeiros and hagen 2013 in this case however the moving boundaries phenomenon should be considered recently there are many methods trying to describe the moving boundaries phenomenon in numerical solutions with the wetting and drying scheme wad scheme being an effective method for this 2 2 1 the process of wad scheme according to previous studies of the wad scheme oey 2005 sobey 2009 implementation of the wad scheme falls into many general steps as shown in fig 2 first a thin film should be specified for all grid elements second comparing the water depth with the thin film if the dh water depth of the grid element is greater than tfh thickness of the designed thin film the grid element will be set as a wet grid while if the water depth of the grid element is less than the grid element will be set as a dry element and be removed from the computational domain third wet elements will be calculated in the models and the dry elements near the wet elements will linearly extrapolate the fluid depth from nearby wet elements thereafter all the three processes should start again in the next step till the time reaches the end 2 2 2 the wad scheme for ecom in ecom there is a two dimensional variable named fsm specified as the mask of wet and dry elements there are two options named cold start and hot start to start the computation for which the methods of checking fsm are different in the cold start mode all initial conditions are set to zero and h should be obtained from the physical information file named as the model grid if h of a grid element is greater than 0 then fsm 1 and the grid element will be set as a wet element otherwise the grid element will be used such that fsm 0 and h 1 0e 10 as a dry element while in the hot start mode all initial conditions including h are inputted in a text file containing computed results from the previous model run in this mode only the grid elements where h greater than 1 0002 will become wet the process for judging fsm runs only one time once the wet or dry property is determined in other words as soon as the h of an element is set to a value in the model grid file it will no longer be changed during the computation in the previous studies of improving pom with wad oey et al 2010 liu and yin 2006 the original mask fsm has been retained for defining the absolute land areas where fsm 0 the other separate time dependent mask wetmask is added and defined for wet and dry dynamic interface with assigning the free surface d h η h is initial water depth below a special datum η is the tidal amplitude the mask wetmask dry if wetmask 0 wet if wetmask 1 will be judged by comparing d with a film of fluid of thickness o cm wetmask 0 if d o wetmask 1 if d o note that h is defined in the model grid files for long term simulation as initial water depth is always changing it is needed to change h in the basic model grid files which makes it inconvenient for model extension additionally in these wad scheme before computing the flow velocity of a grid a i j k the wetmask will be judged first if wetmask 0 the d of the grid a will be set to zero which will bring discontinuous errors during the computing of water level for junction areas between dry and wet grids thus the fixed bottom elevation of grid zb instead of h is used as shown in fig 3 zb is the elevation of the bottom el is the water level of water surface ini el is the initial water level before running the model max el is the elevation that water level is always lower than and min el is the lowest water level at the current lake or reservoir δ el is the change of water level from the current time step to the prior time step additionally h and η are removed from the sigma coordinate system in this case σ z el el zb at the water level line where z el σ 0 and at the bottom where z zb σ 1 dh is still the water depth that equals el zb instead of h η with this improvement the model grid files use zb instead of h the governing equations 1 to 3 will be changed to equations 4 to 6 continuity equation 4 δ el t u dh x v dh y ω σ 0 reynolds momentum equation 5 u dh t u 2 dh x uv dh y u ω σ fv dh g dh δ el x σ k m dh du d σ g dh 2 ρ 0 x σ 0 ρ d σ g dh ρ 0 dh x σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ 6 v dh t uv dh x v 2 dh y v ω σ fu dh g dh δ el y σ k m dh dv d σ g dh 2 ρ 0 y σ 0 ρ d σ g dh ρ 0 dh y σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ to implement wad in ecom the fixed land domain is defined where zb max el mfs o 0 and these cells are always dry at the same time the wet and dry dynamic domain is also defined where zb max el mfs o 1 and the grid elements can be dry or wet according to the comparison between dh and tfh the dynamic mask mfs used in the progress of solving the ecom s primitive equations is defined such that mfs 0 where mfs o 0 or mfs o 1 and dh tfh at dry cells and fixed land domain otherwise mfs 1 where mfs o 1 and dh tfh to reduce discontinuous errors when computing of water level for junction areas between dry grids and wet grids the water level of dry girds will be set equal to its neighboring wet grids set grid a i j is a dry grid its neighboring grids are b i 1 j c i j 1 d i 1 j and e i j 1 among the neighboring grids b and c are wet grids then water level el velocity vector du and dv of a i j are the average value of b and c in the cold start mode the ini el and max el are defined as shown in fig 4 the tfh is set to 0 05 m according to the former wet and dry researches oey 2005 liu and yin 2006 first mfs o will be determined second el of all the cells will be set as ini el while mfs will be determined from the logical condition whether el zb tfh then mfs 0 will be reset where the cell itself is mfs 1 but mfs 0 at its four neighboring cells thereafter the velocity water level el and all other hydrodynamic variables of the wet grid elements will be calculated at the current time step before the next time step the el velocity and momentum flux will be firstly set to zero if mfs 0 except for the near water cells whose hydrodynamic variables will be updated through linear interpolation among its neighboring wet cells after that all mfs will be checked in the hot start mode mfs o el and all other hydrodynamic variables will be inputted from the restart file the process of checking mfs and setting the value for ini el is not needed and other steps are the same as in cold start mode in this way the ecom module becomes a moving boundary structure which is available for waters that have large amplitude fluctuations of water level 2 3 moving confluence route methods in the ecom module three discharge modes have been defined river dam and onshore intake outfall exchanges qbc mode offshore intake outfall discharges dbc mode and the offshore intake outfall discharges in loops dbcl mode as shown in fig 5 in inland waters point source and non point sources are important factors influencing water quantity and water quality for many reservoirs and lakes tributaries rivers are also main intakes or outfalls of water and pollutants haimann and rangarajan 2013 as a result it is defined that tributary input is one part of the qbc mode the dbc mode is divided into two parts one is the point source discharge renamed dbc1 and the other is non point source discharge renamed dbc2 in the initial ecom all discharges enter leave at the fixed location called discharge boundary grid elements two grid elements are needed for qbc discharge location the entering leaving grid elements where fsm 1 and its connecting exterior boundary grid element where fsm 0 for the dbc discharge location only the entering leaving grid element where fsm 1 is needed a fixed location point for qbc or dbc is not adequate in the wad scheme when the boundary changes the discharge location would also change in order to match the wad scheme the discharge route is defined instead of the fixed discharge point for every discharge location the discharge route is determined by the elevation of grids as shown in fig 5 qbc 1 is one of the discharge routes and it begins at the junction of the discharge river and the max el line and ends at the grid element where zb min el the discharge route the same as a water route may be a straight line or curve but the cells in the route from the beginning to the end should be listed in descending order of zb every time after resetting the fsm the discharge location cell in the discharge route will be recomputed assuming that there are n cells in one discharge route it will be successively checked from the cell n to cell 2 and cell m will be determined as the discharge location cell if fsm m 1 and fsm m 1 0 2 m n sometimes the sewage outlets of point sources might be built inside lakes or reservoirs and in this case if zb min el at the sewage outlet its discharge location cell is fixed and the same as the sewage outlet location cell otherwise it will be treated as a discharge route beginning from the outlet location to the min el cell 3 results and discussion the qingshuihai reservoir in kunming city was selected as a study area with the improved ecomsed not only to test the performance of the wad but also to get the hydrodynamics results for further water quality and aquatic ecosystems modeling 3 1 study area descriptions and model setup kunming city the capital of yunnan province is located in southwest china the current available water resources in kunming city are less than 300 m3 per capita which is much less than the average of 2200 m3 per capita in china to solve water shortage problems many water supply projects have been pursued in recent years in kunming city the kunming qingshuihai water supply project is one of the main projects to satisfy critical water demands of kunming the qingshuihai reservoir locating at 102 57 7 e and 26 4 53 n and northwest of xundian county in kunming city is a natural lake the surface of qingshuihai has an average elevation of 2173 m and lowest storage level of 2161 m it fluctuates with an elevation range of approximately 6 m between dry and wet seasons the water supply project calls for the construction of several dams and reservoirs as well as several water conveyance systems that will bring water from four adjacent catchments shiqiaohe banqiaohe xintianhe and tabizi to qinngshuihai as shown in fig 6 for a water supply project it is important to continuously monitor and evaluate its water quality and analyze the discharge outfalls within the watershed and the four adjacent catchments on water quantity and water quality the characteristic of high altitude and multifarious inputs and outputs makes the qingshuihai reservoir a good study area for testing the wad of ecomsed 3 1 1 inputs and outputs the qingshuihai reservoir watershed covers an area of 34 5 km2 and collects annually an average of 24 7 million cubic meters of water into the lake a watershed model swat was implemented to simulate the land runoff with 32 outlets set as dbc2 discharge type water conveyance systems bring water from four adjacent catchments through two tunnels into qingshuihai reservoir which were set as dbc1 discharge type the water from shiqiaohe banqiaohe and tabizi joins together and falls into qingshuihai reservoir through dbc1 1 while xintianhe s water flows into qingshuihai reservoir through dbc1 2 as shown in fig 7 the water supply project takes water from the intake set as dbc1 3 there are automatic monitoring stations at tunnels and the intake 3 1 2 reservoir operation rules the qingshuihai water supply project will heighten the dam at the north of qingshuihai reservoir and 2180 m at its crest to 2180 m when the water level reaches 2180 m inputs from tunnels dbc1 1 dbc1 2 will be blocked and excess water will spill over the top of the dam the water from the watershed will still flow into qingshuihai reservoir leading to el greater than 2180 in local areas the time series with 24 hours intervals of rainfall water input and output conditions at dbc1s were obtained from monitoring stations and the total input of the dbc2s was obtained from the watershed model swat the fig 7 displays daily time series data of rainfall and water inputs it shows that in wet seasons from june to september the rainfall is much higher than which in dry seasons dry seasons such as november and january have little rainfall and less input but the output flow is still high other conditions such as air temperature wind barometric pressure and other meteorological data were provided by meteorological stations 3 1 3 model setup set the initial water level ini el of qingshuihai reservoir is 2174 m the max el is 2181 the min el is 2161 and the tfh is 0 05 m the max el contour line has a distance that from the east to the west is 2 2 km and 5 5 km from the south to the north the dam has been heightened and the dam began to fill in june there are 155 384 grid cells whose size ranges from 10 to 14 m eleven sigma levels are used vertically from 1 to zero with interval 0 1 the baroclinic time step is 30 s the barotropic time step is 3 s the internal external mode splitting is 10 and the period of cold start to obtain a stabilize flow is set as 12 h the mellor yamada turbulence closure model and the upwind finite difference scheme is selected in the simulation with temperature simulation included two comparative schemes with wad and without wad are set for simulation from january 1 to december 31 3 2 verification and evaluation of model performance to quantify the fit of simulation data and the measured data nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determinant r2 which are were widely used basic goodness of fit criterion for evaluating model performance engel et al 2007 park and engel 2014 were used for model verfication the model performance can be judged satisfactory if the ens 0 4 engel et al 2007 and r2 ranges from 0 to 1 the closer that r2 is to 1 the higher the precision of the simulation the water level flow velocity and water mass conservation were used for model validation from january 1 to december 31 3 2 1 water level the water level has been verified by compared with the simulated results and measured data around the center of line s2 in fig 6 for the whole year the fig 8 shows the simulated water level and the measured water level and the r2 by comparing the model calculation results with the measured data from fig 8 it is displaying that the quantity range and change trends of water level during the whole year have good consistency the mean absolute error mea has been used for yearly monthly and daily validation analysis wang et al 2016 the annual and monthly error analysis results are shown in table 1 it is displayed that from fig 8 and table 1 the biggest absolute error is 0 0968 in may most of the monthly absolute errors are around 0 05 m and the relative errors are around 0 002 wet seasons from may to aug average absolute errors are bigger than dry seasons from oct to dec for daily absolute errors analysis the biggest three absolute errors are 0 55 0 54 and 0 49 on may 20th may 29th and march 30th these errors may be caused by input and output conditions while most of the absolute errors are less than 0 05 m which is almost the same as ecom used in other studies hu et al 2009 as the ecom is rarely applied in high altitude mainland modeling previous studies about other famous 3d hydrodynamic model used in high altitude waters were selected for maximum absolute errors of water level comparison the biggest absolute errors of simulated water level in the chicago columbus drive with efdc are almost0 3 m sinha et al 2013 the water level absolute errors in the changtan reservoir in southern china where the altitude is from 138 m to 150 m with efdc are approaching1m du et al 2016 compared with these studies the improved ecomsed achieved an acceptable absolute errors of the water level the high r2 0 9944 showed in fig 8 indicated a positive relationship between accurate degree the simulated and measured water level overall the water level results verification shows that the model calculation results are credible and the improved model performed satisfactorily 3 2 2 flow velocity five measured points have been made for flow velocity verification as shown in fig 6 which are labeled with yellow circle the speed and direction of flow velocity in the surface and speeds in the vertical have been measured on date january 1st june 21 september 26 and november 21 the surface flow direction was measured by field observation with white foam the flow velocity was measured by flowquest adcp which is an ideal instrument for measuring currents and flows in oceans harbors lakes and rivers data collection voyage mode was used for flow velocity measuring from 1 to 5 after boat stability stop at the measured points data of flow velocity in different layers will be recorded flow velocity at five layers of five measured points on four days have been recorded the surface flow direction of five different measured points at noon on four days is shown in fig 9 for surface flow direction the precision of simulation results compare with measure data is over 90 it indicates that the model is capable to simulate the surface flow of lakes whose main driving force is wind as shown in fig 9 the measured direction is almost the same as the wind direction the r2 ens and mea were used for flow velocity verification results of velocity in five measured points on four days are shown in fig 10 the r2 of velocity with measured data and model results at five selected locations on four days is 0 8559 the mea is 0 0024 and the ens is 0 8214 it is clear that the model has a good performance in the three dimensional flow velocity simulation the accuracy of surface flow velocity is better than the middle layer while relatively bigger error exits at elevations around 2170 m 3 2 3 water mass conservation for hydrodynamic simulation of moving boundary an important evaluation factor is mass conservation medeiros and hagen 2013 naturally the amount of inflow outflow precipitation and evaporation will change the water volume in reservoirs in the wad scheme the water mass conservation is the basic and most important condition and basic requirement with daily observed inputs and outputs and the reservoir s initial water volume the result herein named mio the actual water volume mv of the reservoir can be calculated for summating water volume of all grids the simulated water volume sv of the reservoir can be gained for the qingshuihai reservoir the mass conservation verification formula is 7 mio t t 1 t mdbc 1 1 t mdbc 1 2 t mdbc 1 3 t n 1 32 mdbc 2 n t 86400 mra t mini

elevation of the grid cell i j el i j is the water surface elevation of grid cell i j at time t results in fig 11 show that the water mass change trend between observed and simulated in qingshuihai reservoir is similar the absolute values of relative errors between the observed and simulated data are most under 0 5 the maximum errors are approximately 1 4 in wet seasons in june along with the tremendous changes of water inputs and outfalls the amplitude change of water mass will be higher the mass and momentum conservation discrepancies have consequences for model stability and predicted results bates and hervouet 1999 the problem that potentially numerically unstable and disturbances propagated from the boundary is inevitable in the wet and dry scheme as wet dry threshold of cells or elements are identified by the small positive depth of thin film bates 2000 yuan et al 2008 the small depth hydraulics should be represented correctly and with the most suitable thin film the spurious oscillations resulting from boundary movement can be minimized bates 2000 in our research with the thin film of 0 05 m ens is 0 9951 and r2 is 0 9984 the ens and r2 are high enough to verify the accuracy of the improved model it demonstrates that the improved wad scheme in ecom conforms well to mass conservation for water mass assessment it is confirmed that with wad scheme the dynamically mass and momentum conservation are well kept while the fixed thin film is used in this study dynamic changing thin film may be helpful for mass balance and model stability as the different amplitude of water level fluctuation in different seasons for better performance of the current improved model the determination of thin film requires further careful investigation and construction 3 3 effects of wad scheme on water level to analyze the detailed effects of the wad scheme two different scenarios one with wad scheme and the other without wad scheme were compared results are displayed with water level changing at two longitudinal sections for different dates in these two scenarios as shown in fig 6 the line s1 is near the boundary of qingshuihai composed of grid cells where j 35 and line s2 is the central section containing grid cells where j 192 the s1 is a section whose profile shape looks like a w and the s2 looks like u choose the four days t 0 16 day on january 1 t 171 90 day on june 22 when the average elf is the lowest t 268 59 day on september 18 when the total input trend line reaches its peak and t 324 50 day on november 19 when average elf is the highest as the result observation dates the water levels of s1 and s2 with wad and without wad are shown in figs 12 and in 13 the fig 12 displays the water level at s1 in two scenarios in the vertical direction the graphs a 1 to a 4 show the dry and wet changing process at the middle areas of s1 from graph a 1 and graph a 2 when the water surface elevation drops from 2174 m to 2172 76 m the number of dry cells in the middle of s1 increases from the range i 26 to 35 to the range i 25 to 37 when water surface elevation increases to 2175 95 m in graph a 3 dry cells from i 25 to 37 become wet cells the graphs a 1 to a 4 in fig 12 show the water level changing process at the middle areas of s1 the initial water surfer elevation of all wet grids is 2174 m from graph a 1 and graph a 2 when the water surface elevation drops from 2174 m to 2172 63 m the water surface elevation of grid cells i 8 i 25 i 36 and i 61 is lower than its bottom elevation and should be dry cells but because of the fixed boundary scheme the grid cells will not change and are still wet cells which does not correspond to reality additionally when water surface elevation increases to 2176 12 m in graph a 3 and 2176 86 m in graph a 4 the dry cells from i 26 to 35 are still dry cells but these cells have already been inundated and become wet cells in the reality for the terrain elevation of these cells from i 26 to 35 is lower than the water surface elevation this error is equally conspicuous in grid cells from i 1 to 7 and i 62 to 63 graphs b 1 to b 4 in fig 13 show the dry and wet changing process at the shoreside boundary areas of s2 along with the water level decreases from 2174 m to 2172 76 m the wet cells i 10 j 192 and i 70 j 192 will become dry cells in graphic b 3 dry cells where i 9 10 71 and 72 will become wet cells when water level increases to 2175 96 m in the scenario without wad the water level firstly decreasing from 2174 m to 2172 58 m the domain of wet cells is not changing even though the water level is lower than the bed elevation of grid cells where i 10 and i 71 on the next two days in graphic b 3 and graphic b 4 the water level increase by more than 2 m compared to graphic b 1 but the boundary cells are still the cells at i 10 and i 71 these results demonstrate that the moving boundary and wet dry cell transformation phenomenon cannot be simulated if the ecom without the wad scheme compare with the results of two scenarios it is obvious that the ecomsed improved with wad can well simulate the moving boundary phenomenon and keep continuous mass balance in the inland water areas especially big wide rivers and lakes there are a lot of central bars such as the manitoulin island in huron lake rao and sheng 2008 the chongming island in yangtze river zhao et al 2009 and etc these islands will be flooded when water level increasing and exposed a large stretch of sandy bank when water level decreasing to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristic in such water areas with complex landform and geology the moving boundary technology is essential requirement not only for description of natural phenomena but also for conservation principles of mass and momentum and and prosperetti 2003 compare with the results in figs 12 and 13 with the wad scheme the water level will be in a realistic smooth and continuous representations while without the wad scheme water level will be in a wide difference among the grids in the boundary areas along with the water level increasing it looks like there is an invisible dam blocking water flow and leading to incontinuous mass and momentum this will result in greater water level fluctuating in both space and time as shown in table 2 the table 2 shows the different mean water level on 4 days at section s1 and s2 on the same day the water level of s1 and s2 is similar and the difference is smaller than 0 03 m with wad but without wad the gap of water level between s1 and s2 is clearly expanding as is the case with the trends in water level changing the comparison of water level in special sections with wad and without wad shows that the entire trend of the model results agrees with each other basically the trends of water level are determined by the water volume changing from inputs and outputs inland water areas such as qingshuihai reservoirs functioning as water supplies have their own special rules for water regulation and various inputs and outfalls in wet seasons ample rainfall will bring significant inflow into qingshuihai reservoir causing water levels to rise in order to avoid flooding and protect the dam management will reduce the water level by increasing outflow and reducing or even cutting off the inflow before the wet season in this case the water level will drop sometimes down to its dead storage level from fig 14 comparing the flow of input dbc1 and output dbc2 during wet seasons from june 5 to june 20 it shows the amount of output is much higher than the input which may be caused by the regulation rule of empty reservoir storage capacity for wet seasons this phenomenon is well exhibited in fig 14 and the time series of water level shows that the average water surface elevation reduces slowly from january 1 to may 30 during this period there is little precipitation and qingshuihai reservoir provides water for kunming city as a result inflow is less than the outflow total flow rate zero and the water level is below the ini el the wet season starts from may 1 but under the regulation rule the inflow may be blocked at the beginning of the main flood period which leads to a continued decline of water level in that situation the water level reaches its lowest level on june 20 before the maximum rainfall day after that water level increases with a rising trend in total input until november with the arrival of the dry season water demand of kunming city is increasing and inflow is decreasing resulting in water level decline the discharges of inputs and outputs significantly affect the hydraulic characteristic of inland water areas especially the reservoirs and lakes should not be ignored 3 4 effects of moving confluence route methods on velocity and water mass as the water level increasing the discharge location will move closer to the fixed land inversely the location of discharging will keep away from the fixed land the water surface velocity and direction will be changed by the inputs the direction and velocity field for result observation dates near the discharge dbc1 2 is shown in figs 15 and table 3 the fig 15 shows that at the beginning of the simulation t 0 16 day inflow mainly influences the flow field which causes water surface flow velocity close to dbc1 2 to be higher than other velocities for date t 171 9 day the inflow from the tunnel is blocked by the sluice gate for flood protection in the flood season and the wind becomes the main driving force and flow direction is almost the same as the direction of wind from the northeast to southwest as shown in table 3 when the elf raises to 2175 95 m at date t 268 59 day some of the dry discharge route cells of dbc1 2 become wet cells and the one closest to the land becomes the new discharge location cell because of the large inflow from dbc1 2 the flow velocity at t 268 59 day is the maximum among the four result dates the wind is the main driving force of flow in lakes and reservoirs if there are few discharges chao et al 2008 at the discharge boundary the velocity is affected by inflow the table 3 shows the measured wind speed and direction on the four days and the velocity near the location of dbc1 2 and the mean water surface velocity msv on the 171 90 day when there is no inflow from the dbc1 2 the water velocity is almost the same as wind direction in the other three days the water direction is changed and different with the wind direction when the inflow and wind driven current mix at the areas near the dbc1 2 as the direction of the inflow from dbc1 2 is towards east the wind driven current from the north direction will be slow down by the inflow on the date 268 59 day the water velocity of the grid cells near the dbc1 2 is smaller than the mean water velocity on the date 0 16 day and 324 50 day although the wind directions are almost the same the water velocity and direction of the grid cells near the dbc1 2 are affected differently by the inflow on the date 0 16 day the water velocity of the grid cells near the dbc1 2 is bigger than the mean water velocity while on the date 324 50 day the mean water velocity is bigger the discharges will result in water velocity increasing moreau et al 2006 and also caused water velocity decreasing asselman and middelkoop 1995 the direction and magnitude of water exchange have different effects on water regimen harvey and bencala 1993 the measured mean water velocity is ranged from 0 01 to 0 05 which is the same as the simulated results the different influence of inflows has been simulated and the results of the velocity field are realistic showing that the wad scheme and modification with of moving confluence route methods in the discharge mode were successful as the reservoir is dammed the water velocity in qingshuihai is slower than most of the rivers and bays such as the irish sea with mean velocity 0 3 m s dabrowski et al 2012 and the mokelumne river with mean velocity 0 5 m s pasternack et al 2004 in the inland water areas especially lakes and reservoirs with the small velocity tributaries non point sources and point sources are mainly water and material input sources which will highly affect the velocity and water mass the qingshuihai is a lake of modest size whose changes in water level in fig 8 is driven more by inflows the water velocity is the main affecting factor of sediment transport and water quality processes ji et al 2001 thus in the inland water areas discharges should be completely considered especially the lateral discharge which is one of the major ways of water draining to the water areas and brings water into the water areas from the fixed land area with fixed location of exchanging when water level changing the inflow will disappear or be under water xue and du 2010 tested that in the casco bay the inflow coastal water could not flow into the estuary during water level decreasing dynamic input cells or outfall cells in a route from the fixed land area to the lowest area are used in the moving confluence route with which no matter how the water level changing and boundary moving the intersection of discharges will never disappear this method most closely captures the actual physical processes of discharges for mass conservation in inland water areas to conduct the wad scheme the water level and temperature of boundary wet cells will be linearly extrapolated to the neighboring dry cells which makes smoothness continuous and realistic appearance of the results while every scheme has its applicable condition and limits the decision about whether to use wad and moving confluence route or not and how to determine the depth of the thin film is up to the modeler judgment and their individual needs 4 conclusions according to the high elevation of inland areas the water depth control scheme based on a special datum was changed to water level in ecomsed based on moving boundary technology the model was modified with wetting and drying scheme and moving confluence route methods the resultant model was implemented in a water supply project reservoir qingshuihai reservoir located in a high altitude inland area of china results of the model were verified by water level and water mass conservation wad scheme effects were compared with two different scenarios that one with wad scheme and the other without wad scheme the results are as followings 1 in the water level verification the monthly absolute errors are around 0 05 and the relative errors are around 0 002 most of the daily absolute errors are less than 0 05 m for water mass conservation the absolute values of relative errors between the observed and simulated data are most under 0 5 the maximum errors are approximately 1 4 in the wet seasons the model performance was judged by nash sutcliffe coefficient ens and the coefficient of determinant r2 the ens is 0 9907 and r2 is 0 9971 2 the wet and dry cell transformation phenomenon can be well simulated through the wad scheme the results showed that the model successfully simulated the complex phenomenon of water surface elevation variation wet and dry cell transformation along with water level changes the ecomsed with the wetting and drying scheme and moving confluence route method can be more adapted for hydrodynamic simulation in inland water bodies where the water level changes greatly acknowledgements this study is funded by the china postdoctoral science foundation funded project 2016 m602364 and the major science and

7392,for three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in inland waters the rapid changes with moving boundary and various input conditions should be considered some models are developed with moving boundary but the dynamic change of discharges is unresolved or ignored for better hydrodynamic simulation in inland waters the widely used 3d model ecomsed has been improved by moving confluence route mcr method with a wetting and drying scheme wad the fixed locations of water and pollutants inputs from tributaries point sources and non point sources have been changed to dynamic confluence routes as the boundary moving the improved model was applied in an inland water area qingshuihai reservoir kunming city china for a one year hydrodynamic simulation the results were verified by water level flow velocity and water mass conservation detailed water level variation analysis and velocity field comparison at different times showed that the improved model has better performance for simulating the boundary moving phenomenon and moving discharges along with water level changing than the original one the improved three dimensional model is available for hydrodynamics simulation in water bodies where water boundary shifts along with change of water level and have various inlets keywords moving boundary ecomsed wetting and drying scheme qingshuihai reservoir moving confluence route hydrodynamic simulation 1 introduction the characteristics with high elevation complex topography rapid changes in the fluid boundary and various discharges make it complicated for hydrodynamic simulation in inland waters the water surface elevation in the floodplains shores or dikes is in an ever changing and moving boundary situation the moving boundary will change locations of point source and non point source discharges if the moving boundary and discharges phenomenon are not considered in numerical models the model momentum equation and continuity equation will lose physical significance for dry land cells causing iterative fluctuation and numerical divergence schumm and khan 1971 zhou and derby 2001 as such moving boundary technology has been proposed and developed in 1968 in the explicit finite difference model reid and bodine 1968 until now many boundary technologies are developed and have been used in solving hydraulic problems liang et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 gawlik and lew 2014 pangborn et al 2015 celli and kuznetsov 2018 the wetting and drying scheme wad using predetermined rules for judging wet or dry properties of grid cells is one of the most popular moving boundary technologies it can deal with complicated boundary conditions with a simple principle and strong applicability medeiros and hagen 2013 some state of the art and widely used three dimensionally 3d models have been improved with wad such as delft3d hydraulics 2011 mohid miranda et al 2000 environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hydro hamrick 1992 ji et al 2001 and princeton ocean model pom giunta et al 2007 oey 2005 while the dynamic changing of input outfall discharges from offshore branches non point sources and point sources along with moving boundary are not considered or ignored in these models the open source three dimensional hydrodynamic model ecomsed completely considering different discharges is based on the pom giunta et al 2007 and the coastal ocean reservoir and lake model ecom blumberg and mellor 1987 it takes the advantages of pom and ecom functions which can deal with significant topographical variability with sigma coordinate system and simulate water levels currents temperature cohesive and noncohesive sediments and waves in marine and inland fresh water areas blumberg 2002 to date the ecomsed has been widely used in numerical stimulation of offshore areas for tidal sun et al 2008 ma et al 2009 typhoon storm surge nie et al 2012 and sediment transport ma et al 2009 pang et al 2010 qiao et al 2011 while in the latest version of the ecomsed the fixed boundary scheme and fixed discharges are still used sun et al 2008 scholars have improved pom with wad scheme and used the improved model in tidal simulations such as the simulation in the san francisco bay in california usa the shenzhen bay in china and casco bay in new england usa oey et al 2010 saramul and ezer 2009 xue and du 2010 zhang et al 2009 several scholars tried to modify ecom with wad for tide or wave simulation sun et al 2008 zhang and shen 2015 these previous studies provided successful experiences in employing the moving boundary technology in these models for the changing process of boundaries in the floodplain or the dike simulation while the average depth of grid element in a specified datum such as ocean altitude datum was used to judge the wet or dry grids by counting up the water surface elevation above the specified datum and bathymetric depth below the specified datum which is reasonable in the sea or bay areas where the water surface is near sea level and the bottom elevation is negative but in the high altitude inland areas especially where water surface is gradients and water excessive oscillations the specified datum is hard to determine and the method will lead to numerical instability oey et al 2010 furthermore moving confluence location of discharges has not been mentioned in these studies for better hydrodynamic behavior of ecomsed in the inland water bodies establishing a new moving boundary method with wad and taking the moving confluence characteristic into account has attracted interests the present study was undertaken to perform better hydrodynamic simulation of the moving boundary and the discharge intersections location changing phenomenon in inland water areas based on the mature hydrodynamic model ecomsed according to the structure and details of technical characteristics sigma coordinate system existing boundary control mode and water depth control scheme of the ecomsed a specific wad scheme was proposed on account of the characteristics of inland water bodies and the wad scheme the moving boundary technology with the modified water depth control scheme and the moving confluence route method for discharges of ecomsed was put forward to test the performance of the improved ecomsed the model was applied in an inland reservoir the qingshuihai reservoir in kunming city china 2 methods 2 1 the ecomsed description the ecomsed contains five modules hydrodynamic module named ecom sediment transport module wind induced wave module heat flux module and particle tracking module the five modules can be conveniently turned on and off depending upon modeling needs and work in conjunction with another with output from one serving as input to another blumberg et al 2015 to overcome disadvantages in the vicinity of large bathymetric irregularities of the ordinary x y z coordinate system a sigma coordinate system is adopted similarly to make the grid match well with the complex topography and shoreline in offshore marine areas an orthogonal curvilinear grid is used overall three different boundary exchange modes are developed in ecom to completely reflect the influence of the discharge condition 2 1 1 the sigma coordinate system in the ecom module orthogonal curvilinear grid and sigma coordinate systems are applied in horizontal and vertical directions respectively for the convenience of using continental shelf terrain sun et al 2008 the sea surface and bottom are all horizontal in the sigma coordinate system as shown in fig 1 that simplifies establishing numerical models and shows its superiority in dealing with the boundary condition when the bottom topography is complicated along with the sigma coordinate system the orthogonal curvilinear and arakawa c staggered grid is used as its basic grid which ensures a higher grid resolution in offshore areas nie et al 2012 as shown in fig 1 in the x y z coordinate system the governing equations are continuity equation and reynolds momentum equation blumberg 2002 in the sigma coordinate system as shown in fig 1 the independent variable σ z η h η is used to replace the vertical coordinate z in the x y z coordinate system in oceanic regions the z of the mlw is always set as ocean altitude datum or specified datum where the water level z is zero and then z equals h x y at the btl therefore in the sigma coordinate system in ecom σ ranges from zero at the mlw to 1 at the btl set d h η with this change from x y z t coordinate system to sigma coordinate system x y σ t the governing equations and reynolds momentum equation are 1 η t ud x vd y ω σ 0 2 ud t u 2 d x uvd y u ω σ fvd gd η x σ k m d du d σ gd 2 ρ 0 x σ 0 ρ d σ gd ρ 0 d x σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ 3 vd t uvd x v 2 d y v ω σ fud gd η y σ k m d dv

acceleration p is pressure k m is vertical eddy diffusivity of turbulent momentum mixing f is the latitudinal variation of the coriolis parameter 2 1 2 the water depth control scheme in the water depth control scheme of ecom the water depth of grid elements is set as d h η in ecom there is only one time for checking the wet and dry attribute of grid cells h is read from the model grid files named model grid if h is larger than zero the grids will be set as wet grids during the whole simulation period that will not make any sense when ecom is used in inland regions to simulate a long period of time across the dry season and the flood season as it is difficult to determine the mlw as shown in fig 1 if the water level line of the flood season is set at the mlw all grid elements below the flood season line will be wet grid cells in ecom the attribute of grid elements dry or wet is fixed and been set before iterating calculation while when the water level declines to the mlw line or the dry season line the grid elements between flood season line and the current water level line are dry elements which should be removed from computational but are still calculated in ecom as its fixed wet attribute conversely if the dry season line is set at the mlw the h of all the grid elements whose water level is higher than the dry season s level will be set as 1 0e 10 when the water level increases these wet elements should be set as the computational grids but with its fixed boundary scheme these grids cannot be set wet in the iterating calculation of ecom in this case the wad scheme is necessary for ecom 2 2 wetting and drying scheme it is a common and important phenomenon that flow boundaries move due to water level changes this process in numerical simulation is grid transformation from wet to dry or vice versa that often results in unsteady shallow water flows in models yuan et al 2008 when water level decreases some of the original wet grids will transform to dry land and these dry elements should be removed from computations conversely as the flood wave inundates a previously dry area dry grids will translate into wet grids and then the model must adapt to include these new wet areas in boundary areas the wet and dry elements may keep changing which may vastly influence the mass and momentum conservation and calculation accuracy of these models medeiros and hagen 2013 in this case however the moving boundaries phenomenon should be considered recently there are many methods trying to describe the moving boundaries phenomenon in numerical solutions with the wetting and drying scheme wad scheme being an effective method for this 2 2 1 the process of wad scheme according to previous studies of the wad scheme oey 2005 sobey 2009 implementation of the wad scheme falls into many general steps as shown in fig 2 first a thin film should be specified for all grid elements second comparing the water depth with the thin film if the dh water depth of the grid element is greater than tfh thickness of the designed thin film the grid element will be set as a wet grid while if the water depth of the grid element is less than the grid element will be set as a dry element and be removed from the computational domain third wet elements will be calculated in the models and the dry elements near the wet elements will linearly extrapolate the fluid depth from nearby wet elements thereafter all the three processes should start again in the next step till the time reaches the end 2 2 2 the wad scheme for ecom in ecom there is a two dimensional variable named fsm specified as the mask of wet and dry elements there are two options named cold start and hot start to start the computation for which the methods of checking fsm are different in the cold start mode all initial conditions are set to zero and h should be obtained from the physical information file named as the model grid if h of a grid element is greater than 0 then fsm 1 and the grid element will be set as a wet element otherwise the grid element will be used such that fsm 0 and h 1 0e 10 as a dry element while in the hot start mode all initial conditions including h are inputted in a text file containing computed results from the previous model run in this mode only the grid elements where h greater than 1 0002 will become wet the process for judging fsm runs only one time once the wet or dry property is determined in other words as soon as the h of an element is set to a value in the model grid file it will no longer be changed during the computation in the previous studies of improving pom with wad oey et al 2010 liu and yin 2006 the original mask fsm has been retained for defining the absolute land areas where fsm 0 the other separate time dependent mask wetmask is added and defined for wet and dry dynamic interface with assigning the free surface d h η h is initial water depth below a special datum η is the tidal amplitude the mask wetmask dry if wetmask 0 wet if wetmask 1 will be judged by comparing d with a film of fluid of thickness o cm wetmask 0 if d o wetmask 1 if d o note that h is defined in the model grid files for long term simulation as initial water depth is always changing it is needed to change h in the basic model grid files which makes it inconvenient for model extension additionally in these wad scheme before computing the flow velocity of a grid a i j k the wetmask will be judged first if wetmask 0 the d of the grid a will be set to zero which will bring discontinuous errors during the computing of water level for junction areas between dry and wet grids thus the fixed bottom elevation of grid zb instead of h is used as shown in fig 3 zb is the elevation of the bottom el is the water level of water surface ini el is the initial water level before running the model max el is the elevation that water level is always lower than and min el is the lowest water level at the current lake or reservoir δ el is the change of water level from the current time step to the prior time step additionally h and η are removed from the sigma coordinate system in this case σ z el el zb at the water level line where z el σ 0 and at the bottom where z zb σ 1 dh is still the water depth that equals el zb instead of h η with this improvement the model grid files use zb instead of h the governing equations 1 to 3 will be changed to equations 4 to 6 continuity equation 4 δ el t u dh x v dh y ω σ 0 reynolds momentum equation 5 u dh t u 2 dh x uv dh y u ω σ fv dh g dh δ el x σ k m dh du d σ g dh 2 ρ 0 x σ 0 ρ d σ g dh ρ 0 dh x σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ 6 v dh t uv dh x v 2 dh y v ω σ fu dh g dh δ el y σ k m dh dv d σ g dh 2 ρ 0 y σ 0 ρ d σ g dh ρ 0 dh y σ 0 σ ρ σ d σ to implement wad in ecom the fixed land domain is defined where zb max el mfs o 0 and these cells are always dry at the same time the wet and dry dynamic domain is also defined where zb max el mfs o 1 and the grid elements can be dry or wet according to the comparison between dh and tfh the dynamic mask mfs used in the progress of solving the ecom s primitive equations is defined such that mfs 0 where mfs o 0 or mfs o 1 and dh tfh at dry cells and fixed land domain otherwise mfs 1 where mfs o 1 and dh tfh to reduce discontinuous errors when computing of water level for junction areas between dry grids and wet grids the water level of dry girds will be set equal to its neighboring wet grids set grid a i j is a dry grid its neighboring grids are b i 1 j c i j 1 d i 1 j and e i j 1 among the neighboring grids b and c are wet grids then water level el velocity vector du and dv of a i j are the average value of b and c in the cold start mode the ini el and max el are defined as shown in fig 4 the tfh is set to 0 05 m according to the former wet and dry researches oey 2005 liu and yin 2006 first mfs o will be determined second el of all the cells will be set as ini el while mfs will be determined from the logical condition whether el zb tfh then mfs 0 will be reset where the cell itself is mfs 1 but mfs 0 at its four neighboring cells thereafter the velocity water level el and all other hydrodynamic variables of the wet grid elements will be calculated at the current time step before the next time step the el velocity and momentum flux will be firstly set to zero if mfs 0 except for the near water cells whose hydrodynamic variables will be updated through linear interpolation among its neighboring wet cells after that all mfs will be checked in the hot start mode mfs o el and all other hydrodynamic variables will be inputted from the restart file the process of checking mfs and setting the value for ini el is not needed and other steps are the same as in cold start mode in this way the ecom module becomes a moving boundary structure which is available for waters that have large amplitude fluctuations of water level 2 3 moving confluence route methods in the ecom module three discharge modes have been defined river dam and onshore intake outfall exchanges qbc mode offshore intake outfall discharges dbc mode and the offshore intake outfall discharges in loops dbcl mode as shown in fig 5 in inland waters point source and non point sources are important factors influencing water quantity and water quality for many reservoirs and lakes tributaries rivers are also main intakes or outfalls of water and pollutants haimann and rangarajan 2013 as a result it is defined that tributary input is one part of the qbc mode the dbc mode is divided into two parts one is the point source discharge renamed dbc1 and the other is non point source discharge renamed dbc2 in the initial ecom all discharges enter leave at the fixed location called discharge boundary grid elements two grid elements are needed for qbc discharge location the entering leaving grid elements where fsm 1 and its connecting exterior boundary grid element where fsm 0 for the dbc discharge location only the entering leaving grid element where fsm 1 is needed a fixed location point for qbc or dbc is not adequate in the wad scheme when the boundary changes the discharge location would also change in order to match the wad scheme the discharge route is defined instead of the fixed discharge point for every discharge location the discharge route is determined by the elevation of grids as shown in fig 5 qbc 1 is one of the discharge routes and it begins at the junction of the discharge river and the max el line and ends at the grid element where zb min el the discharge route the same as a water route may be a straight line or curve but the cells in the route from the beginning to the end should be listed in descending order of zb every time after resetting the fsm the discharge location cell in the discharge route will be recomputed assuming that there are n cells in one discharge route it will be successively checked from the cell n to cell 2 and cell m will be determined as the discharge location cell if fsm m 1 and fsm m 1 0 2 m n sometimes the sewage outlets of point sources might be built inside lakes or reservoirs and in this case if zb min el at the sewage outlet its discharge location cell is fixed and the same as the sewage outlet location cell otherwise it will be treated as a discharge route beginning from the outlet location to the min el cell 3 results and discussion the qingshuihai reservoir in kunming city was selected as a study area with the improved ecomsed not only to test the performance of the wad but also to get the hydrodynamics results for further water quality and aquatic ecosystems modeling 3 1 study area descriptions and model setup kunming city the capital of yunnan province is located in southwest china the current available water resources in kunming city are less than 300 m3 per capita which is much less than the average of 2200 m3 per capita in china to solve water shortage problems many water supply projects have been pursued in recent years in kunming city the kunming qingshuihai water supply project is one of the main projects to satisfy critical water demands of kunming the qingshuihai reservoir locating at 102 57 7 e and 26 4 53 n and northwest of xundian county in kunming city is a natural lake the surface of qingshuihai has an average elevation of 2173 m and lowest storage level of 2161 m it fluctuates with an elevation range of approximately 6 m between dry and wet seasons the water supply project calls for the construction of several dams and reservoirs as well as several water conveyance systems that will bring water from four adjacent catchments shiqiaohe banqiaohe xintianhe and tabizi to qinngshuihai as shown in fig 6 for a water supply project it is important to continuously monitor and evaluate its water quality and analyze the discharge outfalls within the watershed and the four adjacent catchments on water quantity and water quality the characteristic of high altitude and multifarious inputs and outputs makes the qingshuihai reservoir a good study area for testing the wad of ecomsed 3 1 1 inputs and outputs the qingshuihai reservoir watershed covers an area of 34 5 km2 and collects annually an average of 24 7 million cubic meters of water into the lake a watershed model swat was implemented to simulate the land runoff with 32 outlets set as dbc2 discharge type water conveyance systems bring water from four adjacent catchments through two tunnels into qingshuihai reservoir which were set as dbc1 discharge type the water from shiqiaohe banqiaohe and tabizi joins together and falls into qingshuihai reservoir through dbc1 1 while xintianhe s water flows into qingshuihai reservoir through dbc1 2 as shown in fig 7 the water supply project takes water from the intake set as dbc1 3 there are automatic monitoring stations at tunnels and the intake 3 1 2 reservoir operation rules the qingshuihai water supply project will heighten the dam at the north of qingshuihai reservoir and 2180 m at its crest to 2180 m when the water level reaches 2180 m inputs from tunnels dbc1 1 dbc1 2 will be blocked and excess water will spill over the top of the dam the water from the watershed will still flow into qingshuihai reservoir leading to el greater than 2180 in local areas the time series with 24 hours intervals of rainfall water input and output conditions at dbc1s were obtained from monitoring stations and the total input of the dbc2s was obtained from the watershed model swat the fig 7 displays daily time series data of rainfall and water inputs it shows that in wet seasons from june to september the rainfall is much higher than which in dry seasons dry seasons such as november and january have little rainfall and less input but the output flow is still high other conditions such as air temperature wind barometric pressure and other meteorological data were provided by meteorological stations 3 1 3 model setup set the initial water level ini el of qingshuihai reservoir is 2174 m the max el is 2181 the min el is 2161 and the tfh is 0 05 m the max el contour line has a distance that from the east to the west is 2 2 km and 5 5 km from the south to the north the dam has been heightened and the dam began to fill in june there are 155 384 grid cells whose size ranges from 10 to 14 m eleven sigma levels are used vertically from 1 to zero with interval 0 1 the baroclinic time step is 30 s the barotropic time step is 3 s the internal external mode splitting is 10 and the period of cold start to obtain a stabilize flow is set as 12 h the mellor yamada turbulence closure model and the upwind finite difference scheme is selected in the simulation with temperature simulation included two comparative schemes with wad and without wad are set for simulation from january 1 to december 31 3 2 verification and evaluation of model performance to quantify the fit of simulation data and the measured data nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determinant r2 which are were widely used basic goodness of fit criterion for evaluating model performance engel et al 2007 park and engel 2014 were used for model verfication the model performance can be judged satisfactory if the ens 0 4 engel et al 2007 and r2 ranges from 0 to 1 the closer that r2 is to 1 the higher the precision of the simulation the water level flow velocity and water mass conservation were used for model validation from january 1 to december 31 3 2 1 water level the water level has been verified by compared with the simulated results and measured data around the center of line s2 in fig 6 for the whole year the fig 8 shows the simulated water level and the measured water level and the r2 by comparing the model calculation results with the measured data from fig 8 it is displaying that the quantity range and change trends of water level during the whole year have good consistency the mean absolute error mea has been used for yearly monthly and daily validation analysis wang et al 2016 the annual and monthly error analysis results are shown in table 1 it is displayed that from fig 8 and table 1 the biggest absolute error is 0 0968 in may most of the monthly absolute errors are around 0 05 m and the relative errors are around 0 002 wet seasons from may to aug average absolute errors are bigger than dry seasons from oct to dec for daily absolute errors analysis the biggest three absolute errors are 0 55 0 54 and 0 49 on may 20th may 29th and march 30th these errors may be caused by input and output conditions while most of the absolute errors are less than 0 05 m which is almost the same as ecom used in other studies hu et al 2009 as the ecom is rarely applied in high altitude mainland modeling previous studies about other famous 3d hydrodynamic model used in high altitude waters were selected for maximum absolute errors of water level comparison the biggest absolute errors of simulated water level in the chicago columbus drive with efdc are almost0 3 m sinha et al 2013 the water level absolute errors in the changtan reservoir in southern china where the altitude is from 138 m to 150 m with efdc are approaching1m du et al 2016 compared with these studies the improved ecomsed achieved an acceptable absolute errors of the water level the high r2 0 9944 showed in fig 8 indicated a positive relationship between accurate degree the simulated and measured water level overall the water level results verification shows that the model calculation results are credible and the improved model performed satisfactorily 3 2 2 flow velocity five measured points have been made for flow velocity verification as shown in fig 6 which are labeled with yellow circle the speed and direction of flow velocity in the surface and speeds in the vertical have been measured on date january 1st june 21 september 26 and november 21 the surface flow direction was measured by field observation with white foam the flow velocity was measured by flowquest adcp which is an ideal instrument for measuring currents and flows in oceans harbors lakes and rivers data collection voyage mode was used for flow velocity measuring from 1 to 5 after boat stability stop at the measured points data of flow velocity in different layers will be recorded flow velocity at five layers of five measured points on four days have been recorded the surface flow direction of five different measured points at noon on four days is shown in fig 9 for surface flow direction the precision of simulation results compare with measure data is over 90 it indicates that the model is capable to simulate the surface flow of lakes whose main driving force is wind as shown in fig 9 the measured direction is almost the same as the wind direction the r2 ens and mea were used for flow velocity verification results of velocity in five measured points on four days are shown in fig 10 the r2 of velocity with measured data and model results at five selected locations on four days is 0 8559 the mea is 0 0024 and the ens is 0 8214 it is clear that the model has a good performance in the three dimensional flow velocity simulation the accuracy of surface flow velocity is better than the middle layer while relatively bigger error exits at elevations around 2170 m 3 2 3 water mass conservation for hydrodynamic simulation of moving boundary an important evaluation factor is mass conservation medeiros and hagen 2013 naturally the amount of inflow outflow precipitation and evaporation will change the water volume in reservoirs in the wad scheme the water mass conservation is the basic and most important condition and basic requirement with daily observed inputs and outputs and the reservoir s initial water volume the result herein named mio the actual water volume mv of the reservoir can be calculated for summating water volume of all grids the simulated water volume sv of the reservoir can be gained for the qingshuihai reservoir the mass conservation verification formula is 7 mio t t 1 t mdbc 1 1 t mdbc 1 2 t mdbc 1 3 t n 1 32 mdbc 2 n t 86400 mra t mini

elevation of the grid cell i j el i j is the water surface elevation of grid cell i j at time t results in fig 11 show that the water mass change trend between observed and simulated in qingshuihai reservoir is similar the absolute values of relative errors between the observed and simulated data are most under 0 5 the maximum errors are approximately 1 4 in wet seasons in june along with the tremendous changes of water inputs and outfalls the amplitude change of water mass will be higher the mass and momentum conservation discrepancies have consequences for model stability and predicted results bates and hervouet 1999 the problem that potentially numerically unstable and disturbances propagated from the boundary is inevitable in the wet and dry scheme as wet dry threshold of cells or elements are identified by the small positive depth of thin film bates 2000 yuan et al 2008 the small depth hydraulics should be represented correctly and with the most suitable thin film the spurious oscillations resulting from boundary movement can be minimized bates 2000 in our research with the thin film of 0 05 m ens is 0 9951 and r2 is 0 9984 the ens and r2 are high enough to verify the accuracy of the improved model it demonstrates that the improved wad scheme in ecom conforms well to mass conservation for water mass assessment it is confirmed that with wad scheme the dynamically mass and momentum conservation are well kept while the fixed thin film is used in this study dynamic changing thin film may be helpful for mass balance and model stability as the different amplitude of water level fluctuation in different seasons for better performance of the current improved model the determination of thin film requires further careful investigation and construction 3 3 effects of wad scheme on water level to analyze the detailed effects of the wad scheme two different scenarios one with wad scheme and the other without wad scheme were compared results are displayed with water level changing at two longitudinal sections for different dates in these two scenarios as shown in fig 6 the line s1 is near the boundary of qingshuihai composed of grid cells where j 35 and line s2 is the central section containing grid cells where j 192 the s1 is a section whose profile shape looks like a w and the s2 looks like u choose the four days t 0 16 day on january 1 t 171 90 day on june 22 when the average elf is the lowest t 268 59 day on september 18 when the total input trend line reaches its peak and t 324 50 day on november 19 when average elf is the highest as the result observation dates the water levels of s1 and s2 with wad and without wad are shown in figs 12 and in 13 the fig 12 displays the water level at s1 in two scenarios in the vertical direction the graphs a 1 to a 4 show the dry and wet changing process at the middle areas of s1 from graph a 1 and graph a 2 when the water surface elevation drops from 2174 m to 2172 76 m the number of dry cells in the middle of s1 increases from the range i 26 to 35 to the range i 25 to 37 when water surface elevation increases to 2175 95 m in graph a 3 dry cells from i 25 to 37 become wet cells the graphs a 1 to a 4 in fig 12 show the water level changing process at the middle areas of s1 the initial water surfer elevation of all wet grids is 2174 m from graph a 1 and graph a 2 when the water surface elevation drops from 2174 m to 2172 63 m the water surface elevation of grid cells i 8 i 25 i 36 and i 61 is lower than its bottom elevation and should be dry cells but because of the fixed boundary scheme the grid cells will not change and are still wet cells which does not correspond to reality additionally when water surface elevation increases to 2176 12 m in graph a 3 and 2176 86 m in graph a 4 the dry cells from i 26 to 35 are still dry cells but these cells have already been inundated and become wet cells in the reality for the terrain elevation of these cells from i 26 to 35 is lower than the water surface elevation this error is equally conspicuous in grid cells from i 1 to 7 and i 62 to 63 graphs b 1 to b 4 in fig 13 show the dry and wet changing process at the shoreside boundary areas of s2 along with the water level decreases from 2174 m to 2172 76 m the wet cells i 10 j 192 and i 70 j 192 will become dry cells in graphic b 3 dry cells where i 9 10 71 and 72 will become wet cells when water level increases to 2175 96 m in the scenario without wad the water level firstly decreasing from 2174 m to 2172 58 m the domain of wet cells is not changing even though the water level is lower than the bed elevation of grid cells where i 10 and i 71 on the next two days in graphic b 3 and graphic b 4 the water level increase by more than 2 m compared to graphic b 1 but the boundary cells are still the cells at i 10 and i 71 these results demonstrate that the moving boundary and wet dry cell transformation phenomenon cannot be simulated if the ecom without the wad scheme compare with the results of two scenarios it is obvious that the ecomsed improved with wad can well simulate the moving boundary phenomenon and keep continuous mass balance in the inland water areas especially big wide rivers and lakes there are a lot of central bars such as the manitoulin island in huron lake rao and sheng 2008 the chongming island in yangtze river zhao et al 2009 and etc these islands will be flooded when water level increasing and exposed a large stretch of sandy bank when water level decreasing to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristic in such water areas with complex landform and geology the moving boundary technology is essential requirement not only for description of natural phenomena but also for conservation principles of mass and momentum and and prosperetti 2003 compare with the results in figs 12 and 13 with the wad scheme the water level will be in a realistic smooth and continuous representations while without the wad scheme water level will be in a wide difference among the grids in the boundary areas along with the water level increasing it looks like there is an invisible dam blocking water flow and leading to incontinuous mass and momentum this will result in greater water level fluctuating in both space and time as shown in table 2 the table 2 shows the different mean water level on 4 days at section s1 and s2 on the same day the water level of s1 and s2 is similar and the difference is smaller than 0 03 m with wad but without wad the gap of water level between s1 and s2 is clearly expanding as is the case with the trends in water level changing the comparison of water level in special sections with wad and without wad shows that the entire trend of the model results agrees with each other basically the trends of water level are determined by the water volume changing from inputs and outputs inland water areas such as qingshuihai reservoirs functioning as water supplies have their own special rules for water regulation and various inputs and outfalls in wet seasons ample rainfall will bring significant inflow into qingshuihai reservoir causing water levels to rise in order to avoid flooding and protect the dam management will reduce the water level by increasing outflow and reducing or even cutting off the inflow before the wet season in this case the water level will drop sometimes down to its dead storage level from fig 14 comparing the flow of input dbc1 and output dbc2 during wet seasons from june 5 to june 20 it shows the amount of output is much higher than the input which may be caused by the regulation rule of empty reservoir storage capacity for wet seasons this phenomenon is well exhibited in fig 14 and the time series of water level shows that the average water surface elevation reduces slowly from january 1 to may 30 during this period there is little precipitation and qingshuihai reservoir provides water for kunming city as a result inflow is less than the outflow total flow rate zero and the water level is below the ini el the wet season starts from may 1 but under the regulation rule the inflow may be blocked at the beginning of the main flood period which leads to a continued decline of water level in that situation the water level reaches its lowest level on june 20 before the maximum rainfall day after that water level increases with a rising trend in total input until november with the arrival of the dry season water demand of kunming city is increasing and inflow is decreasing resulting in water level decline the discharges of inputs and outputs significantly affect the hydraulic characteristic of inland water areas especially the reservoirs and lakes should not be ignored 3 4 effects of moving confluence route methods on velocity and water mass as the water level increasing the discharge location will move closer to the fixed land inversely the location of discharging will keep away from the fixed land the water surface velocity and direction will be changed by the inputs the direction and velocity field for result observation dates near the discharge dbc1 2 is shown in figs 15 and table 3 the fig 15 shows that at the beginning of the simulation t 0 16 day inflow mainly influences the flow field which causes water surface flow velocity close to dbc1 2 to be higher than other velocities for date t 171 9 day the inflow from the tunnel is blocked by the sluice gate for flood protection in the flood season and the wind becomes the main driving force and flow direction is almost the same as the direction of wind from the northeast to southwest as shown in table 3 when the elf raises to 2175 95 m at date t 268 59 day some of the dry discharge route cells of dbc1 2 become wet cells and the one closest to the land becomes the new discharge location cell because of the large inflow from dbc1 2 the flow velocity at t 268 59 day is the maximum among the four result dates the wind is the main driving force of flow in lakes and reservoirs if there are few discharges chao et al 2008 at the discharge boundary the velocity is affected by inflow the table 3 shows the measured wind speed and direction on the four days and the velocity near the location of dbc1 2 and the mean water surface velocity msv on the 171 90 day when there is no inflow from the dbc1 2 the water velocity is almost the same as wind direction in the other three days the water direction is changed and different with the wind direction when the inflow and wind driven current mix at the areas near the dbc1 2 as the direction of the inflow from dbc1 2 is towards east the wind driven current from the north direction will be slow down by the inflow on the date 268 59 day the water velocity of the grid cells near the dbc1 2 is smaller than the mean water velocity on the date 0 16 day and 324 50 day although the wind directions are almost the same the water velocity and direction of the grid cells near the dbc1 2 are affected differently by the inflow on the date 0 16 day the water velocity of the grid cells near the dbc1 2 is bigger than the mean water velocity while on the date 324 50 day the mean water velocity is bigger the discharges will result in water velocity increasing moreau et al 2006 and also caused water velocity decreasing asselman and middelkoop 1995 the direction and magnitude of water exchange have different effects on water regimen harvey and bencala 1993 the measured mean water velocity is ranged from 0 01 to 0 05 which is the same as the simulated results the different influence of inflows has been simulated and the results of the velocity field are realistic showing that the wad scheme and modification with of moving confluence route methods in the discharge mode were successful as the reservoir is dammed the water velocity in qingshuihai is slower than most of the rivers and bays such as the irish sea with mean velocity 0 3 m s dabrowski et al 2012 and the mokelumne river with mean velocity 0 5 m s pasternack et al 2004 in the inland water areas especially lakes and reservoirs with the small velocity tributaries non point sources and point sources are mainly water and material input sources which will highly affect the velocity and water mass the qingshuihai is a lake of modest size whose changes in water level in fig 8 is driven more by inflows the water velocity is the main affecting factor of sediment transport and water quality processes ji et al 2001 thus in the inland water areas discharges should be completely considered especially the lateral discharge which is one of the major ways of water draining to the water areas and brings water into the water areas from the fixed land area with fixed location of exchanging when water level changing the inflow will disappear or be under water xue and du 2010 tested that in the casco bay the inflow coastal water could not flow into the estuary during water level decreasing dynamic input cells or outfall cells in a route from the fixed land area to the lowest area are used in the moving confluence route with which no matter how the water level changing and boundary moving the intersection of discharges will never disappear this method most closely captures the actual physical processes of discharges for mass conservation in inland water areas to conduct the wad scheme the water level and temperature of boundary wet cells will be linearly extrapolated to the neighboring dry cells which makes smoothness continuous and realistic appearance of the results while every scheme has its applicable condition and limits the decision about whether to use wad and moving confluence route or not and how to determine the depth of the thin film is up to the modeler judgment and their individual needs 4 conclusions according to the high elevation of inland areas the water depth control scheme based on a special datum was changed to water level in ecomsed based on moving boundary technology the model was modified with wetting and drying scheme and moving confluence route methods the resultant model was implemented in a water supply project reservoir qingshuihai reservoir located in a high altitude inland area of china results of the model were verified by water level and water mass conservation wad scheme effects were compared with two different scenarios that one with wad scheme and the other without wad scheme the results are as followings 1 in the water level verification the monthly absolute errors are around 0 05 and the relative errors are around 0 002 most of the daily absolute errors are less than 0 05 m for water mass conservation the absolute values of relative errors between the observed and simulated data are most under 0 5 the maximum errors are approximately 1 4 in the wet seasons the model performance was judged by nash sutcliffe coefficient ens and the coefficient of determinant r2 the ens is 0 9907 and r2 is 0 9971 2 the wet

7393,nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural areas poses a major challenge to the sustainability of water resources aquifer vulnerability models are useful tools that can help resource managers identify areas of concern but quantifying nitrogen n inputs in such models is challenging especially at large spatial scales we sought to improve regional nitrate no3 input functions by characterizing unsaturated zone no3 transport to groundwater through use of surrogate machine learning metamodels of a process based n flux model the metamodels used boosted regression trees brts to relate mappable landscape variables to parameters and outputs of a previous vertical flux method vfm applied at sampled wells in the fox wolf and peshtigo fwp river basins in northeastern wisconsin in this context the metamodels upscaled the vfm results throughout the region and the vfm parameters and outputs are the metamodel response variables the study area encompassed the domain of a detailed numerical model that provided additional predictor variables including groundwater recharge to the metamodels we used a statistical learning framework to test a range of model complexities to identify suitable hyperparameters of the six brt metamodels corresponding to each response variable of interest no3 source concentration factor which determines the local no3 input concentration unsaturated zone travel time no3 concentration at the water table in 1980 2000 and 2020 three separate metamodels and no3 extinction depth the eventual steady state depth of the no3 front the final metamodels were trained to 129 wells within the active numerical flow model area and considered 58 mappable predictor variables compiled in a geographic information system gis these metamodels had training and cross validation testing r2 values of 0 52 0 86 and 0 22 0 38 respectively and predictions were compiled as maps of the above response variables testing performance was reasonable considering that we limited the metamodel predictor variables to mappable factors as opposed to using all available vfm input variables relationships between metamodel predictor variables and mapped outputs were generally consistent with expectations e g with greater source concentrations and no3 at the groundwater table in areas of intensive crop use and well drained soils shorter unsaturated zone travel times in poorly drained areas likely indicated preferential flow through clay soils and a tendency for fine grained deposits to collocate with areas of shallower water table numerical estimates of groundwater recharge were important in the metamodels and may have been a proxy for n input and redox conditions in the northern fwp which had shallow predicted no3 extinction depth the metamodel results provide proof of concept for regional characterization of unsaturated zone no3 transport processes in a statistical framework based on readily mappable gis input variables keywords metamodel nitrate boosted regression trees cross validation unsaturated zone groundwater 1 introduction nitrate no3 is one of the most pervasive contaminants in domestic wells in the u s particularly in agricultural areas where inorganic fertilizer and or manure are used to aid crop production desimone et al 2009 dubrovsky et al 2010 no3 concentration in this work is reported as n statistical water quality models are commonly used to predict the vulnerability of aquifers to nitrate contamination but quantification of n inputs from fertilizer manure and other sources to use as predictor variables is challenging particularly at large spatial scales land applied fertilizer n estimates derived from county level data are often used as n input in such models gronberg and spahr 2012 nolan and hitt 2006 ruddy et al 2006 warner and arnold 2010 wheeler et al 2015 but do not consider the amount of no3 that leaches to the water table and the no3 leaching fraction is not the same everywhere and depends on variations in soil texture unsaturated zone thickness recharge rate and other factors kurtzman et al 2013 liao et al 2012 nolan et al 2012 nitrogen input estimates also are used in numerical modeling approaches e g modflow modpath to predict no3 concentration in pumped wells and at stream interfaces green et al 2010 kauffman et al 2001 koh et al 2016 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 sanford and pope 2013 starn and brown 2007 for example starn and brown 2007 used modflow modpath particle tracking to relate land use and residence time in the contributing recharge area of a public supply well in connecticut to concentrations of no3 and other water quality parameters in pumped groundwater nitrate trends in the well were simulated over four decades based on initial concentrations beneath various land uses however such travel times typically do not include residence time in the unsaturated zone which causes contaminant responses in aquifers to lag behind changes in n input at the land surface accounting for unsaturated zone travel time would indicate the total time required for changes in water quality at pumped wells following management actions at the land surface additionally refined water table n input functions may improve modflow modpath predictions of no3 concentration more recently a vertical flux method vfm was developed for efficient estimation of no3 flux to the water table in the fox wolf peshtigo fwp area of northeastern wisconsin usa fig 1 green et al 2018 the vfm is a mechanistic model that is calibrated to measured groundwater chemistry data to estimate hydrologic and reactive processes based on a consistent hydrogeochemical framework among sites groundwater chemistry data consisted of o2 excess n2 from denitrification no3 and atmospheric groundwater age tracers including tritium tritiogenic helium chlorofluorocarbons and carbon 14 from 250 wells sampled during 1966 2015 vfm calibration r2 values ranged from 0 56 for tritiogenic helium to 0 99 for no3 vfm parameters and outputs pertinent to the current study include nitrate concentration at the water table cs no3 t in 1980 2000 and 2020 n source concentration factor fcn which determines the local no3 input concentration at the well mean unsaturated zone travel time τ u and no3 extinction depth in the aquifer zss which is the eventual steady state depth of the no3 front green et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the travel time of solute to a specified depth is based on a two dimensional conceptual model of a water table aquifer underlain by a confining unit the extinction depth corresponds to that at which no3 declines to a negligible value in the denitrification zone zero plus a small amount caused by dispersion at the given recharge rate adjustable or derived vfm parameters include fcn and τ u whereas zss and cs no3 t are outputs of the method for the purposes of this discussion all of these are referred to as vfm parameters in the methods we provide equations to explain the role of selected parameters in the vfm model to help interpret the metamodeling results interested readers may consult green et al 2018 for more detailed discussion of the vfm we anticipate that the above vfm parameters will benefit future statistical and numerical groundwater quality models of the region by providing improved n input functions for example unsaturated zone n leaching flux was ranked third of 145 predictor variables screened in a boosted regression tree brt model of groundwater no3 in the central valley california and was also ranked third of 25 variables in the final model ransom et al 2017 however vfm parameters are available only at wells with sufficient tracer data to calibrate the method to address this limitation we developed brt metamodels to extend vfm parameters throughout unsampled areas of the fwp brt is a machine learning additive tree method that dispenses with hypothesis testing assumptions associated with traditional regression boosting combines many simple models weak learners to improve predictive performance elith et al 2008 the method does not require data transformation can fit complex nonlinear relations and automatically incorporates interactions among predictor variables early boosting algorithms from the 1990s used ensembles of weak classifiers to reduce misclassification error rate kuhn and johnson 2013 friedman 2001 introduced brt a gradient boosting machine which comprises both classification and regression and which finds an additive tree model that minimizes a statistical loss function brt has been successfully implemented in studies of groundwater arsenic ayotte et al 2016 no3 nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017 redox rosecrans et al 2017b and ph rosecrans et al 2017a in the central valley of california three of the above studies compared brt with traditional linear classification or regression and found that the former yielded superior predictive performance brt models of groundwater no3 in the central valley yielded r2 values of 0 89 and 0 26 for training and hold out data respectively whereas multiple linear regression mlr had r2 values of 0 42 and 0 07 respectively nolan et al 2015 a follow up groundwater no3 model of the same region that included groundwater redox and age as predictor variables yielded brt training and hold out r2 values of 0 83 and 0 44 respectively whereas mlr had r2 values of 0 42 and 0 31 ransom et al 2017 therefore mlr explained less than half the variation in the training data in these studies similarly brt outperformed logistic regression lr a linear classifier according to multiple fit criteria for probability models of groundwater arsenic in the central valley ayotte et al 2016 brt yielded higher training and hold out accuracies and sensitivities than lr at both arsenic thresholds considered 5 and 10 μg l the six vfm parameters discussed above are the response variables for separate brt metamodels a metamodel is a statistical surrogate for a more computationally expensive or data intensive model fienen et al 2015 piñeros garcet et al 2006 and typically is constructed by training outputs of the underlying complex model to that model s inputs the latter are compiled in gis if the objective is regional prediction by the metamodel i e mapping metamodels have previously been used to predict contaminant transport in soils and groundwater in the midwestern usa and elsewhere bouzaher et al 1993 el tabach et al 2007 holman et al 2004 nolan et al 2012 and to predict components of groundwater flow at pumped wells fienen et al 2016 extending the vfm no3 flux parameters of green et al 2018 wall to wall throughout the fwp would indicate aquifer vulnerability and as mentioned above provide potentially useful predictor variables for future water quality models accordingly the objectives of the current research were to 1 develop metamodels of vfm no3 flux parameters and 2 to apply the metamodels for gis mapping of predicted vfm parameters throughout the fwp region 2 methods 2 1 study area description the study area comprised the fox wolf and peshtigo basins in the lake michigan basin of northeastern wisconsin fig 1 the area has a northern temperate climate and receives on average about 80 cm per year of precipitation mean daily temperature ranges from 13 degrees c to 27 degrees juckem et al 2017 the study area is bounded by the active modflow model domain of juckem et al 2017 which supplied modflow simulated groundwater recharge and depth to water and percent coarse fraction from well logs for use as predictor variables in the metamodels the study area contains numerous lakes and wetlands especially in the north which is predominantly forest the overall landscape reflects glacial landforms with watershed divides formed by glacial moraines cultivated crops and pasture are more common in the southern part of the study area the surficial glacial aquifer and underlying bedrock aquifer are the primary aquifers in the region to the north and west the glacial aquifer is predominant and overlies impermeable crystalline bedrock whereas to the south and east glacial sediments are more fine grained and sandstone and dolomite aquifers are the primary sources of groundwater in general the glacial sediments transition from coarse grained deposits in the west to finer grained deposits in the east juckem et al 2017 2 2 vertical flux method vfm parameter estimates were obtained for the study area from green et al 2018 who updated the original method of liao et al 2012 to include an advective dispersion travel time distribution ttd time varying leaching fractions and a no3 concentration scaling factor to account for local variability of n source and n uptake in soils these enhancements enable backcasting and forecasting of water table no3 concentration based on temporal trends in historical local no3 concentrations in groundwater recharge vfm equations and parameters important in this regard are as follows solutes are simulated for a single date of interest using a convolution equation comprising the tracer concentration input function and the advective dispersion ttd as described by green et al 2018 1 c s i t t c 0 i t r i t t i g t t dt where cs i is the concentration of solute i at the sampling location at time t c0 i is the solute concentration at the time of entry at the land surface t ri is the mass lost to reactions between the date at which the reaction begins t i and the time of sampling and g is a travel time distribution ttd describing output of a conservative tracer injected instantaneously at the inlet the time of travel between input and time of sampling is τ t t the advective dispersion ttd component is given by green et al 2018 2 g τ d τ 4 π d τ 3 exp d τ 4 τ 1 τ τ 2 where d is a dimensionless dispersion coefficient and τ is the mean travel time the parameter d is defined as d x α where α is the dispersivity parallel to flow and x is the vertical transport distance the vfm is calibrated to tracer data from the saturated zone whereas the total travel time reflects the unsaturated zone therefore the total mean travel time is the sum of the mean travel times in the unsaturated zone τ u and saturated zone τ s τ τ u τ s the local concentration input function c0 i t is obtained for each well by multiplying a regional average input or shape function by the linear scaling factor fcn to account for local variability unsaturated zone mean travel time τ u is a function of unsaturated zone thickness and two vfm parameters recharge rate and unsaturated zone mobile water content the eventual steady state depth of no3 in the aquifer under steady state conditions zss or no3 extinction depth in m is a function of recharge rate and other vfm parameters green et al 2018 2 3 stochastic gradient boosted regression trees we trained stochastic gradient brt metamodels to selected vfm parameters at sampled wells fcn cs no3 t τ u zss using gis landscape data as predictor variables to facilitate prediction in unsampled areas the metamodels were then applied throughout the active modflow modeling domain of juckem et al 2017 fig 1 to map the vfm parameters in an aquifer vulnerability context boosted regression is an additive model defined as hastie et al 2009 3 f x m 1 m β m b x λ m where βm are expansion coefficients corresponding to the m trees x is the set of predictor variables λm parameterizes splitting variables at internal nodes and predictions at terminal nodes and b x λm is a basis function that represents a single tree we used stagewise boosting such that βm and λm are estimated sequentially from m 1 to m and each new tree is fitted to the residuals of the previous tree we used the squared error loss function for brt model training 4 l y f x y f x 2 where y is the observed value of the response variable which in the metamodel context is a vfm parameter stochastic gradient boosting involves steepest descent minimization friedman 2001 and estimates βm to minimize the overall loss randomness at each sequential step is accomplished through bootstrap aggregation bagging machine learning methods such as brt are prone to overfitting which can degrade predictions to new data hastie et al 2009 therefore we evaluated a range of model complexities within a statistical learning framework hastie et al 2009 nolan et al 2015 to identify suitable hyperparameters of the brt metamodels for each response variable of interest we used k fold cross validation cv tuning to optimize the following hyperparameters interaction depth i e tree depth which controls tree size learning rate shrinkage which controls the contribution of each new tree to the model and the number of trees which controls the degree of model training the number of folds k specifies the number of training and testing data sets of approximately equal size for estimation of expected testing error best models were those that minimized cv testing root mean square error rmse the brt metamodel response variables comprised those vfm parameters of green et al 2018 that pertain to aquifer vulnerability to nitrate these were designated vfm fcn fcn in the above discussion vfm travel time yrs τ u zss n ext depth zss and no3 wt mgl yr cs no3 t where yr 1980 2000 and 2020 each year is a separate metamodel response variable table 1 2 4 metamodel training and testing metamodel development proceeded in two phases in phase i we used cv tuning to test a wide range of brt hyperparameter values based on 250 wells from green et al 2018 predictor variables comprised data on land use soil chemistry soil physical properties surficial geology hydrology and weather in the study area hyperparameter ranges tested in the models were interaction depth 2 16 incremented by 1 learning rate 0 001 0 015 by 0 001 number of trees 500 2000 by 500 these ranges resulted in 900 unique combinations of hyperparameters corresponding to different levels of brt model complexity we applied five fold cv to each of the 900 model configurations for each of the six metamodel response variables 27 000 brt runs total and selected those models that minimized average cv testing rmse we evaluated both untransformed and natural log transformed response variables during phase i to see if the latter improved cv testing performance in phase ii we re trained the best phase i metamodels using 129 wells sampled during 1993 2014 within the active modflow model area of juckem et al 2017 fig 1 and 58 mappable predictor variables that had comparatively high relative influence in the phase i metamodels table s1 in the supplementary material we emphasized the active modflow area because of the high relative influence of modflow estimated groundwater recharge in several of the metamodels the relative influence measures the effect of individual predictors on the variation of model outputs and is generalized by averaging over all trees in the additive model friedman 2001 using the method of ransom et al 2017 the brt metamodels were further simplified by deleting predictor variables one at a time in an iterative loop starting with the variable that had the lowest relative influence and re fitting the model at each iteration the hyperparameters were held constant at the optimal values obtained in phase i for a given model we stopped eliminating variables when the hold out rmse increased by more than about 1 hold out data consisted of 65 samples randomly selected from among alternate sampling dates at the training wells the hold out samples reflect temporal variability of vfm parameters rather than spatial variability because they were culled from the same 129 wells used in model training we eliminated an additional 20 wells from the vfm travel time yrs metamodel these comprised 11 bedrock wells and 9 wells in the northern part of the fwp study area where small lakes and wetlands are abundant such features are expected to function as weak hydraulic sinks that remove shallow groundwater and thereby disconnect rates of unsaturated zone recharge from groundwater vertical velocities as inferred from age tracers abrams et al 2013 we removed the same 11 bedrock wells from the zss n ext depth metamodel we employed brt r package gbm v 2 1 1 ridgeway 2013 within r s caret package v 6 0 71 kuhn 2014 to train and test the metamodels the gbm package includes a function for partial dependence plots to visualize relations between the brt predicted response variable and a predictor variable the marginal effect of a selected predictor variable is determined by integrating over the joint probability density of the predictor variables friedman 2001 maps of vfm response variables were obtained by applying final brt metamodels to mappable predictor variables rasterized within 1 km2 grid cells brt predictions were made for each of the 49 000 grid cells in the study area using the predict function in r s raster package v 2 5 8 hijmans 2016 and the results were mapped in gis using v 10 5 of arcgis esri 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 metamodel response variables summary statistics of the metamodel response variables for the training wells are provided in table 1 and the values of these variables at sampled wells are shown in figs 3 6 8 9 in general maps of vfm fcn no3 wt mgl yr and zss ext depth followed patterns of agricultural intensity with greater source concentration factor no3 concentration and no3 extinction depth in the southwestern fwp which coincides with cultivated cropland and well drained soils these trends are consistent with predictions of current groundwater no3 distributions in the study area based on statistical analysis of water quality data tesoriero et al 2017 in contrast vfm travel time yrs appears more related to soil and aquifer texture these relations are discussed in more detail below 3 2 metamodel training and testing a range of model complexities was tried in phase i and evaluated using cv five of six minimum cv testing rmse metamodels had low interaction depth 2 3 which is consistent with the concept of weak learners in an additive model table 2 in general aggregate models comprising many simple trees weak learners more accurately predict to new data than single large complex trees hastie et al 2009 the maximum interaction depth of 7 corresponds to the vfm no3 2020 model and indicates moderate complexity given the range of depths tested 2 16 according to cv testing r2 values model fits of vfm travel time yrs and zss n ext depth benefitted from log transformation therefore only log space results are shown for these two metamodels all metamodels were compared using r2 to accommodate different units of measurement cross validation testing r2 of final metamodels in phase i ranged from 0 22 for no3 wt mgl 2000 to 0 38 zss n ext depth which is fairly typical of statistical groundwater quality models the metamodels relied only on gis mappable predictor variables land use soils and other factors as opposed to vfm input parameters and measured data such as well depth and water level these r2 values are affected by noise and uncertainty related to mappable predictor variables that are not directly tied to vfm model parameters as opposed to greater r2 values in studies that directly relate model outputs to input variables for example fienen et al 2016 obtained cv testing r2 values of 0 69 0 86 for metamodels based on modflow inputs and outputs in the lake michigan basin bouzaher et al 1993 obtained cv testing r2 values of 0 83 0 85 for metamodels of atrazine leaching in the midwestern u s the metamodel predictor variables in the latter study were inputs to the pesticide root zone model such as soil and pesticide properties results in the current paper are more consistent with the brt models of nolan et al 2015 and ransom et al 2017 who obtained cv testing r2 values of 0 36 0 39 and 0 45 respectively when relating measured groundwater no3 concentration to mappable predictor variables including land use and soils data the best phase i metamodels were further simplified in phase ii and evaluated using hold out data hold out performance r2 0 45 0 78 table 2 was better than that of cv testing and approached that obtained by fienen et al 2016 hold out r2 0 80 0 85 in the current study we regard cv testing as a better indication of the predictive capability of the metamodels in a mapping spatial context hold out data were used only in phase ii with the iterative variable deletion loop which had constant values of hyperparameters for each model and which did not involve cv tuning scatterplots of observed vfm parameters vs metamodel predictions are shown in figs s1a f in the supplementary material 3 3 metamodel outputs and relations with predictor variables maps of metamodel outputs show a gradient from high values in the southwest fwp to comparatively low values in the northeast for both n source concentration factor vfm fcn which decreased from 2 3 to 0 25 and water table no3 concentration no3 wt mgl yr yr 1980 2000 2020 which decreased from 20 mg l overall to about 0 mg l figs 3 6 all metamodel response variables are defined in table 1 white areas on the maps correspond to missing values of predictor variables relations between agricultural land use and outputs by these four metamodels were corroborated by the relative influence of predictor variables fig s2 and partial dependence plots figs s3 s8 the concentration gradients were driven primarily by longitudinal position dec long ranked 1 2 in these four metamodels and percent cropland in 1974 near sampled wells cat43 lu74 ranked 1 3 fig s2 in fig s2 the length of the bar indicates the normalized relative influence of a predictor variable in the brt metamodels cultivated crops are more common in the southwestern fwp compared with the southeast which has more pasture hay and the north which has predominantly deciduous forest and woody wetlands fig 1 cropland in 1974 cat43 lu74 is more prevalent in the south central and central parts of the fwp where proportions of this land use exceeding 80 were more extensive orange red areas in fig s9 the fact that older cropland 1974 was consistently ranked higher than 1992 agricultural land use in these metamodels suggests that no3 in sampled wells tended to originate at land surface around 1974 or earlier sampling dates in the data set ranged from 1993 to 2014 implying lag times of 19 to 40 years or more as compared to a median travel time of 46 years calculated for samples in green et al 2018 with age tracers regarding these four metamodels we anticipate that increasing cropland over well drained soils orange red areas in fig s10 would increase the fraction of no3 that is leached to groundwater and associated concentrations of no3 at the water table this interaction is supported by the presence of variables cat43 lu74 and drnclass 5 somewhat excessively drained soils ranked 2nd and 8th respectively in the vfm fcn model partial dependence plots of top ranked variables show the direction of influence of the most important predictors in these plots the predicted response on the y axis is labeled as a function of the indicated predictor variable for the above metamodels predicted vfm fcn or no3 wt mgl yr increased sharply as the proportion of 1974 cropland near the well approached 0 6 figs s3 s6 these same four metamodels also had consistent relations with dec long where predicted vfm fcn or no3 wt mgl yr decreased with increasing values of dec long i e going from west to east as land use shifts from cultivated crops to pasture hay along this gradient in the southern part of the fwp soils change from well drained and excessively well drained to moderately well drained fig s10 therefore dec long may reflect the interaction of fertilizer addition and soil type relations among soils cropland and or inorganic n fertilizer input have been noted in national and regional groundwater quality modeling studies nolan and hitt 2006 ransom et al 2017 warner and arnold 2010 wheeler et al 2015 water table no3 concentration is predicted to increase from low to moderate levels across much of the fwp in 2020 compared with 1980 and 2000 levels according to green et al 2018 the estimated regional average input concentrations of no3 are relatively constant after 1985 therefore the largest increases of no3 at the water table occur in areas with high source concentration factor fcn which is related to land use and soils as discussed above this is seen by comparing the predicted fcn map fig 3 with a map of 1980 to 2020 differences in water table no3 concentrations i e 2020 predictions minus 1980 predictions fig 7 the water table no3 increases are also related to mean travel time according to the advective dispersion form of the travel time distribution g τ which is a component of eq 1 as τ increases g τ is shifted to increasingly greater travel times as indicated by eq 2 and the convolution integral is more strongly affected by pre 1985 portions of the no3 input function when input no3 concentrations were changing most rapidly green et al 2018 this causes cs no3 t to increase eq 1 if the mean unsaturated zone travel time is close to zero then the water table no3 concentration will remain relatively constant after 1985 in tandem with the constant inputs the map of 1980 2020 water table no3 differences fig 7 compares reasonably well with the map of predicted unsaturated zone travel time vfm travel time yrs fig 8 except for the northern fwp which has predominantly forested land use and presumably low n input in the southwestern and southeastern fwp predicted unsaturated zone travel times of 10 30 years coincide with water table nitrate increases of 2 mg l or more metamodel predicted no3 extinction depth zss n ext depth followed a similar pattern as the above response variables and was greater in the southwestern fwp and comparatively shallow in the southeastern and north central parts of the watershed fig 9 deeper values of zss n ext depth 20 m coincided with areas of cultivated crops fig 1 and well drained soils fig s10 indicating that the same processes that increase no3 loading to the water table result in deeper penetration of no3 into the aquifer additional factors related to zss n ext depth include groundwater recharge soil properties and land surface elevation numerical model estimates of groundwater recharge recharge1juckem table s1 fig s11 were ranked 2 4 in four of the metamodels vfm fcn no3 wt mgl 2000 no3 wt mgl 2020 zss n ext depth but in some cases the variable appeared to be a surrogate for other factors the predicted responses of fcn and water table no3 to recharge were nonlinear and increased sharply at about 13 in yr 33 cm yr figs s3 s5 s6 increases in water table no3 would be expected for increased flows of water and chemicals through the unsaturated zone on the other hand no3 extinction depth in the aquifer zss n ext depth generally decreased as recharge1juckem rank 4 increased to about 12 in yr 30 cm yr fig s7 which is the same range at which the above response variables are less sensitive to increasing recharge suggesting that moderate values of recharge are tied to no3 reduction processes zss n ext depth has a slight negative correlation with recharge1juckem for wells in the training data set spearman correlation ρ 0 13 p 0 15 zss n ext depth is sensitive to recharge for values of recharge1juckem between 4 and 12 in yr 10 and 30 cm yr which are in the northern part of the fwp green and yellow areas in fig s11 there are generally less cultivated crops in the northwestern fwp fig 1 except for an isolated irrigated area in central langlade county this same area tends to have more poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained soils green and yellow areas in fig s10 recharge may be a proxy for n input and redox conditions in this area as recharge increases cultivated crops and associated n input extent of well drained soils and oxic conditions in soils and groundwater generally decrease which decreases the depth to which no3 penetrates the aquifer zss n ext depth is flat insensitive for values of recharge1juckem 12 in yr 30 cm yr suggesting a minimal no3 extinction depth for the region and offset of the above factors by high no3 input to the water table additional important factors suggested by the zss n ext depth partial dependence plot and or relative influence values include available water storage in soil aws025wta rank 1 inorganic carbon content of the a soil horizon a c inorg rank 2 moderately fine textured soils hydgrpb rank 5 and soil organic matter content avg om rank 8 which in combination suggest conditions that favor denitrification in the shallow part of the groundwater system as aws025wta increased beyond 3 cm predicted zss n ext depth decreased sharply fig s7 suggesting a soil water threshold for denitrification as a c inorg increased to about 0 3 predicted no3 extinction depth decreased rapidly inorganic carbon is associated with greater alkalinity and ph and losses of n to denitrification tend to be greater in neutral or alkaline soils than in acidic soils šimek and cooper 2002 increased alkalinity can be directly associated with microbial activity e g with production of co2 from organic carbon during denitrification nascimento et al 1997 as avg om increased to about 5 predicted zss n ext depth decreased sharply not shown organic carbon is a common electron donor driving microbial activity in soils and groundwater mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and as per the above can be a source of dissolved inorganic carbon during denitrification taken together relations among zss n ext depth and these predictor variables point to the role of denitrification in soils and shallow groundwater which decreases the penetration depth of no3 in the aquifer predicted zss n ext depth also decreased as alt ft raster land surface elevation increased fig s7 which is likely related to the increase in forested areas that occur at higher elevations in the northern part of the fwp region the forested areas would be expected to have reduced n input compared with agricultural areas metamodel predicted unsaturated zone travel time vfm travel time yrs was generally greater in the western fwp up to 39 years as shown in fig 8 and was influenced by soils and unsaturated zone thickness predicted vfm travel time yrs decreased rapidly as somewhat poorly drained soils drnclass 6 rank 2 increased to about 20 fig s8 which suggests preferential flow in soils with high clay content the drnclass 6 variable is positively correlated with clay content of soils near wells in the data set ρ 0 45 p 0 0001 macropores in soils with high clay content would be expected to rapidly transmit water through the unsaturated zone decreasing residence time this explanation is supported by the spatial pattern of soils with high clay content 20 percent of more which are found in the southeastern portion of the study area and to a lesser extent in the northwestern part fig s12 the high clay areas generally coincide with areas having vfm travel time yrs values of 0 5 years as well as areas having drnclass 6 values of 50 percent or more yellow to red areas on fig s13 in contrast longer predicted travel times 10 39 years extending north south through the study area coincide with drnclass 6 values 10 percent and clay values 15 percent these relations are also consistent with the partial dependence plot of soil drainage rank 3 vs predicted vfm travel time yrs fig s8 the drainage variable was calculated as the weighted average of drainage classes ranked from low to high 1 7 where 1 very poorly drained and 7 excessively well drained and is inversely correlated with the clay content of soils near wells in the data set ρ 0 43 p 0 0001 vfm travel time yrs initially was at a minimum predicted value 1 5 yrs that corresponds to very poorly and poorly drained soils assumed to have macropore features vfm travel time yrs increased sharply for somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained soils fig s8 suggesting less influence from clay soils this relation is supported by the soil drainage map fig s10 which shows areas of moderately to excessively well drained soils going from southwest to northeast in the study area orange red areas on the map these same areas drainage values 4 in fig s8 have longer predicted travel times 5 years predicted vfm travel time yrs initially increased as alt ft raster rank 4 increased fig s8 which may relate to increasing unsaturated zone travel distance and residence time the spatial pattern of high values of predicted vfm travel time yrs in the northwestern fwp yellow to red areas in that part of fig 8 coincides with the high land elevation in this area approaching 1900 ft 580 m and depth to water approaching 300 ft 91 m figs s14 and s15 respectively 4 conclusions this study used a metamodel approach to extrapolate process based modeling results from data centered point locations to continuous regions boosted regression trees were used to relate gis mappable predictor variables to the parameters of a mechanistic vertical flux method metamodeled vfm parameters included the n source concentration factor mean unsaturated zone travel time no3 concentrations at the water table at various time intervals 1980 2000 and 2010 and the extinction depth of no3 maps of these quantities generally were consistent with predictor variables and major geographical features such as unsaturated zone thickness crop land uses and soils in the current study individual regression trees were weak learners with comparatively small numbers of predictor variables and the overall number of predictor variables in the aggregate models was iteratively reduced while maintaining acceptable predictive performance predictive performance obtained by the metamodels may have been hampered by the considerable spatial variability of unsaturated zone and groundwater quality conditions in the glacial aquifer however results were comparable to those of previous statistical models that relied on gis mapped predictor variables additionally the training performance of the metamodels was good with r2 values consistently 0 50 previous multiple linear regression models of groundwater nitrate explained less than half the variation in training data and the predictive performance of such models was poor compared with boosted regression trees the comparatively high training r2 values in the current study lend confidence to interpretations based on partial dependence plots which provided useful insights into the influence of landscape attributes on unsaturated zone no3 fluxes we anticipate that the metamodel outputs will benefit future statistical and numerical water quality models of the region through improved characterization of no3 input functions estimates of unsaturated zone n input substantially improved a previous groundwater nitrate model of the central valley therefore the usefulness of the approach does not depend solely on the predictive performance of the metamodels themselves the current metamodel approach satisfies the objective of interpolating transport processes and features between local data centered points for future studies addressing larger areas it may be advantageous to test extrapolation into unsampled regions outside of the study area on which the metamodels were trained results of the current study highlight several issues that may be involved with extrapolation hydrogeochemical predictor variables related to soils land use and hydrology may be straight forward to extrapolate into neighboring areas other predictor variables may be less suitable for extrapolation across diverse landscapes for example modflow estimated recharge appeared to act as a proxy for n input and redox conditions longitude also ranked as a relatively important predictor variable which may be acceptable for interpolation within a given study area but spatial trends in underlying processes may not hold at greater scales expansion of metamodels to larger areas may explore the balance between providing sufficient numbers of sampling locations and predictor variables to provide adequate model performance and the appropriateness and utility of predictor variables for extrapolation of transport processes across diverse geochemical landscapes a primary advantage of the current approach is the ability to extend estimates of no3 flux derived from tracer data at sampled wells in this implementation the mechanistic vfm was calibrated separately followed by the machine learning approach for larger regions of study with scarcer data implementation of the vfm may be a challenge as an alternative the calibration potential of mappable gis variables can potentially be integrated into a fully coupled hybrid model that includes both mechanistic vfm and statistical machine learning or other regression components

7393,nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural areas poses a major challenge to the sustainability of water resources aquifer vulnerability models are useful tools that can help resource managers identify areas of concern but quantifying nitrogen n inputs in such models is challenging especially at large spatial scales we sought to improve regional nitrate no3 input functions by characterizing unsaturated zone no3 transport to groundwater through use of surrogate machine learning metamodels of a process based n flux model the metamodels used boosted regression trees brts to relate mappable landscape variables to parameters and outputs of a previous vertical flux method vfm applied at sampled wells in the fox wolf and peshtigo fwp river basins in northeastern wisconsin in this context the metamodels upscaled the vfm results throughout the region and the vfm parameters and outputs are the metamodel response variables the study area encompassed the domain of a detailed numerical model that provided additional predictor variables including groundwater recharge to the metamodels we used a statistical learning framework to test a range of model complexities to identify suitable hyperparameters of the six brt metamodels corresponding to each response variable of interest no3 source concentration factor which determines the local no3 input concentration unsaturated zone travel time no3 concentration at the water table in 1980 2000 and 2020 three separate metamodels and no3 extinction depth the eventual steady state depth of the no3 front the final metamodels were trained to 129 wells within the active numerical flow model area and considered 58 mappable predictor variables compiled in a geographic information system gis these metamodels had training and cross validation testing r2 values of 0 52 0 86 and 0 22 0 38 respectively and predictions were compiled as maps of the above response variables testing performance was reasonable considering that we limited the metamodel predictor variables to mappable factors as opposed to using all available vfm input variables relationships between metamodel predictor variables and mapped outputs were generally consistent with expectations e g with greater source concentrations and no3 at the groundwater table in areas of intensive crop use and well drained soils shorter unsaturated zone travel times in poorly drained areas likely indicated preferential flow through clay soils and a tendency for fine grained deposits to collocate with areas of shallower water table numerical estimates of groundwater recharge were important in the metamodels and may have been a proxy for n input and redox conditions in the northern fwp which had shallow predicted no3 extinction depth the metamodel results provide proof of concept for regional characterization of unsaturated zone no3 transport processes in a statistical framework based on readily mappable gis input variables keywords metamodel nitrate boosted regression trees cross validation unsaturated zone groundwater 1 introduction nitrate no3 is one of the most pervasive contaminants in domestic wells in the u s particularly in agricultural areas where inorganic fertilizer and or manure are used to aid crop production desimone et al 2009 dubrovsky et al 2010 no3 concentration in this work is reported as n statistical water quality models are commonly used to predict the vulnerability of aquifers to nitrate contamination but quantification of n inputs from fertilizer manure and other sources to use as predictor variables is challenging particularly at large spatial scales land applied fertilizer n estimates derived from county level data are often used as n input in such models gronberg and spahr 2012 nolan and hitt 2006 ruddy et al 2006 warner and arnold 2010 wheeler et al 2015 but do not consider the amount of no3 that leaches to the water table and the no3 leaching fraction is not the same everywhere and depends on variations in soil texture unsaturated zone thickness recharge rate and other factors kurtzman et al 2013 liao et al 2012 nolan et al 2012 nitrogen input estimates also are used in numerical modeling approaches e g modflow modpath to predict no3 concentration in pumped wells and at stream interfaces green et al 2010 kauffman et al 2001 koh et al 2016 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 sanford and pope 2013 starn and brown 2007 for example starn and brown 2007 used modflow modpath particle tracking to relate land use and residence time in the contributing recharge area of a public supply well in connecticut to concentrations of no3 and other water quality parameters in pumped groundwater nitrate trends in the well were simulated over four decades based on initial concentrations beneath various land uses however such travel times typically do not include residence time in the unsaturated zone which causes contaminant responses in aquifers to lag behind changes in n input at the land surface accounting for unsaturated zone travel time would indicate the total time required for changes in water quality at pumped wells following management actions at the land surface additionally refined water table n input functions may improve modflow modpath predictions of no3 concentration more recently a vertical flux method vfm was developed for efficient estimation of no3 flux to the water table in the fox wolf peshtigo fwp area of northeastern wisconsin usa fig 1 green et al 2018 the vfm is a mechanistic model that is calibrated to measured groundwater chemistry data to estimate hydrologic and reactive processes based on a consistent hydrogeochemical framework among sites groundwater chemistry data consisted of o2 excess n2 from denitrification no3 and atmospheric groundwater age tracers including tritium tritiogenic helium chlorofluorocarbons and carbon 14 from 250 wells sampled during 1966 2015 vfm calibration r2 values ranged from 0 56 for tritiogenic helium to 0 99 for no3 vfm parameters and outputs pertinent to the current study include nitrate concentration at the water table cs no3 t in 1980 2000 and 2020 n source concentration factor fcn which determines the local no3 input concentration at the well mean unsaturated zone travel time τ u and no3 extinction depth in the aquifer zss which is the eventual steady state depth of the no3 front green et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the travel time of solute to a specified depth is based on a two dimensional conceptual model of a water table aquifer underlain by a confining unit the extinction depth corresponds to that at which no3 declines to a negligible value in the denitrification zone zero plus a small amount caused by dispersion at the given recharge rate adjustable or derived vfm parameters include fcn and τ u whereas zss and cs no3 t are outputs of the method for the purposes of this discussion all of these are referred to as vfm parameters in the methods we provide equations to explain the role of selected parameters in the vfm model to help interpret the metamodeling results interested readers may consult green et al 2018 for more detailed discussion of the vfm we anticipate that the above vfm parameters will benefit future statistical and numerical groundwater quality models of the region by providing improved n input functions for example unsaturated zone n leaching flux was ranked third of 145 predictor variables screened in a boosted regression tree brt model of groundwater no3 in the central valley california and was also ranked third of 25 variables in the final model ransom et al 2017 however vfm parameters are available only at wells with sufficient tracer data to calibrate the method to address this limitation we developed brt metamodels to extend vfm parameters throughout unsampled areas of the fwp brt is a machine learning additive tree method that dispenses with hypothesis testing assumptions associated with traditional regression boosting combines many simple models weak learners to improve predictive performance elith et al 2008 the method does not require data transformation can fit complex nonlinear relations and automatically incorporates interactions among predictor variables early boosting algorithms from the 1990s used ensembles of weak classifiers to reduce misclassification error rate kuhn and johnson 2013 friedman 2001 introduced brt a gradient boosting machine which comprises both classification and regression and which finds an additive tree model that minimizes a statistical loss function brt has been successfully implemented in studies of groundwater arsenic ayotte et al 2016 no3 nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017 redox rosecrans et al 2017b and ph rosecrans et al 2017a in the central valley of california three of the above studies compared brt with traditional linear classification or regression and found that the former yielded superior predictive performance brt models of groundwater no3 in the central valley yielded r2 values of 0 89 and 0 26 for training and hold out data respectively whereas multiple linear regression mlr had r2 values of 0 42 and 0 07 respectively nolan et al 2015 a follow up groundwater no3 model of the same region that included groundwater redox and age as predictor variables yielded brt training and hold out r2 values of 0 83 and 0 44 respectively whereas mlr had r2 values of 0 42 and 0 31 ransom et al 2017 therefore mlr explained less than half the variation in the training data in these studies similarly brt outperformed logistic regression lr a linear classifier according to multiple fit criteria for probability models of groundwater arsenic in the central valley ayotte et al 2016 brt yielded higher training and hold out accuracies and sensitivities than lr at both arsenic thresholds considered 5 and 10 μg l the six vfm parameters discussed above are the response variables for separate brt metamodels a metamodel is a statistical surrogate for a more computationally expensive or data intensive model fienen et al 2015 piñeros garcet et al 2006 and typically is constructed by training outputs of the underlying complex model to that model s inputs the latter are compiled in gis if the objective is regional prediction by the metamodel i e mapping metamodels have previously been used to predict contaminant transport in soils and groundwater in the midwestern usa and elsewhere bouzaher et al 1993 el tabach et al 2007 holman et al 2004 nolan et al 2012 and to predict components of groundwater flow at pumped wells fienen et al 2016 extending the vfm no3 flux parameters of green et al 2018 wall to wall throughout the fwp would indicate aquifer vulnerability and as mentioned above provide potentially useful predictor variables for future water quality models accordingly the objectives of the current research were to 1 develop metamodels of vfm no3 flux parameters and 2 to apply the metamodels for gis mapping of predicted vfm parameters throughout the fwp region 2 methods 2 1 study area description the study area comprised the fox wolf and peshtigo basins in the lake michigan basin of northeastern wisconsin fig 1 the area has a northern temperate climate and receives on average about 80 cm per year of precipitation mean daily temperature ranges from 13 degrees c to 27 degrees juckem et al 2017 the study area is bounded by the active modflow model domain of juckem et al 2017 which supplied modflow simulated groundwater recharge and depth to water and percent coarse fraction from well logs for use as predictor variables in the metamodels the study area contains numerous lakes and wetlands especially in the north which is predominantly forest the overall landscape reflects glacial landforms with watershed divides formed by glacial moraines cultivated crops and pasture are more common in the southern part of the study area the surficial glacial aquifer and underlying bedrock aquifer are the primary aquifers in the region to the north and west the glacial aquifer is predominant and overlies impermeable crystalline bedrock whereas to the south and east glacial sediments are more fine grained and sandstone and dolomite aquifers are the primary sources of groundwater in general the glacial sediments transition from coarse grained deposits in the west to finer grained deposits in the east juckem et al 2017 2 2 vertical flux method vfm parameter estimates were obtained for the study area from green et al 2018 who updated the original method of liao et al 2012 to include an advective dispersion travel time distribution ttd time varying leaching fractions and a no3 concentration scaling factor to account for local variability of n source and n uptake in soils these enhancements enable backcasting and forecasting of water table no3 concentration based on temporal trends in historical local no3 concentrations in groundwater recharge vfm equations and parameters important in this regard are as follows solutes are simulated for a single date of interest using a convolution equation comprising the tracer concentration input function and the advective dispersion ttd as described by green et al 2018 1 c s i t t c 0 i t r i t t i g t t dt where cs i is the concentration of solute i at the sampling location at time t c0 i is the solute concentration at the time of entry at the land surface t ri is the mass lost to reactions between the date at which the reaction begins t i and the time of sampling and g is a travel time distribution ttd describing output of a conservative tracer injected instantaneously at the inlet the time of travel between input and time of sampling is τ t t the advective dispersion ttd component is given by green et al 2018 2 g τ d τ 4 π d τ 3 exp d τ 4 τ 1 τ τ 2 where d is a dimensionless dispersion coefficient and τ is the mean travel time the parameter d is defined as d x α where α is the dispersivity parallel to flow and x is the vertical transport distance the vfm is calibrated to tracer data from the saturated zone whereas the total travel time reflects the unsaturated zone therefore the total mean travel time is the sum of the mean travel times in the unsaturated zone τ u and saturated zone τ s τ τ u τ s the local concentration input function c0 i t is obtained for each well by multiplying a regional average input or shape function by the linear scaling factor fcn to account for local variability unsaturated zone mean travel time τ u is a function of unsaturated zone thickness and two vfm parameters recharge rate and unsaturated zone mobile water content the eventual steady state depth of no3 in the aquifer under steady state conditions zss or no3 extinction depth in m is a function of recharge rate and other vfm parameters green et al 2018 2 3 stochastic gradient boosted regression trees we trained stochastic gradient brt metamodels to selected vfm parameters at sampled wells fcn cs no3 t τ u zss using gis landscape data as predictor variables to facilitate prediction in unsampled areas the metamodels were then applied throughout the active modflow modeling domain of juckem et al 2017 fig 1 to map the vfm parameters in an aquifer vulnerability context boosted regression is an additive model defined as hastie et al 2009 3 f x m 1 m β m b x λ m where βm are expansion coefficients corresponding to the m trees x is the set of predictor variables λm parameterizes splitting variables at internal nodes and predictions at terminal nodes and b x λm is a basis function that represents a single tree we used stagewise boosting such that βm and λm are estimated sequentially from m 1 to m and each new tree is fitted to the residuals of the previous tree we used the squared error loss function for brt model training 4 l y f x y f x 2 where y is the observed value of the response variable which in the metamodel context is a vfm parameter stochastic gradient boosting involves steepest descent minimization friedman 2001 and estimates βm to minimize the overall loss randomness at each sequential step is accomplished through bootstrap aggregation bagging machine learning methods such as brt are prone to overfitting which can degrade predictions to new data hastie et al 2009 therefore we evaluated a range of model complexities within a statistical learning framework hastie et al 2009 nolan et al 2015 to identify suitable hyperparameters of the brt metamodels for each response variable of interest we used k fold cross validation cv tuning to optimize the following hyperparameters interaction depth i e tree depth which controls tree size learning rate shrinkage which controls the contribution of each new tree to the model and the number of trees which controls the degree of model training the number of folds k specifies the number of training and testing data sets of approximately equal size for estimation of expected testing error best models were those that minimized cv testing root mean square error rmse the brt metamodel response variables comprised those vfm parameters of green et al 2018 that pertain to aquifer vulnerability to nitrate these were designated vfm fcn fcn in the above discussion vfm travel time yrs τ u zss n ext depth zss and no3 wt mgl yr cs no3 t where yr 1980 2000 and 2020 each year is a separate metamodel response variable table 1 2 4 metamodel training and testing metamodel development proceeded in two phases in phase i we used cv tuning to test a wide range of brt hyperparameter values based on 250 wells from green et al 2018 predictor variables comprised data on land use soil chemistry soil physical properties surficial geology hydrology and weather in the study area hyperparameter ranges tested in the models were interaction depth 2 16 incremented by 1 learning rate 0 001 0 015 by 0 001 number of trees 500 2000 by 500 these ranges resulted in 900 unique combinations of hyperparameters corresponding to different levels of brt model complexity we applied five fold cv to each of the 900 model configurations for each of the six metamodel response variables 27 000 brt runs total and selected those models that minimized average cv testing rmse we evaluated both untransformed and natural log transformed response variables during phase i to see if the latter improved cv testing performance in phase ii we re trained the best phase i metamodels using 129 wells sampled during 1993 2014 within the active modflow model area of juckem et al 2017 fig 1 and 58 mappable predictor variables that had comparatively high relative influence in the phase i metamodels table s1 in the supplementary material we emphasized the active modflow area because of the high relative influence of modflow estimated groundwater recharge in several of the metamodels the relative influence measures the effect of individual predictors on the variation of model outputs and is generalized by averaging over all trees in the additive model friedman 2001 using the method of ransom et al 2017 the brt metamodels were further simplified by deleting predictor variables one at a time in an iterative loop starting with the variable that had the lowest relative influence and re fitting the model at each iteration the hyperparameters were held constant at the optimal values obtained in phase i for a given model we stopped eliminating variables when the hold out rmse increased by more than about 1 hold out data consisted of 65 samples randomly selected from among alternate sampling dates at the training wells the hold out samples reflect temporal variability of vfm parameters rather than spatial variability because they were culled from the same 129 wells used in model training we eliminated an additional 20 wells from the vfm travel time yrs metamodel these comprised 11 bedrock wells and 9 wells in the northern part of the fwp study area where small lakes and wetlands are abundant such features are expected to function as weak hydraulic sinks that remove shallow groundwater and thereby disconnect rates of unsaturated zone recharge from groundwater vertical velocities as inferred from age tracers abrams et al 2013 we removed the same 11 bedrock wells from the zss n ext depth metamodel we employed brt r package gbm v 2 1 1 ridgeway 2013 within r s caret package v 6 0 71 kuhn 2014 to train and test the metamodels the gbm package includes a function for partial dependence plots to visualize relations between the brt predicted response variable and a predictor variable the marginal effect of a selected predictor variable is determined by integrating over the joint probability density of the predictor variables friedman 2001 maps of vfm response variables were obtained by applying final brt metamodels to mappable predictor variables rasterized within 1 km2 grid cells brt predictions were made for each of the 49 000 grid cells in the study area using the predict function in r s raster package v 2 5 8 hijmans 2016 and the results were mapped in gis using v 10 5 of arcgis esri 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 metamodel response variables summary statistics of the metamodel response variables for the training wells are provided in table 1 and the values of these variables at sampled wells are shown in figs 3 6 8 9 in general maps of vfm fcn no3 wt mgl yr and zss ext depth followed patterns of agricultural intensity with greater source concentration factor no3 concentration and no3 extinction depth in the southwestern fwp which coincides with cultivated cropland and well drained soils these trends are consistent with predictions of current groundwater no3 distributions in the study area based on statistical analysis of water quality data tesoriero et al 2017 in contrast vfm travel time yrs appears more related to soil and aquifer texture these relations are discussed in more detail below 3 2 metamodel training and testing a range of model complexities was tried in phase i and evaluated using cv five of six minimum cv testing rmse metamodels had low interaction depth 2 3 which is consistent with the concept of weak learners in an additive model table 2 in general aggregate models comprising many simple trees weak learners more accurately predict to new data than single large complex trees hastie et al 2009 the maximum interaction depth of 7 corresponds to the vfm no3 2020 model and indicates moderate complexity given the range of depths tested 2 16 according to cv testing r2 values model fits of vfm travel time yrs and zss n ext depth benefitted from log transformation therefore only log space results are shown for these two metamodels all metamodels were compared using r2 to accommodate different units of measurement cross validation testing r2 of final metamodels in phase i ranged from 0 22 for no3 wt mgl 2000 to 0 38 zss n ext depth which is fairly typical of statistical groundwater quality models the metamodels relied only on gis mappable predictor variables land use soils and other factors as opposed to vfm input parameters and measured data such as well depth and water level these r2 values are affected by noise and uncertainty related to mappable predictor variables that are not directly tied to vfm model parameters as opposed to greater r2 values in studies that directly relate model outputs to input variables for example fienen et al 2016 obtained cv testing r2 values of 0 69 0 86 for metamodels based on modflow inputs and outputs in the lake michigan basin bouzaher et al 1993 obtained cv testing r2 values of 0 83 0 85 for metamodels of atrazine leaching in the midwestern u s the metamodel predictor variables in the latter study were inputs to the pesticide root zone model such as soil and pesticide properties results in the current paper are more consistent with the brt models of nolan et al 2015 and ransom et al 2017 who obtained cv testing r2 values of 0 36 0 39 and 0 45 respectively when relating measured groundwater no3 concentration to mappable predictor variables including land use and soils data the best phase i metamodels were further simplified in phase ii and evaluated using hold out data hold out performance r2 0 45 0 78 table 2 was better than that of cv testing and approached that obtained by fienen et al 2016 hold out r2 0 80 0 85 in the current study we regard cv testing as a better indication of the predictive capability of the metamodels in a mapping spatial context hold out data were used only in phase ii with the iterative variable deletion loop which had constant values of hyperparameters for each model and which did not involve cv tuning scatterplots of observed vfm parameters vs metamodel predictions are shown in figs s1a f in the supplementary material 3 3 metamodel outputs and relations with predictor variables maps of metamodel outputs show a gradient from high values in the southwest fwp to comparatively low values in the northeast for both n source concentration factor vfm fcn which decreased from 2 3 to 0 25 and water table no3 concentration no3 wt mgl yr yr 1980 2000 2020 which decreased from 20 mg l overall to about 0 mg l figs 3 6 all metamodel response variables are defined in table 1 white areas on the maps correspond to missing values of predictor variables relations between agricultural land use and outputs by these four metamodels were corroborated by the relative influence of predictor variables fig s2 and partial dependence plots figs s3 s8 the concentration gradients were driven primarily by longitudinal position dec long ranked 1 2 in these four metamodels and percent cropland in 1974 near sampled wells cat43 lu74 ranked 1 3 fig s2 in fig s2 the length of the bar indicates the normalized relative influence of a predictor variable in the brt metamodels cultivated crops are more common in the southwestern fwp compared with the southeast which has more pasture hay and the north which has predominantly deciduous forest and woody wetlands fig 1 cropland in 1974 cat43 lu74 is more prevalent in the south central and central parts of the fwp where proportions of this land use exceeding 80 were more extensive orange red areas in fig s9 the fact that older cropland 1974 was consistently ranked higher than 1992 agricultural land use in these metamodels suggests that no3 in sampled wells tended to originate at land surface around 1974 or earlier sampling dates in the data set ranged from 1993 to 2014 implying lag times of 19 to 40 years or more as compared to a median travel time of 46 years calculated for samples in green et al 2018 with age tracers regarding these four metamodels we anticipate that increasing cropland over well drained soils orange red areas in fig s10 would increase the fraction of no3 that is leached to groundwater and associated concentrations of no3 at the water table this interaction is supported by the presence of variables cat43 lu74 and drnclass 5 somewhat excessively drained soils ranked 2nd and 8th respectively in the vfm fcn model partial dependence plots of top ranked variables show the direction of influence of the most important predictors in these plots the predicted response on the y axis is labeled as a function of the indicated predictor variable for the above metamodels predicted vfm fcn or no3 wt mgl yr increased sharply as the proportion of 1974 cropland near the well approached 0 6 figs s3 s6 these same four metamodels also had consistent relations with dec long where predicted vfm fcn or no3 wt mgl yr decreased with increasing values of dec long i e going from west to east as land use shifts from cultivated crops to pasture hay along this gradient in the southern part of the fwp soils change from well drained and excessively well drained to moderately well drained fig s10 therefore dec long may reflect the interaction of fertilizer addition and soil type relations among soils cropland and or inorganic n fertilizer input have been noted in national and regional groundwater quality modeling studies nolan and hitt 2006 ransom et al 2017 warner and arnold 2010 wheeler et al 2015 water table no3 concentration is predicted to increase from low to moderate levels across much of the fwp in 2020 compared with 1980 and 2000 levels according to green et al 2018 the estimated regional average input concentrations of no3 are relatively constant after 1985 therefore the largest increases of no3 at the water table occur in areas with high source concentration factor fcn which is related to land use and soils as discussed above this is seen by comparing the predicted fcn map fig 3 with a map of 1980 to 2020 differences in water table no3 concentrations i e 2020 predictions minus 1980 predictions fig 7 the water table no3 increases are also related to mean travel time according to the advective dispersion form of the travel time distribution g τ which is a component of eq 1 as τ increases g τ is shifted to increasingly greater travel times as indicated by eq 2 and the convolution integral is more strongly affected by pre 1985 portions of the no3 input function when input no3 concentrations were changing most rapidly green et al 2018 this causes cs no3 t to increase eq 1 if the mean unsaturated zone travel time is close to zero then the water table no3 concentration will remain relatively constant after 1985 in tandem with the constant inputs the map of 1980 2020 water table no3 differences fig 7 compares reasonably well with the map of predicted unsaturated zone travel time vfm travel time yrs fig 8 except for the northern fwp which has predominantly forested land use and presumably low n input in the southwestern and southeastern fwp predicted unsaturated zone travel times of 10 30 years coincide with water table nitrate increases of 2 mg l or more metamodel predicted no3 extinction depth zss n ext depth followed a similar pattern as the above response variables and was greater in the southwestern fwp and comparatively shallow in the southeastern and north central parts of the watershed fig 9 deeper values of zss n ext depth 20 m coincided with areas of cultivated crops fig 1 and well drained soils fig s10 indicating that the same processes that increase no3 loading to the water table result in deeper penetration of no3 into the aquifer additional factors related to zss n ext depth include groundwater recharge soil properties and land surface elevation numerical model estimates of groundwater recharge recharge1juckem table s1 fig s11 were ranked 2 4 in four of the metamodels vfm fcn no3 wt mgl 2000 no3 wt mgl 2020 zss n ext depth but in some cases the variable appeared to be a surrogate for other factors the predicted responses of fcn and water table no3 to recharge were nonlinear and increased sharply at about 13 in yr 33 cm yr figs s3 s5 s6 increases in water table no3 would be expected for increased flows of water and chemicals through the unsaturated zone on the other hand no3 extinction depth in the aquifer zss n ext depth generally decreased as recharge1juckem rank 4 increased to about 12 in yr 30 cm yr fig s7 which is the same range at which the above response variables are less sensitive to increasing recharge suggesting that moderate values of recharge are tied to no3 reduction processes zss n ext depth has a slight negative correlation with recharge1juckem for wells in the training data set spearman correlation ρ 0 13 p 0 15 zss n ext depth is sensitive to recharge for values of recharge1juckem between 4 and 12 in yr 10 and 30 cm yr which are in the northern part of the fwp green and yellow areas in fig s11 there are generally less cultivated crops in the northwestern fwp fig 1 except for an isolated irrigated area in central langlade county this same area tends to have more poorly drained and somewhat poorly drained soils green and yellow areas in fig s10 recharge may be a proxy for n input and redox conditions in this area as recharge increases cultivated crops and associated n input extent of well drained soils and oxic conditions in soils and groundwater generally decrease which decreases the depth to which no3 penetrates the aquifer zss n ext depth is flat insensitive for values of recharge1juckem 12 in yr 30 cm yr suggesting a minimal no3 extinction depth for the region and offset of the above factors by high no3 input to the water table additional important factors suggested by the zss n ext depth partial dependence plot and or relative influence values include available water storage in soil aws025wta rank 1 inorganic carbon content of the a soil horizon a c inorg rank 2 moderately fine textured soils hydgrpb rank 5 and soil organic matter content avg om rank 8 which in combination suggest conditions that favor denitrification in the shallow part of the groundwater system as aws025wta increased beyond 3 cm predicted zss n ext depth decreased sharply fig s7 suggesting a soil water threshold for denitrification as a c inorg increased to about 0 3 predicted no3 extinction depth decreased rapidly inorganic carbon is associated with greater alkalinity and ph and losses of n to denitrification tend to be greater in neutral or alkaline soils than in acidic soils šimek and cooper 2002 increased alkalinity can be directly associated with microbial activity e g with production of co2 from organic carbon during denitrification nascimento et al 1997 as avg om increased to about 5 predicted zss n ext depth decreased sharply not shown organic carbon is a common electron donor driving microbial activity in soils and groundwater mcmahon and chapelle 2008 and as per the above can be a source of dissolved inorganic carbon during denitrification taken together relations among zss n ext depth and these predictor variables point to the role of denitrification in soils and shallow groundwater which decreases the penetration depth of no3 in the aquifer predicted zss n ext depth also decreased as alt ft raster land surface elevation increased fig s7 which is likely related to the increase in forested areas that occur at higher elevations in the northern part of the fwp region the forested areas would be expected to have reduced n input compared with agricultural areas metamodel predicted unsaturated zone travel time vfm travel time yrs was generally greater in the western fwp up to 39 years as shown in fig 8 and was influenced by soils and unsaturated zone thickness predicted vfm travel time yrs decreased rapidly as somewhat poorly drained soils drnclass 6 rank 2 increased to about 20 fig s8 which suggests preferential flow in soils with high clay content the drnclass 6 variable is positively correlated with clay content of soils near wells in the data set ρ 0 45 p 0 0001 macropores in soils with high clay content would be expected to rapidly transmit water through the unsaturated zone decreasing residence time this explanation is supported by the spatial pattern of soils with high clay content 20 percent of more which are found in the southeastern portion of the study area and to a lesser extent in the northwestern part fig s12 the high clay areas generally coincide with areas having vfm travel time yrs values of 0 5 years as well as areas having drnclass 6 values of 50 percent or more yellow to red areas on fig s13 in contrast longer predicted travel times 10 39 years extending north south through the study area coincide with drnclass 6 values 10 percent and clay values 15 percent these relations are also consistent with the partial dependence plot of soil drainage rank 3 vs predicted vfm travel time yrs fig s8 the drainage variable was calculated as the weighted average of drainage classes ranked from low to high 1 7 where 1 very poorly drained and 7 excessively well drained and is inversely correlated with the clay content of soils near wells in the data set ρ 0 43 p 0 0001 vfm travel time yrs initially was at a minimum predicted value 1 5 yrs that corresponds to very poorly and poorly drained soils assumed to have macropore features vfm travel time yrs increased sharply for somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained soils fig s8 suggesting less influence from clay soils this relation is supported by the soil drainage map fig s10 which shows areas of moderately to excessively well drained soils going from southwest to northeast in the study area orange red areas on the map these same areas drainage values 4 in fig s8 have longer predicted travel times 5 years predicted vfm travel time yrs initially increased as alt ft raster rank 4 increased fig s8 which may relate to increasing unsaturated zone travel distance and residence time the spatial pattern of high values of predicted vfm travel time yrs in the northwestern fwp yellow to red areas in that part of fig 8 coincides with the high land elevation in this area approaching 1900 ft 580 m and depth to water approaching 300 ft 91 m figs s14 and s15 respectively 4 conclusions this study used a metamodel approach to extrapolate process based modeling results from data centered point locations to continuous regions boosted regression trees were used to relate gis mappable predictor variables to the parameters of a mechanistic vertical flux method metamodeled vfm parameters included the n source concentration factor mean unsaturated zone travel time no3 concentrations at the water table at various time intervals 1980 2000 and 2010 and the extinction depth of no3 maps of these quantities generally were consistent with predictor variables and major geographical features such as unsaturated zone thickness crop land uses and soils in the current study individual regression trees were weak learners with comparatively small numbers of predictor variables and the overall number of predictor variables in the aggregate models was iteratively reduced while maintaining acceptable predictive performance predictive performance obtained by the metamodels may have been hampered by the considerable spatial variability of unsaturated zone and groundwater quality conditions in the glacial aquifer however results were comparable to those of previous statistical models that relied on gis mapped predictor variables additionally the training performance of the metamodels was good with r2 values consistently 0 50 previous multiple linear regression models of groundwater nitrate explained less than half the variation in training data and the predictive performance of such models was poor compared with boosted regression trees the comparatively high training r2 values in the current study lend confidence to interpretations based on partial dependence plots which provided useful insights into the influence of landscape attributes on unsaturated zone no3 fluxes we anticipate that the metamodel outputs will benefit future statistical and numerical water quality models of the region through improved characterization of no3 input functions estimates of unsaturated zone n input substantially improved a previous groundwater nitrate model of the central valley therefore the usefulness of the approach does not depend solely on the predictive performance of the metamodels themselves the current metamodel approach satisfies the objective of interpolating transport processes and features between local data centered points for future studies addressing larger areas it may be advantageous to test extrapolation into unsampled regions outside of the study area on which the metamodels were trained results of the current study highlight several issues that may be involved with extrapolation hydrogeochemical predictor variables related to soils land use and hydrology may be straight forward to extrapolate into neighboring areas other predictor variables may be less suitable for extrapolation across diverse landscapes for example modflow estimated recharge appeared to act as a proxy for n input and redox conditions longitude also ranked as a relatively important predictor variable which may be acceptable for interpolation within a given study area but spatial trends in underlying processes may not hold at greater scales expansion of metamodels to larger areas may explore the balance between providing sufficient numbers of sampling locations and predictor variables to provide adequate model performance and the appropriateness and utility of predictor variables for extrapolation of transport processes across diverse geochemical landscapes a primary advantage of the current approach is the ability to extend estimates of no3 flux derived from tracer data at sampled wells in this implementation the mechanistic vfm was calibrated separately followed by the machine learning approach for larger regions of study with scarcer data implementation of the vfm may be a challenge as an alternative the calibration potential of mappable gis variables can potentially be integrated into a fully coupled hybrid model that includes both mechanistic vfm and statistical machine learning or other regression components we propose this method as an area of exploration for future work in larger regions with fewer data for direct calibration of the vfm acknowledgements we extend our thanks to the following people jo

vertical flow constructed wetlands specifically designed for combined sewer overflow cso treatment have proven to be an effective tool to mitigate negative impacts of csos on receiving water bodies long term hydrologic simulations are used to predict the emissions from urban drainage systems during planning of stormwater management measures so far no universally accepted model for rsf simulation exists when simulating hydraulics and water quality in rsfs an appropriate level of detail must be chosen for reasonable balancing between model complexity and model handling considering the model input s level of uncertainty the most crucial parameters determining the resultant uncertainties of the integrated sewer system and filter bed model were identified by evaluating a virtual drainage system with a retention soil filter for cso treatment to determine reasonable parameter ranges for rsf simulations data of 207 events from six full scale rsf plants in germany were analyzed data evaluation shows that even though different plants with varying loading and operation modes were examined a simple model is sufficient to assess relevant suspended solids ss chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 emissions from rsfs two conceptual rsf models with different degrees of complexity were assessed these models were developed based on evaluation of data from full scale rsf plants and column experiments incorporated model processes are ammonium adsorption in the filter layer and degradation during subsequent dry weather period filtration of ss and particulate cod xcod to a constant background concentration and removal of solute cod scod by a constant removal rate during filter passage as well as sedimentation of ss and xcod in the filter overflow xcod ss and ammonium loads as well as ammonium concentration peaks are discharged primarily via rsf overflow not passing through the filter bed uncertainties of the integrated simulation of the sewer system and rsf model mainly

combined sewer overflow constructed wetland retention soil filter sensitivity analysis stormwater management uncertainty 1 introduction 1 1 effects of csos on receiving water pollutant emissions by combined sewer overflows are an issue in many countries for many substances the pollutant loads emitted by csos are of similar or greater magnitude than the emissions from wastewater treatment plants e g gasperi et al 2012 launay et al 2016 scherer et al 2003 furthermore csos can cause serious damage to the aquatic ecosystem especially when the receiving water body is small and sensitive e g borchardt et al 1998 borchardt and sperling 1996 casadio et al 2010 ellis 2000 ellis and hvitved jacobsen 1996 passerat et al 2011 burton and pitt 2002 willems and einfalt 2012 as european legislation calls for a good chemical and ecological status of all water bodies eu wfd 2000 treatment of cso discharge is required in many cases the most relevant effects of cso discharges are high peak flows oxygen depletion due to excessive organic loads from single events ecotoxic concentrations of ammonia nh3 and silting of the watercourse by fine sediments miskewitz and uchrin 2013 david et al 2013 borchardt and sperling 1996 1 2 rsfs for cso treatment for 25 years retention soil filters rsfs have been used for treatment of combined sewer overflow discharges dittmer et al 2016 they combine a vertical flow sand filter below a detention basin fig 1 dittmer et al 2005 dittmer 2006 the filter layer is planted with reed phragmites spec as filter media mainly ordinary local sand with a minimum content of caco3 is used for advanced treatment e g phosphorous removal special components can be added vohla et al 2011 dwa 2005 a regulated valve limits the filtration rate to avoid preferential flow through macro pores standard values for filtration rates range from 1 to 3 10 5 m s the filtration rate of the regulated valve is much lower than the flow velocity through the porous media therefore the filter sand is assumed to be saturated with water when the retention volume is filled up during heavier rain events the overflow is discharged directly to the receiving water the filter surface is around 1 of the contributing connected impervious area dittmer et al 2016 german guidelines on layout design and dimensioning of these systems are described by uhl and dittmer 2005 in literature rsfs are also referred to as constructed wetlands or biofilters kadlec and wallace 2009 classify retention soil filters as event driven wetlands currently similar systems are in use in several other european countries such as france italy and portugal amaral et al 2013 meyer et al 2013 due to the stochastic nature of rainfall rsfs are loaded irregularly dry weather periods between loading events might last up to several months after each loading the filter is drained completely to ensure optimal aeration apart from reduction of hydraulic stress rsfs are mostly applied with the objective to reduce the emission of suspended solids ss and of particle bound pollutants such as heavy metals and pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons other objectives of the treatment by rsfs are the removal of organic compounds represented by the chemical oxygen demand cod and the reduction of discharged ammonium peak concentrations by adsorption during the filter passage and subsequent nitrification during dry weather periods meyer and dittmer 2015 1 3 modelling of retention soil filters to assess the ecological impact of cso discharges each pollutant parameter must be evaluated on the time scale that corresponds to its effect on the aquatic ecosystem ammonia is acutely toxic within minutes a simulation model should therefore predict the frequency and the intensity of short term peaks of nh4 concentrations and loads oxygen depletion due to the degradation of organic loads takes place at a time scale of several hours to days the corresponding emission characteristic is the frequency and intensity of event specific loads which can be displayed by cumulative frequency distributions as siltation of river beds and impacts of persistent pollutants are long term accumulative effects the appropriate emission characteristics for ss are long term loads miskewitz and uchrin 2013 david et al 2013 borchardt and sperling 1996 ellis and hvitved jacobsen 1996 due to the stochastic character of rainfall representative results for the above mentioned peak loads and concentrations can only be obtained by simulating longer time series a typical lengths for long term simulations in germany is 10 years yet there is no generally accepted approach to integrate retention soil filters into such a long term sewer quality modelling the aim of the practical sizing of rsfs is only the reliability of the plant s operation the dimensioning parameters are hydraulic loading and maximum lengths of filter bed surcharge quality aspects and treatment performance of the plants are not considered the aim of the rsf models is to predict relevant emissions from rsf systems 1 4 scope and aim several software programs such as swmm mike urban simba or infoworks cs are widely used for quality simulations in combined sewer systems fewer programs are available for simulation of vertical flow constructed wetlands or rsfs the underlying models differ widely in level of detail model complexity and the required effort for parameter estimation and calibration the dynamic input of the rsf simulation in coupled sewer system rsf modelling is always the result of a sewer quality simulation both hydrograph and pollutograph are required as rsf model input a reasonable balance is needed between model simplicity and reliability meyer et al 2015 this study identifies the most relevant processes and important parameters that determine the resulting uncertainties of the integrated sewer system and rsf model by meyer and dittmer 2015 a sensitivity analysis sa of the integrated model was conducted considering the effects of the modeled pollutants on the respective time scales to determine reasonable model parameter ranges for rsf simulations data from 207 events from six full scale rsf systems in germany were analyzed conclusions are drawn as to how model simplifications or details are justified and which range of uncertainty of model parameters is acceptable 2 materials and methods 2 1 general concept for sensitivity analysis the aim of the study was to determine important model parameters for sewer system and modelling of retention soil filters hamby 1994 defined an important parameter as a parameter that is sensitive meaning that changes have an influence on the model output and which is also not known precisely so it contributes substantially to the uncertainty in assessment result the sensitivity analysis sa of the sewer system and rsf model was performed using the one at a time oat approach also referred to as local sa hamby 1994 hall et al 2009 varying the model parameters by a constant percentage cannot reflect the real uncertainty of the model parameters therefore in this study the parameters were varied by a range determined by literature for the sewer system model and by data evaluation for the rsf model see sections 2 3 and 3 1 representing the variability of the parameter this ensures a realistic assessment of existing output uncertainties in the planning and modelling process of sewer systems and rsfs a similar approach has been described by downing et al 1985 for estimating the dose equivalent to man from the concentration of radioactivity in air water and food 2 2 conceptual models applied for rsf simulation langergraber and šimůnek 2012 presented with hydrus 2d cw2d a model modification of hydrus a tool for simulating variably saturated water flow and multi component transport in constructed wetlands complex finite elements models like hydrus 2d cw2d are able to display processes in retention soil filters under varying conditions for long term simulation of rsfs finite element methods are inappropriate henrichs et al 2007 henrichs et al 2009 pálfy et al 2014 2016 they require model parameters which are difficult to obtain and long calculation times for longer simulation periods furthermore for integrated sewer system rsf simulations the input data for the rsf model being a result of sewer system quality simulations show a high level of uncertainty in this study two models with different levels of complexity are compared to identify relevant processes these models were developed to calculate emissions of ss cod and nh4 from rsfs 2 2 1 rsf disc rsf disc dittmer 2006 was first implemented into the sewer quality model kosmo schmitt and dittmer 2007 it is a simple black box model that was developed based on observations from one full scale rsf in ensheim germany the rsf is separated into two layers see fig 1 implemented in the model the detention layer represents the storage volume above the filter layer the process layer represents the pore volume of the filter in which the relevant removal processes occur meyer 2011 both layers are modeled as completely stirred tank reactors the filtration rate limiting the outflow of the rsf is assumed to be constant when the inflow to the filter exceeds the filtration rate the filter is surcharged until the retention volume is filled if the retention volume is exceeded an overflow occurs the overflowing water bypasses the filter bed and is discharged directly with the concentration of the water in the storage layer and under consideration of sedimentation during filter passage suspended solids and particulate cod are reduced to a constant background concentration c0 ss and c0 xcod respectively the dissolved fraction is reduced following a constant removal rate ηscod retained cod compounds are mineralized by a zero order reaction ammonium elimination is represented as a two stage process 1 in a loading event of the rsf ammonium is adsorbed until the maximum sorption capacity bsorb max is reached during this period effluent concentration is reduced down to a constant outflow background concentration c0 nh4 n when the maximum sorption capacity is reached the effluent concentration increases filter breakthrough 2 during the next dry weather period the adsorbed ammonium is oxidized immediately to nitrate the sorption capacity of the filter is regenerated the nitrate formed during the oxidization of ammonium is flushed out during the subsequent loading event 2 2 2 rsf sim rsf sim was developed with a more detailed process description than rsf disc based on lab scale experiments and simulations to achieve a better approximation of the simulated time series to measured data meyer 2011 a detailed description of rsf sim is given in meyer and dittmer 2015 the model changes were based on simulation studies with hydrus 2d cw2d henrichs et al 2007 2009 pálfy et al 2014 and data evaluation of two full scale rsfs dittmer 2006 meyer 2011 the model based optimization tool for constructed wetlands in france orage by pálfy et al 2017 was also inspired by rsf sim the hydraulic model of rsf sim consists of a linear storage cascade of completely stirred tank reactors to describe the processes in the filter a third layer is added to the hydraulic model in addition to the retention layer and the process layer as in rsf disc the drainage layer provides additional retention volume and allows a better fitting of effluent time series to measured data the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate is considered in addition to the filtration rate to enable calculation of concentrations during dry weather periods a residual water content in the process layer is required physically the residual water or residual saturation is the water which is kept within the pores of the filter media due to capillary forces only for rsf sim hydraulic parameters were assessed in the sensitivity analysis see table 1 as in rsf disc suspended solids ss and particulate cod xcod are assumed to be retained by filtration down to a constant background concentration c0 ss and c0 xcod respectively sedimentation of ss and xcod can be considered by a constant sedimentation rate in the case of rsf overflows see table 2 solute cod scod is assumed to be reduced by a constant per event removal rate ηcod depending on the duration of the antecedent dry weather period lower removal rates due to short 1 d or long 1 d dry weather periods to achieve reasonable results in low inflow concentrations an option to add a constant background concentration c0 scod is also implemented meyer and dittmer 2015 as in rsf disc ammonium removal is described in a two step process ammonium is retained by adsorption during the passage of the filter media layer kinetic nitrification starts simultaneously to re aeration after drainage adsorption itself is modeled by a two stage linear isotherm with the parameters a1 slope of 1st stage c1 critical concentration and a2 slope of 2nd stage see fig 2 to determine a1 c1 and a2 adsorption capacities bsorb max were fitted to observed time series during breakthrough events 2 3 simulated drainage system and rsf for the simulation study an ideal virtual drainage system was modeled this system has been used before in several comparative simulation studies leinweber 2002 welker 2004 all sewer system structures including the retention soil filter were dimensioned according to german guidelines the virtual combined sewer system drains an effective impervious area of 102 45 ha with 9900 inhabitants see table 3 two industrial sites discharge into the combined sewer system the system comprises two combined sewer overflow tanks storing 1 16 mm of rainfall that is subsequently conveyed to the wastewater treatment plant a retention soil filter is applied to treat the overflow of the last tank upstream of the wastewater treatment plant reducing the plant s inflow the rsf has a surface area of 2510 m2 with a filtration rate of 0 02 l s m2 and is designed according to german guidelines dwa 2005 the depth of the detention basin is 1 m the filter sand layer is 0 75 m and the gravel layer is 0 25 m high see fig 1 for sewer system simulation a 10 year time series of precipitation was taken from a measurement station in germany holzgerlingen schnapseiche the rsf was simulated due to computational reasons only for two representative years of the 10 year sewer system simulation period the sewer system simulation is conducted using the hydrological software kosim harms and kenter 1987 subcatchments are represented by a linear reservoir cascade n 3 k calculated using an overland flow time of 4 min flow routing is based on the kalinin miljukov method itwh 2009 ranges for parameters of the sewer system quality model were taken from literature welker 2004 gujer 2007 orhon et al 1997 results of the base case simulation of the sewer system were checked for plausibility against a broad collection of literature data uhl and kasting 2002 welker 2004 brombach et al 2005 previous studies have identified the effective impervious area as the most sensitive parameter for stormwater runoff simulations corving and clemens 2005 dotto et al 2011 therefore special attention was paid to this parameter the assessed range of effective impervious area was calculated from a dataset that comprises 43 subcatchments from various sites in germany by evaluating aerial images paved areas were determined a standard approach is to assume that all paved areas are impermeable and that they are connected to the drainage system to consider this bias during planning of combined sewer systems an effective impervious area of 100 was set as base case for the simulations evaluation of rainfall runoff balances from the dataset of 43 subcatchments revealed that even after initial losses are covered only 42 94 median 72 mean value 71 of the area was contributing to the runoff therefore the paved area was varied only downward 58 and 28 corresponding to observed minimum and median 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of model parameters for rsf models to determine reasonable ranges of the model parameters for the local sensitivity analysis of the rsf models data from 207 events in six german full scale rsf plants were analyzed descriptions and data evaluation of the individual rsfs can be found in dittmer 2006 and meyer 2011 for the rsf ensheim eh in frechen 2009 and meyer 2011 for the plant oberelsungen oe in fuchs and schnabel 2001 for rsf langenalb la and in waldhoff 2008 for the plants fellenweg fw kleingladenbach kg and wiesenbach wb the filter media for all plants except fw is sand 0 2 mm the rsf plant fw is equipped with cohesive soil 0 1 4 mm at the plant oe and la calcium carbonate was added to the filter substrate to maintain a high nitrification level median average interquartile range outliers deviation between 1 5 fold and 3 fold of interquartile range and extreme values distance of more than 3 fold from the 1st or 3rd quartile see explanation boxplot in fig 3 r for the model parameters were determined for each retention soil filter plant separately and for all events of all plants together model parameter ranges for the sensitivity analysis were derived from overall data evaluation base case values for process description parameters were adopted from meyer et al 2008 an evaluation of inflow concentrations for all rsf plants is given in fig 3 the overall and plant specific variability of tss event mean concentrations emcs in the inflow between the observed events is high 4 1180 mg l also inflow emcs for cod show a high level of variability 12 980 mg l and are dominated by the higher variations of particulate cod xcod inflow emcs 9 225 mg l the data range for solute cod scod inflow emcs lies between 6 mg l and 142 mg l ammonium inflow emcs range from 0 1 to 29 mg l the event mean concentrations of ss and xcod in the effluent of the rsf plants were evaluated to determine the constant background concentration c0 for xcod and ss for both rsf models the event mean concentrations of suspended solids for the plants la fw kg and wb are between 0 5 and 30 mg l see fig 4 l median values of these plants range from 2 to 7 mg l higher values of up to 66 mg l were observed only at the plant in oe an overall interquartile range from 3 to 9 mg l is obtained in comparison to inflow event mean concentration interquartile range for ss 45 189 mg l see fig 3 l the effluent values are low confirming a high removal efficiency of rsf plants regarding ss the high ss outflow values for the rsf oe are remarkable considering that the outflow emcs of particulate cod xcod are rather low below 10 mg l see fig 5 this could imply that the filter is losing inorganic filter material in its outflow which would be a construction problem probably the influence of preferential flow through the filter rather than a low treatment performance in the outflow of the rsf eh ss were below limit of quantification neglecting outliers and extreme values ss emcs of 207 monitored events vary between 1 and 20 mg l while the rsfs kg and wb are showing xcod emcs between 0 and 3 mg l the plants oe and la have maximum values of 10 mg l and 29 mg l respectively fig 5 at the plant fw xcod was not measured for rsf eh the measured outflow values for xcod were below the detection limit in the overall statistical evaluation the highest value from oe and the three highest values from la are classified as outliers and extreme values leaving a data range of below detection limit to 10 mg l xcod with a median of 2 mg l the overall interquartile range is 1 5 mg l the solute cod background concentration c0 scod was determined by evaluating time series of each event from each plant for the lowest scod outflow concentration except for one outlier from the rsf eh all minimum outflow concentrations are between 4 mg l and 20 mg l with a median of 9 mg l see fig 5 the removal efficiencies for solute cod scod are between 28 and 69 for the rsf plants eh la kg and wb see fig 5 the rsf oe shows one lower removal efficiency of only 11 the overall median is 47 removal efficiency for scod in 37 evaluated events the event mean concentrations of ammonium for events without ammonium breakthrough defined as η 90 or outflow concentration 1 mg l in the outflow of the rsfs see fig 4 were evaluated to display the background concentration c0 nh4 n of ammonium before depletion of maximum sorption capacity in rsf disc for the rsf plants eh la kg and wb all ammonium event mean concentrations are below 0 8 mg l the plants oe and fw show higher extreme values 1 mg l and 2 3 mg l the overall median of ammonium emcs is very low 0 09 mg l and neglecting extreme values and outliers concentrations vary from 0 to 0 35 mg l the maximum capacity of ammonium sorption bsorb max was determined in 14 events with ammonium breakthrough see fig 5 the filter plant eh shows highest ammonium sorption capacities between 5 8 and 13 g m2 ammonium sorption at the rsfs oe and kenten k is lower 4 8 7 2 g m2 3 6 6 g m2 tondera et al 2014 overall the median of ammonium sorption is 6 3 g m2 with a range from 3 to 11 g m2 the evaluated data from all rsfs show an effective removal of all assessed parameters observed variations for the evaluated rsf model parameters are low compared to ranges of rsf inflow concentrations intra event variability of inflow and outflow concentrations for suspended solids ss and particulate xcod as well as solute cod scod and ammonium shows that the model assumptions in rsf sim and rsf disc are correct outflow concentrations for particulate matter and ammonium stay constant during the events even though varying inflow concentrations occur inflow and outflow time series for scod show that a removal by a constant removal rate is a more accurate process description than modelling scod elimination by a constant outflow concentration the ranges for the sensitivity analysis sa as shown in table 4 were derived from the presented data evaluation results from 6 full scale rsfs in germany for ammonium adsorption the entire data range without outliers was taken as bandwidth for the sensitivity analysis sa for scod removal efficiency the interquartile range was set as sa bandwidth for background concentration of c0 scod 0 to median value was taken as sa bandwidth and for background concentrations of c0 xcod and c0 ss 0 to third quartile of the datasets were taken as sa bandwidth furthermore different model configurations were assessed for rsf sim one simulation was run with decreased removal efficiency for solute cod scod after short 1 d or long 14 d dry weather periods one was run with continuous ammonium degradation in the solid phase and another with decreased removal efficiency for scod for higher infiltration rates 3 2 sewer system simulation output time series of the sewer system simulation are required as input data for the rsf simulation in the simulated system the overflow of the last cso tank upstream of the wastewater treatment plant provides inflow for the rsf therefore a sensitivity analysis of the sewer system simulation was conducted to identify the parameters most influencing cso overflow volume as well as ss cod and ammonium loads results of the parameter variations are shown in fig 6 model parameter variations for the sewer system model can be found in table 3 the most important parameters causing uncertainties in the sewer system model are connected area and stormwater runoff quality see fig 6 the change of the connected area in the simulation input results in deviations of discharged volume and loads of up to 80 kleidorfer et al 2009 also identified the effective impervious area as the most sensitive flow parameter in urban stormwater modelling in previous studies stormwater and cso quality models have shown a high level of uncertainty dotto et al 2010 kanso et al 2005 corroborating the high variability of sewer system model results obtained in this study output changes of up to 71 are caused by variations of stormwater runoff quality variations of dry weather flow quality show a much lower influence on simulation results up to 11 this high contribution of quality parameters accords with willems 2008 and freni and mannina 2010 who found out that the uncertainty contribution by water quality submodels is higher than that for flow submodels 3 3 rsf simulation within the 2 year simulation period the rsf is fed 99 times with a total amount of 218 383 m3 combined sewer overflow resulting in a loading rate of 44 m year using base case simulation parameters the filter overflows in 15 events in both models leading to an overflow of 18 of the total inflow volume model parameter variations for the rsf models can be found in tables 1 and 4 3 3 1 ss the simulated ss loads differ between rsf sim and rsf disc by around 18 in the base case scenario fig 9 the difference between the two models for ss load is higher than that of cod and ammonium loads because most of the ss load 90 in rsf sim for base case scenario is discharged via filter overflow sedimentation of ss occurs in the detention layer in contrast to rsf sim sedimentation of the overflowing water is not implemented in rsf disc the strong influence of sedimentation efficiency on the emitted loads in rsf sim can also be seen in fig 7 regarding the sensitivity analysis of rsf sim the strongest influencing parameter on ss sedimentation efficiency is causing a deviation from base case scenario of 54 to 19 for the simulated output ss load see fig 7 simulated ss loads with rsf disc vary in a range of 8 for the assessed ss background concentrations see fig 8 simulated ss loads are dominated by uncertainties in the sewer system model variations up to 80 see fig 6 3 3 2 cod most of the total cod load is discharged via rsf outflow in both models whereas for xcod most of the load is discharged via filter overflow see fig 9 regarding discharged total cod loads the result difference between rsf sim and rsf disc is 4 in the base case scenario in the sensitivity analysis of rsf sim the simulated cod loads vary from 18 to 11 from base case scenario for a change in sedimentation efficiency of 281 and for a decrease of 33 of solute cod scod removal efficiency respectively see fig 7 discharged cod loads simulated using rsf disc vary around 11 for the tested parameters the most important parameter is the removal efficiency for scod see fig 8 in comparison to the ranges due to uncertainties in the sewer system for cod 81 to 52 see fig 6 the variations for cod obtained with both rsf models are minor the relevant effect of combined sewer overflow on receiving water bodies considering cod is oxygen depletion due to excessive organic loads from single events dittmer et al 2014 cumulative frequency distributions can represent these characteristics simulated cumulative frequency distributions of discharged cod loads per event resemble each other closely for all assessed parameters and for both models only a major variation in sedimentation gives a slightly different cumulative frequency distribution this underlines the significance of filter overflows on receiving water quality 3 3 3 ammonium most of the annually discharged load as well as ammonium peak concentrations are released via filter overflow see fig 9 this means that only 15 overflows of 99 events are contributing 69 of the total emitted loads the relevant ecosystem impact is ammonium peak concentrations causing acute ammonia toxicity miskewitz and uchrin 2013 david et al 2013 borchardt and sperling 1996 in base case scenario all three events discharging high ammonium concentrations 5 mg l originate from the filter overflow furthermore ammonium peak concentrations discharged by the filter outflow are delayed in comparison to peak concentrations discharged by filter overflows this gives the flow level in the receiving water body time to rise during a rain event allowing for mixing to occur the peak concentrations discharged by the filter outflow are more diluted the impact of acute toxicity of ammonia on the receiving water body s ecosystem is lower because ammonium breakthroughs have only minor impacts simulated ammonium loads in base case scenario differ between the rsf models about 9 whether ammonium is degraded in the solid phase during wetting conditions as well as during dry weather has the strongest influence on emitted ammonium loads up to 28 deviation from base case scenario see fig 7 adsorption capacity also shows major influence on emitted ammonium loads using rsf disc ammonium loads vary most for the evaluated ammonium background concentrations causing a deviation from base case scenario of 13 to 28 see fig 8 uncertainties about discharged ammonium loads are dominated by uncertainties in the sewer system quality model in contrast to the moderate variations from 30 to 28 in both rsf models for ammonium the sewer system model produces uncertainty ranges of 79 to 63 for total ammonium loads discharged via combined sewer overflow see fig 6 3 4 validity of data removal efficiencies from the evaluated rsf plants for cod and ss are in the range of international literature values see table 5 in appendix a with a total cod removal efficiency of 46 99 literature 30 95 and ss removal rates of 27 98 literature 25 100 ammonium removal efficiencies for eh oe la kw and wb are in the range of international literature 58 99 literature 60 99 kg shows ammonium removal efficiencies remarkably below the given literature range with 28 and 37 in two of 37 events generally it should be noted that the analyzed database comes from rather low loaded rsf plants in germany another problem with the data evaluation is that rsfs with more measurement values dominate the overall statistical data evaluation 4 conclusions data evaluation from six full scale rsf plants has shown a good removal performance for ss ammonium and cod in all cases rsfs can therefore be considered an effective measure for reducing the main stress factors that combined sewer overflows impose on receiving water ecosystems simple conceptual models have the ability to describe the observed performance of all plants despite the differences in loading and operation mode such models are a valuable tool to include rsfs in simulation based design of stormwater management concepts when coupled with a sewer quality model in a long term simulation they can predict the effect of a retention soil filter and the remaining emissions at a given site the value of the model depends on how accurately it represents the relevant emission parameters at their corresponding time scale in many cases the most important emission characteristics in regards to the impact on the receiving water body are long term loads of ss frequency of critical event specific cod loads and frequency of short term peaks of ammonium concentrations these values can be predicted reliably with a highly simplified rsf model without being sensitive to model parameter uncertainties thus these models enable a quality based evaluation of the effectiveness of retention soil filters the monitored rsf plants were designed according to current german guidelines this leads to a design where critical emissions are mainly discharged via filter overflows under such conditions the model of the filtration is of minor importance however this will change as guidelines are revised to make better use of the potential of rsfs with increasing volumes of filtrate per filter area the relevance of the filter model will also increase output uncertainties of integrated models for sewer systems and rsfs are dominated by uncertainties associated with sewer quality models during data collection in a planning process special focus should be put on accurate description of connected area runoff efficiency however stormwater runoff quality and model parameters for pollutant transport in sewer systems can only be estimated roughly the model structure adds considerably to output uncertainty all this is especially valid for xcod and ss compared to the processes in sewer systems rsfs are relatively well understood model parameters can be derived from monitoring data the level of uncertainty of simulation results does not increase by

vertical flow constructed wetlands specifically designed for combined sewer overflow cso treatment have proven to be an effective tool to mitigate negative impacts of csos on receiving water bodies long term hydrologic simulations are used to predict the emissions from urban drainage systems during planning of stormwater management measures so far no universally accepted model for rsf simulation exists when simulating hydraulics and water quality in rsfs an appropriate level of detail must be chosen for reasonable balancing between model complexity and model handling considering the model input s level of uncertainty the most crucial parameters determining the resultant uncertainties of the integrated sewer system and filter bed model were identified by evaluating a virtual drainage system with a retention soil filter for cso treatment to determine reasonable parameter ranges for rsf simulations data of 207 events from six full scale rsf plants in germany were analyzed data evaluation shows that even though different plants with varying loading and operation modes were examined a simple model is sufficient to assess relevant suspended solids ss chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 emissions from rsfs two conceptual rsf models with different degrees of complexity were assessed these models were developed based on evaluation of data from full scale rsf plants and column experiments incorporated model processes are ammonium adsorption in the filter layer and degradation during subsequent dry weather period filtration of ss and particulate cod xcod to a constant background concentration and removal of solute cod scod by a constant removal rate during filter passage as well as sedimentation of ss and xcod in the filter overflow xcod ss and ammonium loads as well as ammonium concentration peaks are discharged primarily via rsf overflow not passing through the filter bed uncertainties of the integrated simulation of the sewer system and rsf model mainly

combined sewer overflow constructed wetland retention soil filter sensitivity analysis stormwater management uncertainty 1 introduction 1 1 effects of csos on receiving water pollutant emissions by combined sewer overflows are an issue in many countries for many substances the pollutant loads emitted by csos are of similar or greater magnitude than the emissions from wastewater treatment plants e g gasperi et al 2012 launay et al 2016 scherer et al 2003 furthermore csos can cause serious damage to the aquatic ecosystem especially when the receiving water body is small and sensitive e g borchardt et al 1998 borchardt and sperling 1996 casadio et al 2010 ellis 2000 ellis and hvitved jacobsen 1996 passerat et al 2011 burton and pitt 2002 willems and einfalt 2012 as european legislation calls for a good chemical and ecological status of all water bodies eu wfd 2000 treatment of cso discharge is required in many cases the most relevant effects of cso discharges are high peak flows oxygen depletion due to excessive organic loads from single events ecotoxic concentrations of ammonia nh3 and silting of the watercourse by fine sediments miskewitz and uchrin 2013 david et al 2013 borchardt and sperling 1996 1 2 rsfs for cso treatment for 25 years retention soil filters rsfs have been used for treatment of combined sewer overflow discharges dittmer et al 2016 they combine a vertical flow sand filter below a detention basin fig 1 dittmer et al 2005 dittmer 2006 the filter layer is planted with reed phragmites spec as filter media mainly ordinary local sand with a minimum content of caco3 is used for advanced treatment e g phosphorous removal special components can be added vohla et al 2011 dwa 2005 a regulated valve limits the filtration rate to avoid preferential flow through macro pores standard values for filtration rates range from 1 to 3 10 5 m s the filtration rate of the regulated valve is much lower than the flow velocity through the porous media therefore the filter sand is assumed to be saturated with water when the retention volume is filled up during heavier rain events the overflow is discharged directly to the receiving water the filter surface is around 1 of the contributing connected impervious area dittmer et al 2016 german guidelines on layout design and dimensioning of these systems are described by uhl and dittmer 2005 in literature rsfs are also referred to as constructed wetlands or biofilters kadlec and wallace 2009 classify retention soil filters as event driven wetlands currently similar systems are in use in several other european countries such as france italy and portugal amaral et al 2013 meyer et al 2013 due to the stochastic nature of rainfall rsfs are loaded irregularly dry weather periods between loading events might last up to several months after each loading the filter is drained completely to ensure optimal aeration apart from reduction of hydraulic stress rsfs are mostly applied with the objective to reduce the emission of suspended solids ss and of particle bound pollutants such as heavy metals and pahs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons other objectives of the treatment by rsfs are the removal of organic compounds represented by the chemical oxygen demand cod and the reduction of discharged ammonium peak concentrations by adsorption during the filter passage and subsequent nitrification during dry weather periods meyer and dittmer 2015 1 3 modelling of retention soil filters to assess the ecological impact of cso discharges each pollutant parameter must be evaluated on the time scale that corresponds to its effect on the aquatic ecosystem ammonia is acutely toxic within minutes a simulation model should therefore predict the frequency and the intensity of short term peaks of nh4 concentrations and loads oxygen depletion due to the degradation of organic loads takes place at a time scale of several hours to days the corresponding emission characteristic is the frequency and intensity of event specific loads which can be displayed by cumulative frequency distributions as siltation of river beds and impacts of persistent pollutants are long term accumulative effects the appropriate emission characteristics for ss are long term loads miskewitz and uchrin 2013 david et al 2013 borchardt and sperling 1996 ellis and hvitved jacobsen 1996 due to the stochastic character of rainfall representative results for the above mentioned peak loads and concentrations can only be obtained by simulating longer time series a typical lengths for long term simulations in germany is 10 years yet there is no generally accepted approach to integrate retention soil filters into such a long term sewer quality modelling the aim of the practical sizing of rsfs is only the reliability of the plant s operation the dimensioning parameters are hydraulic loading and maximum lengths of filter bed surcharge quality aspects and treatment performance of the plants are not considered the aim of the rsf models is to predict relevant emissions from rsf systems 1 4 scope and aim several software programs such as swmm mike urban simba or infoworks cs are widely used for quality simulations in combined sewer systems fewer programs are available for simulation of vertical flow constructed wetlands or rsfs the underlying models differ widely in level of detail model complexity and the required effort for parameter estimation and calibration the dynamic input of the rsf simulation in coupled sewer system rsf modelling is always the result of a sewer quality simulation both hydrograph and pollutograph are required as rsf model input a reasonable balance is needed between model simplicity and reliability meyer et al 2015 this study identifies the most relevant processes and important parameters that determine the resulting uncertainties of the integrated sewer system and rsf model by meyer and dittmer 2015 a sensitivity analysis sa of the integrated model was conducted considering the effects of the modeled pollutants on the respective time scales to determine reasonable model parameter ranges for rsf simulations data from 207 events from six full scale rsf systems in germany were analyzed conclusions are drawn as to how model simplifications or details are justified and which range of uncertainty of model parameters is acceptable 2 materials and methods 2 1 general concept for sensitivity analysis the aim of the study was to determine important model parameters for sewer system and modelling of retention soil filters hamby 1994 defined an important parameter as a parameter that is sensitive meaning that changes have an influence on the model output and which is also not known precisely so it contributes substantially to the uncertainty in assessment result the sensitivity analysis sa of the sewer system and rsf model was performed using the one at a time oat approach also referred to as local sa hamby 1994 hall et al 2009 varying the model parameters by a constant percentage cannot reflect the real uncertainty of the model parameters therefore in this study the parameters were varied by a range determined by literature for the sewer system model and by data evaluation for the rsf model see sections 2 3 and 3 1 representing the variability of the parameter this ensures a realistic assessment of existing output uncertainties in the planning and modelling process of sewer systems and rsfs a similar approach has been described by downing et al 1985 for estimating the dose equivalent to man from the concentration of radioactivity in air water and food 2 2 conceptual models applied for rsf simulation langergraber and šimůnek 2012 presented with hydrus 2d cw2d a model modification of hydrus a tool for simulating variably saturated water flow and multi component transport in constructed wetlands complex finite elements models like hydrus 2d cw2d are able to display processes in retention soil filters under varying conditions for long term simulation of rsfs finite element methods are inappropriate henrichs et al 2007 henrichs et al 2009 pálfy et al 2014 2016 they require model parameters which are difficult to obtain and long calculation times for longer simulation periods furthermore for integrated sewer system rsf simulations the input data for the rsf model being a result of sewer system quality simulations show a high level of uncertainty in this study two models with different levels of complexity are compared to identify relevant processes these models were developed to calculate emissions of ss cod and nh4 from rsfs 2 2 1 rsf disc rsf disc dittmer 2006 was first implemented into the sewer quality model kosmo schmitt and dittmer 2007 it is a simple black box model that was developed based on observations from one full scale rsf in ensheim germany the rsf is separated into two layers see fig 1 implemented in the model the detention layer represents the storage volume above the filter layer the process layer represents the pore volume of the filter in which the relevant removal processes occur meyer 2011 both layers are modeled as completely stirred tank reactors the filtration rate limiting the outflow of the rsf is assumed to be constant when the inflow to the filter exceeds the filtration rate the filter is surcharged until the retention volume is filled if the retention volume is exceeded an overflow occurs the overflowing water bypasses the filter bed and is discharged directly with the concentration of the water in the storage layer and under consideration of sedimentation during filter passage suspended solids and particulate cod are reduced to a constant background concentration c0 ss and c0 xcod respectively the dissolved fraction is reduced following a constant removal rate ηscod retained cod compounds are mineralized by a zero order reaction ammonium elimination is represented as a two stage process 1 in a loading event of the rsf ammonium is adsorbed until the maximum sorption capacity bsorb max is reached during this period effluent concentration is reduced down to a constant outflow background concentration c0 nh4 n when the maximum sorption capacity is reached the effluent concentration increases filter breakthrough 2 during the next dry weather period the adsorbed ammonium is oxidized immediately to nitrate the sorption capacity of the filter is regenerated the nitrate formed during the oxidization of ammonium is flushed out during the subsequent loading event 2 2 2 rsf sim rsf sim was developed with a more detailed process description than rsf disc based on lab scale experiments and simulations to achieve a better approximation of the simulated time series to measured data meyer 2011 a detailed description of rsf sim is given in meyer and dittmer 2015 the model changes were based on simulation studies with hydrus 2d cw2d henrichs et al 2007 2009 pálfy et al 2014 and data evaluation of two full scale rsfs dittmer 2006 meyer 2011 the model based optimization tool for constructed wetlands in france orage by pálfy et al 2017 was also inspired by rsf sim the hydraulic model of rsf sim consists of a linear storage cascade of completely stirred tank reactors to describe the processes in the filter a third layer is added to the hydraulic model in addition to the retention layer and the process layer as in rsf disc the drainage layer provides additional retention volume and allows a better fitting of effluent time series to measured data the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate is considered in addition to the filtration rate to enable calculation of concentrations during dry weather periods a residual water content in the process layer is required physically the residual water or residual saturation is the water which is kept within the pores of the filter media due to capillary forces only for rsf sim hydraulic parameters were assessed in the sensitivity analysis see table 1 as in rsf disc suspended solids ss and particulate cod xcod are assumed to be retained by filtration down to a constant background concentration c0 ss and c0 xcod respectively sedimentation of ss and xcod can be considered by a constant sedimentation rate in the case of rsf overflows see table 2 solute cod scod is assumed to be reduced by a constant per event removal rate ηcod depending on the duration of the antecedent dry weather period lower removal rates due to short 1 d or long 1 d dry weather periods to achieve reasonable results in low inflow concentrations an option to add a constant background concentration c0 scod is also implemented meyer and dittmer 2015 as in rsf disc ammonium removal is described in a two step process ammonium is retained by adsorption during the passage of the filter media layer kinetic nitrification starts simultaneously to re aeration after drainage adsorption itself is modeled by a two stage linear isotherm with the parameters a1 slope of 1st stage c1 critical concentration and a2 slope of 2nd stage see fig 2 to determine a1 c1 and a2 adsorption capacities bsorb max were fitted to observed time series during breakthrough events 2 3 simulated drainage system and rsf for the simulation study an ideal virtual drainage system was modeled this system has been used before in several comparative simulation studies leinweber 2002 welker 2004 all sewer system structures including the retention soil filter were dimensioned according to german guidelines the virtual combined sewer system drains an effective impervious area of 102 45 ha with 9900 inhabitants see table 3 two industrial sites discharge into the combined sewer system the system comprises two combined sewer overflow tanks storing 1 16 mm of rainfall that is subsequently conveyed to the wastewater treatment plant a retention soil filter is applied to treat the overflow of the last tank upstream of the wastewater treatment plant reducing the plant s inflow the rsf has a surface area of 2510 m2 with a filtration rate of 0 02 l s m2 and is designed according to german guidelines dwa 2005 the depth of the detention basin is 1 m the filter sand layer is 0 75 m and the gravel layer is 0 25 m high see fig 1 for sewer system simulation a 10 year time series of precipitation was taken from a measurement station in germany holzgerlingen schnapseiche the rsf was simulated due to computational reasons only for two representative years of the 10 year sewer system simulation period the sewer system simulation is conducted using the hydrological software kosim harms and kenter 1987 subcatchments are represented by a linear reservoir cascade n 3 k calculated using an overland flow time of 4 min flow routing is based on the kalinin miljukov method itwh 2009 ranges for parameters of the sewer system quality model were taken from literature welker 2004 gujer 2007 orhon et al 1997 results of the base case simulation of the sewer system were checked for plausibility against a broad collection of literature data uhl and kasting 2002 welker 2004 brombach et al 2005 previous studies have identified the effective impervious area as the most sensitive parameter for stormwater runoff simulations corving and clemens 2005 dotto et al 2011 therefore special attention was paid to this parameter the assessed range of effective impervious area was calculated from a dataset that comprises 43 subcatchments from various sites in germany by evaluating aerial images paved areas were determined a standard approach is to assume that all paved areas are impermeable and that they are connected to the drainage system to consider this bias during planning of combined sewer systems an effective impervious area of 100 was set as base case for the simulations evaluation of rainfall runoff balances from the dataset of 43 subcatchments revealed that even after initial losses are covered only 42 94 median 72 mean value 71 of the area was contributing to the runoff therefore the paved area was varied only downward 58 and 28 corresponding to observed minimum and median 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of model parameters for rsf models to determine reasonable ranges of the model parameters for the local sensitivity analysis of the rsf models data from 207 events in six german full scale rsf plants were analyzed descriptions and data evaluation of the individual rsfs can be found in dittmer 2006 and meyer 2011 for the rsf ensheim eh in frechen 2009 and meyer 2011 for the plant oberelsungen oe in fuchs and schnabel 2001 for rsf langenalb la and in waldhoff 2008 for the plants fellenweg fw kleingladenbach kg and wiesenbach wb the filter media for all plants except fw is sand 0 2 mm the rsf plant fw is equipped with cohesive soil 0 1 4 mm at the plant oe and la calcium carbonate was added to the filter substrate to maintain a high nitrification level median average interquartile range outliers deviation between 1 5 fold and 3 fold of interquartile range and extreme values distance of more than 3 fold from the 1st or 3rd quartile see explanation boxplot in fig 3 r for the model parameters were determined for each retention soil filter plant separately and for all events of all plants together model parameter ranges for the sensitivity analysis were derived from overall data evaluation base case values for process description parameters were adopted from meyer et al 2008 an evaluation of inflow concentrations for all rsf plants is given in fig 3 the overall and plant specific variability of tss event mean concentrations emcs in the inflow between the observed events is high 4 1180 mg l also inflow emcs for cod show a high level of variability 12 980 mg l and are dominated by the higher variations of particulate cod xcod inflow emcs 9 225 mg l the data range for solute cod scod inflow emcs lies between 6 mg l and 142 mg l ammonium inflow emcs range from 0 1 to 29 mg l the event mean concentrations of ss and xcod in the effluent of the rsf plants were evaluated to determine the constant background concentration c0 for xcod and ss for both rsf models the event mean concentrations of suspended solids for the plants la fw kg and wb are between 0 5 and 30 mg l see fig 4 l median values of these plants range from 2 to 7 mg l higher values of up to 66 mg l were observed only at the plant in oe an overall interquartile range from 3 to 9 mg l is obtained in comparison to inflow event mean concentration interquartile range for ss 45 189 mg l see fig 3 l the effluent values are low confirming a high removal efficiency of rsf plants regarding ss the high ss outflow values for the rsf oe are remarkable considering that the outflow emcs of particulate cod xcod are rather low below 10 mg l see fig 5 this could imply that the filter is losing inorganic filter material in its outflow which would be a construction problem probably the influence of preferential flow through the filter rather than a low treatment performance in the outflow of the rsf eh ss were below limit of quantification neglecting outliers and extreme values ss emcs of 207 monitored events vary between 1 and 20 mg l while the rsfs kg and wb are showing xcod emcs between 0 and 3 mg l the plants oe and la have maximum values of 10 mg l and 29 mg l respectively fig 5 at the plant fw xcod was not measured for rsf eh the measured outflow values for xcod were below the detection limit in the overall statistical evaluation the highest value from oe and the three highest values from la are classified as outliers and extreme values leaving a data range of below detection limit to 10 mg l xcod with a median of 2 mg l the overall interquartile range is 1 5 mg l the solute cod background concentration c0 scod was determined by evaluating time series of each event from each plant for the lowest scod outflow concentration except for one outlier from the rsf eh all minimum outflow concentrations are between 4 mg l and 20 mg l with a median of 9 mg l see fig 5 the removal efficiencies for solute cod scod are between 28 and 69 for the rsf plants eh la kg and wb see fig 5 the rsf oe shows one lower removal efficiency of only 11 the overall median is 47 removal efficiency for scod in 37 evaluated events the event mean concentrations of ammonium for events without ammonium breakthrough defined as η 90 or outflow concentration 1 mg l in the outflow of the rsfs see fig 4 were evaluated to display the background concentration c0 nh4 n of ammonium before depletion of maximum sorption capacity in rsf disc for the rsf plants eh la kg and wb all ammonium event mean concentrations are below 0 8 mg l the plants oe and fw show higher extreme values 1 mg l and 2 3 mg l the overall median of ammonium emcs is very low 0 09 mg l and neglecting extreme values and outliers concentrations vary from 0 to 0 35 mg l the maximum capacity of ammonium sorption bsorb max was determined in 14 events with ammonium breakthrough see fig 5 the filter plant eh shows highest ammonium sorption capacities between 5 8 and 13 g m2 ammonium sorption at the rsfs oe and kenten k is lower 4 8 7 2 g m2 3 6 6 g m2 tondera et al 2014 overall the median of ammonium sorption is 6 3 g m2 with a range from 3 to 11 g m2 the evaluated data from all rsfs show an effective removal of all assessed parameters observed variations for the evaluated rsf model parameters are low compared to ranges of rsf inflow concentrations intra event variability of inflow and outflow concentrations for suspended solids ss and particulate xcod as well as solute cod scod and ammonium shows that the model assumptions in rsf sim and rsf disc are correct outflow concentrations for particulate matter and ammonium stay constant during the events even though varying inflow concentrations occur inflow and outflow time series for scod show that a removal by a constant removal rate is a more accurate process description than modelling scod elimination by a constant outflow concentration the ranges for the sensitivity analysis sa as shown in table 4 were derived from the presented data evaluation results from 6 full scale rsfs in germany for ammonium adsorption the entire data range without outliers was taken as bandwidth for the sensitivity analysis sa for scod removal efficiency the interquartile range was set as sa bandwidth for background concentration of c0 scod 0 to median value was taken as sa bandwidth and for background concentrations of c0 xcod and c0 ss 0 to third quartile of the datasets were taken as sa bandwidth furthermore different model configurations were assessed for rsf sim one simulation was run with decreased removal efficiency for solute cod scod after short 1 d or long 14 d dry weather periods one was run with continuous ammonium degradation in the solid phase and another with decreased removal efficiency for scod for higher infiltration rates 3 2 sewer system simulation output time series of the sewer system simulation are required as input data for the rsf simulation in the simulated system the overflow of the last cso tank upstream of the wastewater treatment plant provides inflow for the rsf therefore a sensitivity analysis of the sewer system simulation was conducted to identify the parameters most influencing cso overflow volume as well as ss cod and ammonium loads results of the parameter variations are shown in fig 6 model parameter variations for the sewer system model can be found in table 3 the most important parameters causing uncertainties in the sewer system model are connected area and stormwater runoff quality see fig 6 the change of the connected area in the simulation input results in deviations of discharged volume and loads of up to 80 kleidorfer et al 2009 also identified the effective impervious area as the most sensitive flow parameter in urban stormwater modelling in previous studies stormwater and cso quality models have shown a high level of uncertainty dotto et al 2010 kanso et al 2005 corroborating the high variability of sewer system model results obtained in this study output changes of up to 71 are caused by variations of stormwater runoff quality variations of dry weather flow quality show a much lower influence on simulation results up to 11 this high contribution of quality parameters accords with willems 2008 and freni and mannina 2010 who found out that the uncertainty contribution by water quality submodels is higher than that for flow submodels 3 3 rsf simulation within the 2 year simulation period the rsf is fed 99 times with a total amount of 218 383 m3 combined sewer overflow resulting in a loading rate of 44 m year using base case simulation parameters the filter overflows in 15 events in both models leading to an overflow of 18 of the total inflow volume model parameter variations for the rsf models can be found in tables 1 and 4 3 3 1 ss the simulated ss loads differ between rsf sim and rsf disc by around 18 in the base case scenario fig 9 the difference between the two models for ss load is higher than that of cod and ammonium loads because most of the ss load 90 in rsf sim for base case scenario is discharged via filter overflow sedimentation of ss occurs in the detention layer in contrast to rsf sim sedimentation of the overflowing water is not implemented in rsf disc the strong influence of sedimentation efficiency on the emitted loads in rsf sim can also be seen in fig 7 regarding the sensitivity analysis of rsf sim the strongest influencing parameter on ss sedimentation efficiency is causing a deviation from base case scenario of 54 to 19 for the simulated output ss load see fig 7 simulated ss loads with rsf disc vary in a range of 8 for the assessed ss background concentrations see fig 8 simulated ss loads are dominated by uncertainties in the sewer system model variations up to 80 see fig 6 3 3 2 cod most of the total cod load is discharged via rsf outflow in both models whereas for xcod most of the load is discharged via filter overflow see fig 9 regarding discharged total cod loads the result difference between rsf sim and rsf disc is 4 in the base case scenario in the sensitivity analysis of rsf sim the simulated cod loads vary from 18 to 11 from base case scenario for a change in sedimentation efficiency of 281 and for a decrease of 33 of solute cod scod removal efficiency respectively see fig 7 discharged cod loads simulated using rsf disc vary around 11 for the tested parameters the most important parameter is the removal efficiency for scod see fig 8 in comparison to the ranges due to uncertainties in the sewer system for cod 81 to 52 see fig 6 the variations for cod obtained with both rsf models are minor the relevant effect of combined sewer overflow on receiving water bodies considering cod is oxygen depletion due to excessive organic loads from single events dittmer et al 2014 cumulative frequency distributions can represent these characteristics simulated cumulative frequency distributions of discharged cod loads per event resemble each other closely for all assessed parameters and for both models only a major variation in sedimentation gives a slightly different cumulative frequency distribution this underlines the significance of filter overflows on receiving water quality 3 3 3 ammonium most of the annually discharged load as well as ammonium peak concentrations are released via filter overflow see fig 9 this means that only 15 overflows of 99 events are contributing 69 of the total emitted loads the relevant ecosystem impact is ammonium peak concentrations causing acute ammonia toxicity miskewitz and uchrin 2013 david et al 2013 borchardt and sperling 1996 in base case scenario all three events discharging high ammonium concentrations 5 mg l originate from the filter overflow furthermore ammonium peak concentrations discharged by the filter outflow are delayed in comparison to peak concentrations discharged by filter overflows this gives the flow level in the receiving water body time to rise during a rain event allowing for mixing to occur the peak concentrations discharged by the filter outflow are more diluted the impact of acute toxicity of ammonia on the receiving water body s ecosystem is lower because ammonium breakthroughs have only minor impacts simulated ammonium loads in base case scenario differ between the rsf models about 9 whether ammonium is degraded in the solid phase during wetting conditions as well as during dry weather has the strongest influence on emitted ammonium loads up to 28 deviation from base case scenario see fig 7 adsorption capacity also shows major influence on emitted ammonium loads using rsf disc ammonium loads vary most for the evaluated ammonium background concentrations causing a deviation from base case scenario of 13 to 28 see fig 8 uncertainties about discharged ammonium loads are dominated by uncertainties in the sewer system quality model in contrast to the moderate variations from 30 to 28 in both rsf models for ammonium the sewer system model produces uncertainty ranges of 79 to 63 for total ammonium loads discharged via combined sewer overflow see fig 6 3 4 validity of data removal efficiencies from the evaluated rsf plants for cod and ss are in the range of international literature values see table 5 in appendix a with a total cod removal efficiency of 46 99 literature 30 95 and ss removal rates of 27 98 literature 25 100 ammonium removal efficiencies for eh oe la kw and wb are in the range of international literature 58 99 literature 60 99 kg shows ammonium removal efficiencies remarkably below the given literature range with 28 and 37 in two of 37 events generally it should be noted that the analyzed database comes from rather low loaded rsf plants in germany another problem with the data evaluation is that rsfs with more measurement values dominate the overall statistical data evaluation 4 conclusions data evaluation from six full scale rsf plants has shown a good removal performance for ss ammonium and cod in all cases rsfs can therefore be considered an effective measure for reducing the main stress factors that combined sewer overflows impose on receiving water ecosystems simple conceptual models have the ability to describe the observed performance of all plants despite the differences in loading and operation mode such models are a valuable tool to include rsfs in simulation based design of stormwater management concepts when coupled with a sewer quality model in a long term simulation they can predict the effect of a retention soil filter and the remaining emissions at a given site the value of the model depends on how accurately it represents the relevant emission parameters at their corresponding time scale in many cases the most important emission characteristics in regards to the impact on the receiving water body are long term loads of ss frequency of critical event specific cod loads and frequency of short term peaks of ammonium concentrations these values can be predicted reliably with a highly simplified rsf model without being sensitive to model parameter uncertainties thus these models enable a quality based evaluation of the effectiveness of retention soil filters the monitored rsf plants were designed according to current german guidelines this leads to a design where critical emissions are mainly discharged via filter overflows under such conditions the model of the filtration is of minor importance however this will change as guidelines are revised to make better use of the potential of rsfs with increasing volumes of filtrate per filter area the relevance of the filter model will also increase output uncertainties of integrated models for sewer systems and rsfs are dominated by uncertainties associated with sewer quality models during data collection in a planning process special focus should be put on accurate description of connected area runoff efficiency however stormwater runoff quality and model parameters for pollutant transport in sewer systems can only be estimated roughly the model structure adds considerably to output uncertainty all this is especially valid for xcod and ss compared to the processes in sewer systems rsfs are relatively well understood model parameters can be derived from monitoring data the level of uncertainty of simulation results does not increase by
