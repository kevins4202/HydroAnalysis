11855,the instruments that help decision makers for evaluating the quality of groundwater resources are necessary this study introduces a bayesian network to simulate and predict the nitrate and tds concentrations as two quality parameters affecting water consumption for this purpose various quantitative and qualitative predictor variables were evaluated using different scenarios for simulation

exploitation javadi et al 2020 in addition to reliability in terms of exploitation these resources have less potential of pollution than surface waters increasing exploitation with industrial and agricultural developments have led to progressive growth in various pollutants increasing cultivated area in croplands along with the use of various fertilizers and pesticides have amplified nitrate concentrations in aquifers mahvi et al 2005 the majority of aquatic environments and groundwater resources are among the places of nitrate accumulation wen et al 2018 chica olmo et al 2014 the rising concentration of nitrate in drinking water sources can cause a variety of gastrointestinal diseases abortion blue syndrome reproductive toxicity and so on paladino et al 2018 wu et al 2018 although groundwater resources have little potential for contamination the continuous influx of pollutants leads to rising concentrations of qualitative parameters and reducing soil self purification properties in an unsaturated zone if this process continues in addition to pollutant accumulation in aquifers it contributes to the pollution of water resources from the recharge of aquifers and transmission of contamination evaluation and prediction of the nitrate concentration in groundwater resources are especially important for drinking water it is imperative today to develop a model that can be used to predict qualitative parameters by considering the complexity of pollution flow and transmission allawi et al 2018 because of the stochastic approach in water cycle processes it is critical to use an approach that takes the uncertainty of these processes and can provide appropriate results in the assessment and prediction bayesian network is one of the modeling tools for evaluation and prediction of qualitative parameters in groundwater resources this network is a graphical model for expressing probabilistic relationships between variables various uses of the probabilistic approach of this network have been discussed in water resources research ramin et al 2012 used a bayesian model to integrate several models for the prediction of water quality and identification of affecting factors their combination of existing models indicated the accuracy of bayesian network efficacy for prediction kardan moghaddam and roozbahani kardan and roozbahani 2015 simulated groundwater level using a bayesian network with two clustered and explicit structures their results showed that bayesian network was a strong tool in simulating groundwater level under uncertainty conditions and that the use of an explicit structure to predict groundwater levels per piezometer of the aquifer could be used with higher correlation the bayesian approach considering the uncertainty of different parameters can be used as a suitable model for simulation moghaddam et al 2019 noorbeh et al 2020 rahmani et al 2021 used the clustering approach to analyze the quality status of groundwater resources using 14 quality parameters in the aquifer the results showed that his method is the most appropriate qualitative clustering method rahmani et al 2021 in this study the bayesian approach was used to simulate two qualitative parameters of tds and nitrate concentration in groundwater resources the results of this study can be very important considering the sensitivity of groundwater resources utilization due to these two qualitative parameters 2 materials and methods exploitation of groundwater resources particularly under the water shortage conditions and inappropriate allocation of surface water resources have led to increased growth of consumption malmir et al 2022 although this issue has led to developments in water supply and distribution sectors

and quality of groundwater resources in the area different approaches have been employed to simulate the quantitative status of water resources but the evaluation of qualitative approaches less used the parameters which affected on quality of groundwater resources are depended on quantity and the nature of the aquifer accordingly the bayesian network approach has been used as a novel approach to

which the probabilities are specified for the placement of each variable in each category conditional probability tables reflect the effects of a variable on another determined for each node with respect to its parents bayesian networks have been developed based on the use of conditional probabilities and bayes theorem the bayes relationship is defined as if e and f are two assumed events such that p e 0 and p f 0 then we have eq 1 p e f p f e p e p f where p e f is the probability of e under the condition f or posterior probability p f e is the probability of f under the condition e and p e is the probability of observing e or prior probability and p f is the probability of observing f the combined probabilistic distribution of a set of variables assuming independent of each other is obtained from the product of multiplying their distribution of conditional probabilities over the past two decades bayesian networks have been used based on expert knowledge and then researchers have developed methods for training these networks using existing data these methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in some data analysis problems the possibility of network expansion even in the case of incomplete data series the possibility and convenience of updating parameters and conditional probabilities between different parameters are some advantages of bayesian networks also bayesian

probability distribution function is used during the modeling period and the expected numerical value is predicted depending on the process probability in the categorized mode each agent is divided into several categories clustering and the network output is received as the probability of each variable per cluster in most cases a bayesian network model can operate as an expert system in such cases of insufficient observational data the analyst can determine the conditional probabilities between the cause and effect and then analyze the model clearly errors in the analysis and related predictions will rise if a bayesian model is developed and analyzed based on very little observational data because the model considers a probability of 50 50 in failure and non failure modes for all cases where observational data are not available high accumulation of the above conditions will result in a very high error level this problem can be solved using expert opinions quality assessment of water resources is often measured by the type of exploitation including drinking industry and agriculture in agricultural exploitation one of the most important qualitative parameters is the

improper management and increase of nitrate fertilizers in order to simulate and predict the concentration of these two qualitative parameters bayesian network under hugin v8 4 software was used bayesian network training was selected due to the npc network structure as npc and determined and the em type of observed data as partial accordingly nitrate and tds concentrations were simulated in 21 qualitative sampling wells in the region using bayesian network for two approaches with 10 scenarios statistical validation indices were used to select the best scenario as input to bayesian

evaluated based on the average statistical indices in 21 wells table 4 the analysis of the results shows that the accuracy of tds simulation results is higher than the nitrate concentration and this is due to the high correlation coefficient and low error rate one of the main reasons for this superiority is related to the effects of water exploitation and return flow on water quality and also be a high correlation of quality parameters concentration in comparison tds also analysis of simulation results in the selected scenario for simulations of nitrate and tds concentrations revealed that the highest and lowest accuracy levels belonged to wells 12 and 10 respectively in nitrate concentration simulation in the simulation of tds concentration the highest and lowest accuracy levels were

the trend of change there is less difference due to the influence of geological factors after assessment of the two approaches for simulating nitrate and tds concentrations in the qualitative sampling wells four wells were used to study the spatial predictive map considering the impact of land use on groundwater quality according to the time series of predictor variables in q2 and q4 scenarios the zoning of nitrate and tds concentrations over the aquifer was determined by idw and kriging methods fig 5 show the predictions for nitrate and tds concentrations respectively in the aquifer by two methods using the concentrations observed in four wells the predictive results of qualitative zoning was validated as shown in table 6 analysis of the results indicated that kriging interpolation method provided more suitable results of zoning for the prediction of nitrate and tds concentrations the results indicate better simulation of tds than nitrate which is the most important factor in

can be helpful in water resource management and planning this study aimed to simulate nitrate and tds concentrations by a bayesian network using various approaches of predictor parameters the results showed that both quantitative and qualitative parameters influenced on prediction the concentrations of sodium and chloride as affecting qualitative parameters and drawdown return flow and precipitation as affecting quantitative parameters influenced the prediction of tds prediction of nitrate concentration in the aquifer was influenced by sulfate calcium hardness and electric

11856,the particle induced x ray emission system is an extremely responsive multi elemental diagnostic practice uses to analyze thin films air water archaeological and biological samples this complicated system was used to quantify heavy metals presented in groundwater in the south central part of bangladesh contaminates in tube well water are related in a straight line with human health hazard the study was designed to scrutinize heavy metal concentrations in 170 groundwater samples collected from densely settled area of gopalganj district bangladesh the samples were collected from 96 no fukra kurulia and kandi tilchara mouza the study represents that the highest arsenic concentration was 260 μg l iron was 17 21 mg l manganese was 0 94 mg l zinc was 1 71 mg l and copper was 0 07 mg l the end result evidently showed that almost 5 0 times elevated arsenic concentration 17 0 times higher iron concentration 9 0 times elevated manganese concentration were found in the study area as compared to standard value approved by bangladesh the peak concentration of arsenic was found in kandi tilchchara mouza which was along the bank of madhumati river the spatial distribution showed that arsenic concentration was relatively towering in kandi tilchchara mouza majority of water sources were unsuitable for drinking and cooking in terms of arsenic and manganese concentrations the cumulative ingestion of drinking water along the study area imposes high non carcinogenic and very high cancer risk to the residents health graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic contamination

sweden he organized a discussion meeting on pixe in 1980s where the details of the system were shared and discussed johansson and campbell 1988 important findings on pixe were published in different referred journals or books international journal on pixe was in print for the earliest time in 1991 since then it is being published constantly the clash of charged particles with atoms makes the atomic inner shell electrons ionized and produce characteristics of x rays this observable fact is called pixe the expertise was developed by bombarding target atoms with weighty charged particles which produce the characteristics of x rays of the target atoms the protons and α particles are universally used in pixe system johansson et al 1970 similar to electron bombardment the x ray energy spectrum obtained continuous heavy charged particle bombardment habitually the pixe system is applied for testing rare earth elements in very low concentration this short of analysis has universal application in environmental pollution agriculture biology fisheries medicine chemistry industry archeology criminology and searches for mineral assets ishii 2019 the ongoing research used pixe for quantification of heavy metals in gw of south central part of bangladesh more specifically this was used to find out the presence of low concentration of targeted heavy metals in drinking water to determine their impacts on human health of the densely populated area water is mostly needed compounds for all forms of living beings in the globe vanloon and duffy 2017 among the all supply water nearly 3 is fresh of which almost 30 lies as gw groundwater is treated as the elementary source of drinkable water and one third of the global population depends on it for ingestion emenike et al 2017 some countries individually in bangladesh the drinking water irrigation water and majority of industrial water supply constitute nearly 90 of the gw zahid et al 2008 bangladesh and west bengal india are considered as one of the most populated sedimentary basins in the world where 85 89 people use gw for ingestion hossain et al 2015 worland et al 2015 as well as for household purposes worland et al 2015 the bangladesh part meets nearly 97 99 drinking water demands and 90 irrigation water from gw bhattacharya et al 2002a zahid et al 2008 the huge extraction of gw creates an overload in aquifer system which mineralizes and releases toxic substances to gw and deteriorates its quality annaduzzaman et al 2018 moreover climate change induced hazards make the condition of gw more complex in coastal region shaibur et al 2017a b c shaibur et al 2021b for example the coastal areas of bangladesh are facing salinity intrusion problem due to climate change pal et al 2016 shammi et al 2017

west monsoon of the indian ocean the ganges river acts as main waterbody for the river system along the study area moreover the kaliganga the madhumati the gorai and the ghagar are the notable rivers flowing through gopalganj district shammi et al 2012 all the rivers discharge water to the bay of bengal bbs 2011 the fascinating fact is that a multifarious interaction of the tidal flows from the bay of bengal and fresh water from the upstream exists in the study area the hydrology of the coastal plain of the study area is governed by the storm surges and tropical cyclones moreover it is usually affected by the seasonal rainfall recently the gw quality is declining further due to climate variability shaibur et al 2019d 2021b improper management of water shifting of river natural

color as the corroded cu comes off the inside of pipes and appears in the water as a precipitate georgopoulos et al 2001 most of the cases as is determined with aas vga icp ms hplc icp ms and together with other process it means the gw of different parts of world was analyzed with different systems or instruments but the information regarding gw quality and the use of sophisticated technique pixe in determining very low concentration of metalloids or heavy metals in gw is scarce or absent moreover in determining the impacts of toxic elements on human health particularly in the study area of gopalganj district is absent to keep all those in mind we intended to do this present research the objectives were 1 to determine the very low concentration of some heavy metals or metalloids in gw by using the pixe system and 2 to assess the probable health risk of those elements on the people along the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the investigation was directed in fukra union under kashiani upazila 23 05 23 19 n latitudes and 89 41 89 56 e longitude of gopalganj district bangladesh this union is occupied with an area of 29 33 km2 which is inhabited by 24 666 people bbs 2011 the population density in this union was 841 per km2 while the population density in gopalganj district was 798 per km2 hossain et al 2021 the climatic pattern and rainfall distribution along the study area was dominated by south west monsoon from the bay of bengal islam et al 2018 the average annual rainfall in coastal region of bangladesh is 2000 mm islam et al 2017a but the gopalganj district receives 1620 mm islam et al 2018 the important fact is that 75 80 of the rainfall is received in monsoon april to october and dry weather is observed in rest of the months islam et al 2017a the typical humidity fluctuates from 68 6 to 90 in different month of the year the minimum and maximum temperature in this area was 9 c and 30 c respectively islam et al 2018 the study area is crossed by madhumati river from north to south fig 1 a b c d the other rivers channel flow through the gopalganj district are the gorai the kaliganga and the ghagar those river channels act as a drainage channel for rainwater and carry floodwater to the bay of bengal islam et al 2018 the average elevation of gopalganj district is less than 2 0 m from the mean sea level geo morphologically gopalganj is consisted of active low ganges river floodplain 30 ganges floodplain 5 old meghna floodplain 23 gopalganj khulna beels 41 and others 1 the gw in this area is exceedingly contaminated with as shaibur 2019 shaibur and howlader 2020 due to high as load in gw the drinking water supply in gopalganj town comes from madhumati river shammi et al 2012 2 2 water sample collection and preparation initially 500 ml plastic bottles were cleaned with tap water and detergent the bottles were then socked in 0 1 n hno3 for 24 h the bottles were rewashed with tap water and distilled water and finally oven dried at 55 c for overnight a total of 170 tube well water samples were randomly composed from 3 mouza namely 96 no fukra kandi tilchhara and kuralia of fukra union under kashiani upazila bangladesh fig 1a b c water was collected in 500 ml potable plastic pot the bottles were prewashed properly with sample water during sampling to avoid plausible contamination firstly tube wells were pumped precise times with respect to the depth of the aquifer in feet i e a 50 feet tube well was initially pumped for 50 times and the water samples were collected the water samples were preserved by fallowing standard methods apha 1995 the samples were digested with strenuous hno3 to eliminate potential complex formation agent present in the water sample srikanth 2013 the same volume was made with distilled water after digestion accuracy and precession were performed in every case 2 3 use of pixe for sample analysis the concentration of as fe mn zn and cu were quantified with the pixe system at the nishine memorial cyclotron center of japan takizawa iwate prefecture japan the pixe system has the aptitude of quantifying plentiful elements instantaneously the arrangement employs proton accelerated by cyclotron and the extent of the elements can be quantified by the strength of reflecting x ray the detection limit of as was 10 ng g 10 ppb an aggregate of 20 μg l indium normal solution was mixed with the water specimen as an indoor standard and was well homogenized targets for proton beam were outfitted by tumbling the sample solutions of 20 μl onto a 4 0 μm thick prolene film and dried up at room temperature target objects were bombarded with 2 9 mevproton beam extracted from a tiny sized cyclotron mcy1750 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan and emitted x rays were deliberated through 2 si li detectors instantaneously a 500 μm thick mylar film was applied as the x ray absorber for every target beam spot size was 6 mm in diameter distinctive beam current was 80 na and detection time was 5 0 10 0 min spectrum scrutiny was conducted by using a computer code sapix 2 sera and futatsugawa 1996 shaibur et al 2012b an extra meticulous description of the beam line and measuring technique was described in the literature sera et al 1992 2 4 principal component analysis the pca procedure is applied to convert the primary data set into a lesser set consists of uncorrelated factors without losing momentous information jiang et al 2015 the pca uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors related to the variance matrix to come up with pcs by multiplying the initial correlate variables by the eigenvector the pcs having eigenvalue greater than 1 0 was considered for the interpretation of the data set kibria et al 2016 in case of heavy metal pollution pca established factors help to identify metal pollution sources and distribution concentration and also metal pollution composition five heavy metals or metalloids e g as fe mn zn and cu were analyzed in this research khelif and boudoukha 2018 kibria et al 2016 2 5 health risk assessment of metal exposure 2 5 1 chronic risk assessment the hra of all grave metals or metalloids is routinely supported quantification of the danger level and is expressed in terms of cancer or non carcinogenic health risk usepa 2009 the 2 principal toxicity risk factors evaluated square measure the sf for matel risk characterization and also the rfd for non carcinogen risk characterization lim et al 2008 for this assessment the oral exposure pathway was considered the cdi of heavy metal via ingestion was deliberated by using equation 1 wu et al 2009 karim 2011 1 c d i o r a l c i f e f e d b w a t where cdioral chronic daily intake mg kg day via oral ingestion c concentration of trace element in gw μg l or mg l ir ingestion rate ef expose frequency ed exposure doze bw body weight at average time the cdl was premeditated by using the desired value presented in table 1 2 5 2 non carcinogenic risk assessment the hq was computed as the ratio of cdi and rfd for a heavy metal typically the hq represents the non carcinogenic risk which was calculated by using equation 2 usepa 1989 2 h q c d i r f d where hq hazard quotient unit less cdi chronic daily intake mg kg day via oral ingestion and rfd is the reference doze mg kg day the rfd originates from risk based concentration table provided by usepa usepa 2001 the overall potential for non carcinogenic effects of more than one chemical is calculated by using equation 3 the calculated hq value for each chemical is summed and expressed as hi usepa 1989 3 h i h q 1 h q 2 h q 3 h q n the subsequent categories of chronic risk assessment were set by preceding studies simeonov et al 2003 muhammad et al 2011 a negligible risk where the hi or hq are 0 1 b low risk where the hi or hq are 0 1 1 0 c moderate risk where the hi or hq are 1 0 4 0 d high risk where the hi or hq are 4 0 2 5 3 carcinogenic risk assessment carcinogenic risk of an individual arises from the incremental exposure of a potential carcinogen over a lifetime it is responsible for developing cancer cell rahman et al 2018 bodrud doza et al 2019 for calculating linear doze carcinogenic risk the fallowing equation was used for an individual exposure route usepa 1989 4 l o w d o s e e x p o s u r e r i s k c d i s f 5 h i g h d o s e e x p o s u r e r i s k 1 e x e c

of trace elements are presented in table 2 the acceptable limit is treated at 1 10 6 this means that due to the consequence of the exposure approximately 1 0 person per 1 000 000 has the probability to develop cancer lim et al 2008 the acceptable risk generally considered from 1 10 6 1 10 4 usepa 1992 yang et al 2012 2 6 statistical analysis the obtained results were statistically analyzed by using spss version 20 0 the spatial analysis tools of arcgis 10 5 were applied to analyze the spatial variation of heavy metal in gw for interpolating the point data in surface map inverse distance weighted algorithm was used singh et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic concentration and distribution arsenic concentration ranges from 0 0 to 260 μg l with the average concentration of 40 50 μg l fig 2 a high concentration of as is common in shallow aquifer at the depth ranging from 15 to 75 m in low laying coastal region of faridpur trough hatiya trough and barisal chandpur high khalequzzaman et al 2005 however deep aquafer water is safe both for as and microbial contamination saha et al 2018 2019 the who recommended value for as in drinking water is 10 μg l who 1984 while the bangladesh standard recommended value is 50 μg l doe 1997 ahmad and khan 2015 about 53 of water samples exceed who drinking water quality standard and about 25 exceed bangladesh drinking water quality standard the higher concentration of as was most probably due to the fact that the samples were collected from the village situated on the bank of the madhumati river shaibur 2019 the madhumati river is directly connected with the padma river the study site is also not so far from west bengal india it is alleged that as may come from the fe mine of west bengal the mine is connected with pandma river the name padma is in bangladesh and ganga is in west bengal the madhumati river is the most important distributaries of padma river therefore it is believed that as might come from the fe mine and distributed along the river bank of the padma and lastly it came in the madhumati river and finally distribute along the bank of the river this supposition needs to be verified with extensive research arsenic exists universally in the environment all rocks soil water air and biological tissus both in solid and liquid phases it shows both metallic and non metallic properties in nature train 1979 nearly 150 speies of as bearing minerals are found in nature but arsenopyrite is branded as the leading source of as pollution in bangladesh fazal et al 2001 the bengal basin bangladesh is largely located is formed by the deposition of gbm river system during the pleistocene and holocene era mammoth amounts of as containing sediments was deposited to form this sedimentary basin the sediments originated from the himalayas and carried out by gbm river system these sediments act as the primary source for leaching of as to gw aquifers in the deposited quarter of holocene alluvium previously the exact geochemical process of as leaching into gw is not fully understood however three distinctive mechanisms were recommended in elucidation the process firstly the as is unconfined into the gw due to oxidation of arsenical pyrites minerals in the alluvial sediments the atmospheric oxygen enters into the lower aquifers during excessive withdrawal of gw through stw and dtw and might help arsenical pyrites to oxidize secondly microbic metabolism of organic substances within the aquifer resulting in hypoxia conditions which ultimately causes for reduction of fe oxyhydroxides feooh and subsequently release the sorbed as into the gw thirdly as adsorbed in aquifer minerals might be dislocated into the solution by competitive exchange of phosphorus and might contaminate the gw excess use of phosphate fertilizer may be responsible for the displacement of as from the sorbed site of soil particles islam and islam 2010 safiuddin et al 2011 ahmad et al 2018 among the similar ions present in soils po4 3 is the main competitor of as iii and as v adsorption onto fe oxyhydroxide biswas et al 2014 however the latest hypothesis is that in soils as is combined in the authigenically settled sulfides sediments in reduced condition ahmed et al 2004 and the geochemistry of fe and po4 3 in soil sediments is controlled by the presence of siderite and vivianite ahmed et al 2004 therefore reductive disbanding of fe oxyhydroxide existing as the cover of sand grains and altered mica biotite controlled the governing factors are predicted as the prime mechanism of as release into gw in the sandy aquifer of the study area nickson et al 2000 ahmed et al 2004 zheng et al 2004 again the gw as comes from the different sources e g magmatic arcs e g andes or ancient e g himalaya continental convergent margins of the utmost projecting orogenic systems throughout the globe and eventually it is ended up in secondary source sediments in connecting with foreland or related basins which eventually perform as aquifers mukherjee et al 2019 the aggressive affiliation between phosphorus and as is existed in nature asher and reay 1979 shaibur et al 2013 it is suspected that all those phenomena are reviled in the study area resulting in higher concentration of as in gw arsenic concentration ranges from 0 37 to 2 5 nmol kg was reported from gw of carrizo sand aquifer in texas usa haque and johannesson 2006 the key fact is that the perceptible impacts of as are more recurrent at concentration of 200 μg l halim et al 2009 bndwqs 2011 arsenic concentration data throughout bangladesh are exceedingly patchy in spatial and temporal scale shaibur 2019 shaibur and howlader 2020 the allotment of as in bengal basin principally depends on the geology of the upstream section and land use pattern of the catchment area ahmed et al 2004 also depends on the core river system that carries and distributes sediments and anthropogenic waste along the catchment area khalequzzaman et al 2005 some studies showed that ganges delta plains contain a sediment layer rich in as compound at the depth of 20 80 m this layer is exceedingly enriched with arseno pyrite minerals that originated from the granitic and metamorphic source location of the himalayas safiuddin et al 2011 the greater parts of natives of rustic bangladesh were exaggerated by arsenicosis through consumption of as contaminated stw water shallow tube well at the depth of 150 m is the source of as in drinking water in bangladesh haque 2018 arsenic can also come from as contaminated cooked food or crops cultivated with as enriched gw khan et al 2010 high concentration of as in drinking water or in food may cause different types of skin diseases like hyperkeratosis melanosis hyper pigmentation keratosis leuco melanosis dastgiri et al 2010 pigmentation changes hypertension and cardiovascular disorder rezaei et al 2019 similar to as pd is also sometimes responsible for creating some problems in human body the literature showed that exposure to pb is severely poisonous to human s and can create severe problems for example irritability abdominal pain headache nerve damages brain kidney and liver damage lung cancer stomach cancer blood pressure disturbance of behavior reproductive impairment together with anemia rezaei et al 2019 the above discussion demonstrated that the as came in the gw from different sources and through different mechanisms the current upshot showed that similar to different sources and mechanisms the distribution of as in gw in the study area was not homogenous in the present study the spatial distribution data of as showed that the as concentration in the majority areas ranged from 10 to 50 μg l and the higher value was observed in south western part fig 2b this area falls under kandi tilchhara mouza which is along the sedimentary basin of madhumati river it was suspected that madhumati river might be mostly responsible for higher concentration of as in the kandi tilchhara mouza the lower concentration of as in the other parts of the study area might be the distance from madhumati river the result suggested that the people of kandi tilchchara mouza should not drink the stw because samples of this mouza contained very high concentration of as this result is also informative for the people living on the bank of madhumati river extensive research along the river madhumati regarding the presence of as in gw is strongly recommended 3 2 iron concentration and distribution iron concentation along the study area ranged from 0 16 to 17 21 mg l while the mean value was 5 58 mg l fig 3 a the present upshot revealed that the gw of the research spot contained very towering concentration of fe bangladesh prescribed value of fe in drinking water is 0 03 1 0 mg l bndwqs 2011 in bangladesh the avreage concentration of fe in stw water was 2 56 mg l and in dtw water the value was 1 37 mg l bndwqs 2011 but various individual studies reported to have towering concentration of fe in some specific areas and most of the cases it was due to anthropogenic input the highest concentration of fe in gw 28 9 mg l was detected in an arsenical stw water of chuadanga nahar et al 2014 high concentration of fe was also reported from jashore municipality shaibur et al 2021c but the ingestion of high concentration of fe doesn t have any major health impact however some reports showed that towering concentration fe in drinking water can cause diabetes anemia and also heart disease toyokuni 2009 iron is one of the most ample trace elements found in earth crust but fe defeciancy is a global concern quintero gutiérrez et al 2008 the fe concentrtion in the samples were not uniform in all parts of the sampling area the spatial distribution of fe showed that the concentration of fe was relatively higher in south western part which is along the bank of madhumati river fig 4 a the upshot recommended that people of the study area must be alert regarding the high concentration of fe present in the gw more specifically among the study area the people of the kandi tilchchra mouza must be conscious about excessive fe in gw arsenic concentration was also higher in this region fig 2b a strong correlation between fe and as was found in this study table 3 therefore combined bad impact of fe and as might be possible in kandi tilchchara mouza however the corellation between as and fe was negigible in the water samples in some parts of gopalgnj district shaibur and howlader 2020 the affiliation between other elements were not so inspiring in this research table 3 3 3 manganese concentration and distribution the concentration of mn in collected sample ranges from 0 025 to 0 944 mg l with the representative value of 0 344 mg l fig 3b nearly 78 of water samples exceeded bangladesh drinking water quality standard and nearly 25 exceeded who standard value it was reported that mn concentration in the gw varied from 0 001 to 9 98 mg l with the mean value of 0 554 mg l hasan and ali 2010 the bangladesh standard for mn in drinking water is 0 01 mg l and 27 of tube well was within this limit a similar report showed that about 59 of gw samples were within who drinking water quality standard hasan and ali 2010 up to now we came to know that the premier value of mn in drinking water of bangladesh was reported from singair upazila of manikganj district halim et al 2009 2014 ingestion of towering concentration of mn in drinking water causes ruthless diseases like hallucination disorientation memory impairment and emotional instability hasan et al 2019 a study in greece reported that ingestion of 1 8 mg l of mn along with drinking water can cause neurological disordering hasan et al 2019 manganese is an essential element and it is found in every animal species tested yet but its distribution in gw varies with place to place goldhaber et al 2003 the spatial distribution represents that mn concentration gradually decreased to south western part fig 4b manganese has a significantly negative correlation with as table 3 the south western part belongs to kandi tilchchra mouza and along the madhumati river several studies reported that mn distribution generally does not correspond to that of as this meant that gw with acceptable concentration of as may not have acceptable concentration of mn in bangladesh about 32 of tube wells are safe with respect to as 50 μg l but unsafe with respect to mn mn more than 0 4 mg l hasan and ali 2010 a very towering concentration of mn in gw was reported from the jashore district shaibur et al 2012a shaibur et al 2019a b shaibur et al 2021c but stumpy concentration was reported from some parts of gopalganj district shaibur and howlader 2020 3 4 zink concentration and distribution zinc concentration ranges from 0 004 to 1 70 mg l with the average value of 0 06 mg l fig 3c zinc is more or less unvaryingly scattered in the study area fig 4c higher value was observed in only some samples in innermost part of the study area which ranges from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l fig 4c the entire values of zn concentrations in gw samples were inside who and bangladesh drinking water quality standard the who average value is 3 0 mg l and bangladesh average value is 5 0 mg l who 1984 bndwqs 2011 islam 2014 zinc occurs unsurprisingly in soil at the concentration of nearly 70 0 mg kg 1 in earth crust davies and jones 1988 but in up to date time zn concentration is escalating due to anthropogenic activities industries deposit mammoth quantities of zn enriched toxic waste to environment which slowly but surely amplify its concentration in soil sediment and gw another imperative aspect is that zn is effortlessly bio accumulate in aquatic organism living in zn contaminated water bodies it is also bio magnified through food chain water soluble zn is capable to percolate to aquifer and contaminate the gw table greaney 2005 zinc is an indispensable trace element for human health and its paucity can cause birth defects to fresh borne babies fortunately drinking water contains assured amounts of zn which helps to meet its deficiencies wuana and okieimen 2011 who 2001 3 5 copper concentration and distribution the entire water sample contained negligible concentration of cu which ranges from 0 002 to 0 073 mg l fig 3d the average value of cu 0 02 mg cu l 1 indicated that best part of the water samples feels right to lower limit approved by who 2 0 mg l the cu concentration was consistently scattered along the study area fig 4d the most significant fact was that all samples were within bangladesh and who drinking water quality standard fig 4d the who recommended the highest allowable concentration of cu in drinking water is 2 0 mg l who 1984 shaibur et al 2012a mostafa et al 2017 bangladesh standard limit value is 1 0 mg l bndwqs 2011 shaibur 2019 shaibur et al 2019a b d the bndwqs 2009 represent that nearly 100 of gw sample contains lesser concentration of cu as compared to who and bangladesh standard bndwqs 2011 who 1984 the concentration of cu in stw water was 0 08 mg l and in dtw water was 0 39 mg l in rajshahi city mostafa et al 2017 bdl in gopalganj and jashore municipality shaibur et al 2012a 2021c shaibur and howlader 2020 and in just campus shaibur et al 2019a stumpy concentration of cu is indispensable for human beings but higher concentration of cu is toxic excess accumulation of cu in human body can cause hemolytic anemia hepatic cirrhosis and degeneration of the basal ganglia harris and gitlin 1996 copper is an indispensable trace element which shows a significant role in the biochemistry of all living organisms for humans it is fundamental for production of blood haemoglobin in plants it s important for disease resistance seed production and regulation of water bremner and beattie 1990 martınez and motto 2000 3 6 principal component analysis the pca was performed to ascertain factors that contribute twords the metal pollution source allocation and concentration table 4 the significant pc number were preferred depending on varimax rotation with kaiser normalisation by means of eigenvalues 1 two pc e g pc 1 pc 2 have eigenvalues 1 representing 57 07 total variance of the data set for data interpretation the component loading factor 0 6 was considered singh et al 2017 the foremost pc 1 represented 36 236 of entire variance and towering positive loding value of as 0 889 and fe 0 737 indicating that as and fe in the samples originated from the alike mineral sources while mn 0 689 shows towering negative loading value table 4 signifying that as and mn didn t originite from alike minerals source the second pc 2 accounted for 20 834 of entire variance and confidently correlated with zn 0 702 and cu 0 731 table 2 indicating that both heavy metal originate from same mineral sources 3 7 health risk assessment of metal exposure ingestion of heavy metals was painstaking for both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessment the hra of heavy metal in drinking water for adult and child were located in table 5 and table 6 for both adult and child the utmost ingestion was found for as and the lowest was for zn table 5 the hq or non cancer risk is assessed by dividing the total ingestion by corresponding rfd mg kg day the study showed that the highest mean hq value of as for adult was 4 359 and the maximum value was 27 315 table 5 both the values were in high risk while in the case of child the mean and the highest hq values of as were 6 935 and 57 94 respectively table 5 from the hq values presented in table 5 it can be concluded that the contribution of five heavy meatls to health risk was in the order of as fe mn cu zn an additional essential fact was that to estimate the total potential non carcinogenic impacts induced by more than one metal the hq computed for each metal is summerized and expressed as hi usepa 2004 shams et al 2020 for adults the mean hi value through ingestion was 5 499 while the highest hi value was 30 837 again for child the mean hi value through ingestion was 9 354 while the highest value was 65 414 table 5 the previous research computed four risk categories depending on hi value those are i negligible risk hi 0 1 ii low risk hi 0 1 1 0 iii moderate risk hi 1 0 4 0 and iv high risk hi 4 0 mohammadi et al 2019 2020 bodrud doza et al 2016 2019 considering the hi value it can be concluded that the health of the resident s in the study area is in under high non carcinogenic risk as the value is greater than 4 for carcinogenic risk appraisal only as was painstaking as this metalloid can potentially boost up the risk of cancer to humans long term contact to stumpy concentration of this metalloid can generate unusual types of cancer which is computed by using ilcr the ilcr is defined as the incremental probablity of a person mounting any type of cancer over a lifetime as a results of 24 h per day exposure to a given amount daily of a carcinogenic element for seventy years sultana et al 2017 the mean ilcr value for adults was 1 31 10 3 while for child the value was 1 16 10 3 table 6 depending on ilcr index value there were five computed carcinogenic risk categories e g 1 very low 10 6 2 low 10 6 10 5 3 medium 10 5 10 4 4 high 10 4 10 3 and 5 very high 10 3 bortey sam et al 2015 tepanosyan et al 2017 considering the designed and obtained value the current research demonstrated that there was a very high cancer risk of residence through the cumulative ingestion of drinking water in the study area therefore people are advised not to use gw as the drinking water they must use other sources for drinking purpose 4 conclusions and recommendations the mean concentration of as in gw was 41 μg l and about 53 of water samples exceeded who drinking water quality standard however about 25 of water samples exceeded the bangladesh recommended value the mean concentration of fe in gw sample was 5 58 mg l manganese concentration in gw sample was very high along the study area and it ranged from 0 03 to 0 94 mg l considering the mn about 25 exceeded who standard but about 78 of water samples exceeded the bangladesh standard of drinking water quality the correlation matrix and pca results showed that as has a significantly positive correlation with fe while significantly negative correlation with mn the spatial distribution showed that as concentration gradually increased along the western part of the area but mn concentration decreased gradually the entire water samples along the study area contain negligible concentration of cu and zn majority of the water samples were unsuitable for drinking in terms of as and mn concentration the pca results showed that as and fe originate from same mineral source the research also represented a high non carcinogenic risk and very high cancer risk of the residence

complicated system was used to quantify heavy metals presented in groundwater in the south central part of bangladesh contaminates in tube well water are related in a straight line with human health hazard the study was designed to scrutinize heavy metal concentrations in 170 groundwater samples collected from densely settled area of gopalganj district bangladesh the samples were collected from 96 no fukra kurulia and kandi tilchara mouza the study represents that the highest arsenic concentration was 260 μg l iron was 17 21 mg l manganese was 0 94 mg l zinc was 1 71 mg l and copper was 0 07 mg l the end result evidently showed that almost 5 0 times elevated arsenic concentration 17 0 times higher iron concentration 9 0 times elevated manganese concentration were found in the study area as compared to standard value approved by bangladesh the peak concentration of arsenic was found in kandi tilchchara mouza which was along the bank of madhumati river the spatial distribution showed that arsenic concentration was relatively towering in kandi tilchchara mouza majority of water sources were unsuitable for drinking and cooking in terms of arsenic and manganese concentrations the

sweden he organized a discussion meeting on pixe in 1980s where the details of the system were shared and discussed johansson and campbell 1988 important findings on pixe were published in different referred journals or books international journal on pixe was in print for the earliest time in 1991 since then it is being published constantly the clash of charged particles with atoms makes the atomic inner shell electrons ionized and produce characteristics of x rays this observable fact is called pixe the expertise was developed by bombarding target atoms with weighty charged particles which produce the characteristics of x rays of the target atoms the protons and α particles are universally used in pixe system johansson et al 1970 similar to electron bombardment the x ray energy spectrum obtained continuous heavy charged particle bombardment habitually the pixe system is applied for testing rare earth elements in very low concentration this short of analysis has universal application in environmental pollution agriculture biology fisheries medicine chemistry industry archeology criminology and searches for mineral assets ishii 2019 the ongoing research used pixe for quantification of heavy metals in gw of south central part of bangladesh more specifically this was used to find out the presence of low concentration of targeted heavy metals in drinking water to determine their impacts on human health of the densely populated area water is mostly needed compounds for all forms of living beings in the globe vanloon and duffy 2017 among the all supply water

500 ml plastic bottles were cleaned with tap water and detergent the bottles were then socked in 0 1 n hno3 for 24 h the bottles were rewashed with tap water and distilled water and finally oven dried at 55 c for overnight a total of 170 tube well water samples were randomly composed from 3 mouza namely 96 no fukra kandi tilchhara and kuralia of fukra union under kashiani upazila bangladesh fig 1a b c water was collected in 500 ml potable plastic pot the bottles were prewashed properly with sample water during sampling to avoid plausible contamination firstly tube wells were pumped precise times with respect to the depth of the aquifer in feet i e a 50 feet tube well was initially pumped for 50 times and the water samples were collected the water samples were preserved by fallowing standard methods apha 1995 the samples were digested with strenuous hno3 to eliminate potential complex formation agent present in the water sample srikanth 2013 the same volume was made with distilled water after digestion accuracy and precession were performed in every case 2 3 use of pixe for sample analysis the concentration of as fe mn zn and cu were quantified with the pixe system at the nishine memorial cyclotron center of japan takizawa iwate prefecture japan the pixe system has the aptitude of quantifying plentiful elements instantaneously the arrangement employs proton accelerated by cyclotron and the extent of the elements can be quantified by the strength of reflecting x ray the detection limit of as was 10 ng g 10 ppb an aggregate of 20 μg l indium normal solution was mixed with the water specimen as an indoor standard and was well homogenized targets for proton beam were outfitted by tumbling the sample solutions of 20 μl onto a 4 0 μm thick prolene film and dried up at room temperature target objects were bombarded with 2 9 mevproton beam extracted from a tiny sized cyclotron mcy1750 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan and emitted x rays were deliberated through 2 si li detectors instantaneously a 500 μm thick mylar film was applied as the x ray absorber for every target beam spot size was 6 mm in diameter distinctive beam current was 80 na and detection time was 5 0 10 0 min spectrum scrutiny was conducted by using a computer code sapix 2 sera and futatsugawa 1996 shaibur et al 2012b an extra meticulous description of the beam line and measuring technique was described in the literature sera et al 1992 2 4 principal component analysis the pca procedure is applied to convert the primary data set into a lesser set consists of uncorrelated factors without losing momentous information jiang et al 2015 the pca uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors related to the variance matrix to come up with pcs by multiplying the initial correlate variables by the eigenvector the pcs having eigenvalue greater than 1 0 was considered for the interpretation of the data set kibria et al 2016 in case of heavy metal pollution pca established factors help to identify metal pollution sources and distribution concentration and also metal pollution composition five heavy metals or metalloids e g as fe mn zn and cu were analyzed in this research khelif and boudoukha 2018 kibria et al 2016 2 5 health risk assessment of metal exposure 2 5 1 chronic risk assessment the hra of all grave metals or metalloids is routinely supported quantification of the danger level and is expressed in terms of cancer or non carcinogenic health risk usepa 2009 the 2 principal toxicity risk factors evaluated square measure the sf for matel risk characterization and also the rfd for non carcinogen risk characterization lim et al 2008 for this assessment the oral exposure pathway was considered the cdi of heavy metal via ingestion was deliberated by using equation 1 wu et al 2009 karim 2011 1 c d i o r a l c i f e f e d b w a t where cdioral chronic daily intake mg kg day via oral ingestion c concentration of trace element in gw μg

assessment the hq was computed as the ratio of cdi and rfd for a heavy metal typically the hq represents the non carcinogenic risk which was calculated by using equation 2 usepa 1989 2 h q c d i r f d where hq hazard quotient unit less cdi chronic daily intake mg kg day via oral ingestion and rfd is the reference doze mg kg day the rfd originates from risk based concentration table provided by usepa usepa 2001 the overall potential for non carcinogenic effects of more than one chemical is calculated by using equation 3 the calculated hq value for each chemical is summed and expressed as hi usepa 1989 3 h i h q 1 h q 2 h q 3 h q n the subsequent categories of chronic risk assessment were set by preceding studies simeonov et al 2003 muhammad et al 2011 a negligible risk where the hi or hq are 0 1 b low risk where the hi or hq are 0 1 1 0 c moderate risk where the hi or hq are 1 0 4 0 d high risk where the hi or hq are 4 0 2 5 3 carcinogenic risk assessment carcinogenic risk of an individual arises from the incremental exposure of a potential carcinogen over a lifetime it is responsible for developing cancer cell rahman et al 2018 bodrud doza et al 2019 for calculating linear

of trace elements are presented in table 2 the acceptable limit is treated at 1 10 6 this means that due to the consequence of the exposure approximately 1 0 person per 1 000 000 has the probability to develop cancer lim et al 2008 the acceptable risk generally considered from 1 10 6 1 10 4 usepa 1992 yang et al 2012 2 6 statistical analysis the obtained results were statistically analyzed by using spss version 20 0 the spatial analysis tools of arcgis 10 5 were applied to analyze the spatial variation of heavy metal in gw for interpolating the point data in surface map inverse distance weighted algorithm was used singh et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic concentration and distribution arsenic concentration ranges from 0 0 to 260 μg l with the average concentration of 40 50 μg l fig 2 a high concentration of as is common in shallow aquifer at the depth ranging from 15 to 75 m in low laying coastal region of faridpur trough hatiya trough and barisal chandpur high khalequzzaman et al 2005 however deep aquafer water is safe both for as and microbial contamination saha et al 2018 2019 the who recommended value for as in drinking water is 10 μg l who 1984 while the bangladesh standard recommended value is 50 μg l doe 1997 ahmad and khan 2015 about 53 of water samples exceed who drinking water quality standard and about 25 exceed bangladesh drinking water quality standard the higher concentration of as was most probably due to the fact that the samples were collected from the village situated on the bank of the madhumati river shaibur 2019 the madhumati river is directly connected with the padma river the study site is also not so far from west bengal india it is alleged that as may come from the fe mine of west bengal the mine is connected with pandma river the name padma is in bangladesh and ganga is in west bengal the madhumati river is the most important distributaries of padma river therefore it is believed that as might come from the fe mine and distributed along the river bank of the padma and lastly it came in the madhumati river and finally distribute along the bank of the river this supposition needs to be verified with extensive research arsenic exists universally in the environment all rocks soil water air and biological tissus both in solid and liquid phases it shows both metallic and non metallic properties in nature train 1979 nearly 150 speies of as bearing minerals are found in nature but arsenopyrite is branded as the leading source of as pollution in bangladesh fazal et al 2001 the bengal basin bangladesh is largely located is formed by the deposition of gbm river system during the pleistocene and holocene era mammoth amounts of as containing sediments was deposited to form this sedimentary basin the sediments originated from the himalayas and carried out by gbm river system these sediments act as the primary source for leaching of as to gw aquifers in the deposited quarter of holocene alluvium previously the exact geochemical process of as leaching into gw is not fully understood however three distinctive mechanisms were recommended in elucidation the process firstly the as is unconfined into the gw due to oxidation of arsenical pyrites minerals in the alluvial sediments the atmospheric oxygen enters into the lower aquifers during excessive withdrawal of gw through stw and dtw and might help arsenical pyrites to oxidize secondly microbic metabolism of organic substances within the aquifer resulting in hypoxia conditions which ultimately causes for reduction of fe oxyhydroxides feooh and subsequently release the sorbed as into the gw thirdly as adsorbed in aquifer minerals might be dislocated into the solution by competitive exchange of phosphorus and might contaminate the gw excess use of phosphate fertilizer may be responsible for the displacement of as from the sorbed site of soil particles islam and islam 2010 safiuddin et al 2011 ahmad et al 2018 among the similar ions present in soils po4 3 is the main competitor of as iii and as v adsorption onto fe oxyhydroxide biswas et al 2014 however the latest hypothesis is that in soils as is combined in the authigenically settled sulfides sediments in reduced condition ahmed et al 2004 and the geochemistry of fe and po4 3 in soil sediments is controlled by the presence of siderite and vivianite ahmed et al 2004 therefore reductive disbanding of fe oxyhydroxide existing as the cover of sand grains and altered mica biotite controlled the governing factors are predicted as the prime mechanism of as release into gw in the sandy aquifer of the study area nickson et al 2000 ahmed et al 2004 zheng et al 2004 again the gw as comes from the different sources e g magmatic arcs e g andes or ancient e g himalaya continental convergent margins of the utmost projecting orogenic systems throughout the globe and eventually it is ended up in secondary source sediments in connecting with foreland or related basins which eventually perform as aquifers mukherjee et al 2019 the aggressive affiliation between phosphorus and as is existed in nature asher and reay 1979 shaibur et al 2013 it is suspected that all those phenomena are reviled in the study area resulting in higher concentration of as in gw arsenic concentration ranges from 0 37 to 2 5 nmol kg was reported from gw of carrizo sand aquifer in texas usa haque and johannesson 2006 the key fact is that the perceptible impacts of as are more recurrent at concentration of 200 μg l halim et al 2009 bndwqs 2011 arsenic concentration data throughout bangladesh are exceedingly patchy in spatial and temporal scale shaibur 2019 shaibur and howlader 2020 the allotment of as in bengal basin principally depends on the geology of the upstream section and land use pattern of the catchment area ahmed et al 2004 also depends on the core river system that carries and distributes sediments and anthropogenic waste along the catchment area khalequzzaman et al 2005 some studies showed that ganges delta plains contain a sediment layer rich in as compound at the depth of 20 80 m this layer is exceedingly enriched with arseno pyrite minerals that originated from the granitic and metamorphic source location of the himalayas safiuddin et al 2011 the greater parts of natives of rustic bangladesh were exaggerated by arsenicosis through consumption of as contaminated stw water shallow tube well at the depth of 150 m is the source of as in drinking water in bangladesh haque 2018 arsenic can also come from as contaminated cooked food or crops cultivated with as enriched gw khan et al 2010 high concentration of as in drinking water or in food may cause different types of skin diseases like hyperkeratosis melanosis hyper pigmentation keratosis leuco melanosis dastgiri et al 2010 pigmentation changes hypertension and cardiovascular disorder rezaei et al 2019 similar to as pd is also sometimes responsible for creating some problems in human body the literature showed that exposure to pb is severely poisonous to human s and can create severe problems for example irritability abdominal pain headache nerve damages brain kidney and liver damage lung cancer stomach cancer blood pressure disturbance of behavior reproductive impairment together with anemia rezaei et al 2019 the above discussion demonstrated that the as came in the gw from different sources and through different mechanisms the current upshot showed that similar to different sources and mechanisms the distribution of as in gw in the study area was not homogenous in the present study the spatial distribution data of as showed that the as concentration in the majority areas ranged from 10 to 50 μg l and the higher value was observed in south western part fig 2b this area falls under kandi tilchhara mouza which is along the sedimentary basin of madhumati river it was suspected that madhumati river might be mostly responsible for higher concentration of as in the kandi tilchhara mouza the lower concentration of as in the other parts of the study area might be the distance from madhumati river the result suggested that the people of kandi tilchchara mouza should not drink the stw because samples of this mouza contained very high concentration of as this result is also informative for the people living on the bank of madhumati river extensive research along the river madhumati regarding the presence of as in gw is strongly recommended 3 2 iron concentration and distribution iron concentation along the study area ranged from 0 16 to 17 21 mg l while the mean value was 5 58 mg l fig 3 a the present upshot revealed that the gw of the research spot contained very towering concentration of fe bangladesh prescribed value of fe in drinking water is 0 03 1 0 mg l bndwqs 2011 in bangladesh the avreage concentration of fe in stw water was 2 56 mg l and in dtw water the value was 1 37 mg l bndwqs 2011 but various individual studies reported to have towering concentration of fe in some specific areas and most of the cases it was due to anthropogenic input the highest concentration of fe in gw 28 9 mg l was detected in an arsenical stw water of chuadanga nahar et al 2014 high concentration of fe was also reported from jashore municipality shaibur et al 2021c but the ingestion of high concentration of fe doesn t have any major health impact however some reports showed that towering concentration fe in drinking water can cause diabetes anemia and also heart disease toyokuni 2009 iron is one of the most ample trace elements found in earth crust but fe defeciancy is a global concern quintero gutiérrez et al 2008 the fe concentrtion in the samples were not uniform in all parts of the sampling area the spatial distribution of fe showed that the concentration of fe was relatively higher in south western part which is along the bank of madhumati river fig 4 a the upshot recommended that people of the study area must be alert regarding the high concentration of fe present in the gw more specifically among the study area the people of the kandi tilchchra mouza must be conscious about excessive fe in gw arsenic concentration was also higher in this region fig 2b a strong correlation between fe and as was found in this study table 3 therefore combined bad impact of fe and as might be possible in kandi tilchchara mouza however the corellation between as and fe was negigible in the water samples in some parts of gopalgnj district shaibur and howlader 2020 the affiliation between other elements were not so inspiring in this research table 3 3 3 manganese concentration and distribution the concentration of mn in collected sample ranges from 0 025 to 0 944 mg l with the representative value of 0 344 mg l fig 3b nearly 78 of water samples exceeded bangladesh drinking water quality standard and nearly 25 exceeded who standard value it was reported that mn concentration in the gw varied from 0 001 to 9 98 mg l with the mean value of 0 554 mg l hasan and ali 2010 the bangladesh standard for mn in drinking water is 0 01 mg l and 27 of tube well was within this limit a similar report showed that about 59 of gw samples were within who drinking water quality standard hasan and ali 2010 up to now we came to know that the premier value of mn in drinking water of bangladesh was reported from singair upazila of manikganj district halim et al 2009 2014 ingestion of towering concentration of mn in drinking water causes ruthless diseases like hallucination disorientation memory impairment and emotional instability hasan et al 2019 a study in greece reported that ingestion of 1 8 mg l of mn along with drinking water can cause neurological disordering hasan et al 2019 manganese is an essential element and it is found in every animal species tested yet but its distribution in gw varies with place to place goldhaber et al 2003 the spatial distribution represents that mn concentration gradually decreased to south western part fig 4b manganese has a significantly negative correlation with as table 3 the south western part belongs to kandi tilchchra mouza and along the madhumati river several studies reported that mn distribution generally does not correspond to that of as this meant that gw with acceptable concentration of as may not have acceptable concentration of mn in bangladesh about 32 of tube wells are safe with respect to as 50 μg l but unsafe with respect to mn mn more than 0 4 mg l hasan and ali 2010 a very towering concentration of mn in gw was reported from the jashore district shaibur et al 2012a shaibur et al 2019a b shaibur et al 2021c but stumpy concentration was reported from some parts of gopalganj district shaibur and howlader 2020 3 4 zink concentration and distribution zinc concentration ranges from 0 004 to 1 70 mg l with the average value of 0 06 mg l fig 3c zinc is more or less unvaryingly scattered in the study area fig 4c higher value was observed in only some samples in innermost part of the study area which ranges from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l fig 4c the entire values of zn concentrations in gw samples were inside who and bangladesh drinking water quality standard the who average value is 3 0 mg l and bangladesh average value is 5 0 mg l who 1984 bndwqs 2011 islam 2014 zinc occurs unsurprisingly in soil at the concentration of nearly 70 0 mg kg 1 in earth crust davies and jones 1988 but in up to date time zn concentration is escalating due to anthropogenic activities industries deposit mammoth quantities of zn enriched toxic waste to environment which slowly but surely amplify its concentration in soil sediment and gw another imperative aspect is that zn is effortlessly bio accumulate in aquatic organism living in zn contaminated water bodies it is also bio magnified through food chain water soluble zn is capable to percolate to aquifer and contaminate the gw table greaney 2005 zinc is an indispensable trace element for human health and its paucity can cause birth defects to fresh borne babies fortunately drinking water contains assured amounts of zn which helps to meet its deficiencies wuana and okieimen 2011 who 2001 3 5 copper concentration and distribution the entire water sample contained negligible concentration of cu which ranges from 0 002 to 0 073 mg l fig 3d the average value of cu 0 02 mg cu l 1 indicated that best part of the water samples feels right to lower limit approved by who 2 0 mg l the cu concentration was consistently scattered along the study area fig 4d the most significant fact was that all samples were within bangladesh and who drinking water quality standard fig 4d the who recommended the highest allowable concentration of cu in drinking water is 2 0 mg l who 1984 shaibur et al 2012a mostafa et al 2017 bangladesh standard limit value is 1 0 mg l bndwqs 2011 shaibur 2019 shaibur et al 2019a b d the bndwqs 2009 represent that nearly 100 of gw sample contains lesser concentration of cu as compared to who and bangladesh standard bndwqs 2011 who 1984 the concentration of cu in stw water was 0 08 mg l and in dtw water was 0 39 mg l in rajshahi city mostafa et al 2017 bdl in gopalganj and jashore municipality shaibur et al 2012a 2021c shaibur and howlader 2020 and in just campus shaibur et al 2019a stumpy concentration of cu is indispensable for human beings but higher concentration of cu is toxic excess accumulation of cu in human body can cause hemolytic anemia hepatic cirrhosis and degeneration of the basal ganglia harris and gitlin 1996 copper is an indispensable trace element which shows a significant role in the biochemistry of all living organisms for humans it is fundamental for production of blood haemoglobin in plants it s important for disease resistance seed production and regulation of water bremner and beattie 1990 martınez and motto 2000 3 6 principal component analysis the pca was performed to ascertain factors that contribute twords the metal pollution source allocation and concentration table 4 the significant pc number were preferred depending on varimax rotation with kaiser normalisation by means of eigenvalues 1 two pc e g pc 1 pc 2 have eigenvalues 1 representing 57 07 total variance of the data set for data interpretation the component loading factor 0 6 was considered singh et al 2017 the foremost pc 1 represented 36 236 of entire variance and towering positive loding value of as 0 889 and fe 0 737 indicating that as and fe in the samples originated from the alike mineral sources while mn 0 689 shows towering negative loading value table 4 signifying that as and mn didn t originite from alike minerals source the second pc 2 accounted for 20 834 of entire variance and confidently correlated with zn 0 702 and cu 0 731 table 2 indicating that both heavy metal originate from same mineral sources 3 7 health risk assessment of metal exposure ingestion of heavy metals was painstaking for both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessment the hra of heavy metal in drinking water for adult and child were located in table 5 and table 6 for both adult and child the utmost ingestion was found for as and the lowest was for zn table 5 the hq or non cancer risk is assessed by dividing the total ingestion by corresponding rfd mg kg day the study showed that the highest mean hq value of as for adult was 4 359 and the maximum value was 27 315 table 5 both the values were in high risk while in the case of child the mean and the highest hq values of as were 6 935 and 57 94 respectively table 5 from the hq values presented in table 5 it can be concluded that the contribution of five heavy meatls to health risk was in the order of as fe mn cu zn an additional essential fact was that to estimate the total potential non carcinogenic impacts induced by more than one metal the hq computed for each metal is summerized and expressed as hi usepa 2004 shams et al 2020 for adults the mean hi value through ingestion was 5 499 while the highest hi value was 30 837 again for child the mean hi value through ingestion was 9 354 while the highest value was 65 414 table 5 the previous research computed four risk categories depending on hi value those are i negligible risk hi 0 1 ii low risk hi 0 1 1 0 iii moderate risk hi 1 0 4 0 and iv high risk hi 4 0 mohammadi et al 2019 2020 bodrud doza et al 2016 2019 considering the hi value it can be concluded that the health of the resident s in the study area is in under high non carcinogenic risk as the value is greater than 4 for carcinogenic risk appraisal only as was painstaking as this metalloid can potentially boost up the risk of cancer to humans long term contact to stumpy concentration of this metalloid can generate unusual types of cancer which is computed by using ilcr the ilcr is defined as the incremental probablity of a person mounting any type of cancer over a lifetime as a results of 24 h per day exposure to a given amount daily of a carcinogenic element for seventy years sultana et al 2017 the mean ilcr value for adults was 1 31 10 3 while for child the value was 1 16 10 3 table 6 depending on ilcr index value there were five computed carcinogenic risk categories e g 1 very low 10 6 2 low 10 6 10 5 3 medium 10 5 10 4 4 high 10 4 10 3 and 5 very high 10 3 bortey sam et al 2015 tepanosyan et al 2017 considering the designed and obtained value the current research demonstrated that there was a very high cancer risk of residence through the cumulative ingestion of drinking water in the study area therefore people are advised not to use gw as the drinking water they must use other sources for drinking purpose 4 conclusions and recommendations the mean concentration of as in gw was 41 μg l and about 53 of water samples exceeded who drinking water quality standard however about 25 of water samples exceeded the bangladesh recommended value the mean concentration of fe in gw sample was 5 58 mg l manganese concentration in gw sample was very high along the study area and it ranged from 0 03 to 0 94 mg l considering the mn about 25 exceeded who standard but about 78 of water samples exceeded the bangladesh standard of drinking water quality the correlation matrix and pca results showed that as has a significantly positive correlation with fe while significantly negative correlation with mn the spatial distribution showed that as concentration gradually increased along the western part of the area but mn concentration decreased gradually the entire water samples along the study area contain negligible concentration of cu and zn majority of the water samples were unsuitable for drinking in terms of as and mn concentration the pca results showed that as and fe originate from same mineral source the research also represented a high non carcinogenic risk and very high cancer risk of the residence

11857,solar distillation is one of the cheapest and lowest energy consuming desalination processes to produce potable drinking water the main obstacle of desalination process is the low production rate of fresh water owing to slow evaporation and condensation rate of the system in this experiment a double slope solar still ss is modified by using two different modified absorber plates and an external copper condenser ecc absorber plates are modified by employing triangular and rectangular channels as they increase surface area of the absorber plates to increase heat transfer to the basin water and hence increase evaporation rate of water ecc is designed in such a way that provides extended cool surface area in addition with glass surface to increase condensation rate experiments are done in the month of october for 7 days and comparative analysis is done to determine the best modification out of the 5 modifications conventional ss ss with triangular channeled tc with and without ecc and ss with rectangular channeled rc with and without ecc in terms of productivity and efficiency the maximum average productivity obtained among all the modifications is 1 7 0 1 l m2 while experimenting with ss with tc absorber plates and ecc the maximum average overall efficiency and maximum average instantaneous efficiency both are obtained with ss with tc and ecc which are 17 86 0 6 and 18 2 1 6 respectively addition of ecc increased the average productivity by 0 66 l m2 and overall efficiency by 7 52 than conventional ss the economic analysis of the sss is also conducted and results represent that the modified sss are approximately 55 57 cost effective than the conventional ss graphical abstract image 1 keywords double slope solar still modified absorber plates external

survival of human beings now a days use of fresh water has been growing in developed and undeveloped countries and number of regions with barren ground is increasing with more demand for fresh water supply abdelal and taamneh 2017 about 70 of total area of the earth is covered by water among them 97 is saline seawater and another 2 is locked up as frozen in the polar ice region only 1 is accessible for carrying out our demands of water for survival el sebaii et al 2015 hassan et al 2019 yousef and hassan 2019 therefore demand of potable water is increasing rapidly by degrees and at the same time the accessibility of fresh water is reducing in time that creates water crisis saini et al 2019 around 3 5 million people die every year due to waterborne diseases sampathkumar et al 2010 this situation has been driven the technologies to focus on providing fresh water at a faster rate for producing large scale of freshwater various techniques are followed such as membrane water distillation multiple effect water distillation multi stage water distillation and reverse osmosis distillation however all these techniques are depended on fossil fuel as they require large motors and pumps to attain high pressure of water which need continuous supply of constant energy that can t be possible to attain by other sources of renewable energy dsilva et al 2016 these desalination methods cause various environmental troubles such as production of waste water that contains nitrogen and phosphorus and increasing use of fossil fuel contributes to greenhouse effect us epa 2022 using renewable energy such as solar distillation is the best way to avoid those environmental problems yousef et al 2019 solar distillation is a simple process which depends on non conventional energy solar energy and it is very cost effective process to produce fresh potable water panchal and patel 2017 in this process ss converts the salty or brackish water into potable water through evaporation and condensation processes by using solar energy as primary source of energy keshtkar et al 2020 solar energy is one of major types of sustainable energy which is environmentally friendly and cost effective compared to any other conventional energy sources for producing potable water but in the traditional stills continuous production of fresh water at same rate is sometimes found difficult for the irregular solar intensity during different hours of day as well as thermal loss through the body of ss so to enhance the productivity of the simple ss researchers around the world have worked and researched about different modification of solar desalination system this has been achieved by establishment of various modifications in the designs of sss or improvement of different parameters of the design such as single slope solar still with nano phase change material kumar et al 2021 double slope ss modifications gnanaraj and velmurugan 2019 kaviti et al 2021 pyramid ss al madhhachi and smaisim 2021 prakash and jayaprakash 2020 saravanavel et al 2020 tilted wick type ss hansen et al 2015 janarthanan et al 2006 mahdi et al 2011 sharon et al 2017 shubhajyothi et al 2020 inclined type ss sadineni et al 2008 samuel et al 2021 fins bataineh and abbas 2020 jani and modi 2019 panchal et al 2020 and so on a double slope solar still dsss is very familiar and commonly recognized design to the ss researchers a dsss is found more efficient than single slope ss because dsss can capture maximum solar irradiation from both east and west direction during different hours of the day and aids in producing higher fresh water output compared to single slope ss tiwari and singh 1991 kabeel and abdelgaied 2020 conducted an experimental investigation where they reported that the use of 25 mm graphite absorber plate with cooling the glass cover accelerates the daily efficiency of the modified pyramid shaped ss by 97 2 98 9 as compared to a traditional pyramid shaped ss a ss was fabricated with different design absorber plate configurations under normal climatic condition samuel and murugavel 2017 according to the experimental analysis it was found that 74 5 productivity increased for ss coupled with fin shaped absorber plate kabeel et al 2017a carried out an experiment integrating nanoparticle coated absorber plate they mixed the cuprous oxide nanoparticle with black paint the application of nanoparticle boosted the distillate output by 16 25 in comparison to the conventional ss an experiment was conducted with same sized sss using different energy absorbing materials in it for six months of time interval the main purpose of that experiment was to observe the effect of different energy absorbing materials on distillate output of ss the use of energy absorbing material not only increased the distillate output of a ss at the day time but also night time black rocks were found to be 20 more productive than any other energy absorbing material dwivedi and tiwari 2010 shanmugan et al 2018 experimented with a wick type ss with al2o3 nanoparticles on cotton wick fin with cotton wick jute wick and fin with jute wick as the basin liner during both summer and winter days they launched that the productivity was higher for fin with cotton wick and provided 7 46 and 4 12 kg m2 day for summer and winter respectively a comparative performance test for the sss employing different absorber plates such as aluminum plate and galvanized iron plate was conducted and compared with the conventional ss at the same climatic condition panchal 2011 ss with aluminum plate was found to attain the highest productivity a modified pyramid ss was designed with the absorber plate made of carbon particles nanomaterial modified epoxy composites by abdelal and taamneh 2017 it was found that adding 5 to 2 5 of carbon nanotubes to the carbon particle epoxy composite enhanced the productivity about 109 and 65 respectively yousef et al 2019 analyzed the performance of single slope ss using hollow cylindrical pin fins and steel wool fibers as the absorbing materials they reported that the feed water output increased by 16 and 25 for hollow cylindrical pin fins and steel wool fibers respectively as compared to the conventional ss moreover to increase the vapor condensation process there are two common measures such as reducing the glass cover temperature or addition of internal external condenser an et al 2018 monowe et al 2011 proposed a new design integrated with an external reflecting booster and an outside condenser they concluded that the efficiency of this system will around 77 if preheated saline water is used for domestic purpose and it could be raised up to 83 if the warm water is supplied to the still till night time numerical and experimental analyses were conducted on the effect of condensation area on natural circulation loop ncp ss feature where maximum daily output can be reached up to 4 73 and 2 71 kg m2 under summer and winter condition respectively rahmani and boutriaa 2017 the performance of different modification of identical sss with heating cooling and nano fluid was examined where they reported that the contribution of external condenser enhances 26 3 of total output parsa et al 2020 tuly et al 2021 examined the effect of external condenser in a double sloped ss with fin pcm and wick material and observed that the freshwater yield of modified ss was approximately 10 higher than the conventional ss for using external condenser from the above literature study it is evident that a wide range of modifications are trialed for the solar distillation unit by using different auxiliary equipment to examine the outcome of modifications some researchers have experimented with built in condenser and additional equipment where a few researchers studied about the combination of different design of absorber plates and external condenser in correlation with the work completed by tuly et al 2021 similar type of condenser is used in this work applying different dimension and construction method the aim of this experimental study is to enhance the freshwater yield of a double slope ss by employing triangular and rectangular channel absorber plates with an external copper condenser and finally to compare the results with the conventional ss once for all a cost analysis of the modified ss is introduced to analyze the overall effectiveness of the solar distiller unit economically moreover the time dependent instantaneous efficiencies and overall efficiencies are computed individually for all cases 2 materials and methodology 2 1 solar still design and construction experimental setups were designed and fabricated to test the distillate output for different absorber plates and ecc a photograph of a single pair of modified experimental setup is displayed in fig 1 body of the sss and absorber plates were fabricated from gp sheet with a thickness of 1 mm both the conventional and modified sss have the same dimensions of 1 57 1 016 m2 whereas the elevation of side walls at front and at middle portion were 0 15 and 0 40 m respectively it contained two absorber plates at the bottom on which water was placed for evaporation the side walls and bottom side of the ss body were insulated with 0 3 m cork sheet to reduce heat loss through the walls transparent glasses 4 mm thick having emissivity of 0 95 was used as the cover the whole solar distillate body and condenser surface area was placed at an inclination of 25 with horizontal plane following geographical orientation of rajshahi 24 3636 n 88 6241 e it had dimension of 1 016 0 693 m2 two glasses 0 3556 0 3048 m2 were used to cover the horizontal portions of the sss the modified sss contained specially designed absorber plates tc or rc at each and the conventional ss contained one flat absorber plate at the bottom on which water was placed for evaporation the absorber plates were fabricated with gp sheet held by wooden frames and were incorporated with tc and rc of different shapes increased surface to volume ratio was obtained by introducing different shaped channels in the absorber plates which enhanced the free surface area for water evaporation the tc and rc absorber plates were identical in dimension of 0 889 0 635 m2 and consisted of 70 and 40 channels respectively at beginning of experimental procedure 3 61 10 3 and 3 15 10 3 m3 feed water were supplied to the rc and rc absorber plates until the water depth was 0 1 m the required amount water was supplied after each hour to fill up the evaporated water from the absorber plates to maintain 0 1 m water depth the exposed water surface area was 0 5 m2 to increase the rate of absorption of solar heat flux both the absorber plates were painted black an ecc was placed on the top of the modified sss body fig 1 the ecc is made of hollow copper tube of 6 35 10 3 m in diameter wounded at a shape of compressed coil and it forms the shape of a hollow cylinder of 0 3 m diameter the gaps between the copper tubes were reduced by copper welding the outer surface of the ecc is insulated with polyurethane foam and cloaked with tape to reduce heat loss to the surroundings the bottom portion is insulated with cork sheet the ecc is cooled by the continuous flow of the feed water from the reservoir the feed water passes through the hollow copper conduit of the ecc and preheated by the flat plate solar collector before entering the modified ss 2 2 experimental procedure three different setups conventional tc plate with ecc and rc plate with ecc were tested at the same time and location simultaneously the lay out diagram of the experimental setup is represented in fig 2 at first feed water from the reservoir flew through the copper tube before entering the solar stills the flowing feed water kept the condenser surface temperature around 35 38 c approximately which was below inner glass surface temperature by this way condensation rate was enhanced the water got preheated by the latent heat of condensation the feed water was additionally preheated by the flat plate solar collector fpsc before entering ss preheating the feed water in two stages resulted in enhanced evaporation rate and high distillate output some water vapors were condensed inside the glass cover and rest of them entered into the ecc the condensate output was collected from the ecc and the modified ss unit a pyranometer was mounted beside the experimental setup to estimate the hourly solar intensity on the surface a mercury glass thermometer temperature range from 0 to 100 c was used to measure the ambient temperature of the feed water condensate output water and preheated water from flat plate solar collector custom made data logger ds18b20 digital temperature sensors incorporated with arduino uno showed in fig 2 was used to measure the temperature of absorber plates and basin water inside the condenser humid air temperature and inside glass temperature an infrared thermometer measurement error is about 2 or 4 f was used to measure the outside glass temperature and inside condenser wall temperature during the tests the condensate output was computed hourly using a leveled beaker 200 ml capacity the specific data were recorded hourly from 10 00 to 16 00 h during every experimental day all experiments were done at the rajshahi university of engineering and technology rajshahi bangladesh latitude 24 3636 n 88 6241 e rajshahi region of bangladesh represents a hot climatic condition from march to october the average annual temperature in rajshahi is 25 8 c where the highest temperature in summer is 35 9 c and in winter is 10 2 c the experiment is carried out in october when the average temperature was 27 6 c and the average solar intensity reached 1200 w m2 2 3 error analysis the performance appraisal of the ss is based on the different parameters the measured parameters sometimes involve some errors caused by the method of uncertainty of the measuring instruments this errors or percentage of uncertainty may impact the results velmurugan et al 2008 experimentally evaluated the performance of pyranometer thermocouple thermometer infrared thermometer and measuring beaker in measuring the solar radiation absorber plates temperature basin water

temperature and amount of distillate output the standard uncertainty of the various used instruments was evaluated by using eq 1 rahbar and esfahan 2012 the ranges accuracies standard uncertainty and percentage of errors for the instruments are given in table 1 1 u a 3 where u and a are considered as uncertainty and accuracy of the instrument respectively 2 4 cost analysis of solar distillation unit cost analysis of the solar distillation system can be implemented by the procedure following esfahani et al 2011 the total cost of the ss is calculated for each case the capital recovery factor crf is given by esfahani et al 2011 2 c r f i 1 i n 1 i n 1 where i is considered as annual interest which is 12 and n as the lifetime of the ss can perform which is 10 years srivastava and agrawal 2014 the first annual cost fac is given by esfahani et al 2011 3 f a c c r f p where p is considered as capital cost of the ss the first annual salvage value asv of the ss can be calculated by 4 a s v

output of the ss the cost per liter cpl of the distillate output can be executed by esfahani et al 2011 9 c p l a c m 2 5 solar still efficiency the instantaneous efficiency can be explicated as the ratio of input energy to the output energy at any particular time the instantaneous efficiencies of a solar still is calculated for all considered cases the instantaneous efficiency of the solar still for different cases at respected times is calculated by following formula cooper 1973 10 η i q c w g α w i t where α w is the absorptivity of water per unit area m2 and i t is rate of incident solar energy on the solar still per unit area w m2 the efficiency can be maximized by increasing the output produced this can be achieved by enhancing the conversion of input energy to output energy and minimizing the heat loss for increasing the output an external condenser was also used so the total convective heat transfer coefficient should be also used to calculate the total instantaneous efficiency for the solar still the heat transfer from ecc is similar to glass surface as the only the material changes so eq 10 is modified for ecc 11 so 12 where q c w g h c w g t w t g and q c w c h

water was measured by h t o t a l h o u r m h where m h is the hourly produced feed water 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of temperatures on solar distillation unit 3 1 1 effect of solar irradiation intensity solar irradiation profile study is important for forecasting the amount of distilled water output by a ss it was observed that the solar irradiance increased until 13 00 h and then decreased with time due to the position of sun the irradiance changed within the range of 590 1050 w m2 the evaporation rate varied with the solar radiation which was directly involved for the productivity of the sss maximum solar radiation was observed during 13 00 h during experimental days within the range of 850 1050 w m2 fig 3 a b and c represent the 7 days average of temperatures of basin and basin water of conventional ss ss with tc absorber plates and ecc and ss with rc absorber plates and ecc for all the modifications it was observed that the temperature of basin of the absorber plates and basin water increased with the increase of solar irradiation the average basin temperature for conventional ss ss with tc and ss with rc absorber plates were varied between 49 and 59 52 68 and 51 65 c respectively the average basin water temperature for conventional ss ss with tc and ss with rc absorber plates were varied between 46 and 56 50 66 and 47 61 c respectively maximum average basin and basin water temperature observed were 68 and 66 c both for ss with tc absorber plates around 13 00 h which was during the peak solar radiation time the hourly average ambient temperatures were recorded within the range of 35 38 c for different solar radiation profile during experimental days which were almost same the average outer glass temperature values were also varied following solar radiation profile ranging from 42 to 49 c which remained almost same for all the modifications 3 1 2 effect of different design of absorber plates the hourly average basin water temperature changes for conventional tc and rc absorber plates were within the range of 46 56 51 66 and 47 61 c respectively under same solar radiation profile it was observed that the average basin water temperature for tc absorber plate was 4 5 and 5 10 c higher than the rc absorber plate and conventional solar still respectively this was due to the enhanced surface area of tc absorber plate than other two types of plates which resulted in higher heat transfer rate between the basin and basin water in case of tc absorber plate from fig 3 a and b it was seen that during each hour of experiment under same solar radiation the difference between basin and basin water temperature for ss with tc absorber plate was smaller than rc absorber plate at 13 00 h average basin and basin water temperature were 67 and 65 c for tc absorber plate and difference between the temperatures was 2 c at the same time average basin and basin water temperature was 65 and 61 c for rc absorber plate and difference between the temperatures was 4 c while for conventional ss the average temperature difference between basin and basin water was as much as 7 c this difference in temperature was because of different surface area of the absorber plates the absorber plates with tc and rc had higher surface area than the conventional flat absorber plate the conventional flat absorber plate had the area of 0 5 m2 while tc absorber plate had surface area of 1 093 m2 and rc absorber plate had surface area of 0 85 m2 as the tc absorber plate had the highest surface area it provided the best heat transfer between the absorber plates and basin water so the relative difference between the basin and basin water temperature was smaller than other two modifications eq 12 shows that the instantaneous efficiency would be higher as the difference between basin water temperature and glass inner surface or condenser surface temperature increased the average instantaneous efficiency was observed to be changed with respect to value of tw tg the instantaneous efficiency raised as the value of tw tg increased for all the modifications among all the modifications ss with tc and ecc had the highest average instantaneous efficiency ranging from 12 2 to 18 2 for value of tw tg between 5 and 13 c the reason for higher instantaneous efficiency of the ss with tc and ecc was that the basin water temperature was higher than other modifications due to extra surface area of the tc absorber plates the heat transfer rate was better so higher tw tg value was maintained than other modifications that resulted in higher instantaneous efficiency it was also observed that at lower temperature differences ss with rc and conventional plates showed higher instantaneous efficiency than ss with tc with ecc and without ecc tc with ecc and without ecc showed higher instantaneous efficiency when the value of tw tg was raised higher than 8 c that occurred due to the fact that while using ss with rc and conventional value of tw tg was between 5 and 8 c during peak solar radiation time which was around 13 00 h while for ss with tc with ecc and without ecc 5 8 c temperature difference was observed during early and late hours of day when solar radiation was relatively lower than peak hours during peak solar radiation hours evaporation rate was maximum for each individual modification as the temperature difference of 5 8 c was observed during peak hours for ss with rc and conventional absorber plates they exhibited higher efficiencies than ss with tc while for ss with tc and ecc and without ecc 8 13 c temperature difference region was observed during peak solar radiation hours at peak solar radiation hours maximum temperature differences was observed in respective to all modifications so it seemed that tc with ec and without ecc showed better efficiencies for higher temperature differences while for rc and conventional it was observed for relatively lower temperature differences 3 1 3 effect of external copper condenser it was noticed that the inner glass surface temperature increased gradually until 13 00 h when the solar radiation was at peak for conventional ss ss with tc and ss with rc absorber plates it increased from 42 to 51 45 to 54 and 44 52 c respectively the maximum average value of inner glass surface temperature for using tc rc and flat plate absorber plate were 54 52 and 51 c respectively but at the same time the average temperature for eccs varied between 32 40 and 33 39 c the eccs provided approximately 22 lower surface temperature for condensation than the inner glass surface the reason that the ecc provided lower surface temperature was the continuous flow of feed water temperature 35 38 c through the copper pipe of the condenser coil also due to insulation around the outer surface of the condenser the sunlight couldn t directly incident on the copper surface as a result ecc surface temperature remained cool and didn t increase too much with the increase of solar radiation at peak time there was no cooling system or insulation couldn t be used on glass surface in fact glass surface temperature was subjected to be heated as the solar radiation increased so ecc acted as better condensation unit than the glass surface 3 2 accumulated distillate output and efficiency 3 2 1 effect of absorber plates the accumulated distillate output for employing tc rc and flat plate absorber plates in ss is represented in fig 4 the average accumulated distillate output for tc without ecc rc without ecc and conventional were 1 56 1 14 and 0 97 l day during 7 days the accumulated distillate output for utilizing tc absorber plate was 60 8 higher than flat plate absorber plate and 36 8 higher than rc absorber plate the maximum distillate output was obtained for tc absorber plate because of its higher evaporation rate and better heat transfer characteristics the tc absorber plate had 12 5 higher surface to volume ratio than rc absorber plate more surface area for heat transfer increased the evaporation of feed water as well as productivity of ss 3 2 2 effect of external copper condenser from fig 4 average accumulated distillated output for using tc and rc with ecc and without ecc in modified ss was observed the average output for using tc rc absorber plates without ecc were approximately 1 56 and 1 14 l day respectively while using ecc the output increased to 1 71 and 1 54 l day ecc increased the total output of ss the accumulated output for tc absorber plate with ecc was 9 6 higher than without ecc where this was 35 09 higher for rc absorber plate with ecc than without ecc by adding ecc with glass condensation surface it provided extra 0 18 m2 area cooler than glass surface area for condensation when excess vapor was generated during peak solar radiation that increased the productivity of ss 3 3 efficiency of solar stills the efficiencies of the sss were calculated as instantaneous and overall the average instantaneous efficiencies of 7 experimental days at different hours of sss are represented in fig 5 a it is already established that inner glass surface temperature increased with solar radiation intensity which was usually maximum at 13 00 h and gradually decreased towards last hours of day the instantaneous efficiency depends mainly on solar radiation basin water temperature and the temperature of condensation surface i e glass condenser surface as shown in eq 12 a winded copper coil ecc was used and its effect was tested for both tc and rc absorber plates the maximum average instantaneous efficiency observed for tc without ecc rc without ecc and conventional were 15 5 1 5 13 7 0 7 and 10 5 0 8 at 13 00 h tc without ecc had shown more instantaneous efficiency than other 2 modifications was due to the fact that it had higher temperature of basin water and as a result higher value of tw tg was observed during peak solar radiation hours it was also observed that tc with ecc and rc with ecc showed 2 65 and 3 2 more instantaneous efficiency than experimenting without ecc the reason of the higher instantaneous efficiency while adding ecc was the cooler surface area ecc provided around 32 40 c which was much less than inner glass surface temperature so even higher value of tw tg was obtained while using ecc and hence efficiency increased fig 5 b represents the comparative analysis of overall efficiency of sss for each of the seven experimental days the maximum overall efficiencies were attained by integrating tc with and without ecc in modified ss were 19 and 16 9 respectively and by using rc absorber plate with and without ecc were 17 5 and 15 8 respectively both were obtained on 14 10 2018 when the solar radiation was maximum among 7 experimental days productivity was also maximum that day due to maximum solar radiation as seen from fig 6 eq 13 shows that the overall efficiency depends mainly on accumulated distillate output absorber plate area and total amount of solar radiation during experimental hours so maximum overall efficiency was observed on 14 10 2018 if overall efficiencies of other days were observed it can be seen that overall efficiencies fluctuated as the solar radiation profile on particular days changed the ecc increased the average overall efficiency of tc and rc by 2 09 and 1 94 respectively than while experimenting without ecc when eccs were used with tc and rc the accumulated distillate increased and hence the overall efficiencies of those modifications increased 3 4 productivity of solar stills the equivalent analysis of the productivities of the sss is illustrated in fig 6 the average productivities of conventional ss ss with tc and rc absorber plates without ecc were 1 04 1 39 and 1 28 l m2 respectively the average productivity of ss with tc and rc absorber plates with ecc were 1 7 and 1 52 l m2 the addition of eccs to the modified sss increased the average productivity by 23 6 and 19 3 for ss with tc and rc respectively also the ss with tc and ecc and rc with ecc improved the productivity by 63 4 and 46 15 compared to the conventional ss respectively tc with ecc also provided maximum productivity of 1 9 l m2 on 14 10 2018 productivity denotes the overall outcome from different modifications as output per area in a single day as the tc absorber plate provided better evaporation rate for higher absorber plate surface area as discussed earlier the vapor production was more for this case and hence better productivity was found the ecc with extended cooler surface area could condensate more vapor than conventional ss as a result the combined effect of ss with tc absorber plate and ecc provided best productivity 4 cost analysis the major purpose of the solar distillation system is to reduce the cpl of the distillate output in the current work the cost analysis is accomplished for conventional ss and modified sss with only different design absorber plates and with both different design absorber plates and ecc table 2 represents the consequence of cost analysis for the various layouts of ss the cpl value of conventional ss was 0 028 0 019 l m2 where that was 0 019 l m2 when only different design absorber plates were used and 0 018 l m2 when both different design absorber plates and ecc were used among all cases the most economical configuration was the ss with different design absorber plates and ecc since the distillate output was higher for this configuration as opposed to the other cases due to the combination of modifications of the absorber plates and ecc the construction of modified sss need more metal sheet and glass also the construction of contributed to the cost due to copper tube material although the fabrication cost of modified absorber plates and ecc were slightly high all the modifications to the ss provide higher distillate output as a result cost per unit output was reduced ultimately 5 conclusion in this study design construction and performance test of a double slop ss were conducted the experiments were conducted for varying the design of the absorber plates with or without external condenser the maximum average productivity was 1 7 l m2 for the ss with tc absorber plates and ecc which was maximum among the 5 modifications tested the presence of ecc enhanced the overall productivity by 63 4 compared to the conventional ss the maximum average instantaneous efficiency among all the modifications was obtained 18 2 with ss with tc and ecc the average instantaneous efficiency with tc and ecc was 1 3 and 7 7 higher than rc with ecc and conventional ss respectively maximum average efficiency 19 was also achieved with ss with tc and ecc the cpl value for the modified ss and conventional ss are 0 018 l m2 and 0 028 l m2 this represents that the modified ss was more economical than the conventional ss after 7 days of experiments ss with tc and ecc provided the maximum average productivity maximum average instantaneous efficiency maximum average overall efficiency and lowest cpl value hence tc with ecc is considered as the best version among other modifications 6 limitations and future directions the ecc used in this experiment was cylindrical shape and occupied only 2 9 area of the whole ss body the ecc was confined to this smaller size to reduce shadow on the absorber plate in future researches rectangular or pyramid shaped ecc may be tested rectangular and pyramid shaped ecc over the whole top area of the ss body will provide more ecc surface area but ways need to be found to eradicate shadow effect with increased area no pcm were used during this experiment so heat can t be stored during day to utilize during night for more productivity pcm may be used under the absorber plates to utilize stored heat during day at night amount of insulation was kept minimum 0 3 m in the solar still body as the ambient weather didn t fluctuate much and not so cold amount of insulation need to be increased where weather is too cold in that case cost may increase but adjustment need to be made to keep the cpl value low declaration of competing interest the authors declare

11857,solar distillation is one of the cheapest and lowest energy consuming desalination processes to produce potable drinking water the main obstacle of desalination process is the low production rate of fresh water owing to slow evaporation and condensation rate of the system in this experiment a double slope solar still ss is modified by using two different modified absorber plates and an external copper condenser ecc absorber plates are modified by employing triangular and rectangular channels as they increase surface area of the absorber plates to increase heat transfer to the basin water and hence increase evaporation rate of water ecc is designed in such a way that provides extended cool surface area in addition with glass surface to increase condensation rate experiments are done in the month of october for 7 days and comparative analysis is done to determine the best modification out of the 5 modifications conventional ss ss with triangular channeled tc with and without ecc and ss with rectangular channeled rc with and without ecc in terms of productivity and efficiency the maximum average productivity obtained among all the modifications is 1 7 0 1 l m2 while experimenting with ss with tc absorber plates and ecc the maximum average overall efficiency and maximum average instantaneous efficiency both are obtained with ss with tc and ecc which are 17 86 0 6 and 18 2 1 6 respectively addition of ecc increased the average productivity by 0 66 l m2 and overall efficiency by 7 52 than conventional ss the economic analysis of the sss is also conducted and

survival of human beings now a days use of fresh water has been growing in developed and undeveloped countries and number of regions with barren ground is increasing with more demand for fresh water supply abdelal and taamneh 2017 about 70 of total area of the earth is covered by water among them 97 is saline seawater and another 2 is locked up as frozen in the polar ice region only 1 is accessible for carrying out our demands of water for survival el sebaii et al 2015 hassan et al 2019 yousef and hassan 2019 therefore demand of potable water is increasing rapidly by degrees and at the same time the accessibility of fresh water is reducing in time that creates water crisis saini et al 2019 around 3 5 million people die every year due to waterborne diseases sampathkumar et al 2010 this situation has been driven the technologies to focus on providing fresh water at a faster rate for producing large scale of freshwater various techniques are followed such as membrane water distillation multiple effect water distillation multi stage water distillation and reverse osmosis distillation however all these techniques are depended on fossil fuel as they require large motors and pumps to attain high pressure of water which need continuous supply of constant energy that can t be possible to attain by other sources of renewable energy dsilva et al 2016 these desalination methods cause various environmental troubles such as production of waste water that contains nitrogen and phosphorus and increasing use of fossil fuel contributes to greenhouse effect us epa 2022 using renewable energy such as solar distillation is the best way to avoid those environmental problems yousef et al 2019 solar distillation is a simple process which depends on non conventional energy solar energy and it is very cost effective process to produce fresh potable water panchal and patel 2017 in this process ss converts the salty or brackish water into potable water through evaporation and condensation processes by using solar energy as primary source of energy keshtkar et al 2020 solar energy is one of major types of sustainable energy which is environmentally friendly and cost effective compared to any other conventional energy sources for producing potable water but in the traditional stills continuous production of fresh water at same rate is sometimes found difficult for the irregular solar intensity during different hours of day as well as thermal loss through the body of ss so to enhance the productivity of the simple ss researchers around the world have worked and researched about different modification of solar desalination system this has been achieved by establishment of various modifications in the designs of sss or improvement of different parameters of the design such as single slope solar still with nano phase change material kumar et al 2021 double slope ss modifications gnanaraj and velmurugan 2019 kaviti et al 2021 pyramid ss al madhhachi and smaisim 2021 prakash and jayaprakash 2020 saravanavel et al 2020 tilted wick type ss hansen et al 2015 janarthanan et al 2006 mahdi et al 2011 sharon et al 2017 shubhajyothi et al 2020 inclined type ss sadineni et al 2008 samuel et al 2021 fins bataineh and abbas 2020 jani and modi 2019 panchal et al 2020 and so on a double slope solar still dsss is very familiar and commonly recognized design to the ss researchers a dsss is found more efficient than single slope ss because dsss can capture maximum solar irradiation from both east and west direction during different hours of the day and aids in producing higher fresh water output compared to single slope ss tiwari and singh 1991 kabeel and abdelgaied 2020 conducted an experimental investigation where they reported that the use of 25 mm graphite absorber plate with cooling the glass cover accelerates the daily efficiency of the modified pyramid shaped ss by 97 2 98 9 as compared to a traditional pyramid shaped ss a ss was fabricated with different design absorber plate configurations under normal climatic condition samuel and murugavel 2017 according to the experimental analysis it was found that 74 5 productivity increased for ss coupled with fin shaped absorber plate kabeel et al 2017a carried out an experiment integrating nanoparticle coated absorber plate they mixed the cuprous oxide nanoparticle with black paint the application of nanoparticle boosted the distillate output by 16 25 in comparison to the conventional ss an experiment was conducted with same sized sss using different energy absorbing materials in it for six months of time interval the main purpose of that experiment was to observe the effect of different energy absorbing materials on distillate output of ss the use of energy absorbing material not only increased the distillate output of a ss at the day time but also night time black rocks were found to be 20 more productive than any other energy absorbing material dwivedi and tiwari 2010 shanmugan et al 2018 experimented with a wick type ss with al2o3 nanoparticles on cotton wick fin with cotton wick jute wick and fin with jute wick as the basin liner during both summer and winter days they launched that the productivity was higher for fin with cotton wick and provided 7 46 and 4 12 kg m2 day for summer and winter respectively a comparative performance test for the sss employing different absorber plates such as aluminum plate and galvanized iron plate was conducted and compared with the conventional ss at the same climatic condition panchal 2011 ss with aluminum plate was found to attain the highest productivity a modified pyramid ss was designed with the absorber plate made of carbon particles nanomaterial modified epoxy composites by abdelal and taamneh 2017 it was found that adding 5 to 2 5 of carbon nanotubes to the carbon particle epoxy composite enhanced the productivity about 109 and 65 respectively yousef et al 2019 analyzed the performance of single slope ss using hollow cylindrical pin fins and steel wool fibers as the absorbing materials they reported that the feed water output increased by 16 and 25 for hollow cylindrical pin fins and steel wool fibers respectively as compared to the conventional ss moreover to increase the vapor condensation process there are two common measures such as reducing the glass cover temperature or addition of internal external condenser an et al 2018 monowe et al 2011 proposed a new design integrated with an external reflecting booster and an outside condenser they concluded that the efficiency of this system will around 77 if preheated saline water is used for domestic purpose and it could be raised up to 83 if the warm water is supplied to the still till night time numerical and experimental analyses were conducted on the effect of condensation area on natural circulation loop ncp ss feature where maximum daily output can be reached up to 4 73 and 2 71 kg m2 under summer and winter condition respectively rahmani and boutriaa 2017 the performance of different modification of identical sss with heating cooling and nano fluid was examined where they reported that the contribution of external condenser enhances 26 3 of total output parsa et al 2020 tuly et al 2021 examined the effect of external condenser in a double sloped ss with fin pcm and wick material and observed that the freshwater yield of modified ss was approximately 10 higher than the conventional ss for using external condenser from the above literature study it is evident that a wide range of modifications are trialed for the solar distillation unit by using different auxiliary equipment to examine the outcome of modifications some researchers have experimented with built in condenser and additional equipment where a few researchers studied about the combination of different design of absorber plates and external condenser in correlation with the work completed by tuly et al 2021 similar type of condenser is used in this work applying different dimension and construction method the aim of this experimental study is to enhance the freshwater yield of a double slope ss by employing triangular and rectangular channel absorber plates with an external copper condenser and finally to compare the results with the conventional ss once for all a cost analysis of the modified ss is introduced to analyze the overall effectiveness of the solar distiller unit economically moreover the time dependent instantaneous efficiencies and overall efficiencies are computed individually for all cases 2 materials and methodology 2 1 solar still design and construction experimental setups were designed and fabricated to test the distillate output for different absorber plates and ecc a photograph of a single pair of modified experimental setup is displayed in fig 1 body of the sss and absorber plates were fabricated from gp sheet with a thickness of 1 mm both the conventional and modified sss have the same dimensions of 1 57 1 016 m2 whereas the elevation of side walls at front and at middle portion were 0 15 and 0 40 m respectively it contained two absorber plates at the bottom on which water was placed for evaporation the side walls and bottom side of the ss body were insulated with 0 3 m cork sheet to reduce heat loss through the walls transparent glasses 4 mm thick having emissivity of 0 95 was used as the cover the whole solar distillate body and condenser surface area was placed at an inclination of 25 with horizontal plane following geographical orientation of rajshahi 24 3636 n 88 6241 e it had dimension of 1 016 0 693 m2 two glasses 0 3556 0 3048 m2 were used to cover the horizontal portions of the sss the modified sss contained specially designed absorber plates tc or rc at each and the conventional ss contained one flat absorber plate at the bottom on which water was placed for evaporation the absorber plates were fabricated with gp sheet held by wooden frames and were incorporated with tc and rc of different shapes increased surface to volume ratio was obtained by introducing different shaped channels in the absorber plates which enhanced the free surface area for water evaporation the tc and rc absorber plates were identical in dimension of 0 889 0 635 m2 and consisted of 70 and 40 channels respectively at beginning of experimental procedure 3 61 10 3 and 3 15 10 3 m3 feed water were supplied to the rc and rc absorber plates until the water depth was 0 1 m the required amount water was supplied after each hour to fill up the evaporated water from the absorber plates to maintain 0 1 m water depth the exposed water surface area was 0 5 m2 to increase the rate of absorption of solar heat flux both the absorber plates were painted black an ecc was placed on the top of the modified sss body fig 1 the ecc is made of hollow copper tube of 6 35 10 3 m in diameter wounded at a shape of compressed coil and it forms the shape of a hollow cylinder of 0 3 m diameter the gaps between the copper tubes were reduced by copper welding the outer surface of the ecc is insulated with polyurethane foam and cloaked with tape to reduce heat loss to the surroundings the bottom portion is insulated with cork sheet the ecc is cooled by the continuous flow of the feed water from the reservoir the feed water passes through the hollow copper conduit of the ecc and preheated by the flat plate solar collector before entering the modified ss 2 2 experimental procedure three different setups conventional tc plate with ecc and rc plate with ecc were tested at the same time and location simultaneously the lay out diagram of the experimental setup is represented in fig 2 at first feed water from the reservoir flew through the copper tube before entering the solar stills the flowing feed water kept the condenser surface temperature around 35 38 c approximately which was below inner glass surface temperature by this way condensation rate was enhanced the water got preheated by the latent heat of condensation the feed water was additionally preheated by the flat plate solar collector fpsc before entering ss preheating the feed water in two stages resulted in enhanced evaporation rate and high distillate output some water vapors were condensed inside the glass cover and rest of them entered into the ecc the condensate output was collected from the ecc and the modified ss unit a pyranometer was mounted beside the experimental setup to estimate the hourly solar intensity on the surface a mercury glass thermometer temperature range from 0 to 100 c was used to measure the ambient temperature of the feed water condensate output water and preheated water from flat plate solar collector custom made data logger ds18b20 digital temperature sensors incorporated with arduino uno showed in fig 2 was used to measure the temperature of absorber plates and basin water inside the condenser humid air temperature and inside glass temperature an infrared thermometer measurement error is about 2 or 4 f was used to measure the outside glass temperature and inside condenser wall temperature during the tests the condensate output was computed hourly using a leveled beaker 200 ml capacity the specific data were recorded hourly from 10 00 to 16 00 h during every experimental day all experiments were done at the rajshahi university of engineering and technology rajshahi bangladesh latitude 24 3636 n 88 6241 e rajshahi region of bangladesh represents a hot climatic condition from march to october the average annual temperature in rajshahi is 25 8 c where the highest temperature in summer is 35 9 c and in winter is 10 2 c the experiment is carried out in october when the average temperature was 27 6 c and the average solar intensity reached 1200 w m2 2 3 error analysis the performance appraisal of the ss is based on the different parameters the measured parameters sometimes involve some errors caused by the method of uncertainty of the measuring instruments this errors or percentage of uncertainty may impact the results velmurugan et al 2008 experimentally evaluated the performance of pyranometer thermocouple thermometer infrared thermometer and measuring beaker in measuring the solar radiation absorber plates temperature basin water

temperature and amount of distillate output the standard uncertainty of the various used instruments was evaluated by using eq 1 rahbar and esfahan 2012 the ranges accuracies standard uncertainty and percentage of errors for the instruments are given in table 1 1 u a 3 where u and a are considered as uncertainty and accuracy of the instrument respectively 2 4 cost analysis of solar distillation unit cost analysis of the solar distillation system can be implemented by the procedure following esfahani et al 2011 the total cost of the ss is calculated for each case the capital recovery factor crf is given by esfahani et al 2011 2 c r f i 1 i n 1 i n 1 where i is considered as annual interest which is 12 and n as the lifetime of the ss can perform which is 10 years srivastava and agrawal

ratio of input energy to the output energy at any particular time the instantaneous efficiencies of a solar still is calculated for all considered cases the instantaneous efficiency of the solar still for different cases at respected times is calculated by following formula cooper 1973 10 η i q c w g α w i t where α w is the absorptivity of water per unit area m2 and i t is rate of incident solar energy on the solar still per unit area w m2 the efficiency can be maximized by increasing the output produced this can be achieved by enhancing the conversion of input energy to output energy and minimizing the heat loss for increasing the output an external condenser was also used so the total convective heat transfer coefficient should be also used to calculate the total instantaneous efficiency for the solar still the heat transfer from ecc is similar to glass surface as the only the material changes so eq 10 is modified for ecc 11 so 12 where q c w g h c w g t w t g and q c w c h

irradiation intensity solar irradiation profile study is important for forecasting the amount of distilled water output by a ss it was observed that the solar irradiance increased until 13 00 h and then decreased with time due to the position of sun the irradiance changed within the range of 590 1050 w m2 the evaporation rate varied with the solar radiation which was directly involved for the productivity of the sss maximum solar radiation was observed during 13 00 h during experimental days within the range of 850 1050 w m2 fig 3 a b and c represent the 7 days average of temperatures of basin and basin water of conventional ss ss with tc absorber plates and ecc and ss with rc absorber plates and ecc for all the modifications it was observed that the temperature of basin of the absorber plates and basin water increased with the increase of solar irradiation the average basin temperature for conventional ss ss with tc and ss with rc absorber plates were varied between 49 and 59 52 68 and 51 65 c respectively the average basin water temperature for conventional ss ss with tc and ss with rc absorber plates were varied between 46 and 56 50 66 and 47 61 c respectively maximum average basin and basin water temperature observed were 68 and 66 c both for ss with tc absorber plates around 13 00 h which was during the peak solar radiation time the hourly average ambient temperatures were recorded within the range of 35 38 c for different solar radiation profile during experimental days which were almost same the average outer glass temperature values were also varied following solar radiation profile ranging from 42 to 49 c which remained almost same for all the modifications 3 1 2 effect of different design of absorber plates the hourly average basin water temperature changes for conventional tc and rc absorber plates were within the range of 46 56 51 66 and 47 61 c respectively under same solar radiation profile it was observed that the average basin water temperature for tc absorber plate was 4 5 and 5 10 c higher than the rc absorber plate and conventional solar still respectively this was due to the enhanced surface area of tc absorber plate than other two types of plates which resulted in higher heat transfer rate between the basin and basin water in case of tc absorber plate from fig 3 a and b it was seen that during each hour of experiment under same solar radiation the difference between basin and basin water temperature for ss with tc absorber plate was smaller than rc absorber plate at 13 00 h average basin and basin water temperature were 67 and 65 c for tc absorber plate and difference between the temperatures was 2 c at the same time average basin and basin water temperature was 65 and 61 c for rc absorber plate and difference between the temperatures was 4 c while for conventional ss the average temperature difference between basin and basin water was as much as 7 c this difference in temperature was because of different surface area of the absorber plates the absorber plates with tc and rc had higher surface area than the conventional flat absorber plate the conventional flat absorber plate had the area of 0 5 m2 while tc absorber plate had surface area of 1 093 m2 and rc absorber plate had surface area of 0 85 m2 as the tc absorber plate had the highest surface area it provided the best heat transfer between the absorber plates and basin water so the relative difference between the basin and basin water temperature was smaller than other two modifications eq 12 shows that the instantaneous efficiency would be higher as the difference between basin water temperature and glass inner surface or condenser surface temperature increased the average instantaneous efficiency was observed to be changed with respect to value of tw tg the instantaneous efficiency raised as the value of tw tg increased for all the modifications among all the modifications ss with tc and ecc had the highest average instantaneous efficiency ranging from 12 2 to 18 2 for value of tw tg between 5 and 13 c the reason for higher instantaneous efficiency of the ss with tc and ecc was that the basin water temperature was higher than other modifications due to extra surface area of the tc absorber plates the heat transfer rate was better so higher tw tg value was maintained than other modifications that resulted in higher instantaneous efficiency it was also observed that at lower temperature differences ss with rc and conventional plates showed higher instantaneous efficiency than ss with tc with ecc and without ecc tc with ecc and without ecc showed higher instantaneous efficiency when the value of tw tg was raised higher than 8 c that occurred due to the fact that while using ss with rc and conventional value of tw tg was between 5 and 8 c during peak solar radiation time which was around 13 00 h while for ss with tc with ecc and without ecc 5 8 c temperature difference was observed during early and late hours of day when solar radiation was relatively lower than peak hours during peak solar radiation hours evaporation rate was maximum for each individual modification as the temperature difference of 5 8 c was observed during peak hours for ss with rc and conventional absorber plates they exhibited higher efficiencies than ss with tc while for ss with tc and ecc and without ecc 8 13 c temperature difference region was observed during peak solar radiation hours at peak solar radiation hours maximum temperature differences was observed in respective to all modifications so it seemed that tc with ec and without ecc showed better efficiencies for higher temperature differences while for rc and conventional it was observed for relatively lower temperature differences 3 1 3 effect of external copper condenser it was noticed that the inner glass surface temperature increased gradually until 13 00 h when the solar radiation was at peak for conventional ss ss with tc and ss with rc absorber plates it increased from 42 to 51 45 to 54 and 44 52 c respectively the maximum average value of inner glass surface temperature for using tc rc and flat plate absorber plate were 54 52 and 51 c respectively but at the same time the average temperature for eccs varied between 32 40 and 33 39 c the eccs provided approximately 22 lower surface temperature for condensation than the inner glass surface the reason that the ecc provided lower surface temperature was the continuous flow of feed water temperature 35 38 c through the copper pipe of the condenser coil also due to insulation around the outer surface of the condenser the sunlight couldn t directly incident on the copper surface as a result ecc surface temperature remained cool and didn t increase too much with the increase of solar radiation at peak time there was no cooling system or insulation couldn t be used on glass surface in fact glass surface temperature was subjected to be heated as the solar radiation increased so ecc acted as better condensation unit than the glass surface 3 2 accumulated distillate output and efficiency 3 2 1 effect of absorber plates the accumulated distillate output for employing tc rc and flat plate absorber plates in ss is represented in fig 4 the average accumulated distillate output for tc without ecc rc without ecc and conventional were 1 56 1 14 and 0 97 l day during 7 days the accumulated distillate output for utilizing tc absorber plate was 60 8 higher than flat plate absorber plate and 36 8 higher than rc absorber plate the maximum distillate output was obtained for tc absorber plate because of its higher evaporation rate and better heat transfer characteristics the tc absorber plate had 12 5 higher surface to volume ratio than rc absorber plate more surface area for heat transfer increased the evaporation of feed water as well as productivity of ss 3 2 2 effect of external copper condenser from fig 4 average accumulated distillated output for using tc and rc with ecc and without ecc in modified ss was observed the average output for using tc rc absorber plates without ecc were approximately 1 56 and 1 14 l day respectively while using ecc the output increased to 1 71 and 1 54 l day ecc increased the total output of ss the accumulated output for tc absorber plate with ecc was 9 6 higher than without ecc where this was 35 09 higher for rc absorber plate with ecc than without ecc by adding ecc with glass condensation surface it provided extra 0 18 m2 area cooler than glass surface area for condensation when excess vapor was generated during peak solar radiation that increased the productivity of ss 3 3 efficiency of solar stills the efficiencies of the sss were calculated as instantaneous and overall the average instantaneous efficiencies of 7 experimental days at different hours of sss are represented in fig 5 a it is already established that inner glass surface temperature increased with solar radiation intensity which was usually maximum at 13 00 h and gradually decreased towards last hours of day the instantaneous efficiency depends mainly on solar radiation basin water temperature and the temperature of condensation surface i e glass condenser surface as shown in eq 12 a winded copper coil ecc was used and its effect was tested for both tc and rc absorber plates the maximum average instantaneous efficiency observed for tc without ecc rc without ecc and conventional were 15 5 1 5 13 7 0 7 and 10 5 0 8 at 13 00 h tc without ecc had shown more instantaneous efficiency than other 2 modifications was due to the fact that it had higher temperature of basin water and as a result higher value of tw tg was observed during peak solar radiation hours it was also observed that tc with ecc and rc with ecc showed 2 65 and 3 2 more instantaneous efficiency than experimenting without ecc the reason of the higher instantaneous efficiency while adding ecc was the cooler surface area ecc provided around 32 40 c which was much less than inner glass surface temperature so even higher value of tw tg was obtained while using ecc and hence efficiency increased fig 5 b represents the comparative analysis of overall efficiency of sss for each of the seven experimental days the maximum overall efficiencies were attained by integrating tc with and without ecc in modified ss were 19 and 16 9 respectively and by using rc absorber plate with and without ecc were 17 5 and 15 8 respectively both were obtained on 14 10 2018 when the solar radiation was maximum among 7 experimental days productivity was also maximum that day due to maximum solar radiation as seen from fig 6 eq 13 shows that the overall efficiency depends mainly on accumulated distillate output absorber plate area and total amount of solar radiation during experimental hours so maximum overall efficiency was observed on 14 10 2018 if overall efficiencies of other days were observed it can be seen that overall efficiencies fluctuated as the solar radiation profile on particular days changed the ecc increased the average overall efficiency of tc and rc by 2 09 and 1 94 respectively than while experimenting without ecc when eccs were used with tc and rc the accumulated distillate increased and hence the overall efficiencies of those modifications increased 3 4 productivity of solar stills the equivalent analysis of the productivities of the sss is illustrated in fig 6 the average productivities of conventional ss ss with tc and rc absorber plates without ecc were 1 04 1 39 and 1 28 l m2 respectively the average productivity of ss with tc and rc absorber plates with ecc were 1 7 and 1 52 l m2 the addition of eccs to the modified sss increased the average productivity by 23 6 and 19 3 for ss with tc and rc respectively also the ss with tc and ecc and rc with ecc improved the productivity by 63 4 and 46 15 compared to the conventional ss respectively tc with ecc also provided maximum productivity of 1 9 l m2 on 14 10 2018 productivity denotes the overall outcome from different modifications as output per area in a single day as the tc absorber plate provided better evaporation rate for higher absorber plate surface area as discussed earlier the vapor production was more for this case and hence better productivity was found the ecc with extended cooler surface area could condensate more vapor than conventional ss as a result the combined effect of ss with tc absorber plate and ecc provided best productivity 4 cost analysis the major purpose of the solar distillation system is to reduce the cpl of the distillate output in the current work the cost analysis is accomplished for conventional ss and modified sss with only different design absorber plates and with both different design absorber plates and ecc table 2 represents the consequence of cost analysis for the various layouts of ss the cpl value of conventional ss was 0 028 0 019 l m2 where that was 0 019 l m2 when only different design absorber plates were used and 0 018 l m2 when both different design absorber plates and ecc were used among all cases the most economical configuration was the ss with different design absorber plates and ecc since the distillate output was higher for this configuration as opposed to the other cases due to the combination of modifications of the absorber plates and ecc the construction of modified sss need more metal sheet and glass also the construction of contributed to the cost due to copper tube material although the fabrication cost of modified absorber plates and ecc were slightly high all the modifications to the ss provide higher distillate output as a result cost per unit output was reduced ultimately 5 conclusion in this study design construction and performance test of a double slop ss were conducted the experiments were conducted for varying the design of the absorber plates with or without external condenser the maximum average productivity was 1 7 l m2 for the ss with tc absorber plates and ecc which was maximum among the 5 modifications tested the presence of ecc enhanced the overall productivity by 63 4 compared to the conventional ss the maximum average instantaneous efficiency among all the modifications was obtained 18 2 with ss with tc and ecc the average instantaneous efficiency with tc and ecc was 1 3 and 7 7 higher than rc with ecc and conventional ss respectively maximum average efficiency 19 was also achieved with ss with tc and ecc the cpl value for the modified ss and conventional ss are 0 018 l m2 and 0 028 l m2 this represents that the modified ss was more economical than the conventional ss after 7 days of experiments ss with tc and ecc provided the maximum average productivity maximum average instantaneous efficiency maximum average overall efficiency and lowest cpl value hence tc with ecc is considered as the best version among other modifications 6 limitations and future directions the ecc used in this experiment was cylindrical shape and occupied only 2 9 area of the whole ss body the ecc was confined to this smaller size to reduce shadow on the absorber plate in future researches rectangular or pyramid shaped ecc may be tested rectangular and pyramid shaped ecc over the whole top area of the ss body will provide more ecc surface area but ways need to be found to eradicate shadow effect with increased area no pcm were used during this experiment so heat can t be stored during day to utilize during night for more productivity pcm may be used under the absorber plates to utilize stored heat during day at night amount of insulation was kept minimum 0 3 m in the solar still body as the ambient weather didn t fluctuate much and not so cold amount of insulation need to be increased where weather is too cold in that case cost may increase but adjustment need to be made to keep the cpl value low declaration of competing interest the authors declare

11858,in arid and semi arid zones water resources remain unknown in terms of quality and quantity the current paper aims to evaluate the water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes within the essaouira basin and to define the origin and recharge areas of groundwater 122 samples from the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers as well as surface water were taken in july 2020 are the subject of hydrogeochemical analyses based on the results of these analyses almost all elements are within the allowable limit fixed by who except cl and so4 2 in a few points which require treatment before human consumption the indices sar na kr mr cr rsc pi and ec show that the water of the study area is adequate for agricultural purposes therefore the waters of essaouira basin meet the standards according to the indices used except for ec where almost 50 of the points have poor quality and for cr the waters require a non corrosive pipe the spatial distribution of wqi shows a slight improvement of the quality even though the prolonged drought in the region this is explained by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic which has caused a total shutdown of tourist activity tracing the waters using stable isotopes 18o and 2h show that the recharge of these waters is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin without significant evaporation and the recharge altitude varies between 400 and 1400 m the mixing ratios deduced from the mass balance of stable isotopes shows that surface water contributes between 32 16 and 70 42 to the cenomano turonian aquifer recharge

aquifers of morocco the reservoirs concerned by this study are the upper cenomanian turonian aquifer is formed of limestone and dolomite limestone bounded at the base and upper by gray clay and white marl from the lower cenomanian and senonian respectively the plio quaternary aquifer is composed of formations of dune sandstones or marine limestone and contains a free groundwater table the turonian aquifer is located under the senonian marls and is in contact with the plio quaternary aquifer in the northern part towards ksoub wadi and at the level of the tidzi diapir in the east and the essaouira diapir in the west bahir et al 2013 2008 2000 mennani et al 2001 ouhamdouch et al 2018 rafik et al 2021 the hauterivien aquifer is made up of moderately fractured and altered silty and marly clays alternating with siliceous and marly limestones marly siltstones as well as moderately fractured dolomitic limestones duffaud 1960 rey et al 1988 the main tributaries which cross the basin are iguerounzar and ouazi with an average direction of se nw which originate in the high atlas and drain the cenomano turonian aquifer via more than 15 sources which makes them perennial to the south of iguerounzar wadi extends zelten wadi not perennial their intersection with the first is at the level of the zerrar dam which was launched in 2008 with a reservoir capacity of 70 mm3 to supply drinking water to the city of essaouira and the surrounding villages and for the irrigation of 1000 ha of agricultural land bahir et al 2019 2020 2021a ksoub wadi crosses the synclinal basin of essaouira from a direction of flow to the nw receives water from the releases of the zerrar dam and feeds the cenomano turonian aquifer by infiltration towards the southern end of the basin lies igouzoullene wadi which drains the hauterivian aquifer most of the volumes flowing into this wadi are regulated by the igouzoulene dam located upstream with a capacity of 17 mm3 launched in 2004 to meet the needs in

parameters ph ec ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 and no3 is used to assess the quality of water resources in the essaouira basin for domestic uses the period targeted by this study is called the low water

results and discussion 3 1 chemical facies and water mineralization the chadha diagram chadha 1999 is one of the most used diagrams to classify waters according to their chemical facies it also helps to understand and to define plausible hydrogeochemical processes dominating the chemistry of groundwater such as mixing ion exchange and dissolution affecting the composition of groundwater these diagrams are widely used in hydrochemistry and give satisfactory results based on this diagram fig 2 the waters representing the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers are characterized by the facies calcium and magnesium chloride sodium chloride calcium and magnesium bicarbonate calcium sulphate and sodium carbonate with a dominance of calcium and magnesium chloride facies the correlation diagrams between the major elements as well as the saturation indices fig 3 a h show the existence of strong positive correlations between the elements na vs cl ca2 vs so42 and ca2 vs mg2 this reflects the same origin of these elements the positive correlation between na and cl show the contribution of the halite dissolution in groundwater mineralization fig 3a h the parabolic proportional relationship in the diagram na cl vs si with respect to the halite support the hypothesis of dissolution of the halite water samples are placed in the 1 1 line indicating a deficit of na vs cl the excess cl is due to the effect of sea spray and dissolution of evaporates the two points far from all points reflect the marine intrusion effect p74 and p89 coming respectively from the hauterivian and plio quaternary aquifers the ca so4 diagram shows that few points are scattered around the 1 1 line this meant that the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite is limited the excess in so4 is explained by gypsum dissolution and this hypothesis is supported by the parabolic proportional relationship in the ca so4 diagram vs si with respect to gypsum fig 3a h ca mg diagram fig 3a h shows that the samples are scattered around the right side of the 1 1 line with a slight excess of ca this excess could be explained by the reverse ion exchange phenomenon the correlation between ca2 and hco3 fig 3a h showed a weak correlation for the majority of water samples some points were scattered around the calcite dissolution line 1 1 line this suggests the contribution of calcite dissolution to the waters mineralization in essaouira this hypothesis was corroborated by negative saturation index values with respect to calcite and vice versa for points with positive si values relative to calcite 3 2 multivariate statistical analysis fig 4 groups the values of the factors the first two factors dim1 and dim2 represent 79 6 65 8 and 83 6 of the variance expressed for the three plio quaternary pq cenomano turonian ct and hauterivian ha aquifers respectively these factors combine the maximum of the expressed variance and are sufficient to reflect the information sought the analysis of the variables of the principal component analysis pca normalized in the factorial plane dim1 dim2 is represented in fig 4 which highlights two groups among the studied parameters for the plio quaternary the first group around the dim1 axis 67 1 45 3 and 69 8 of the total inertia of the cloud for the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers respectively and which takes into account ec cl na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 show a mineralization of water by the phenomenon of rock dissolution the dim1 factor appears as an axis of global water mineralization the different variables have high correlation coefficients between them the dim2 factor alone explains 12 5 20 5 and 13 8 of the total cloud inertia for the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers respectively it is characterized by no3 and ph shows anthropogenic mineralization of superficial origin as a result of livestock waste and poor treatment of domestic wastewater fig 4 4 evaluation of water quality for drinking purposes evaluating the quality of drinking water is a necessity to ensure that this vital resource meets health standards there are more than 70 criteria framed by strict regulations that impose standards defining the required quality of water intended for human consumption the quality of the water is checked regularly to guarantee its potability and to report any contamination which may be of either anthropogenic or natural origin in this study we are interested in the physicochemical quality based on the standards of the world health organization who 2017 the correlations matrix of physicochemical parameters shows considerable correlation links between some parameters table 1 these correlations reflect that these elements have the same sources with the exception of hco3 and no3 the rest of the elements contribute significantly in the salinization of the waters as shown by the strong correlations with the ec 4 1 hydrogen potential ph the ph is an indicator that reflects the concentration of h ion it is an effective indicator to assess the water state for example their degree of pollution it controls several physicochemical balances for this study the ph values varies between 6 5 and 8 5 table 2 according to the standards set by who the waters are within the acceptable limit indicating the alkaline nature of the waters in the essaouira basin 4 2 electrical conductivity ec is a determining factor for water quality it reflects the capacity of water to conduct current between two electrodes separated from each other by 1 cm bremond and vuichard 1973 the dissolved matter in water is found as electrically charged ions hence the importance of measuring ec in quantifying dissolved salts in water rafik et al 2022 the potability of water according to this parameter is acceptable if it does not exceed 1500 μs cm threshold required by who in the essaouira basin the values of ec oscillate between 0 48 and 26 77 ms cm based on this parameter 69 of the samples capturing the cenomano turonian aquifer have poor quality caused by increased salinity table 2 surface water is generally more mineralized than groundwater following the leaching of the formations crossed before being discharged and the evaporation phenomenon the increase in water exploitation in the face of a low renewal rate creates more and more pressure on water resources which has thus led to the degradation of their quality especially the cenomano turonian aquifer fig 5 shows the monitoring of the spatio temporal distribution of water salinity using the results of the 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns and compares them with the state in 2020 the 2017 campaign the salinity fluctuates between 0 3 and 4 g l with an average of 1 29 g l in 2018 the salinity values varied between 0 4 and 4 3 g l with an average of 1 4 g l and between 0 35 and 4 4 g l with an average of 1 4 for samples from the 2019 campaign in 2020 the water points with values above 4 g l will increase in all the aquifers the situation of salinity becomes worrying in the region of essaouira especially that the values in some points for example the region of sebt kourimat recharge zone of the cenomanian turonian aquifer the salinity values increase by more than 6 times comparing the situation with the nineties it can be seen that the salinity values become more important as time goes forward and goes from east to west during the four campaigns generally the salinity of the waters mineralization in the essaouira region increases the mineralization increases from upstream to downstream of the hauterivian aquifer and attends values 18 times higher than the standard value as the case of point p74 which is already affected by the marine intrusion 13 samples from this aquifer exceed the threshold set by the who for the plio quaternary aquifer 25 samples outside who requirements ec values are generally higher in the eastern and western parts this increase is due to the dissolution of salt formations of the triassic and the marine intrusion impact 4 3 calcium the calcium concentrations vary from one aquifer to another depending on the nature of the host limestone rocks are the major source of this element in the waters in the essaouira basin the ca2 contents vary between 51 57 and 454 71 mg l in the plio quaternary aquifer all the samples show concentrations below 200 mg l which corresponds to the potability standards with the exception of points p89 p97 and p107 which have values outside the threshold required by who for the cenomano turonian aquifer calcium varies between 68 67 and 699 09 mg l with an average of 196 80 mg l 21 water points in this aquifer have an impermissible quality for drinking purposes the high calcium values reflect the strong dissolution of dolomite and or calcite as well as other calcium minerals such as gypsum the points taken from the hauterivian aquifer show ca2 contents ranging from 18 61 to 341 06 mg l point p74 is the only point which exceeds the desirable limit of the who and is located towards the downstream end of igouzoullene wadi table 2 the spatial distribution of ca2 figs 7 9 of the coastal aquifers plio quaternary and hauterivian shows that the high values are located at the ocean continent limit surface and groundwater in these two aquifers are of good quality based on this element as for the cenomano turonian aquifer 32 of water points exceed the threshold of 200 mg l who 2017 4 4 magnesium magnesium is one of the most common elements in nature and important to the hardness of water the main origin of this element in the essaouira basin is the dolomitic limestones of the jurassic and the triassic on the basis of this element the samples capturing the plio quaternary aquifer with the exception of two points p89 and p107 meet the potability standards 150 mg l who 2017 for the cenomano turonian aquifer the magnesium concentration varies between 14 69 and 285 mg l 57 points which capture this aquifer are of good quality the samples analysed from the hauterivian aquifer have mg2 contents below the threshold of 150 mg l set by who i e they have good quality with the exception of point p74 which has an anomaly with a value six times the norm probably suggesting the effect of marine intrusion table 2 the spatial distribution of mg2 is similar to that of ca2 figs 7 9 which indicates the existence of a positive correlation between these two elements this observation gives a hypothesis that calcium and magnesium in water have the same origin 4 5 sodium sodium is a highly reactive element in water stallard and edmond 1983 it is very abundant in the waters due to its rapid release during the processes of dissolution of geological formations the high levels of na can be of several origins such as anthropogenic activity marine intrusion brackish water infiltration alteration of silicate minerals ouhamdouch et al 2018 rafik et al 2021 rodier 1978 and or cations exchange mechanism within the aquifers of the essaouira basin the concentration of na varies between 22 04 and 7117 64 mg l 17 samples capturing the plio quaternary aquifer exceed the permissible limit 200 mg l recommended by who table 2 concerning the cenomano turonian aquifer 30 of the samples do not meet the drinking water requirements while for the hauterivian aquifer 4 water points exceed the maximum admissible content for human consumption according to figs 7 9 the na contents increase going from upstream to downstream for the hauterivian aquifer the maximum value is recorded in point p74 which is very close to the ocean the points that capturing the plio quaternary aquifer have na concentrations below 490 mg l with the exception of point p89 which records an extreme value of around 6079 29 mg l for the cenomano turonian aquifer the concentrations increase going from se to nw flow direction the maximum value of sodium concentration is observed in the downstream of ouazi wadi at the level of p69 and downstream of iguerounzar wadi at the level of points p31 and p32 these anomalies are due to the dissolution of the triassic evaporites formations and to the effect of seawater intrusion 4 6 potassium potassium is present in water with low levels compared to other major elements the contribution of k in water mineralization is minimal in the essaouira basin the potassium concentration varies between 0 64 and 230 98 mg l waters that exceed a concentration of 30 mg l in k are considered unacceptable for human consumption according to who standards table 2 all the points which capture the aquifers studied have good quality with the exception of points p23 and p69 capturing the cenomano turonian aquifer p89 and p118 capturing the plio quaternary aquifer and p74 capturing the hauterivian aquifer the map of the spatial variation of potassium figs 7 9 shows that the points most affected by high concentrations are located towards the ocean which reflects the effect of marine intrusion potassium is found in several minerals such as sylvinite and corrollite and in plant ashes as carbonate agricultural activity provides water through the soil with significant concentrations of potassium by leaching fertilizers in the form of potassium bound to nitrate chloride and or sulphate 4 7 chloride chlorides are inorganic anions found in varying concentrations in natural waters in natural waters the concentration varies according to the nature of the formations crossed the degree of contamination by marine intrusion and the degree of pollution by industrial or anthropogenic discharges the high contents are presented in large quantities in seawater 19 g l their concentration in rainwater is approximately 3 mg l the maximum concentration of cl recommended by who is 250 mg l for the plio quaternary aquifer the contents vary between 74 44 and 10741 23 mg l with an average of 801 68 mg l 82 of the points which capture this aquifer exceed the standard in cl concerning the waters of the cenomano turonian aquifer the chloride concentrations vary between 40 36 and 1569 04 mg l with an average of 441 99 mg l based on this element 38 water points are of poor quality for the hauterivian aquifer the chloride contents vary between 45 02 and 11574 52 mg l with an average of 928 80 56 of the points sampled exceed the desired value table 2 the spatial distribution of cl figs 7 9 shows that the high values are marked in the eastern part downstream of each aquifer the maximum levels for the hauterivian and plio quaternary aquifer are recorded respectively at points p74 and p89 coastal points testifying to marine intrusion for the cenomano turonian aquifer high concentrations are observed at points p23 p33 p12 p31 and p42 under the effect of evaporitic gypsiferous soils 4 8 bicarbonate bicarbonates hco3 are an essential element which controls the alkalinity of water via a process of dissolution of the surrounding carbonate formations or by the infiltration of carbon contained in the soil and the air in the form of co2 for a deep aquifers the major source of bicarbonates is limestone and dolomitic rocks the samples capturing the plio quaternary aquifer have hco3 concentrations varying between 143 96 and 470 92 mg l five samples exceed the 380 mg l concentration the only one admissible by who as for the cenomano turonian aquifer the bicarbonate contents vary between 161 04 and 680 mg l which 25 samples have an unacceptable quality for the hauterivian aquifer the concentrations vary between 141 52 and 509 96 mg l where 56 of the samples exceed the acceptable limit for this element table 2 the high grade points occupy the northern part of the plio quaternary and cenomano turonian aquifers and the eastern part of the hauterivian aquifer figs 7 9 4 9 sulphate water sulphate come from the dissolution of rocks rich in gypsum iron sulphides and or the infiltration of acidic meteoric water resulting from sulfur compounds in the present study the so4 2 contents of the samples capturing the plio quaternary varied between 23 5 and 2098 mg l the waters of this aquifer have an acceptable quality except for points p89 and p100 that exceed the potability threshold 250 mg l set by who for the hauterivian aquifer the concentrations for all the points varies between 90 80 and 250 mg l with the exception of point p74 which records an extreme value of 2320 mg l the points analysed from the cenomano turonian aquifer show that the variation is between 26 and 2106 mg l which 22 samples exceed the standard in this element table 2 the spatial variation figs 7 9 shows that the high concentrations are recorded downstream of the plio quaternary and hauterivian aquifers for the cenomano turonian aquifer the high values are recorded around kourimat and meskala caused by the carbonate matrix and by the cenomanian and jurassic soils rich in gypsum 4 10 nitrate nitrates is an element resulting from the oxidation nitrogen their presence in polluted water attests that the self purification process has already started human activity accelerates the process of enrichment in this element via the leaching of nitrogenous products accumulated in soils such as organic matter fertilizers and or discharges from mineral industries chenaker et al 2017 ouhamdouch et al 2018 ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 however the nitrate ion in water is undesirable if it exceeds the allowable limit of 50 mg l who 2017 the points analysed in the plio quaternary aquifer have no3 contents varying between 0 17 and 149 67 mg l 12 of these samples have concentrations higher than the standard accepted by the who for the cenomano turonian aquifer the nitrate values vary between 0 06 and 940 49 mg l 26 samples from this aquifer are not adequate for drinking water standards for the points which capture the hauterivian aquifer the contents vary between 0 22 and 226 77 mg l all the samples have an acceptable quality except points p71 and p76 table 2 in the study area high nitrate values are recorded downstream of the ouazi wadi and around points p69 and p68 which capture the cenomano turonian aquifer figs 7 9 at point p105 located near of tidzi village and point p90 towards the ocean which captures the plio quaternary aquifer the levels are also high downstream from igouzoullene wadi p71 these high concentrations are mainly due to human activity such as poor treatment of domestic wastewater and livestock waste in the light of these results it is therefore necessary to treat the water from these polluted points before any consumption 5 estimation of water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi is a simple index that is easy to understand by non specialists in hydrogeochemistry and by concerned decision makers at different scales the calculation of wqi for two sampling companions in the low waters of 2019 and 2020 shows that the aquifers of essaouira are sensitive and record fast fluctuations in quality following different sources of disturbance such as climate change the degree of exploitation and the degree of human pollution etc the spatial distribution of wqi fig 6 shows that there is roughly a slight improvement of the quality even though the prolonged drought in the region this is explained maybe by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic which has caused a total shutdown of tourist activity the rainfall conditions changed little between 2019 and 2020 which suggests the impact of the implementation of national containment covid 19 and the lockdown have shown its influence on the chemical composition of water as well as on water quality as demonstrated in the work of chakraborty et al 2021 tokatlı and varol 2021 this has led to a great reduction in the volumes of water exploited either at golf courses or at campsites and also activities linked to tourism the reduction in pumped volumes leads to a decrease in mineralization dilution effect is therefore an improvement in quality the results show that 11 of water in 2019 had good quality while in 2020 this category contains 17 5 of water samples approximately 56 of the samples are classified of poor quality in 2020 i e a slight increase in water points in this category compared to 54 in 2019 for the very poor quality 20 and 13 are recorded in 2019 and 2020 respectively for the unsuitable category we notice a decrease of about 3 of the sampled points of this quality from 2019 to 2020 the spatial distribution of the wqi fig 7 shows that poor to very poor quality water is observed in the central part downstream of the study area this quality is the result of several factors such as the dissolution of evaporative formations rich in salts halite gypsum and anhydrite contamination by animal droppings distance from the recharge area residence time and overexploitation 6 evaluation of water quality for irrigation purposes 6 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar is used to assess the risk of soil alkalinisation by irrigation water a large amount of sodium ions in water affects the permeability of soils and poses problems of infiltration this is because the sodium present in the soil in exchangeable form replaces the calcium and magnesium adsorbed on the soil clays and causes the dispersion of the particles in the soil sar is widely used to study the suitability of water for irrigation richards 1954 the table shows the distribution of the samples in each aquifer according to the values recorded in sar it can be seen that the points which capture all the aquifers have excellent to good quality except for the two points p89 and p74 which respectively capture the aquifers plio quaternary and hauterivian where the quality is questionable to unsuitable for irrigation purposes the study of the adequacy of water to irrigation standards based on this index is made according to two major classes table 3 the first class includes water points with 0 sar 18 as is the case for the majority of the samples analysed thus characterizing a reduced danger of alkalinisation of the soils by irrigation water especially coarse textured soils or organic soils with good permeability the second class sar 18 with very high sodium levels which includes the two points p74 and p89 presents water of poor to unusable quality for irrigation and this can cause the appearance of a dangerous alkalinity in most soils with the exception of poor clay soils the work requires the implementation of a special arrangement ensuring good drainage and strong leaching the addition of organic matter chemical amendments is often necessary fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of sar for each aquifer the maximums recorded in the west towards the atlantic coast where the na concentrations are very high however the waters studied are of adequate quality for agricultural purposes 6 2 sodium percentage na the na is a parameter widely used in the classification of irrigation water wilcox 1955 plants do not tolerate soils saturated with sodium making it one of the most undesirable elements in irrigation water this element causes weathering of rock and soil seawater intrusions treated water and irrigation systems in this study we distinguish between two classes according to the percentage of sodium na the first groups together the samples having an excellent good and admissible quality na 60 the second groups the points having a doubtful to unsuitable quality for the cenomano turonian aquifer the na values vary between 4 79 and 57 25 hence the suitability of these waters for agricultural use for the waters of the plio quaternary aquifer the sodium percentage varies between 19 07 and 76 60 with the exception of points p89 p91 and p121 all the points which capture this aquifer do not pose any risk to agricultural soils for the hauterivian aquifer only points p71 and p74 which are classified from doubtful to unsuitable quality table 3 the spatial distribution of na is very similar to that of sar the high values are observed downstream of the wadis and around meskala the map fig 11 shows the areas where the waters are unusable for irrigation the anomalies observed at the coastal points suggest the phenomenon of marine intrusion 6 3 kelly s ratio kr kelly s ratio kelley et al 1940 is represented by the ratio of the concentrations of na meq l and the sum of ca2 and mg2 meq l it is among the indices constituting a basis for determining the suitability of water for irrigation the high concentration of na in the water used for irrigation is considered unsuitable for its use according to the kr values two classes can be distinguished kr 1 groups together the water points considered to be good for irrigation and kr 1 corresponds to water not suitable for irrigation purposes for the waters of the plio quaternary aquifer kr varies between 0 21 and 3 20 38 reflecting that the waters of this aquifer are inadequate while for the hauterivian aquifer almost 23 of the samples analysed have kr values 1 thus reflecting poor quality for irrigation for the cenomano turonian aquifer all the samples meet the desirable standards for this index with the exception of points p67 and p69 table 3 the spatial distribution fig 12 shows that the zones with kr 1 are located in the west towards the ocean which confirms the hypothesis of the effect of marine intrusion 6 4 magnesium ratio mr the percentage of magnesium or danger of magnesium expresses the measure of the effect of magnesium in the irrigation water it is widely used to classify irrigation water excess magnesium affects soil quality which can result in low crop yields for water intended for irrigation the magnesium rate must be greater than 50 to increase the alkalinity of the soil and consequently increase crop yield in all aquifers table 3 the percentage of magnesium varies between 22 15 and 79 97 for the cenomano turonian aquifer 15 points sampled have mr values 50 not suitable for agricultural purposes for the plio quaternary aquifer mr varies between 22 15 and 72 42 and 4 points analysed have poor quality for irrigation as is the case for the hauterivian aquifer with a variation between 31 61 and 79 97 this index has a spatial distribution fig 13 deferent to the indices already mentioned the waters with high magnesium values in the hauterivian aquifer are located in the vicinity of points p87 and p86 and in points p33 which corresponds to the zerrar dam p31 p35 and p55 in the cenomano turonian aquifer for the plio quaternary aquifer high values are recorded towards the level at points p89 p90 and p91 this variation is explained by the effect of the dissolution of the surrounding formations 6 5 corrosivity ratio cr the corrosivity ratio is one of the parameters of the evaluation of the quality of water intended for irrigation as well as the corrosive nature of the water ryznar 1944 according to the cr values two classes can be distinguished cr 1 which characterizes water with corrosive power which requires a non metallic pipe cr 1 characterizes water without corrosive effect and which is transported via any type of pipe the waters of the cenomano turonian aquifer have cr values between 0 64 and 15 26 with an average of 4 09 61 points which capture this aquifer have a corrosive character for the plio quaternary and hauterivian aquifers only points p87 and p94 which have cr values 1 the rest requires a pipe which supports the corrosive effect of the water table 3 the figure fig 14 shows the spatial distribution of the corrosivity ratio in the aquifers studied this distribution varies from one aquifer to another we also note that for the coastal aquifers hauterivian and plio quaternary the highest values are observed towards the western end the corrosion rate depends on certain factors such as temperature pressure and water flow but also it is controlled by the contents of cl and so4 2 as the case of our study area 6 6 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual alkalinity is only the concept proposed by eaton 1950 and by richards 1954 called residual sodium carbonates rsc it is defined as being the part of the alkalinity which does not is not neutralized by divalent cations it is often considered to precipitate calcite and sepiolite according to lloyd and heathcote 1985 water with an rsc value of less than 2 5 is of suitable to marginally suitable quality for irrigation but an rsc value greater than 2 5 is considered dangerous for irrigation the points analysed in the essaouira basin show that the waters of the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers have good quality for irrigation and do not pose any danger to plants table 3 the spatial distribution fig 15 shows that the high values of this index are recorded upstream of the wadis 6 7 permeability index pi the permeability of the soil is affected by the long term use of irrigation water this parameter is influenced by the content of sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate in the soil three classes are distinguished according to the values recorded in pi points with pi values 75 have excellent quality for irrigation 25 pi 75 reflects good quality for irrigation pi 25 corresponds to water with undesirable quality all the points which capture the plio quaternary and hauterivian aquifers have good to excellent quality as for the cenomano turonian aquifer with the exception of seven points which are of poor quality the rest of the water points are of good quality table 3 7 stable isotopes the isotopic study is of paramount importance in modern groundwater studies it provides important information that facilitates the identification of the water masses origin and the history of their movement at the surface and at depth isotopic tracing will also allow us to understand the groundwater recharge mechanism to determine the origin of water mineralization and to estimate their recharge attitude ait brahim et al 2016 elmeknassi et al 2022 the isotope contents are expressed in reference smow standard mean ocean water representative of the average isotopic composition of the oceans for the present study the stable isotopes of the water molecule 18o and 2h were used table 4 for the same element the ratio of the amount of heavy isotope to the amount of common isotope can be modified during phase changes such as the condensation of water from clouds or the evaporation of the ocean water which allows a natural isotopic tracing of water about 40 samples taken in july 2020 were the subject of isotopic analyses to define the recharge origin to estimate the supply altitudes and to determine the relationships between surface and groundwater in addition these isotopes make it possible to highlight and to have information on the requirements that groundwater can have such as the mixing and evaporation phenomenon the isotopic values in δ18o and δ2h of cenomano turonian waters are respectively between 6 31 and 0 58 with an average of 5 2 and between 39 2 and 2 2 with an average of 29 03 the correlation diagram of oxygen 18 vs deuterium fig 16 a where the local meteorological line δ2h 7 55 δ18o 9 2 bahir et al 2000 mennani et al 2001 and the global meteoric water line δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 have been located shows that the majority of points are closed to gmwl and the lmwl this reflects that the recharge of the cenomano turonian aquifer is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin the 18o vs ec diagram concentrations fig 16b show that the groundwater mineralization is governed by dissolution phenomenon the relationship established between oxygen 18 and chloride contents can provide several information on the mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of the saline load in the studied aquifer fig 16c shows the lack of correlation between 18o and chloride levels in the waters of the cenomano turonian aquifer this indicates that the mineralization is acquired by the phenomenon of dissolution of the minerals this is also confirmed by the hydrogeochemical approach which suggests that water mineralization is not linked to evaporation but essentially comes from the dissolution of minerals following water rock contact such a dissimilarity between the isotopic contents can only be explained by a difference in the temperature of condensation of the local precipitations and those which contributed to the recharge of the aquifers studied this thermal difference is probably linked to an altitude effect this effect means that the groundwater recharge took place at a higher altitude than that where the local precipitation formed in order to confirm or refute this altitude effect it is necessary to estimate the groundwater recharge altitude and check whether this altitude coincides well with the altitudes of the outcrops of the aquifer formation in the region thus by adopting an average altitude gradient for oxygen 18 of 0 26 100 m bahir et al 2000 2001 mennani et al 2001 the projection of each point on the line with the equation δ18o 2 6 10 3 x altitude 3 bouchaou et al 2005 fig 16d shows that the majority of samples should be loaded at altitudes between 400 and 1400 masl some points have altitudes far exceeding the maximum altitude of the study area about 800 masl this reflects that the recharge zone of these points is outside the study area some other water points show that the recharge altitudes coincide well with its outcrop altitudes in particular at the kourimat region the two samples located above the line of the altitudinal gradient reflect the evaporative effect the quantification of groundwater mixing fractions could be quantified using 18o or deuterium isotopic contents the latter are characterized by their conservation throughout the mixing process cruz and silva 2000 according to clark and fritz 2013 the mixing process between two end members as a function of the δ18o content is δ 18 o s a m p l e m δ 18 o a 1 m δ 18 o b where m is the proportion of the mixture and δ18oa and δ18ob are the isotopic content of the end members of the mixture a and b the results were calculated using the unevaporated samples in this work the calculations are based on the average of the surface water isotopic contents and the groundwater isotopic content is considered to be representative of the whole aquifer because of the homogeneous hydrogeological characteristics the mixing ratios deduced from the stable isotope mass balance prove that the contribution of surface water to the cenomano turonian aquifer varies between 32 16 and 70 42 this reflect the close relationship between surface water and groundwater of the cenomano turonian aquifer the high rate of mixing is observed downstream according to the direction of underground flow determined by rafik et al 2021 8 conclusion at the end of this study focused on the combination of quality index isotopic and gis techniques to assess water resources in a semi arid context water resources in essaouira becoming increasingly critical as a result of population growth and climate change the hydrogeochemical results and the use of the geographic information system show that the waters of the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers have mixed facies ca mg cl ca hco3 ca cl and ca so4 the majority of samples projected on the chadha diagram show the dominance of calcium and magnesium chloride facies the water mineralization is controlled by the dissolution of the host rocks halite gypsum dolomite and calcite by the effect of seawater intrusion and by the phenomenon of reverse cation exchange according to the standards set by the world health organization who 2017 the water in this study has an adequate and acceptable quality with respect to ph ec ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 except for a few water points in the cenomano turonian aquifer which exceed the admissible limits and consequently require a treatment of cl and so4 2 before being consumed for the water for irrigation purposes the indices sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na kelly s ratio kr magnesium ratio mr corrosivity ratio cr residual sodium carbonate rsc permeability index pi and salinity hazard ec show that the surface and groundwater are adequate for these purposes the water resources of essaouira meet the standards according to the indices used except for ec where almost 50 of the points are of poor quality and for cr the waters require a non corrosive pipe especially for plants which adapt to high salinity tracing the groundwater of the essaouira basin with stable isotopes of water has made it possible to determine the origin mode and recharge areas of these waters the correlation between the deuterium and oxygen 18 contents of the groundwater of the cenomano turonian aquifer highlighted that the recharge of this water is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin without significant evaporation at altitudes varying between 400 and 1400 masl the mixing ratios deduced from the stable isotope mass balance prove that the contribution of surface water to the cenomano turonian aquifer varies between 32 16 and 70 42 the spatial distribution of wqi shows that there is roughly a slight improvement of the quality even though the prolonged drought in the region this is explained by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic which has caused a total shutdown of tourist activity the results of this study could provide valuable information on the quality of water for drinking and irrigation purposes in the essaouira basin and will consequently allow better management of these resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

11858,in arid and semi arid zones water resources remain unknown in terms of quality and quantity the current paper aims to evaluate the water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes within the essaouira basin and to define the origin and recharge areas of groundwater 122 samples from the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers as well as surface water were taken in july 2020 are the subject of hydrogeochemical analyses based on the results of these analyses almost all elements are within the allowable limit fixed by who except cl and so4 2 in a few points which require treatment before human consumption the indices sar na kr mr cr rsc pi and ec show that the water of the study area is adequate for agricultural purposes therefore the waters of essaouira basin meet the standards according to the indices used except for ec where almost 50 of the points have poor quality and for cr the waters require a non corrosive pipe the spatial distribution of wqi shows a slight improvement of the quality even though the prolonged drought in the region this is explained by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic which has caused a total shutdown of tourist activity tracing the waters using stable isotopes 18o and 2h show that the recharge of these waters is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin without significant evaporation and the recharge altitude varies between 400 and 1400 m the mixing ratios deduced from the mass balance of stable isotopes shows that surface water contributes between 32 16 and 70 42 to the cenomano turonian aquifer recharge

and this manifests as iguerounzar wadi drains the cenomano turonian aquifer via several sources on the other side the hauterivian and plio quaternary aquifers drain igouzoullene and ksoub wadis

this study will be useful as a reference for local government interventions to better manage and protect this important resource 1 1 study area the region studied is essaouira part of the moroccan atlantic coastline covering an area of 3500 km2 between latitudes 31 05 and 31 78 north and longitudes 9 06 and 9 84 west it is limited to the north by the hadid anticline to the south by the wadi igouzoulene to the east by the bouabout unit and the atlantic ocean to the west fig 1 this basin is characterized by a moderately dense hydrographic network on a low hilly terrain the essaouira basin is part of morocco s semi arid environments with very irregular rainfall that does not exceed 300 mm year on average ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 the average temperature fluctuates around 20 c and the thermal amplitude between the driest month august and the coldest month january can reach 17 c mennani et al 2001 from the point of view of groundwater resources the study area contains 10 of the aquifers of morocco the reservoirs concerned by this study are the upper cenomanian turonian aquifer is formed of limestone and dolomite limestone bounded at the base and upper by gray clay and white marl from the lower cenomanian and senonian respectively the plio quaternary aquifer is composed of formations of dune sandstones or marine limestone and contains a free groundwater table the turonian aquifer is located under the senonian marls and is in contact with the plio quaternary aquifer in the northern part towards ksoub wadi and at the level of the tidzi diapir in the east and the essaouira diapir in the west bahir et al 2013 2008 2000 mennani et al 2001 ouhamdouch et al 2018 rafik et al 2021 the hauterivien aquifer is made up of moderately fractured and altered silty and marly clays alternating with siliceous and marly limestones marly siltstones as well as moderately fractured dolomitic limestones duffaud 1960 rey et al 1988 the main tributaries which cross the basin are iguerounzar and ouazi with an average direction of se nw which originate in the high atlas and drain the cenomano turonian aquifer via more than 15 sources which makes them perennial to the south of iguerounzar wadi extends zelten wadi not perennial their intersection with the first is at the level of the zerrar dam which was launched in 2008 with a reservoir capacity of 70 mm3 to supply drinking water to the city of essaouira and the surrounding villages and for the irrigation of 1000 ha of agricultural land bahir et al 2019 2020 2021a ksoub wadi crosses the synclinal basin of essaouira from a direction of flow to the nw receives water from the releases of the zerrar dam and feeds the cenomano turonian aquifer by infiltration towards the southern end of the basin lies igouzoullene wadi which drains the hauterivian aquifer most of the volumes flowing into this wadi are regulated by the igouzoulene dam located upstream with a capacity of 17 mm3 launched in 2004 to meet the needs in drinking water from the tamanar region and irrigation of the plots 2 materials and methods this study is based on the data of the sampling mission which was carried out in july 2020 122 samples 106

parameters ph ec ca mg na k hco3 cl so4 and no3 is used to assess the quality of water resources in the essaouira basin for domestic uses the period targeted by this study is called the low water period the choice of this parameter is that it is easy to apprehend by decision makers to understand the qualitative situation and to act in the face of challenges the wqi calculation allows to attribute a value to each sampled point each value is in the wqi range which corresponds to a water quality w q i i 1 n wi qi wi where wi is the relative weight for the parameter physiochemical i and qi is the quality index for each parameter i the relative weight wi is calculated using the following equation to give each of the ten parameters a weight according to their relative importance w i k

results and discussion 3 1 chemical facies and water mineralization the chadha diagram chadha 1999 is one of the most used diagrams to classify waters according to their chemical facies it also helps to understand and to define plausible hydrogeochemical processes dominating the chemistry of groundwater such as mixing ion exchange and dissolution affecting the composition of groundwater these diagrams are widely used in hydrochemistry and give satisfactory results based on this diagram fig 2 the waters representing the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers are characterized by the facies calcium and magnesium chloride sodium chloride calcium and magnesium bicarbonate calcium sulphate and sodium carbonate with a dominance of calcium and magnesium chloride facies the correlation diagrams between the major elements as well as the saturation indices fig 3 a h show the existence of strong positive correlations between the elements na vs cl ca2 vs so42 and ca2 vs mg2 this reflects the same origin of these elements the positive correlation between na and cl show the contribution of the halite dissolution in groundwater mineralization fig 3a h the parabolic proportional relationship in the diagram na cl vs si with respect to the halite support the hypothesis of dissolution of the halite water samples are placed in the 1 1 line indicating a deficit of na vs cl the excess cl is due to the effect of sea spray and dissolution of evaporates the two points far from all points reflect the marine intrusion effect p74 and p89 coming respectively from the hauterivian and plio quaternary aquifers the ca so4 diagram shows that few points are scattered around the 1 1 line this meant that the dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite is limited the excess in so4 is explained by gypsum dissolution and this hypothesis is supported by the parabolic proportional relationship in the ca so4 diagram vs si with respect to gypsum fig 3a h ca mg diagram fig 3a h shows that the samples are scattered around the right side of the 1 1 line with a slight excess of ca this excess could be explained by the reverse ion exchange phenomenon the correlation between ca2 and hco3 fig 3a h showed a weak correlation for the majority of water samples some points were scattered around the calcite dissolution line 1 1 line this suggests the contribution of calcite dissolution to the waters mineralization in essaouira this hypothesis was corroborated by negative saturation index values with respect to calcite and vice versa for points with positive si values relative to calcite 3 2 multivariate statistical analysis fig 4 groups the values of the factors the first two factors dim1 and dim2 represent 79 6 65 8 and 83 6 of the variance expressed for the three plio quaternary pq cenomano turonian ct and hauterivian ha aquifers respectively these factors combine the maximum of the expressed variance and are sufficient to reflect the information sought the analysis of the variables of the principal component analysis pca normalized in the factorial plane dim1 dim2 is represented in fig 4 which highlights two groups among the studied parameters for the plio quaternary the first group around the dim1 axis 67 1 45 3 and 69 8 of the total inertia of the cloud for the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers respectively and which takes into account ec cl na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 show a mineralization of water by the phenomenon of rock dissolution the dim1 factor appears as an axis of global water mineralization the different variables have high correlation coefficients between them the dim2 factor alone explains 12 5 20 5 and 13 8 of the total cloud inertia for the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers respectively it is characterized by no3 and ph shows anthropogenic mineralization of superficial origin as a result of livestock waste and poor treatment of domestic wastewater fig 4 4 evaluation of water quality for drinking purposes evaluating the quality of drinking water is a necessity to ensure that this vital resource meets health standards there are more than 70 criteria framed by strict regulations that impose standards defining the required quality of water intended for human consumption the quality of the water is checked regularly to guarantee its potability and to report any contamination which may be of either anthropogenic or natural origin in this study we are interested in the physicochemical quality based on the standards of the world health organization who 2017 the correlations matrix of physicochemical parameters shows considerable correlation links between some parameters table 1 these correlations reflect that these elements have the same sources with the exception of hco3 and no3 the rest of the elements contribute significantly in the salinization of the waters as shown by the strong correlations with the ec 4 1 hydrogen potential ph the ph is an indicator that reflects the concentration of h ion it is an effective indicator to assess the water state for example their degree of pollution it controls several physicochemical balances for this study the ph values varies between 6 5 and 8 5 table 2 according to the standards set by who the waters are within the acceptable limit indicating the alkaline nature of the waters in the essaouira basin 4 2 electrical conductivity ec is a determining factor for water quality it reflects the capacity of water to conduct current between two electrodes separated from each other by 1 cm bremond and vuichard 1973 the dissolved matter in water is found as electrically charged ions hence the importance of measuring ec in quantifying dissolved salts in water rafik et al 2022 the potability of water according to this parameter is acceptable if it does not exceed 1500 μs cm threshold required by who in the essaouira basin the values of ec oscillate between 0 48 and 26 77 ms cm based on this parameter 69 of the samples capturing the cenomano turonian aquifer have poor quality caused by increased salinity table 2 surface water is generally more mineralized than groundwater following the leaching of the formations crossed before being discharged and the evaporation phenomenon the increase in water exploitation in the face of a low renewal rate creates more and more pressure on water resources which has thus led to the degradation of their quality especially the cenomano turonian aquifer fig 5 shows the monitoring of the spatio temporal distribution of water salinity using the results of the 2017 2018 and 2019 campaigns and compares them with the state in 2020 the 2017 campaign the salinity fluctuates between 0 3 and 4 g l with an average of 1 29 g l in 2018 the salinity values varied between 0 4 and 4 3 g l with an average of 1 4 g l and between 0 35 and 4 4 g l with an average of 1 4 for samples from the 2019 campaign in 2020 the water points with values above 4 g l will increase in all the aquifers the situation of salinity becomes worrying in the region of essaouira especially that the values in some points for example the region of sebt kourimat recharge zone of the cenomanian turonian aquifer the salinity values increase by more than 6 times comparing the situation with the nineties it can be seen that the salinity values become more important as time goes forward and goes from east to west during the four campaigns generally the salinity of the waters mineralization in the essaouira region increases the mineralization increases from upstream to downstream of the hauterivian aquifer and attends values 18 times higher than the standard value as the case of point p74 which is already affected by the marine intrusion 13 samples from this aquifer exceed the threshold set by the who for the plio quaternary aquifer 25 samples outside who requirements ec values are generally higher in the eastern and western parts this increase is due to the dissolution of salt formations of the triassic and the marine intrusion impact 4 3 calcium the calcium concentrations vary from one aquifer to another depending on the nature of the host limestone rocks are the major source of this element in the waters in the essaouira basin the ca2 contents vary between 51 57 and 454 71 mg l in the plio quaternary aquifer all the samples show concentrations below 200 mg l which corresponds to the potability standards with the exception of points p89 p97 and p107 which have values outside the threshold required by who for the cenomano turonian aquifer calcium varies between 68 67 and 699 09 mg l with an average of 196 80 mg l 21 water points in this aquifer have an impermissible quality for drinking purposes the high calcium values reflect the strong dissolution of dolomite and or calcite as well as other calcium minerals such as gypsum the points taken from the hauterivian aquifer show ca2 contents ranging from 18 61 to 341 06 mg l point p74 is the only point which exceeds the desirable limit of the who and is located towards the downstream end of igouzoullene wadi table 2 the spatial distribution of ca2 figs 7 9 of the coastal aquifers plio quaternary and hauterivian shows that the high values are located at the ocean continent limit surface and groundwater in these two aquifers are of good quality based on this element as for the cenomano turonian aquifer 32 of water points exceed the threshold of 200 mg l who 2017 4 4 magnesium magnesium is one of the most common elements in nature and important to the hardness of water the main origin of this element in the essaouira basin is the dolomitic limestones of the jurassic and the triassic on the basis of this element the samples capturing the plio quaternary aquifer with the exception of two points p89 and p107 meet the potability standards 150 mg l who 2017 for the cenomano turonian aquifer the magnesium concentration varies between 14 69 and 285 mg l 57 points which capture this aquifer are of good quality the samples analysed from the hauterivian aquifer have mg2 contents below the threshold of 150 mg l set by who i e they have good quality with the exception of point p74 which has an anomaly with a value six times the norm probably suggesting the effect of marine intrusion table 2 the spatial distribution of mg2 is similar to that of ca2 figs 7 9 which indicates the existence of a positive correlation between these two elements this observation gives a hypothesis that calcium and magnesium in water have the same origin 4 5 sodium sodium is a highly reactive element in water stallard and edmond 1983 it is very abundant in the waters due to its rapid release during the processes of dissolution of geological formations the high levels of na can be of several origins such as anthropogenic activity marine intrusion brackish water infiltration alteration of silicate minerals ouhamdouch et al 2018 rafik et al 2021 rodier 1978 and or cations exchange mechanism within the aquifers of the essaouira basin the concentration of na varies between 22 04 and 7117 64 mg l 17 samples capturing the plio quaternary aquifer exceed the permissible limit 200 mg l recommended by who table 2 concerning the cenomano turonian aquifer 30 of the samples do not meet the drinking water requirements while for the hauterivian aquifer 4 water points exceed the maximum admissible content for human consumption according to figs 7 9 the na contents increase going from upstream to downstream for the hauterivian aquifer the maximum value is recorded in point p74 which is very close to the ocean the points that capturing the plio quaternary aquifer have na concentrations below 490 mg l with the exception of point p89 which records an extreme value of around 6079 29 mg l for the cenomano turonian aquifer the concentrations increase going from se to nw flow direction the maximum value of sodium concentration is observed in the downstream of ouazi wadi at the level of p69 and downstream of iguerounzar wadi at the level of points p31 and p32 these anomalies are due to the dissolution of the triassic evaporites formations and to the effect of seawater intrusion 4 6 potassium potassium is present in water with low levels compared to other major elements the contribution of k in water mineralization is minimal in the essaouira basin the potassium concentration varies between 0 64 and 230 98 mg l waters that exceed a concentration of 30 mg l in k are considered unacceptable for human consumption according to who standards table 2 all the points which capture the aquifers studied have good quality with the exception of points p23 and p69 capturing the cenomano turonian aquifer p89 and p118 capturing the plio quaternary aquifer and p74 capturing the hauterivian aquifer the map of the spatial variation of potassium figs 7 9 shows that the points most affected by high concentrations are located towards the ocean which reflects the effect of marine intrusion potassium is found in several minerals such as sylvinite and corrollite and in plant ashes as carbonate agricultural activity provides water through the soil with significant concentrations of potassium by leaching fertilizers in the form of potassium bound to nitrate chloride and or sulphate 4 7 chloride chlorides are inorganic anions found in varying concentrations in natural waters in natural waters the concentration varies according to the nature of the formations crossed the degree of contamination by marine intrusion and the degree of pollution by industrial or anthropogenic discharges the high contents are presented in large quantities in seawater 19 g l their concentration in rainwater is approximately 3 mg l the maximum concentration of cl recommended by who is 250 mg l for the plio quaternary aquifer the contents vary between 74 44 and 10741 23 mg l with an average of 801 68 mg l 82 of the points which capture this aquifer exceed the standard in cl concerning the waters of the cenomano turonian aquifer the chloride concentrations vary between 40 36 and 1569 04 mg l with an average of 441 99 mg l based on this element 38 water points are of poor quality for the hauterivian aquifer the chloride contents vary between 45 02 and 11574 52 mg l with an average of 928 80 56 of the points sampled exceed the desired value table 2 the spatial distribution of cl figs 7 9 shows that the high values are marked in the eastern part downstream of each aquifer the maximum levels for the hauterivian and plio quaternary aquifer are recorded respectively at points p74 and p89 coastal points testifying to marine intrusion for the cenomano turonian aquifer high concentrations are observed at points p23 p33 p12 p31 and p42 under the effect of evaporitic gypsiferous soils 4 8 bicarbonate bicarbonates hco3 are an essential element which controls the alkalinity of water via a process of dissolution of the surrounding carbonate formations or by the infiltration of carbon contained in the soil and the air in the form of co2 for a deep aquifers the major source of bicarbonates is limestone and dolomitic rocks the samples capturing the plio quaternary aquifer have hco3 concentrations varying between 143 96 and 470 92 mg l five samples exceed the 380 mg l concentration the only one admissible by who as for the cenomano turonian aquifer the bicarbonate contents vary between 161 04 and 680 mg l which 25 samples have an unacceptable quality for the hauterivian aquifer the concentrations vary between 141 52 and 509 96 mg l where 56 of the samples exceed the acceptable limit for this element table 2 the high grade points occupy the northern part of the plio quaternary and cenomano turonian aquifers and the eastern part of the hauterivian aquifer figs 7 9 4 9 sulphate water sulphate come from the dissolution of rocks rich in gypsum iron sulphides and or the infiltration of acidic meteoric water resulting from sulfur compounds in the present study the so4 2 contents of the samples capturing the plio quaternary varied between 23 5 and 2098 mg l the waters of this aquifer have an acceptable quality except for points p89 and p100 that exceed the potability threshold 250 mg l set by who for the hauterivian aquifer the concentrations for all the points varies between 90 80 and 250 mg l with the exception of point p74 which records an extreme value of 2320 mg l the points analysed from the cenomano turonian aquifer show that the variation is between 26 and 2106 mg l which 22 samples exceed the standard in this element table 2 the spatial variation figs 7 9 shows that the high concentrations are recorded downstream of the plio quaternary and hauterivian aquifers for the cenomano turonian aquifer the high values are recorded around kourimat and meskala caused by the carbonate matrix and by the cenomanian and jurassic soils rich in gypsum 4 10 nitrate nitrates is an element resulting from the oxidation nitrogen their presence in polluted water attests that the self purification process has already started human activity accelerates the process of enrichment in this element via the leaching of nitrogenous products accumulated in soils such as organic matter fertilizers and or discharges from mineral industries chenaker et al 2017 ouhamdouch et al 2018 ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 however the nitrate ion in water is undesirable if it exceeds the allowable limit of 50 mg l who 2017 the points analysed in the plio quaternary aquifer have no3 contents varying between 0 17 and 149 67 mg l 12 of these samples have concentrations higher than the standard accepted by the who for the cenomano turonian aquifer the nitrate values vary between 0 06 and 940 49 mg l 26 samples from this aquifer are not adequate for drinking water standards for the points which capture the hauterivian aquifer the contents vary between 0 22 and 226 77 mg l all the samples have an acceptable quality except points p71 and p76 table 2 in the study area high nitrate values are recorded downstream of the ouazi wadi and around points p69 and p68 which capture the cenomano turonian aquifer figs 7 9 at point p105 located near of tidzi village and point p90 towards the ocean which captures the plio quaternary aquifer the levels are also high downstream from igouzoullene wadi p71 these high concentrations are mainly due to human activity such as poor treatment of domestic wastewater and livestock waste in the light of these results it is therefore necessary to treat the water from these polluted points before any consumption 5 estimation of water quality index wqi the water quality index wqi is a simple index that is easy to understand by non specialists in hydrogeochemistry and by concerned decision makers at different scales the calculation of wqi for two sampling companions in the low waters of 2019 and 2020 shows that the aquifers of essaouira are sensitive and record fast fluctuations in quality following different sources of disturbance such as climate change the degree of exploitation and the degree of human pollution etc the spatial distribution of wqi fig 6 shows that there is roughly a slight improvement of the quality even though the prolonged drought in the region this is explained maybe by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic which has caused a total shutdown of tourist activity the rainfall conditions changed little between 2019 and 2020 which suggests the impact of the implementation of national containment covid 19 and the lockdown have shown its influence on the chemical composition of water as well as on water quality as demonstrated in the work of chakraborty et al 2021 tokatlı and varol 2021 this has led to a great reduction in the volumes of water exploited either at golf courses or at campsites and also activities linked to tourism the reduction in pumped volumes leads to a decrease in mineralization dilution effect is therefore an improvement in quality the results show that 11 of water in 2019 had good quality while in 2020 this category contains 17 5 of water samples approximately 56 of the samples are classified of poor quality in 2020 i e a slight increase in water points in this category compared to 54 in 2019 for the very poor quality 20 and 13 are recorded in 2019 and 2020 respectively for the unsuitable category we notice a decrease of about 3 of the sampled points of this quality from 2019 to 2020 the spatial distribution of the wqi fig 7 shows that poor to very poor quality water is observed in the central part downstream of the study area this quality is the result of several factors such as the dissolution of evaporative formations rich in salts halite gypsum and anhydrite contamination by animal droppings distance from the recharge area residence time and overexploitation 6 evaluation of water quality for irrigation purposes 6 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar is used to assess the risk of soil alkalinisation by irrigation water a large amount of sodium ions in water affects the permeability of soils and poses problems of infiltration this is because the sodium present in the soil in exchangeable form replaces the calcium and magnesium adsorbed on the soil clays and causes the dispersion of the particles in the soil sar is widely used to study the suitability of water for irrigation richards 1954 the table shows the distribution of the samples in each aquifer according to the values recorded in sar it can be seen that the points which capture all the aquifers have excellent to good quality except for the two points p89 and p74 which respectively capture the aquifers plio quaternary and hauterivian where the quality is questionable to unsuitable for irrigation purposes the study of the adequacy of water to irrigation standards based on this index is made according to two major classes table 3 the first class includes water points with 0 sar 18 as is the case for the majority of the samples analysed thus characterizing a reduced danger of alkalinisation of the soils by irrigation water especially coarse textured soils or organic soils with good permeability the second class sar 18 with very high sodium levels which includes the two points p74 and p89 presents water of poor to unusable quality for irrigation and this can cause the appearance of a dangerous alkalinity in most soils with the exception of poor clay soils the work requires the implementation of a special arrangement ensuring good drainage and strong leaching the addition of organic matter chemical amendments is often necessary fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of sar for each aquifer the maximums recorded in the west towards the atlantic coast where the na concentrations are very high however the waters studied are of adequate quality for agricultural purposes 6 2 sodium percentage na the na is a parameter widely used in the classification of irrigation water wilcox 1955 plants do not tolerate soils saturated with sodium making it one of the most undesirable elements in irrigation water this element causes weathering of rock and soil seawater intrusions treated water and irrigation systems in this study we distinguish between two classes according to the percentage of sodium na the first groups together the samples having an excellent good and admissible quality na 60 the second groups the points having a doubtful to unsuitable quality for the cenomano turonian aquifer the na values vary between 4 79 and 57 25 hence the suitability of these waters for agricultural use for the waters of the plio quaternary aquifer the sodium percentage varies between 19 07 and 76 60 with the exception of points p89 p91 and p121 all the points which capture this aquifer do not pose any risk to agricultural soils for the hauterivian aquifer only points p71 and p74 which are classified from doubtful to unsuitable quality table 3 the spatial distribution of na is very similar to that of sar the high values are observed downstream of the wadis and around meskala the map fig 11 shows the areas where the waters are unusable for irrigation the anomalies observed at the coastal points suggest the phenomenon of marine intrusion 6 3 kelly s ratio kr kelly s ratio kelley et al 1940 is represented by the ratio of the concentrations of na meq l and the sum of ca2 and mg2 meq l it is among the indices constituting a basis for determining the suitability of water for irrigation the high concentration of na in the water used for irrigation is considered unsuitable for its use according to the kr values two classes can be distinguished kr 1 groups together the water points considered to be good for irrigation and kr 1 corresponds to water not suitable for irrigation purposes for the waters of the plio quaternary aquifer kr varies between 0 21 and 3 20 38 reflecting that the waters of this aquifer are inadequate while for the hauterivian aquifer almost 23 of the samples analysed have kr values 1 thus reflecting poor quality for irrigation for the cenomano turonian aquifer all the samples meet the desirable standards for this index with the exception of points p67 and p69 table 3 the spatial distribution fig 12 shows that the zones with kr 1 are located in the west towards the ocean which confirms the hypothesis of the effect of marine intrusion 6 4 magnesium ratio mr the percentage of magnesium or danger of magnesium expresses the measure of the effect of magnesium in the irrigation water it is widely used to classify irrigation water excess magnesium affects soil quality which can result in low crop yields for water intended for irrigation the magnesium rate must be greater than 50 to increase the alkalinity of the soil and consequently increase crop yield in all aquifers table 3 the percentage of magnesium varies between 22 15 and 79 97 for the cenomano turonian aquifer 15 points sampled have mr values 50 not suitable for agricultural purposes for the plio quaternary aquifer mr varies between 22 15 and 72 42 and 4 points analysed have poor quality for irrigation as is the case for the hauterivian aquifer with a variation between 31 61 and 79 97 this index has a spatial distribution fig 13 deferent to the indices already mentioned the waters with high magnesium values in the hauterivian aquifer are located in the vicinity of points p87 and p86 and in points p33 which corresponds to the zerrar dam p31 p35 and p55 in the cenomano turonian aquifer for the plio quaternary aquifer high values are recorded towards the level at points p89 p90 and p91 this variation is explained by the effect of the dissolution of the surrounding formations 6 5 corrosivity ratio cr the corrosivity ratio is one of the parameters of the evaluation of the quality of water intended for irrigation as well as the corrosive nature of the water ryznar 1944 according to the cr values two classes can be distinguished cr 1 which characterizes water with corrosive power which requires a non metallic pipe cr 1 characterizes water without corrosive effect and which is transported via any type of pipe the waters of the cenomano turonian aquifer have cr values between 0 64 and 15 26 with an average of 4 09 61 points which capture this aquifer have a corrosive character for the plio quaternary and hauterivian aquifers only points p87 and p94 which have cr values 1 the rest requires a pipe which supports the corrosive effect of the water table 3 the figure fig 14 shows the spatial distribution of the corrosivity ratio in the aquifers studied this distribution varies from one aquifer to another we also note that for the coastal aquifers hauterivian and plio quaternary the highest values are observed towards the western end the corrosion rate depends on certain factors such as temperature pressure and water flow but also it is controlled by the contents of cl and so4 2 as the case of our study area 6 6 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual alkalinity is only the concept proposed by eaton 1950 and by richards 1954 called residual sodium carbonates rsc it is defined as being the part of the alkalinity which does not is not neutralized by divalent cations it is often considered to precipitate calcite and sepiolite according to lloyd and heathcote 1985 water with an rsc value of less than 2 5 is of suitable to marginally suitable quality for irrigation but an rsc value greater than 2 5 is considered dangerous for irrigation the points analysed in the essaouira basin show that the waters of the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers have good quality for irrigation and do not pose any danger to plants table 3 the spatial distribution fig 15 shows that the high values of this index are recorded upstream of the wadis 6 7 permeability index pi the permeability of the soil is affected by the long term use of irrigation water this parameter is influenced by the content of sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate in the soil three classes are distinguished according to the values recorded in pi points with pi values 75 have excellent quality for irrigation 25 pi 75 reflects good quality for irrigation pi 25 corresponds to water with undesirable quality all the points which capture the plio quaternary and hauterivian aquifers have good to excellent quality as for the cenomano turonian aquifer with the exception of seven points which are of poor quality the rest of the water points are of good quality table 3 7 stable isotopes the isotopic study is of paramount importance in modern groundwater studies it provides important information that facilitates the identification of the water masses origin and the history of their movement at the surface and at depth isotopic tracing will also allow us to understand the groundwater recharge mechanism to determine the origin of water mineralization and to estimate their recharge attitude ait brahim et al 2016 elmeknassi et al 2022 the isotope contents are expressed in reference smow standard mean ocean water representative of the average isotopic composition of the oceans for the present study the stable isotopes of the water molecule 18o and 2h were used table 4 for the same element the ratio of the amount of heavy isotope to the amount of common isotope can be modified during phase changes such as the condensation of water from clouds or the evaporation of the ocean water which allows a natural isotopic tracing of water about 40 samples taken in july 2020 were the subject of isotopic analyses to define the recharge origin to estimate the supply altitudes and to determine the relationships between surface and groundwater in addition these isotopes make it possible to highlight and to have information on the requirements that groundwater can have such as the mixing and evaporation phenomenon the isotopic values in δ18o and δ2h of cenomano turonian waters are respectively between 6 31 and 0 58 with an average of 5 2 and between 39 2 and 2 2 with an average of 29 03 the correlation diagram of oxygen 18 vs deuterium fig 16 a where the local meteorological line δ2h 7 55 δ18o 9 2 bahir et al 2000 mennani et al 2001 and the global meteoric water line δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 have been located shows that the majority of points are closed to gmwl and the lmwl this reflects that the recharge of the cenomano turonian aquifer is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin the 18o vs ec diagram concentrations fig 16b show that the groundwater mineralization is governed by dissolution phenomenon the relationship established between oxygen 18 and chloride contents can provide several information on the mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of the saline load in the studied aquifer fig 16c shows the lack of correlation between 18o and chloride levels in the waters of the cenomano turonian aquifer this indicates that the mineralization is acquired by the phenomenon of dissolution of the minerals this is also confirmed by the hydrogeochemical approach which suggests that water mineralization is not linked to evaporation but essentially comes from the dissolution of minerals following water rock contact such a dissimilarity between the isotopic contents can only be explained by a difference in the temperature of condensation of the local precipitations and those which contributed to the recharge of the aquifers studied this thermal difference is probably linked to an altitude effect this effect means that the groundwater recharge took place at a higher altitude than that where the local precipitation formed in order to confirm or refute this altitude effect it is necessary to estimate the groundwater recharge altitude and check whether this altitude coincides well with the altitudes of the outcrops of the aquifer formation in the region thus by adopting an average altitude gradient for oxygen 18 of 0 26 100 m bahir et al 2000 2001 mennani et al 2001 the projection of each point on the line with the equation δ18o 2 6 10 3 x altitude 3 bouchaou et al 2005 fig 16d shows that the majority of samples should be loaded at altitudes between 400 and 1400 masl some points have altitudes far exceeding the maximum altitude of the study area about 800 masl this reflects that the recharge zone of these points is outside the study area some other water points show that the recharge altitudes coincide well with its outcrop altitudes in particular at the kourimat region the two samples located above the line of the altitudinal gradient reflect the evaporative effect the quantification of groundwater mixing fractions could be quantified using 18o or deuterium isotopic contents the latter are characterized by their conservation throughout the mixing process cruz and silva 2000 according to clark and fritz 2013 the mixing process between two end members as a function of the δ18o content is δ 18 o s a m p l e m δ 18 o a 1 m δ 18 o b where m is the proportion of the mixture and δ18oa and δ18ob are the isotopic content of the end members of the mixture a and b the results were calculated using the unevaporated samples in this work the calculations are based on the average of the surface water isotopic contents and the groundwater isotopic content is considered to be representative of the whole aquifer because of the homogeneous hydrogeological characteristics the mixing ratios deduced from the stable isotope mass balance prove that the contribution of surface water to the cenomano turonian aquifer varies between 32 16 and 70 42 this reflect the close relationship between surface water and groundwater of the cenomano turonian aquifer the high rate of mixing is observed downstream according to the direction of underground flow determined by rafik et al 2021 8 conclusion at the end of this study focused on the combination of quality index isotopic and gis techniques to assess water resources in a semi arid context water resources in essaouira becoming increasingly critical as a result of population growth and climate change the hydrogeochemical results and the use of the geographic information system show that the waters of the plio quaternary cenomano turonian and hauterivian aquifers have mixed facies ca mg cl ca hco3 ca cl and ca so4 the majority of samples projected on the chadha diagram show the dominance of calcium and magnesium chloride facies the water mineralization is controlled by the dissolution of the host rocks halite gypsum dolomite and calcite by the effect of seawater intrusion and by the phenomenon of reverse cation exchange according to the standards set by the world health organization who 2017 the water in this study has an adequate and acceptable quality with respect to ph ec ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 except for a few water points in the cenomano turonian aquifer which exceed the admissible limits and consequently require a treatment of cl and so4 2 before being consumed for the water for irrigation purposes the indices sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na kelly s ratio kr magnesium ratio mr corrosivity ratio cr residual sodium carbonate rsc permeability index pi and salinity hazard ec show that the surface and groundwater are adequate for these purposes the water resources of essaouira meet the standards according to the indices used except for ec where almost 50 of the points are of poor quality and for cr the waters require a non corrosive pipe especially for plants which adapt to high salinity tracing the groundwater of the essaouira basin with stable isotopes of water has made it possible to determine the origin mode and recharge areas of these waters the correlation between the deuterium and oxygen 18 contents of the groundwater of the cenomano turonian aquifer highlighted that the recharge of this water is ensured by precipitation of atlantic origin without significant evaporation at altitudes varying between 400 and 1400 masl the mixing ratios deduced from the stable isotope mass balance prove that the contribution of surface water to the cenomano turonian aquifer varies between 32 16 and 70 42 the spatial distribution of wqi shows that there is roughly a slight improvement of the quality even though the prolonged drought in the region this is explained by the impact of the covid 19 pandemic which has caused a total shutdown of tourist activity the results of this study could provide valuable information on the quality of water for drinking and irrigation purposes in the essaouira basin and will consequently allow better management of these resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

11859,in the present study a new framework is developed based on the geographical data gd data mining techniques di and hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making methods hf mcda for modeling groundwater table gwt missing data in damghan plain the gd is used as inputs in the presented approach and available gwt is used as output the different di including artificial neural network ann tree model m5 m5 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars least square support vector machine lssvm random forest rf and extreme learning machine elm are employed for establishing a relation between gd and gwt and estimating missing gwt however there is this challenge that one of the di is better because there are different criteria for selecting the best di including error criteria uncertainty and computation time moreover there is hesitation about the choice of weight criteria in this condition hf mcda is a practical choice according to the results m5 by values of 5 485 m 10 811 m and 0 998 for mae rmse and r2 respectively and lssvm by values of 3 043 m 17 005 m and 0 997 for mae rmse and r2 respectively have accurate results than other investigated di in contrast elm has the worst results in terms of accuracy m5 and rf have the best and worst performance based on the time computation term the results of bootstrap uncertainty show that lssvm has minimum uncertainty by the value of 1 349 m for d factor and elm has maximum uncertainty by the value of 1 570 m for d factor finally according to the results of hf mcda m5 lssvm has first and the second rank with a closed score besides the mars algorithm is placed b in the third rank with a slight difference from m5 and lssvm based on the high and closed scores of m5 lssvm and mars these methods can be used to find missing gwt data graphical abstract image 1 keywords missing data reconstruction geographical data data mining techniques hesitant fuzzy topsis uncertainty groundwater data in damghan plain 1 introduction groundwater table gwt modeling and predicting is one of the essential steps in water resources management gwt modeling and predicting results help decision makers for better programming in the field of sustainable growth of countries especially in regions where groundwater is the main water resource such as iran jamshidzadeh 2020 however missing data of gwt is an important limitation in modeling and predicting gwt the complete gwt data isn t available in some plains this issue can lead to inaccurate and unreliable gwt modeling in recent years many studies focused on the modeling of missing data the data mining method is one of the best methods for handling missing data these methods have been successfully used in many fields such as modeling maximum daily water temperature zhu and heddam 2019 estimating pan evaporation in the reservoir sebbar et al 2019 water hummer modeling salimi et al 2020 prediction min mean and max temperature azad et al 2019b precipitation modeling azad et al 2019a farrokhi et al 2020 minimizing irrigation deficiencies valikhan anaraki et al 2019 optimal design of open channel farzin and valikhan anaraki 2021 data mining methods have been utilized with reasonable accuracy in missing data modeling the self organizing map som based method was applied to multiparameter missing data reconstruction lamrini et al 2011 results indicated that idw was the best imputation method the application of gaussian process regression gpr svr m5 and rf was investigated in estimating missing data of rainfall data which results showed the superiority of support vector regression svr over other investigated methods sattari et al 2020 the neural network k nearest neighbor svr xgboost rf were employed to estimate sub missing hourly data of precipitation which results indicated good accuracy chivers et al 2020 zhou 2020 used the long short term model lstm to estimate the missing data in the water quality dataset results showed more accuracy of this model than the ann model vu et al 2020 used lstm to estimate the missing data of the groundwater table results demonstrated the good accuracy of this method different data mining techniques such asinverse ditance weighting method idw rf ridge r bayesian ridge br svr were used for missing data imputation rodríguez et al 2021 although the data mining techniques have promising applications in missing data of different fields however choosing the best data mining algorithm to model natural phenomena is always a concern for authors because there are different criteria for this choice such as time accuracy and uncertainty in these conditions multicriteria decision methods can select the best algorithm there are different ways to make a multicriteria decision such as technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis li et al 2012 yu and tang 2013 zahedi et al 2017 analytic hierarchy process ahp kourtis and tsihrintzis 2017 singh et al 2018 dar et al 2020 matomela et al 2020 an ahp may sometimes have doubts about the choice of weights aktas and kabak 2019 at this time a combination of fuzzy hesitant with ahp hf ahp and topsis hf topsis methods may be helpful zyoud et al 2016 memari et al 2019 amin et al 2019 xian and guo 2020 besides multicriteria decision methods have been used for selecting best algorithm in some studies mohammadi et al 2019 used the topsis method to select the best optimization method in the optimal operation of the multi reservoir benchmark system farzin et al 2020 employed the topsis method to choose the best data mining method in modeling drug removal from synthetic wastewater as mentioned modeling groundwater without imputation missing data caused inaccurate and unreliable results the idw and kriging used only spatial data for spatial interpolation and finding missing data however in the case of using idw and kriging spatial interpolation methods it should be done separately for each time which even if there is acceptable accuracy the computation time will increase exponentially this limitation of interpolation methods is even more critical in real problems dealing with large data samples the use of the current research approach can solve this problem well besides according to the authors best knowledge there is a lake of modeling missing data of gwt by using geographical data gd and new data mining techniques while using this approach can solve the limitation of the spatial interpolation method hence in the present study gwt will be modeled by a combination of gd and powerful data mining techniques including ann m5 mars lssvm rf and elm furthermore bootstrapping uncertainty method will be utilized for the uncertainty analysis of data mining algorithms however there is a challenge that results of which model is better because there are different criteria such as accuracy computation time and uncertainty it is not easy to choose the best data mining algorithm hence a hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making method hf mcda will be used for selecting the best algorithm in which mcda will be used for existing different criteria and hf will be applied due to the existing hesitation in the defining weight of criteria s finally the best data mining technique will be introduced for modeling gwt missing data based on the gd data using this approach makes it possible to estimate the amount of gwt for each of the wells in damghan plain at any time with acceptable accuracy and computational time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the damghan plain of semnan province was selected as a case study in this study the geographical coordinates of the study range are 42 54 to 53 22 east longitude and 31 36 to 43 35 north latitude the damghan study area covers an area of about 5863 square kilometers the damghan study area is located north of semnan province and southeast of mazandaran province fig 1 the reason for selecting this study is the high importance of damghan plain in supplying the water demand of this region damghan plain has an average annual rainfall of about 108 5 mm most of them are in late winter and early spring and the least in mid summer one of the most critical factors controlling the temperature distribution in the study area is elevation this region s lowest and highest temperatures are related to early winter and early summer respectively according to the report received from the semnan regional water organization the actual long term evapotranspiration rate in the plain heights is 1628 and 2466 mm per year respectively and for the study area 2047 mm per year according to the domarten method the study area is in arid and semi arid climates and has hot and dry summers and cold and dry winters this plain is poor in terms of surface water resources and most of the region s water needs are met by groundwater resources one of the most important rivers of this plain is the cheshmeh ali river according to the studies conducted from 1996 to 2016 a significant decrease has been observed in the piezometers of damghan plain for example in the 20 years the groundwater level for the soltanieh piezometer has dropped by about 10 m 2 2 input data in the present study geographic data including latitude longitude and date month day and year and the depths of the wells were used to model missing gwt data of damghan plain geographic data are considered in the utm geographic system per unit of meter the gwt of eighty four wells of damghan plain has been studied from 1993 07 10 to 2017 20 03 the geographic and gwt data and their statistical criteria are summarized in table 1 in this table the depths of the well are below ground level furthermore different points of damghan plain were used to model missing gwt data this in turn provides reliable results for this plain as all points are considered with different weather and geological conditions also table 1 presents the mean and standard deviation of the gwt below ground level in the damghan plain according to this table the mean and standard deviation and coefficient of variation for groundwater table in damghan plain are 1196 m 229 m and 0 191 respectively given the values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation gwt modeling in the damghan plain is expected to be complex because the data is very scattered in the present study the height of depth of wells and groundwater table are the same because both types are variable length data 2 3 data mining techniques missing data of groundwater modeling was performed using different data mining algorithms includes ann m5 mars lssvm rf and elm 2 3 1 artificial neural network ann the artificial neural network is a complex data and information processing system with extensive distribution it is also a simple system of the structure of the biological neural network of the human brain it should be noted that the ann is defined by one or multilayers that each layer consists of one or multi neurons the inputs data are imposed to input layers then this data is processed in hidden layers and after that exported from the output layer in this process each link between neurons is equivalent to one weight the neuron output is calculated based on the addition of bias with a weighted summation of inputs and weights of that neuron the training algorithm determines the weights and biases of ann for more information see the study of farzin et al 2020 lee et al 2016 there are different types of ann and training algorithms in the present study anaraki et al 2021 the backpropagation ann with levenberg marquardt training algorithm is used the present study used the ann toolbox in matlabr 2017b to train the ann for processing groundwater level data the schematic design of the ann is shown in fig 2 in this figure w11 shows the weight of the link between the first neurons of one layer and it s next layer 2 3 2 m5 model trees algorithm m5 is a hierarchically advanced vidal approach that efficiently divides the sample space into recursively random and creates an ambiguous linear regression model for each class the decision tree induction algorithm with linear regression in nodes is used to develop model trees by splitting and fitting the criterion of tree splitting is the decision to maximize information gains and minimize standard deviations in the target values the standard deviation is the error measurement target value then for each feature the expected error reduction is calculated and the one that delivers the most error reduction is selected for the recursive division the standard deviation calculation formula is expressed as 1 s d r s d x i x i x s d x i in the above relation x is a set of attribute values and xi is a set of attribute values performed by dividing x and standard deviation the second stage pruning method is used for pruning large trees to reach the right decision and solve the problem of overfitting in the pruning stage the internal nodes are transformed into linear nodes by replacing them with linear regression functions after pruning isolated linear models of neighboring leaves subjected to the smoothing process all leaf models are combined along the return path to the root to form the final model to achieve the most effective prediction at the end the modeling process using the m5 tree model is illustrated in fig 3 2 3 3 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars mars performs a multivariate adjustment regression of a nonlinear regression using a spline between dependent and independent variables mars makes no specific assumptions about the fundamental performance relationship between the input and output variables this method involves forward and backward processes in the forward process input parameters are selected and functions are added in general this process creates a complex model that results in over coverage of course such a model has poor prediction accuracy the method of backwardness is applied and unnecessary variables are removed from the previous set selected to eliminate this loss the following functions are used in mars 2 b f 1 max 0 x k n o t 3 b f 2 max 0 k n o t x the x variable is the dependent variable of the target variable bf is the basis function given the node that specifies the swelling point along with the inputs and knot is the threshold value specified the desired mars architecture was obtained by trial and error the process of mars for establishing a regression relation between one input and one target is shown in fig 4 2 3 4 least square support vector machine lssvm the basis of the support vector machine method was presented by vapnik and mukherjee 2000 based on statistical learning theory the least squares support vector machine was first proposed by suykens et al 2002 unlike the model svm linear equations are used instead of quadratic programming therefore this method is more accurate and faster than the svm method the lssvm regression model is as follows 4 y i i 1 n α i h x x i b where α is the lagrangian coefficient b is the bias h is the kernel function x is the input vector and y is the target variable this figure shows that lssvm only consists of one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer this simple structure is an advantage of lssvm over ann for more information refer to farzin and valikhan anaraki 2021 2 3 5 random forests rf model rf first was made by breiman 2001 model rf is a non parametric classification model in this model many classification trees are created by the samples bootstrap to enhance the model s predictive accuracy in rf each tree split is obtained by employing a randomized subset of normalized input factors at each node eq 5 the main advantages of this method include low error and low variance low correlation of individual trees robust error computed using data oob and better prediction the oob error can compute the variance and covariance between grid cells these components measure the uncertainty around estimates of groundwater potentiality within a grid cell thus 5 x i k x i k min x i k max x i k min x i k where x i k is the original value of a factor x i k is the normalized factor value min x i k is the original minimum value and max x i k is the original maximum value see fig 5 the diagram of the random forest is presented in fig 6 2 3 6 extreme learning machine elm extreme learning machine is a feed forward neural network based learning method the single layer neural network consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the neurons of all three layers are fully interconnected the input layer has an n input variable the hidden layer contains l neurons the output layer has the m output variable equivalent to the m neuron but an arbitrary example of the output of the neural network leading to l neurons and the hidden layer excitation function can be expressed as follows 6 f l x i 1 n β i g a i x i b i where a i a i 1 a i 2 a i n is the input weight of the connection between the input layers and the i th hidden layer neurons β i β i 1 β i 2 β i m is an output weight connection between the output layer and the i th hidden layer neurons the b denotes the threshold of the hidden layer neurons one example of elm structure with four neurons in the input layer five neurons in the hidden layer and one neuron in the output layer is illustrated in fig 7 for more information about elm refers to gao et al 2022 see fig 8 2 4 bootstrapping for uncertainty analysis bootstrap was first introduced by efron and tibshirani 1994 it is based on the assumption that the existing dataset is a particular manifestation of the unknown probability distribution if there is no prior knowledge about the actual probability distribution an empirical distribution with a 1 p probability may be defined bootstrap is used to generate samples from original data the reconstitution procedure is repeated for many and at each bootstrap a single data mining is trained and tested the bootstrapping set estimate for each output is calculated by averaging the total outcomes using the following equation 7 m x 1 n i 1 n o i x where m is the average of the outputs n is the number of networks running on different training networks and o is the output of every network this is a common method for collecting the outcomes of an unstable predictor 2 5 evaluation criteria in the present study different evaluation criteria including mae rmse and r2 are employed to assess data mining algorithms accuracy these criteria have been used in many studies such as ehteram et al 2018 valikhan anaraki et al 2019 the formula of mae rmse and r2 are as follows 8 m a e i 1 n y i x i n 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 10 r 2 n i 1 n x y i 1 n x i 1 n y 2 n i 1 n x 2 i 1 n y 2 n i 1 n y 2 i 1 n y 2 where y is modeled gwt x is the observed gwt and n is the number of samples 2 6 hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making methods hf mcda for alternative evaluation in the hf mcda method hf ahp was used to determine the weights and the hf topsis method was used to select the best option among the studied options ahp determines the weight of the criteria and the topsis scores the options the combination of hf with these methods is due to the hesitation in choosing weights hf is one of the most reputable methods in this situation ahp algorithm based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms sets hflts is applied in this phase hf ahp is a suitable method for modeling criteria evaluation under the consideration of decision makers hesitancy which is why hf ahp is used in the study the evaluation criteria including rmse mae r and uncertainty and time were used to rank the reviewed algorithms in this study we used the hf topsis method xu and zhang 2013 to select the best data mining algorithm the decision matrix contains uncertain fuzzy elements in the number of experts if the evaluation of two or more experts in terms of options is similar this evaluation is done only once however in the topsis stages the assessment should be of the same length hence by adding the minimum component of this element the fuzzy hesitant element expands that is to accept the pessimistic case after the decision matrix is complete ideal positive and negative solutions are found for more information see aktas and kabak 2019 article 2 7 presented framework a new framework has been introduced to find missing gwt data in the present research in this framework the following steps are followed 1 the geographical data including latitude longitudinal of wells and the depth of wells and date consisting of years months and days of measuring gwt are considered inputs data the gwt data is used as target data the matrix of the performed dataset in this approach is demonstrated in table 2 according to this table latitude length and depth of wells in damghan plain change these parameters are considered variables because there are several wells in this plain 2 in following data mining methods including ann m5 elm lssvm mars and rf200 established a regression relation between inputs and targets data then evaluation criteria and time computing are estimated in this regard such as studies of rusk et al 2022 you et al 2022 70 of the dataset is used for training and 30 is used for testing 3 after that the uncertainty of gwt missing data modeling is calculated 4 finally the hf mcda recommends the best data mining methods for predicting missing data of gwt in damghan plain fig 7 shows the flowchart of the presented framework for missing data modeling 3 results 3 1 evaluation criteria of data mining techniques in this study we investigated the performance of six data mining algorithms for modeling missing data in damghan plain this study s data mining model inputs are the geographical location of wells and date table 3 presents the values of the six statistical indices for all models studied in two training and testing phases it is evident that the lowest amount of mae in the training period was obtained by the lssvm algorithm and the highest by the elm algorithm and for the mae criterion the lowest value was achieved by the lssvm algorithm during the testing period and the highest by the elm algorithm the highest and the lowest rmse in the training period are related to elm and lssvm by 67 441 and 5 521 respectively for the rmse criterion in the testing period the highest and lowest are related to elm and m5 by values of 66 902 and 10 811 respectively regarding the value of the r criterion in the training period the algorithms evaluated range from 0 986 to 0 999 the most r is for the lssvm and the least r is for the ann also during the test period the m5 and ann algorithms had the highest and lowest accuracy of 0 998 and 0 986 respectively for r in the testing period lssvm by 0 997 has very close results to m5 thus for rmse in the testing period lssvm by the value of 17 005 has the most accuracy after mars and m5 with comparable results therefore it can be concluded that m5 and lssvm have accurate results than other investigated algorithms however due to the existence of criteria such as time and uncertainty and the closeness of the results of the evaluation criteria it is still not possible to say which algorithm is better the m5 and lssvm are more accurate than other algorithms in the present study this superiority of m5 is for using the conquer and dividing strategy in this algorithm this strategy helps m5 to consider the nonlinear relationship between inputs and output by dividing the original data space into a multi subset and creating the linear regression for each subset also the better accuracy of lssvm is for using the kernel function kernel function enables the algorithm to consider the nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs as a linear relationship thus the lssvm used the least square optimization method for finding input weights this method is a global optimization method and prevents it from falling into the local optimum trap while ann for finding input weights used a gradient based method that is a local optimization method it may fall into the local optimum trap also the mars algorithm as more accuracy is placed in the third rank divides the input data into several subsets and establishes a nonlinear relationship between inputs and output thus rf has better accuracy than ann and elm this issue is for random resampling from original data and establishing a model tree for each subsample the weakest results of elm are for assigning a random number to alpha and bias in the structure of this algorithm without any specific calculation the mentioned results are entirely consistent with the results in table 2 because in this table the scattering and variation of data was more high standard deviation and coefficient variation this has led to poor results for some algorithms such as elm and ann while the m5 and lssvm algorithms are also more powerful for solving groundwater modeling with this dispersion due to the conquering and dividing strategy and kernel function in fig 9 the computational time of the six algorithms is given according to fig 9 the minimum computational time is related to the m5 algorithm followed by the elm and mars algorithms and the highest computational time is related to the rf algorithm the time computation of m5 is only 3 s this value for elm and mars is equal to 5 for lssvm equal 36 s and ann and rf equal 300 and 700 s respectively about the time computation of investigated data mining algorithms the m5 has lower time computation and rf has the highest time computations the lower time computation of m5 and mars are for their simple structures also elm for using only one hidden layer and not the iterative method has high speed and low computation time the high computational time of ann is the use of iterative calculations in this algorithm and also the reason for the high computational time of rf is due to the resampling from original data and creating one tree for each sample also the computational time is increased in the lssvm algorithm due to the computing kernel function 3 2 distribution of modeled groundwater level compared to observational groundwater level fig 10 shows the distribution pattern of groundwater levels modeled to the observed groundwater level in the testing period the following diagrams also present the value of the determination coefficient for different algorithms the distribution of the modeled data relative to groundwater level data observations is closer to the 45 degree line but its determination coefficient is closer to one according to these diagrams the highest correlation coefficient value is related to the ann algorithm also the lowest is related to the rf algorithm however all algorithms coefficient of determination values is close to one this suggests that the trend of gwt is well modeled by the data mining algorithms used in this study however according to table 3 some algorithms such as elm has more mae and rmse than other algorithms which leads to distance and deviation from observed gwt this issue can be depicted by plotting modeled and observed gwt time series in the following section 3 3 groundwater time series diagram in fig 11 time series related to groundwater modeling and observational data are shown according to the following results the slightest difference between the modeled and observed time series is related to lssvm and m5 algorithms while the groundwater level modeled with the elm algorithm differs from the observed groundwater level the comparing of scatter diagrams and time series plots shows that the trend of time series of groundwater is modeled with reasonable accuracy however modeled gwt for some algorithms such as elm deviates from the observational data while this difference for m5 and lssvm is minimal this issue is for the nonlinearity of groundwater time series following table 1 because the groundwater time series in the present study is for a different station with a different climate and geographic location of damghan plain so m5 and lssvm with the mentioned assumption and these strategies can estimate nonlinear groundwater time series but elm failed in this subject furthermore considering dates such as day month and year helps di consider rhythmic changes peaks and trends in the time series of groundwater level in fig 11 the gwt time series modeled by lssvm and m5 fit well into the observational time series confirms this issue 3 4 uncertainty results the present study used the mean of the 95 confidence interval band to evaluate the uncertainty table 4 according to table 4 the ann algorithm has less than 30 uncertainty than the m5 lssvm and mars algorithms also it should be noted that the lssvm algorithm has less uncertainty than the other five algorithms during the test period according to the results of uncertainty analysis lssvm and m5 have lower uncertainty than ann mars and rf this issue is for not using random processes in lssvm and m5 while rf used random resampling in their structure ann has also used a random variable for initial weights and bias thus the other reason for this more uncertainty is more sensitivity of ann mars and rf to inputs variables because in bootstrap uncertainty analysis the inputs variables in each iteration are generated based on random resampling in the following we present the graphs of the uncertainty band of the six algorithms in the test period fig 11 according to fig 12 m5 lssvm and ann algorithms have the least uncertainty band respectively based on the results of this study the m5 algorithm was selected as the best algorithm for modeling the groundwater level missing data in the damghan plain it should be noted that the results of the reconstruction of the groundwater level missing data in damghan plain will be used in future authors research based on the results of this algorithm 3 5 hf mcda however each error criterion had different results on the other hand in addition to the error criterion computational time and uncertainty can influence the choice of the best algorithm therefore the hf mcda method was used to select the best algorithm table 5 the reason for using the uncertain hf mcda method is the uncertainty in determining the weights for each criterion according to table 5 most scores are related to the m5 algorithm and then the algorithms are lssvm mars elm rf and ann respectively the hf mcda is used for selecting the best algorithm because of different results based on the various criteria according to the results of hf mcda m5 and lssvm have more scores in contrast ann and rf have the least score this issue is for a higher difference between the time computations of these algorithms the superiority of the m5 and lssvm algorithms over the other algorithms reviewed in this paper confirms the results of fan et al 2018 farzin et al 2020 feng et al 2018 nasseri et al 2013 tavakol davani et al 2013 wang et al 2019 4 conclusion this study used six data mining algorithms to find missing data in damghan plain geographic data and dates were also used as inputs besides the new bootstrap method evaluated the uncertainties of the investigated algorithms on the other hand it was challenging to select the best algorithm due to different criteria such as accuracy time and uncertainty the hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making methods hf mcda were used to select the best algorithm for these reasons the m5 and lssvm algorithms had the best accuracy according to the results the best results were related to the m5 and lssvm algorithms in terms of uncertainty the least computational time was related to the two algorithms m5 and mars in terms of time criterion eventually by actions the multicriteria decision making method the m5 lssvm and mars are in the first to third ranks with a slight difference respectively according to the present study results combining gd and date information with data mining techniques can solve missing gwt data besides using hf mcda helped determine the best data mining for missing data modeling by considering different accuracy time computing and uncertainty criteria finally the presented approach can be a new path toward modeling and predicting missing data of other fields such as surface water and groundwater quality precipitation temperature etc furthermore the presented approach can significantly assist in modeling predicting groundwater levels and making decisions for managing water resources in that area contribution alireza mohaghegh methodology software formal analysis

11859,in the present study a new framework is developed based on the geographical data gd data mining techniques di and hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making methods hf mcda for modeling groundwater table gwt missing data in damghan plain the gd is used as inputs in the presented approach and available gwt is used as output the different di including artificial neural network ann tree model m5 m5 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars least square support vector machine lssvm random forest rf and extreme learning machine elm are employed for establishing a relation between gd and gwt and estimating missing gwt however there is this challenge that one of the di is better because there are different criteria for selecting the best di including error criteria uncertainty and computation time moreover there is hesitation about the choice of weight criteria in this condition hf mcda is a practical choice according to the results m5 by values of 5 485 m 10 811 m and 0 998 for mae rmse and r2 respectively and lssvm by values of 3 043 m 17 005 m and 0 997 for mae rmse and r2 respectively have accurate results than other investigated di in contrast elm has the worst results in terms of accuracy m5 and rf have the best and worst performance based on the time computation term the results of bootstrap uncertainty show that lssvm has minimum uncertainty by the value of 1 349 m for d factor and elm has maximum uncertainty by the value of 1 570 m for d factor finally according to the results of hf mcda m5 lssvm has first and the second rank with a closed score besides the mars algorithm is placed b in the third rank with a slight difference from m5 and lssvm based on the high and closed scores of m5 lssvm and mars these methods can be used to find missing gwt data graphical abstract image 1 keywords missing data reconstruction geographical data data mining techniques hesitant fuzzy topsis uncertainty groundwater data in damghan plain 1 introduction groundwater table gwt modeling and predicting is one of the essential steps in water resources management gwt modeling and predicting results help decision makers for better programming in the field of sustainable growth of countries especially in regions where groundwater is the main water resource such as iran jamshidzadeh 2020 however missing data of gwt is an important limitation in modeling and predicting gwt the complete gwt data isn t available in some plains this issue can lead to inaccurate and unreliable gwt modeling in recent years many studies focused on the modeling of missing data the data mining method is one of the best methods for handling missing data these methods have been successfully used in many fields such as modeling maximum daily water temperature zhu and heddam 2019 estimating pan evaporation in the reservoir sebbar et al 2019 water hummer modeling salimi et al 2020 prediction min mean and max temperature azad et al 2019b precipitation modeling azad et al 2019a farrokhi et al 2020 minimizing irrigation deficiencies valikhan anaraki et al 2019 optimal design of open channel farzin and valikhan anaraki 2021 data mining methods have been utilized with reasonable accuracy in missing data modeling the self organizing map som based method was applied to multiparameter missing data reconstruction lamrini et al 2011 results indicated that idw was the best imputation method the application of gaussian process regression gpr svr m5 and rf was investigated in estimating missing data of rainfall data which results showed the superiority of support vector regression svr over other investigated methods sattari et al 2020 the neural network k nearest neighbor svr xgboost rf were employed to estimate sub missing hourly data of precipitation which results indicated good accuracy chivers et al 2020 zhou 2020 used the long short term model lstm to estimate the missing data in the water quality dataset results showed more accuracy of this model than the ann model vu et al 2020 used lstm to estimate the missing data of the groundwater table results demonstrated the good accuracy of this method different data mining techniques such asinverse ditance weighting method idw rf ridge r bayesian ridge br svr were used for missing data imputation rodríguez et al 2021 although the data mining techniques have promising applications in missing data of different fields however choosing the best data mining algorithm to model natural phenomena is always a concern for authors because there are different criteria for this choice such as time accuracy and uncertainty in these conditions multicriteria decision methods can select the best algorithm there are different ways to make a multicriteria decision such as technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis li et al 2012 yu and tang 2013 zahedi et al 2017 analytic hierarchy process ahp kourtis and tsihrintzis 2017 singh et al 2018 dar et al 2020 matomela et al 2020 an ahp may sometimes have doubts about the choice of weights aktas and kabak 2019 at this time a combination of fuzzy hesitant with ahp hf ahp and topsis hf topsis methods may be helpful zyoud et al 2016 memari et al 2019 amin et al 2019 xian and guo 2020 besides multicriteria decision methods have been used for selecting best algorithm in some studies mohammadi et al 2019 used the topsis method to select the best optimization method in the optimal operation of the multi reservoir benchmark system farzin et al 2020 employed the topsis method to choose the best data mining method in modeling drug removal from synthetic wastewater as mentioned modeling groundwater without imputation missing data caused inaccurate and unreliable results the idw and kriging used only spatial data for spatial interpolation and finding missing data however in the case of using idw and kriging spatial interpolation methods it should be done separately for each time which even if there is acceptable accuracy the computation time will increase exponentially this limitation of interpolation methods is even more critical in real problems dealing with large data samples the use of the current research approach can solve this problem well besides according to the authors best knowledge there is a lake of modeling missing data of gwt by using geographical data gd and new data mining techniques while using this approach can solve the limitation of the spatial interpolation method hence in the present study gwt will be modeled by a combination of gd and powerful data mining techniques including ann m5 mars lssvm rf and elm furthermore bootstrapping uncertainty method will be utilized for the uncertainty analysis of data mining algorithms however there is a challenge that results of which model is better because there are different criteria such as accuracy computation time and uncertainty it is not easy to choose the best data mining algorithm hence a hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making method hf mcda will be used for selecting the best algorithm in which mcda will be used for existing different criteria and hf will be applied due to the existing hesitation in the defining weight of criteria s finally the best data mining technique will be introduced for modeling gwt missing data based on the gd data using this approach makes it possible to estimate the amount of gwt for each of the wells in damghan plain at any time with acceptable accuracy and computational time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the damghan plain of semnan province was selected as a case study in this study the geographical coordinates of the study range are 42 54 to 53 22 east longitude and 31 36 to 43 35 north latitude the damghan study area covers an area of about 5863 square kilometers the damghan study area is located north of semnan province and southeast of mazandaran province fig 1 the reason for selecting this study is the high importance of damghan plain in supplying the water demand of this region damghan plain has an average annual rainfall of about 108 5 mm most of them are in late winter and early spring and the least in mid summer one of the most critical factors controlling the temperature distribution in the study area is elevation this region s lowest and highest temperatures are related to early winter and early summer respectively according to the report received from the semnan regional water organization the actual long term evapotranspiration rate in the plain heights is 1628 and 2466 mm per year respectively and for the study area 2047 mm per year according to the domarten method the study area is in arid and semi arid climates and has hot and dry summers and cold and dry winters this plain is poor in terms of surface water resources and most of the region s water needs are met by groundwater resources one of the most important rivers of this plain is the cheshmeh ali river according to the studies conducted from 1996 to 2016 a significant decrease has been observed in the piezometers of damghan plain for example in the 20 years the groundwater level for the soltanieh piezometer has dropped by about 10 m 2 2 input data in the present study geographic data including latitude longitude and date month day and year and the depths of the wells were used to model missing gwt data of damghan plain geographic data are considered in the utm geographic system per unit of meter the gwt of eighty four wells of damghan plain has been studied from 1993 07 10 to 2017 20 03 the geographic and gwt data and their statistical criteria are summarized in table 1 in this table the depths of the well are below ground level furthermore different points of damghan plain were used to model missing gwt data this in turn provides reliable results for this plain as all points are considered with different weather and geological conditions also table 1 presents the mean and standard deviation of the gwt below ground level in the damghan plain according to this table the mean and standard deviation and coefficient of variation for groundwater table in damghan plain are 1196 m 229 m and 0 191 respectively given the values of standard deviation and coefficient of variation gwt modeling in the damghan plain is expected to be complex because the data is very scattered in the present study the height of depth of wells and groundwater table are the same because both types are variable length data 2 3 data mining techniques missing data of groundwater modeling was performed using different data mining algorithms includes ann m5 mars lssvm rf and elm 2 3 1 artificial neural network ann the artificial neural network is a complex data and information processing system with extensive distribution it is also a simple system of the structure of the biological neural network of the human brain it should be noted that the ann is defined by one or multilayers that each layer consists of one or multi neurons the inputs data are imposed to input layers then this data is processed in hidden layers and after that exported from the output layer in this process each link between neurons is equivalent to one weight the neuron output is calculated based on the addition of bias with a weighted summation of inputs and weights of that neuron the training algorithm determines the weights and biases of ann for more information see the study of farzin et al 2020 lee et al 2016 there are different types of ann and training algorithms in the present study anaraki et al 2021 the backpropagation ann with levenberg marquardt training algorithm is used the present study used the ann toolbox in matlabr 2017b to train the ann for processing groundwater level data the schematic design of the ann is shown in fig 2 in this figure w11 shows the weight of the link between the first neurons of one layer and it s next layer 2 3 2 m5 model trees algorithm m5 is a hierarchically advanced vidal approach that efficiently divides the sample space into recursively random and creates an ambiguous linear regression model for each class the decision tree induction algorithm with linear regression in nodes is used to develop model trees by splitting and fitting the criterion of tree splitting is the decision to maximize information gains and minimize standard deviations in the target values the standard deviation is the error measurement target value then for each feature the expected error reduction is calculated and the one that delivers the most error reduction is selected for the recursive division the standard deviation calculation formula is expressed as 1 s d r s d x i x i x s d x i in the above relation x is a set of attribute values and xi is a set of attribute values performed by dividing x and standard deviation the second stage pruning method is used for pruning large trees to reach the right decision and solve the problem of overfitting in the pruning stage the internal nodes are transformed into linear nodes by replacing them with linear regression functions after pruning isolated linear models of neighboring leaves subjected to the smoothing process all leaf models are combined along the return path to the root to form the final model to achieve the most effective prediction at the end the modeling process using the m5 tree model is illustrated in fig 3 2 3 3 multivariate adaptive regression spline mars mars performs a multivariate adjustment regression of a nonlinear regression using a spline between dependent and independent variables mars makes no specific assumptions about the fundamental performance relationship between the input and output variables this method involves forward and backward processes in the forward process input parameters are selected and functions are added in general this process creates a complex model that results in over coverage of course such a model has poor prediction accuracy the method of backwardness is applied and unnecessary variables are removed from the previous set selected to eliminate this loss the following functions are used in mars 2 b f 1 max 0 x k n o t 3 b f 2 max 0 k n o t x the x variable is the dependent variable of the target variable bf is the basis function given the node that specifies the swelling point along with the inputs and knot is the threshold value specified the desired mars architecture was obtained by trial and error the process of mars for establishing a regression relation between one input and one target is shown in fig 4 2 3 4 least square support vector machine lssvm the basis of the support vector machine method was presented by vapnik and mukherjee 2000 based on statistical learning theory the least squares support vector machine was first proposed by suykens et al 2002 unlike the model svm linear equations are used instead of quadratic programming therefore this method is more accurate and faster than the svm method the lssvm regression model is as follows 4 y i i 1 n α i h x x i b where α is the lagrangian coefficient b is the bias h is the kernel function x is the input vector and y is the target variable this figure shows that lssvm only consists of one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer this simple structure is an advantage of lssvm over ann for more information refer to farzin and valikhan anaraki 2021 2 3 5 random forests rf model rf first was made by breiman 2001 model rf is a non parametric classification model in this model many classification trees are created by the samples bootstrap to enhance the model s predictive accuracy in rf each tree split is obtained by employing a randomized subset of normalized input factors at each node eq 5 the main advantages of this method include low error and low variance low correlation of individual trees robust error computed using data oob and better prediction the oob error can compute the variance and covariance between grid cells these components measure the uncertainty around estimates of groundwater potentiality within a grid cell thus 5 x i k x i k min x i k max x i k min x i k where x i k is the original value of a factor x i k is the normalized factor value min x i k is the original minimum value and max x i k is the original maximum value see fig 5 the diagram of the random forest is presented in fig 6 2 3 6 extreme learning machine elm extreme learning machine is a feed forward neural network based learning method the single layer neural network consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the neurons of all three layers are fully interconnected the input layer has an n input variable the hidden layer contains l neurons the output layer has the m output variable equivalent to the m neuron but an arbitrary example of the output of the neural network leading to l neurons and the hidden layer excitation function can be expressed as follows 6 f l x i 1 n β i g a i x i b i where a i a i 1 a i 2 a i n is the input weight of the connection between the input layers and the i th hidden layer neurons β i β i 1 β i 2 β i m is an output weight connection between the output layer and the i th hidden layer neurons the b denotes the threshold of the hidden layer neurons one example of elm structure with four neurons in the input layer five neurons in the hidden layer and one neuron in the output layer is illustrated in fig 7 for more information about elm refers to gao et al 2022 see fig 8 2 4 bootstrapping for uncertainty analysis bootstrap was first introduced by efron and tibshirani 1994 it is based on the assumption that the existing dataset is a particular manifestation of the unknown probability distribution if there is no prior knowledge about the actual probability distribution an empirical distribution with a 1 p probability may be defined bootstrap is used to generate samples from original data the reconstitution procedure is repeated for many and at each bootstrap a single data mining is trained and tested the bootstrapping set estimate for each output is calculated by averaging the total outcomes using the following equation 7 m x 1 n i 1 n o i x where m is the average of the outputs n is the number of networks running on different training networks and o is the output of every network this is a common method for collecting the outcomes of an unstable predictor 2 5 evaluation criteria in the present study different evaluation criteria including mae rmse and r2 are employed to assess data mining algorithms accuracy these criteria have been used in many studies such as ehteram et al 2018 valikhan anaraki et al 2019 the formula of mae rmse and r2 are as follows 8 m a e i 1 n y i x i n 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 10 r 2 n i 1 n x y i 1 n x i 1 n y 2 n i 1 n x 2 i 1 n y 2 n i 1 n y 2 i 1 n y 2 where y is modeled gwt x is the observed gwt and n is the number of samples 2 6 hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making methods hf mcda for alternative evaluation in the hf mcda method hf ahp was used to determine the weights and the hf topsis method was used to select the best option among the studied options ahp determines the weight of the criteria and the topsis scores the options the combination of hf with these methods is due to the hesitation in choosing weights hf is one of the most reputable methods in this situation ahp algorithm based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms sets hflts is applied in this phase hf ahp is a suitable method for modeling criteria evaluation under the consideration of decision makers hesitancy which is why hf ahp is used in the study the evaluation criteria including rmse mae r and uncertainty and time were used to rank the reviewed algorithms in this study we used the hf topsis method xu and zhang 2013 to select the best data mining algorithm the decision matrix contains uncertain fuzzy elements in the number of experts if the evaluation of two or more experts in terms of options is similar this evaluation is done only once however in the topsis stages the assessment should be of the same length hence by adding the minimum component of this element the fuzzy hesitant element expands that is to accept the pessimistic case after the decision matrix is complete ideal positive and negative solutions are found for more information see aktas and kabak 2019 article 2 7 presented framework a new framework has been introduced to find missing gwt data in the present research in this framework the following steps are followed 1 the geographical data including latitude longitudinal of wells and the depth of wells and date consisting of years months and days of measuring gwt are considered inputs data the gwt data is used as target data the matrix of the performed dataset in this approach is demonstrated in table 2 according to this table latitude length and depth of wells in damghan plain change these parameters are considered variables because there are several wells in this plain 2 in following data mining methods including ann m5 elm lssvm mars and rf200 established a regression relation between inputs and targets data then evaluation criteria and time computing are estimated in this regard such as studies of rusk et al 2022 you et al 2022 70 of the dataset is used for training and 30 is used for testing 3 after that the uncertainty of gwt missing data modeling is calculated 4 finally the hf mcda recommends the best data mining methods for predicting missing data of gwt in damghan plain fig 7 shows the flowchart of the presented framework for missing data modeling 3 results 3 1 evaluation criteria of data mining techniques in this study we investigated the performance of six data mining algorithms for modeling missing data in damghan plain this study s data mining model inputs are the geographical location of wells and date table 3 presents the values of the six statistical indices for all models studied in two training and testing phases it is evident that the lowest amount of mae in the training period was obtained by the lssvm algorithm and the highest by the elm algorithm and for the mae criterion the lowest value was achieved by the lssvm algorithm during the testing period and the highest by the elm algorithm the highest and the lowest rmse in the training period are related to elm and lssvm by 67 441 and 5 521 respectively for the rmse criterion in the testing period the highest and lowest are related to elm and m5 by values of 66 902 and 10 811 respectively regarding the value of the r criterion in the training period the algorithms evaluated range from 0 986 to 0 999 the most r is for the lssvm and the least r is for the ann also during the test period the m5 and ann algorithms had the highest and lowest accuracy of 0 998 and 0 986 respectively for r in the testing period lssvm by 0 997 has very close results to m5 thus for rmse in the testing period lssvm by the value of 17 005 has the most accuracy after mars and m5 with comparable results therefore it can be concluded that m5 and lssvm have accurate results than other investigated algorithms however due to the existence of criteria such as time and uncertainty and the closeness of the results of the evaluation criteria it is still not possible to say which algorithm is better the m5 and lssvm are more accurate than other algorithms in the present study this superiority of m5 is for using the conquer and dividing strategy in this algorithm this strategy helps m5 to consider the nonlinear relationship between inputs and output by dividing the original data space into a multi subset and creating the linear regression for each subset also the better accuracy of lssvm is for using the kernel function kernel function enables the algorithm to consider the nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs as a linear relationship thus the lssvm used the least square optimization method for finding input weights this method is a global optimization method and prevents it from falling into the local optimum trap while ann for finding input weights used a gradient based method that is a local optimization method it may fall into the local optimum trap also the mars algorithm as more accuracy is placed in the third rank divides the input data into several subsets and establishes a nonlinear relationship between inputs and output thus rf has better accuracy than ann and elm this issue is for random resampling from original data and establishing a model tree for each subsample the weakest results of elm are for assigning a random number to alpha and bias in the structure of this algorithm without any specific calculation the mentioned results are entirely consistent with the results in table 2 because in this table the scattering and variation of data was more high standard deviation and coefficient variation this has led to poor results for some algorithms such as elm and ann while the m5 and lssvm algorithms are also more powerful for solving groundwater modeling with this dispersion due to the conquering and dividing strategy and kernel function in fig 9 the computational time of the six algorithms is given according to fig 9 the minimum computational time is related to the m5 algorithm followed by the elm and mars algorithms and the highest computational time is related to the rf algorithm the time computation of m5 is only 3 s this value for elm and mars is equal to 5 for lssvm equal 36 s and ann and rf equal 300 and 700 s respectively about the time computation of investigated data mining algorithms the m5 has lower time computation and rf has the highest time computations the lower time computation of m5 and mars are for their simple structures also elm for using only one hidden layer and not the iterative method has high speed and low computation time the high computational time of ann is the use of iterative calculations in this algorithm and also the reason for the high computational time of rf is due to the resampling from original data and creating one tree for each sample also the computational time is increased in the lssvm algorithm due to the computing kernel function 3 2 distribution of modeled groundwater level compared to observational groundwater level fig 10 shows the distribution pattern of groundwater levels modeled to the observed groundwater level in the testing period the following diagrams also present the value of the determination coefficient for different algorithms the distribution of the modeled data relative to groundwater level data observations is closer to the 45 degree line but its determination coefficient is closer to one according to these diagrams the highest correlation coefficient value is related to the ann algorithm also the lowest is related to the rf algorithm however all algorithms coefficient of determination values is close to one this suggests that the trend of gwt is well modeled by the data mining algorithms used in this study however according to table 3 some algorithms such as elm has more mae and rmse than other algorithms which leads to distance and deviation from observed gwt this issue can be depicted by plotting modeled and observed gwt time series in the following section 3 3 groundwater time series diagram in fig 11 time series related to groundwater modeling and observational data are shown according to the following results the slightest difference between the modeled and observed time series is related to lssvm and m5 algorithms while the groundwater level modeled with the elm algorithm differs from the observed groundwater level the comparing of scatter diagrams and time series plots shows that the trend of time series of groundwater is modeled with reasonable accuracy however modeled gwt for some algorithms such as elm deviates from the observational data while this difference for m5 and lssvm is minimal this issue is for the nonlinearity of groundwater time series following table 1 because the groundwater time series in the present study is for a different station with a different climate and geographic location of damghan plain so m5 and lssvm with the mentioned assumption and these strategies can estimate nonlinear groundwater time series but elm failed in this subject furthermore considering dates such as day month and year helps di consider rhythmic changes peaks and trends in the time series of groundwater level in fig 11 the gwt time series modeled by lssvm and m5 fit well into the observational time series confirms this issue 3 4 uncertainty results the present study used the mean of the 95 confidence interval band to evaluate the uncertainty table 4 according to table 4 the ann algorithm has less than 30 uncertainty than the m5 lssvm and mars algorithms also it should be noted that the lssvm algorithm has less uncertainty than the other five algorithms during the test period according to the results of uncertainty analysis lssvm and m5 have lower uncertainty than ann mars and rf this issue is for not using random processes in lssvm and m5 while rf used random resampling in their structure ann has also used a random variable for initial weights and bias thus the other reason for this more uncertainty is more sensitivity of ann mars and rf to inputs variables because in bootstrap uncertainty analysis the inputs variables in each iteration are generated based on random resampling in the following we present the graphs of the uncertainty band of the six algorithms in the test period fig 11 according to fig 12 m5 lssvm and ann algorithms have the least uncertainty band respectively based on the results of this study the m5 algorithm was selected as the best algorithm for modeling the groundwater level missing data in the damghan plain it should be noted that the results of the reconstruction of the groundwater level missing data in damghan plain will be used in future authors research based on the results of this algorithm 3 5 hf mcda however each error criterion had different results on the other hand in addition to the error criterion computational time and uncertainty can influence the choice of the best algorithm therefore the hf mcda method was used to select the best algorithm table 5 the reason for using the uncertain hf mcda method is the uncertainty in determining the weights for each criterion according to table 5 most scores are related to the m5 algorithm and then the algorithms are lssvm mars elm rf and ann respectively the hf mcda is used for selecting the best algorithm because of different results based on the various criteria according to the results of hf mcda m5 and lssvm have more scores in contrast ann and rf have the least score this issue is for a higher difference between the time computations of these algorithms the superiority of the m5 and lssvm algorithms over the other algorithms reviewed in this paper confirms the results of fan et al 2018 farzin et al 2020 feng et al 2018 nasseri et al 2013 tavakol davani et al 2013 wang et al 2019 4 conclusion this study used six data mining algorithms to find missing data in damghan plain geographic data and dates were also used as inputs besides the new bootstrap method evaluated the uncertainties of the investigated algorithms on the other hand it was challenging to select the best algorithm due to different criteria such as accuracy time and uncertainty the hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making methods hf mcda were used to select the best algorithm for these reasons the m5 and lssvm algorithms had the best accuracy according to the results the best results were related to the m5 and lssvm algorithms in terms of uncertainty the least computational time was related to the two algorithms m5 and mars in terms of time criterion eventually by actions the multicriteria decision making method the m5 lssvm and mars are in the first to third ranks with a slight difference respectively according to the present study results combining gd and date information with data mining techniques can solve missing gwt data besides using hf mcda helped determine the best data mining for missing data modeling by considering different accuracy time computing and uncertainty criteria finally the presented approach can be a new path toward modeling and predicting missing data of other fields such as surface water and groundwater quality precipitation temperature etc furthermore the presented approach can significantly assist in modeling predicting groundwater levels and making decisions for managing water resources in that area contribution alireza mohaghegh methodology software formal analysis
