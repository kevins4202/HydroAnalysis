challenged due to complex hydrological phenomena and their effects e g runoff generation lags behind the hydrometeorological factors as well as observational data deficiency li et al 2019b the upper reaches of the amu darya river basin adrb are located in the tien shan mountains regions central asia where both snow glacier meltwater and rainfall contribute to streamflow li et al 2019b the streamflow supports the livelihood and economic development in adrb moreover streamflow is vital to maintain the ecological environment of the aral sea basin apel et al 2018 liu et al 2020 accurate streamflow simulation is needed for optimizing water resource utilization planning and sustainable management strategy in the adrb li et al 2019c however the adrb lacks dense hydrological and meteorological observation networks and long time span observed data chen et al 2017 therefore more robust and reliable methods are desired to analyze the variation of streamflow in the mountainous regions e g adrb 1 2 literature review previously numerous hydrological research works based on physically based models or conceptual models were conducted in the mountainous regions gan et al 2015 duan et al 2019 jin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 for example duan et al 2019 considered the influence of accumulated temperature on snowmelt using soil and water assessment tool swat model results indicated that the improved model is suitable for the estimation of snowmelt processes in the mountainous areas jin et al 2019 compared snowmelt runoff model srm with hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv in the nyang river basin results showed that the effects of temperature and precipitation on the hydrological process are different the physically based and conceptual models have advantages in quantifying the hydrological process via mathematical formulations which are efficient in accurate simulation anjum et al 2019 yu et al 2020 however almost of them have complex structures with many parameters lacking long time span multiple categories datasets e g weather soil and land use land cover data can lead to uncertainty and make model calibration difficult yaseen et al 2018 due to the low density observation network in the mountainous regions statistical models are also alternative methods for hydrological research zhuang et al 2016 apel et al 2018 ren et al 2018a 2018b for example zhuang et al 2016 developed a framework including stepwise cluster analysis sca to assess climate change impacts on hydrological processes in the kaidu watershed results indicated that sca can simulate streamflow accurately and the variation of streamflow is mainly affected by temperature and precipitation ren et al 2018a developed a probabilistic model based on bayesian neural network bnn for streamflow simulations of the kaidu river basin in central asia results showed that the model works well in the data sparse region apel et al 2018 developed a generic method for deriving seasonal river discharge based on observed data results indicated that the proposed forecast model can provide reliable seasonal streamflow predictions random forest rf is also used in the hydrological simulation and it has potential application value in mountainous regions huang et al 2019 li et al 2019a rezaie balf et al 2019 the statistical models e g rf sca and bnn have the robust generic ability to identify the relationship between factors and streamflow as well as for the ease in development díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 however in the mountainous regions the impact of the factors and the runoff generation do not occur simultaneously tong et al 2009 for example there exists the lag time between snowfall and runoff generation the time lag effect is important to the statistical models which are driven by samples from multiple datasets because the time lag effect may distort the relationship between the factors and streamflow leading to the simulation capacity degradation of the statistical models cross correlation analysis cca is effective for measuring the correlation between time series considering a range of time lags which has been applied to the environmental field kim et al 2018b iliopoulou et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 unfortunately few applications of cca to hydrological process analysis were reported besides multiple factors in hydrological models are not independent and may interact with each other zhuang et al 2016 the rf and other statistical models are insufficient in quantifying the main and interactive effects of factors on the streamflow conventional sensitivity analysis conducts by varying one factor over its range with the other factors held constant it fails to explore the interactions among the factors wang et al 2013 factorial analysis fa is an effective inference approach to reveal the interactive effects of multiple factors on factors montgomery 2017 therefore one potential approach for better dealing with the time lag effect and the interactive relationship of multiple factors is to integrate techniques of cca rf and fa into a general framework 2 novelty and contribution the objective of this study is to develop such a cca rf fa framework crff which is an integration of cross correlation analysis cca random forest rf and factorial analysis fa methods the novelty and contribution of this study are i an innovative framework of crff is firstly developed for runoff simulation ii crff can identify time lag effect in the mixed runoff generation mechanism both rainfall and glacier snow meltwater and tackle the problem of the simulation capacity degradation caused by the time lag effect iii crff is capable of investigating the individual and interactive effects of meteorological and physical factors on runoff simulation iv crff has been applied to the adrb a typical mountainous watershed in central asia v the results can help clarify the impact of the time lag effect on the hydrological cycle provide accurate streamflow simulation and identify the relationship between factors and runoff generation in the mountainous watershed 3 methodology the framework of crff method is illustrated in fig 1 the study steps are i preprocess the data to improve the quality of datasets by singular spectrum analysis ssa ii identify time lag effect between factors i e snow cover and predictand streamflow via cross correlation analysis cca and adjust the order of the factors iii random forest rf is used for streamflow simulation bayesian neural network bnn and stepwise cluster analysis sca are used for comparison to further illustrate the effectiveness of rf in streamflow simulation iv factorial analysis fa is used for analyzing individual and interactive effects of multiple factors based on the trained rf model the main effect can be explained as the variation of runoff with the change of level of a certain factor the interactive can be explained as when factor a is at a certain level the variation of runoff resulted by factor a with the change of the level of factor b in the ssa method two important parameters should be determined the window length l and the number of components m however if the original sequence has unique characteristics of integer period components it is recommended to define l as being proportional to the period zhang et al 2017 empirically the period of the streamflow and factors may be 12 months and l 12 is selected the m decides the number of components in the reconstruction each eigentriple contributes to its value and noise components typically contribute little cross correlation analysis is a practical signal processing method that identifies the correlation between two different time series considering a range of time lags kim et al 2018a the correlation coefficient between the two time series x 1 and x 2 e g streamflow and its factor with a time lag k is defined by 1 r k t 1 t k x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t k x 2 t t 1 t x 1 t x 1 t 2 t 1 t x 2 t x 2 t 2 where are x 1 t and x 2 t the sample means for each series k is allowed to be either positive or negative the cross correlation coefficient rk indicates the strength of a correlation between the two time series if the value of rk is close to 1 0 or 1 0 there is a strong negative or positive correlation between the two time series of streamflow and factor respectively each factor is analyzed by cca with streamflow separately find the highest or lowest value of rk between each factor and runoff and identify the lag time corresponding to the rk the lag time is used to adjust the order of the factors random forest rf is constructed by an ensemble of decision trees dts breiman 2001 using a validation dataset d each subset is generated from bootstrap aggregation bagging sampling then each subset is used to form each dt using the classification and regression trees cart algorithm finally a committee is formed by aggregating all sub decision trees and the result of rf is the average of the results calculated from the dt of the committee the program package of r named randomforest is employed for rf modeling there are two parameters for the program the ntree number of trees to grow and the mtry number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split the accuracy changes little with ntree is larger than 1000 so set ntree and mtry as 1000 and 1 respectively based on the time lag effect information rf and the other two models bnn and sca are employed for streamflow simulation huang et al 2006 zhuang et al 2016 jia et al 2020 the output is the simulated streamflow the kling gupta efficiency scores kge nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are chosen to evaluate the simulation capacity nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 since the kge weights more components of error it is employed to evaluate the impact of lag times on the performance of rf and the other two models the sequential forward selection is used for selecting the modeling factors vasu and lee 2016 for a certain method i e rf first select a factor i e snow cover to bring into the model and retain the factor that obtains the highest nse retaining factor snow cover factors other than snow cover are brought in order and the factor improving the nse to the highest is retained and so on until the nse no longer improves fa technique is employed to efficiently explore the main effects by measuring the variation ranges of response under the impact of individual factors and factors interactions by investigating the specific variations of each factor s effect under the impact of another factor montgomery 2017 the procedure of fa consists of the steps i choose the factors ii evaluate the system responses based on the yates order iii identify the significance of factors and the interactions of factors on system outputs consider the simplest type of fa involves only two factors or sets of treatments the effects model can be expressed as 2 y ijk μ τ i β j τ β ij ε ijk i 1 2 a j 1 2 b k 1 2 n where yijk is the response when factor a is at the ith level i 1 2 a and factor b is at the j th level j 1 2 b for the kth experiment k 1 2 n μ is the mean effect τ i is the effect of factor a at i th level βj is the effect of factor b at the j th level τε ij is the joint effect between τ i and βj ε ijk is the random error component ssa ssb and ssab are the sums of squares for the factors a b and the interaction between a and b respectively sst and sse are the total sum of squares and the error component respectively and they can be express as 3 ss a 1 bn i 1 a y i 2 y 2 abn 4 ss b 1 an j 1 b y j 2 y 2 abn 5 ss ab 1 n i 1 a j 1 b y ij 2 y 2 abn ss a ss b 6 ss a 1 n i a a j 1 b k 1 n y ijk 2 y 2 abn 7 ss e ss t ss ab ss a ss b where yi and yj are the total of all observations of factor a at ith level of factor b the at jth level the yij indicate ij th interaction between factors a and b y denotes the grand total of all observations in this study a multilevel fa design with 34 experiments is performed associated with 4 factors each at three levels that low medium and high the accuracy of the simulated streamflow is sensitive to multiple factors their main and interactive effects on streamflow are quantified using the multilevel factorial analysis technique the rf and its factors including t p swr spr are tested by multilevel fa in three periods snow melting period non melting period and entire simulation horizon each factor was designed into three levels low middle and high corresponding to the 5th and 50th and 95th percentiles of all values leading to 34 treatment combinations sun et al 2018 treatment combinations means that the combination of different levels of factors in the fa experiment table 1 shows the serial number of the 34 treatment combinations 4 case study 4 1 study area the proposed crff is applied to the amu darya river basin adrb which is one of the largest sub basins of the areal sea basin in central asia fig 2 the amu darya river is a glacier snow meltwater and precipitation fed type river with average annual streamflow of more than 70 km3 granit et al 2012 the amu darya river consists of the vakhsh pyandj and some tributaries in the mountainous region in tajikistan and afghanistan the climate of the adrb is continental the average annual temperature is about 4 c and the annual average precipitation is more than 200 mm liu et al 2020 the annual precipitation is high 200 500 mm in mountainous areas and more than 80 of precipitation falls between may and september there are about 130 snow cover days in the basin the largest average annual snow depth is more than 10 cm and the peak snow depth is about 40 cm xu et al 2008 about 70 of the total streamflow occurs between spring and autumn ren et al 2018a 4 2 date acquisition and processing the data used in the study are listed in table 2 the hydrological station is located in atamyrat turkmenistan the length of observed streamflow data is from 2005 to 2018 and its time resolution is 10 days which was collected from the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences the observed streamflow dataset and 13 factors datasets 481 samples per dataset are partitioned into the calibration dataset 380 samples and validation dataset 101 samples the calibration dataset is used to train the models and the validation dataset is retained to test the capacity of the models to avoid the temporal correlation across consecutive data points both the calibration and validation datasets are composed of the full and independent years samples the validation dataset the length of the calibration dataset is from 2005 to 2015 the length of the validation dataset is from 2016 to 2018 the 13 factors related to the runoff generation mechanism in the adrb are selected as factors of the statistical hydrological models table 2 the datasets of the meteorological and hydrological factors range from 2005 to 2018 these datasets are preprocessed into mean value data with the same time resolution as the observed runoff data in particular the factor precipitation is preprocessed as cumulative data according to the bulletins of ca water info http www cawater info net and the interstate commission for water coordination icwc http www icwc aral uz index htm the data of the nurek were collected fig 3 shows there is a linear relationship between the observed streamflow and water inflow to the nurek reservoir indicating their patterns are consistent therefore the authors make an assumption for this study the large reservoirs or hydropower stations does not change the relationship between streamflow and factors and the trends of streamflow of the sub basins are consistent this assumption ensures the credibility of the following results obtained by crff 5 result and discussion 5 1 identifying time lag effect in this study ssa technique was used for improving the quality of the datasets fig 4 represents the result of the ssa the values of components 1 to 8 of the factors are larger than those of the remaining components hence choose m 8 and the components after 8 as noise components that should be eliminated based on the time series datasets reconstructed by ssa cca was employed to identify the time lag effect between streamflow and factors fig 5 shows the different correlation between streamflow and factors since the period is one year the results of the half cycle are highly symmetrical the results of lag time ranging of half year are analyzed for the 0 day lag the correlation between short wave radiation flux swr and streamflow is the strongest significant rk 0 699 similarly the average temperature t is strongly correlated with streamflow rk 0 664 with a lag time of 0 days the high values of rk of t and swr indicate that the time lag effect may be weak to the heat conditions the strongest significant correlation is obtained between snow depth sd and streamflow with a lag time of 130 days 4 months the values of rk range from 0 380 to 0 699 with a lag time of 0 days while the values of rk change with a time lag of 10 to180 days with the values of rk ranging from 0 714 to 0 792 the difference of rk demonstrates that cca can reduce the distortion of the relationship between the streamflow and factors caused by time lag effect ensuring the reliability of the simulated streamflow providing by rf 5 2 streamflow simulation table 3 and fig 6 summarize the simulated results of rf bnn sca during calibration period the simulated results of those three models agree well with the observed streamflow the best nse is obtained for rf with the value of 0 92 followed by sca 0 74 bnn 0 64 during the validation period rf also leads to the most satisfactory performance with nse being 0 84 while bnn sca are 0 81 and 0 80 respectively rf has better performances than other models table 3 shows the best simulation results of the three models are not obtained for all or a single factor indicating that the factors selection scheme avoids over fitting efficiently the interception between three statistical indicators including the pearson correlation coefficient standard deviation and root mean square error is generated in a taylor diagram the taylor diagrams represent the results of rf are the closest to the observed streamflow indicating the rf can effectively capture the variability of streamflow the statistics of the validation performance in the three periods are summarized in table 4 the rf model has the best performance in entire simulation horizon and snow melting period with nse being 0 84 and 0 74 respectively indicating that the rf has the most robust generic ability in the three models the result demonstrates that rf can identify the complex relationship between factors and streamflow in snow melting period for the mountainous regions fig 7 shows the details about the simulated streamflow in fig 7 a the results of the three methods are in good agreement with the observed and their values of nse range from 0 66 to 0 92 in calibration period the three methods are accurate in simulating valley values the mean value of relative error between the observed streamflow and the streamflow simulated by rf bnn sca are 11 7 14 5 and 13 6 respectively for the peak value of 2005 2010 2012 and 2015 the mean relative error of the results of the rf bnn sca are 37 2 54 65 and 44 85 respectively in validation period for the peak value of 2016 2017 and 2018 the mean relative error of the results simulated by the rf bnn sca are 13 2 13 0 and 53 1 respectively for the valley value of 2016 2017 and 2018 the relative error of the streamflow simulated by the three models ranges from 12 1 to 88 8 fig 7 b and c present the capacity of the three models with the validation dataset in the different periods in snow melting period the mean relative error of the peak and valley values for different models are rf 18 1 bnn 35 6 sca 40 6 and sca 19 8 bnn 28 6 rf 41 7 respectively in non melting period the mean relative error of the peak and valley values are bnn 13 4 rf 22 9 sca 21 1 and bnn 64 5 sca 71 28 rf 72 2 respectively fig 8 shows the frequency plots and qq plots for the standardized residual error a standardized residual is a ratio the ratio shows the difference between the observed count and the expected count in the frequency plots if the residual is standard normally distributed 95 of its points should be within 2 standard deviations from the mean 2 2 wang et al 2015 in the qq plot the data are distributed normally if all the points fall close to the straight line for the standardized residual of the rf bnn and sca the proportions are 95 1 93 3 and 94 1 respectively the distribution of the standardized residual indicates that though there more factors should be taken into account the results of the three models are acceptable 5 3 impact on the simulation performance by the time lag fig 9 presents the different simulation capacity of methods caused by the time lag effect of factors similar to the setting in the cca analysis the time lag effect from 0 to 180 days is analyzed the best models for each method are tested the first 25 and third 75 quartile of the value of kge are used to measure the good performance influenced by the lag time when the lag time increases the values of kge of the methods with the same factor have similar trend for example when the factor is swr the value of kge would first decrease and increase later for the temperature t tmin and tmax the values of kge of the methods exceeds the third quartile with the lag time from 0 to 30 days indicating that rf and other methods can effectively identify the relationship between temperature and streamflow with the lag time varies from 0 to 30 days the results of the factor swr are similar to that of t indicating that the interval between the time lag effect of heat conditions e g temperature radiation is weak to runoff generation less than one month the time lag effect on performance is weak when the thermal conditions e g temperature are factors for factor spr the value of kge exceeds the third quartile with the lag time from 30 to 70 days similarly for factor p the value of kge exceeds the third quartile with the lag time from 60 to 90 days the results of spr and p indicate there is a long interval between the impact of the precipitation conditions e g snowfall and the runoff generation precipitation conditions bring strong time lag effect at least one month in this study on performance 5 4 main factors influencing streamflow fig 10 displays the simulation results in snow melting period the highest lowest and average streamflow are 2836 52 m3 s 580 42 m3 s and 1414 52 m3 s respectively in the non snowmelt period the highest lowest and average streamflow of the 81 treatments are 3062 61 m3 s 608 29 m3 s and 1343 85 m3 s respectively in entire simulation horizon the highest lowest and average streamflow of the 34 treatments are 3365 19 m3 s 617 08 m3 s and 1390 75 m3 s respectively the large fluctuation range of streamflow demonstrates the fa is efficient to identify the sensitivity of the variation of streamflow fig 11 a presents the main effects of the four factors on the streamflow the factors are the factors of rf including t p swr and spr the predictands are average annual flow aaf average flow in snow melting period afs and average flow in non melting period afn take the plot of t in aaf as an example when the t level is from low to medium aaf increases from 1145 14 m3 s to 1185 04 m3 s when the t level is from medium to high aaf increases from 1185 04 m3 s to 1968 86 m3 s the slope of the line is positive indicating that t has a positive effect on aaf compared with the other three factors the t has the steepest slope demonstrating that t has the dominant effect on aaf in three periods the four factors have positive effects on streamflow when the four factors t p swr and spr are from the low level to the high level the aaf increases 823 72 m3 s 416 28 m3 s 623 06 m3 s and 699 07 m3 s respectively in the entire simulation horizon the order of streamflow variation responding to factors variation are t 823 72 m3 s spr 699 07 m3 s swr 623 06 m3 s p 416 28 m3 s similarly for afs the order in snow melting period are swr 713 95 m3 s t 490 24 m3 s p 481 44 m3 s spr 462 59 m3 s and for afn the order in non melting period are t 773 73 m3 s spr 642 82 m3 s swr 589 37 m3 s p 485 09 m3 s the contributions of factors to variation of streamflow in snow melting non melting and entire simulation horizon are t 35 8 swr 23 73 p 23 13 spr 13 08 t 37 46 swr 21 44 p 18 21 spr 17 56 and t 39 02 swr 21 78 spr 18 44 p 15 13 respectively the results indicate that the temperature has the dominant impact on the variation of streamflow in snow melting and non melting periods in the mountainous regions it may be because the temperature affects both the hydrological process such as snowfall and snowmelt long term monitoring of the annual average temperature is necessary to the mountainous regions spr is the second main factor in entire simulation horizon and non melting period implying that snowfall can still have a significant impact on the generation of runoff in the non snowmelt period 5 5 interactive effects on streamflow fig 11 b to fig 11 d present the patterns of the interaction of factors on streamflow the interactions identify the effect of each factor on streamflow under the influence of another factor for the plot of p t row 1 column 2 in fig 11 b when t and p are at the low level the streamflow is 1107 29 m3 s when t is at the high level under the low p level the streamflow increases to 1751 95 m3 s hence when t is at the high level under the low p level the variation of streamflow is 644 66 m3 s the coinciding lines indicate there is no interaction between the two factors in entire simulation horizon the most strongly affected by t is spr the variation of streamflow would be 709 172 m3 s in snow melting period the typical interactions of factors on the variation of streamflow are spr t 358 87 m3 s swr p 544 47 m3 s t swr 691 45 m3 s and t spr 484 18 m3 s respectively the spr and t significantly affect each other s effect on streamflow this can be attributed to that the temperature influences the snowfall meanwhile the snow cover can reduce the temperature in non melting period the typical interactions of factors on the variation of streamflow are swr t 767 774 m3 s spr p 499 m3 s t swr 590 89 m3 s and p spr 714 61 m3 s respectively the interaction between t and swr has important effect on streamflow 5 6 comparison with other studies focus on the recent existing studies of the hydrological simulation and analysis in central asia ren et al 2018a and apel et al 2018 both developed statistical models for hydrological simulation but lacks the method to explore the relationship between runoff and factors jia et al 2020 developed a bnn fa for quantifying the effects of multiple factors on streamflow however almost all of these studies did not take into account the time lag effect between runoff and environmental factors therefore the main contribution of this study is to develop an integrated framework to analyze the streamflow variation by considering the time lag effect besides supply the hydrological analysis studies in the data sparse mountainous regions fed by both rainfall and glacier snow meltwater the main limitation of this research is that the statistical based approaches are likely prone to maximize fit for central tendencies rather than extremes it may lead to significant underestimation of peak value and overestimation of valley value rasel et al 2019 ordieres meré et al 2020 silatsa et al 2020 since the statistical relationship established by factors such as temperature is not sufficient to capture the long range hydrological process e g the variation of glaciers conducting hydrological studies by coupling

abbreviated as crff has been developed crff incorporates the cross correlation analysis cca random forest rf and factorial analysis fa within a general framework crff can help identify the time lag

investigating the individual and interactive effects of meteorological and physical factors on runoff simulation crff has been applied to the amu darya river basin in this basin the effect of lag time on simulation capacity and the effect of factors on the streamflow variation have been analyzed the major findings are as follows i there is the strongest positive correlation between sd and streamflow with a lag time of 130 days there exists the strongest negative correlation between swr and streamflow with a lag time of 10 days ii compared with sca and bnn rf has the best simulation performance generic ability in snow melting and entire simulation horizon period and the nse are 0 838 and 0 744 respectively iii the time lag effects of heat conditions e g temperature is weak with a lag time being less than 30 days while that of precipitation conditions e g snow precipitation rate are strong with a lag time ranging from 30 to 90 days iv the t is the dominant factor to the runoff

challenged due to complex hydrological phenomena and their effects e g runoff generation lags behind the hydrometeorological factors as well as observational data deficiency li et al 2019b the upper reaches of the amu darya river basin adrb are located in the tien shan mountains regions central asia where both snow glacier meltwater and rainfall contribute to streamflow li et al 2019b the streamflow supports the livelihood and economic development in adrb moreover streamflow is vital to maintain the ecological environment of the aral sea basin apel et al 2018 liu et al 2020 accurate streamflow simulation is needed for optimizing water resource utilization planning and sustainable management strategy in the adrb li et al 2019c however the adrb lacks dense hydrological and meteorological observation networks and long time span observed data chen et al 2017 therefore more robust and reliable methods are desired to analyze the variation of streamflow in the mountainous regions e g adrb 1 2 literature review previously numerous hydrological research works based on physically based models or conceptual models were conducted in the mountainous regions gan et al 2015 duan et al 2019 jin et al 2019 wang et al 2019 for example duan et al 2019 considered the influence of accumulated temperature on snowmelt using soil and water assessment tool swat model results indicated that the improved model is suitable for the estimation of snowmelt processes in the mountainous areas jin et al 2019 compared snowmelt runoff model srm with hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv in the nyang river basin results showed that the effects of temperature and precipitation on the hydrological process are different the physically based and conceptual models have advantages in quantifying the hydrological process via mathematical formulations which are efficient in accurate simulation anjum et al 2019 yu et al 2020 however almost of them have complex structures with many parameters lacking long time span multiple categories datasets e g weather soil and land use land cover data can lead to uncertainty and make model calibration difficult yaseen et al 2018 due to the low density observation network in the mountainous regions statistical models are also alternative methods for hydrological research zhuang et al 2016 apel et al 2018 ren et al 2018a 2018b for example zhuang et al 2016 developed a framework including stepwise cluster analysis sca to assess climate change impacts on hydrological processes in the kaidu watershed results indicated that sca can simulate streamflow accurately and the variation of streamflow is mainly affected by temperature and precipitation ren et al 2018a developed a probabilistic model based on bayesian neural network bnn for streamflow simulations of the kaidu river basin in central asia results showed that the model works well in the data sparse region apel et al 2018 developed a generic method for deriving seasonal river discharge based on observed data results indicated that the proposed forecast model can provide reliable seasonal streamflow predictions random forest rf is also used in the hydrological simulation and it has potential application value in mountainous regions huang et al 2019 li et al 2019a rezaie balf et al 2019 the statistical models e g rf sca and bnn have the robust generic ability to identify the relationship between factors and streamflow as well as for the ease in development díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 however in the mountainous regions the impact of the factors and the runoff generation do not occur simultaneously tong et al 2009 for example there exists the lag time between snowfall and runoff generation the time lag effect is important to the statistical models which are driven by samples from multiple datasets because the time lag effect may distort the relationship between the factors and streamflow leading to the simulation capacity degradation of the statistical models cross correlation analysis cca is effective for measuring the correlation between time series considering a range of time lags which has been applied to the environmental field kim et al 2018b iliopoulou et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 unfortunately few applications of cca to hydrological process analysis were reported besides multiple factors in hydrological models are not independent and may interact with each other zhuang et al 2016 the rf and other statistical models are insufficient in quantifying the main and interactive effects of factors on the streamflow conventional sensitivity analysis conducts by varying one factor over its range with the other factors held constant it fails to explore the interactions among the factors wang et al 2013 factorial analysis fa is an effective inference approach to reveal the interactive effects of multiple factors on factors montgomery 2017 therefore one potential approach for better dealing with the time lag effect and the interactive relationship of multiple factors is to integrate techniques of cca rf and fa into a general framework 2 novelty and contribution the objective of this study is to develop such a cca rf fa framework crff which is an integration of cross correlation analysis cca random forest rf and factorial analysis fa methods the novelty and contribution of this study are i an innovative framework of crff is firstly developed for runoff simulation ii crff can identify time lag effect in the mixed runoff generation mechanism both rainfall and glacier snow meltwater and tackle the problem of the simulation capacity degradation caused by the time lag effect iii crff is capable of investigating the individual and interactive effects of meteorological and physical factors on runoff simulation iv crff has been applied to the adrb a typical mountainous watershed in central asia v the results can help clarify the impact of the time lag effect on the hydrological cycle provide accurate streamflow simulation and identify the relationship between factors and runoff generation in the mountainous watershed 3 methodology the framework of crff method is illustrated in fig 1 the study steps are i preprocess the data to improve the quality of datasets by singular spectrum analysis ssa ii identify time lag effect between factors i e snow cover and predictand streamflow via cross correlation analysis cca and adjust the order of the factors iii random forest rf is used for streamflow simulation bayesian neural network bnn and stepwise cluster analysis sca are used for comparison to further illustrate the effectiveness of rf in streamflow simulation iv factorial analysis fa is used for analyzing individual and interactive effects of multiple factors based on the trained rf model the main effect can be explained as the variation of runoff with the change of level of a certain factor the interactive can be explained as when factor a is at a certain level the variation of runoff resulted by factor a with the change of the level of factor b in the ssa method two important parameters should be determined the window length l and the number of components m however if the original sequence has unique characteristics of integer period components it is recommended to define l as being proportional to the period zhang et al 2017 empirically the period of the streamflow and factors may be 12 months and l 12 is selected the m decides the number of components in the reconstruction each eigentriple contributes to its value and noise components typically contribute little cross correlation analysis is a practical signal processing method that identifies the correlation between two different time series considering a range of time lags kim et al 2018a the correlation coefficient between the two time series x 1 and x 2 e g streamflow and its factor with a time lag k is defined by 1 r k t 1 t k x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t k x 2 t t 1 t x 1 t x 1 t 2 t 1 t x 2 t x 2 t 2 where are x 1 t and x 2 t the sample means for each series k is allowed to be either positive or negative the cross correlation coefficient rk indicates the strength of a correlation between the two time series if the value of rk is close to 1 0 or 1 0 there is a strong negative or positive correlation between the two time series of streamflow and factor respectively each factor is analyzed by cca with streamflow separately find the highest or lowest value of rk between each factor and runoff and identify the lag time corresponding to the rk the lag time is used to adjust the order of the factors random forest rf is constructed by an ensemble of decision trees dts breiman 2001 using a validation dataset d each subset is generated from bootstrap aggregation bagging sampling then each subset is used to form each dt using the classification and regression trees cart algorithm finally a committee is formed by aggregating all sub decision trees and the result of rf is the average of the results calculated from the dt of the committee the program package of r named randomforest is employed for rf modeling there are two parameters for the program the ntree number of trees to grow and the mtry number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split the accuracy changes little with ntree is larger than 1000 so set ntree and mtry as 1000 and 1 respectively based on the time lag effect information rf and the other two models bnn and sca are employed for streamflow simulation huang et al 2006 zhuang et al 2016 jia et al 2020 the output is the simulated streamflow the kling gupta efficiency scores kge nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are chosen to evaluate the simulation capacity nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019 since the kge weights more components of error it is employed to evaluate the impact of lag times on the performance of rf and the other two models the sequential forward selection is used for selecting the modeling factors vasu and lee 2016 for a certain method i e rf first select a factor i e snow cover to bring into the model and retain the factor that obtains the highest nse retaining factor snow cover factors other than snow cover are brought in order and the factor improving the nse to the highest is retained and so on until the nse no longer improves fa technique is employed to efficiently explore the main effects by measuring the variation ranges of response under the impact of individual factors and factors interactions by investigating the specific variations of each factor s effect under the impact of another factor montgomery 2017 the procedure of fa consists of the steps i choose the factors ii evaluate the system responses based on the yates order iii identify the significance of factors and the interactions of factors on system outputs consider the simplest type of fa involves only two factors or sets of treatments the effects model can be expressed as 2 y ijk μ τ i β j τ β ij ε ijk i 1 2 a j 1 2 b k 1 2 n where yijk is the response when factor a is at the ith level i 1 2 a and factor b is at the j th level j 1 2 b for the kth experiment k 1 2 n μ is the mean effect τ i is the effect of factor a at i th level βj is the effect of factor b at the j th level τε ij is the joint effect between τ i and βj ε ijk is the random error component ssa ssb and ssab are the sums of squares for the factors a b and the interaction between a and b respectively sst and sse are the total sum of squares and the error component respectively and they can be express as 3 ss a 1 bn i 1 a y i 2 y 2 abn 4 ss b 1 an j 1 b y j 2 y 2 abn 5 ss ab 1 n i 1 a j 1 b y ij 2 y 2 abn ss a ss b 6 ss a 1 n i a a j 1 b k 1 n y ijk 2 y 2 abn 7 ss e ss t ss ab ss a ss b where yi and yj are the total of all observations of factor a at ith level of factor b the at jth level the yij indicate ij th interaction between factors a and b y denotes the grand total of all observations in this study a multilevel fa design with 34 experiments is performed associated with 4 factors each at three levels that low medium and high the accuracy of the simulated streamflow is sensitive to multiple factors their main and interactive effects on streamflow are quantified using the multilevel factorial analysis technique the rf and its factors including t p swr spr are tested by multilevel fa in three periods snow melting period non melting period and entire simulation horizon each factor was designed into three levels low middle and high corresponding to the 5th and 50th and 95th percentiles of all values leading to 34 treatment combinations sun et al 2018 treatment combinations means that the combination of different levels of factors in the fa experiment table 1 shows the serial number of the 34 treatment combinations 4 case study 4 1 study area the proposed crff is applied to the amu darya river basin adrb which is one of the largest sub basins of the areal sea basin in central asia fig 2 the amu darya river is a glacier snow meltwater and precipitation fed type river with average annual streamflow of more than 70 km3 granit et al 2012 the amu darya river consists of the vakhsh pyandj and some tributaries in the mountainous region in tajikistan and afghanistan the climate of the adrb is continental the average annual temperature is about 4 c and the annual average precipitation is more than 200 mm liu et al 2020 the annual precipitation is high 200 500 mm in mountainous areas and more than 80 of precipitation falls between may and september there are about 130 snow cover days in the basin the largest average annual snow depth is more than 10 cm and the peak snow depth is about 40 cm xu et al 2008 about 70 of the total streamflow occurs between spring and autumn ren et al 2018a 4 2 date acquisition and processing the data used in the study are listed in table 2 the hydrological station is located in atamyrat turkmenistan the length of observed streamflow data is from 2005 to 2018 and its time resolution is 10 days which was collected from the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences the observed streamflow dataset and 13 factors datasets 481 samples per dataset are partitioned into the calibration dataset 380 samples and validation dataset 101 samples the calibration dataset is used to train the models and the validation dataset is retained to test the capacity of the models to avoid the temporal correlation across consecutive data points both the calibration and validation datasets are composed of the full and independent years samples the validation dataset the length of the calibration dataset is from 2005 to 2015 the length of the validation dataset is from 2016 to 2018 the 13 factors related to the runoff generation mechanism in the adrb are selected as factors of the statistical hydrological models table 2 the datasets of the meteorological and hydrological factors range from 2005 to 2018 these datasets are preprocessed into mean value data with the same time resolution as the observed runoff data in particular the factor precipitation is preprocessed as cumulative data according to the bulletins of ca water info http www cawater info net and the interstate commission for water coordination icwc http www icwc aral uz index htm the data of the nurek were collected fig 3 shows there is a linear relationship between the observed streamflow and water inflow to the nurek reservoir indicating their patterns are consistent therefore the authors make an assumption for this study the large reservoirs or hydropower stations does not change the relationship between streamflow and factors and the trends of streamflow of the sub basins are consistent this assumption ensures the credibility of the following results obtained by crff 5 result and discussion 5 1 identifying time lag effect in this study ssa technique was used for improving the quality of the datasets fig 4 represents the result of the ssa the values of components 1 to 8 of the factors are larger than those of the remaining components hence choose m 8 and the components after 8 as noise components that should be eliminated based on the time series datasets reconstructed by ssa cca was employed to identify the time lag effect between streamflow and factors fig 5 shows the different correlation between streamflow and factors since the period is one year the results of the half cycle are highly symmetrical the results of lag time ranging of half year are analyzed for the 0 day lag the correlation between short wave radiation flux swr and streamflow is the strongest significant rk 0 699 similarly the average temperature t is strongly correlated with streamflow rk 0 664 with a lag time of 0 days the high values of rk of t and swr indicate that the time lag effect may be weak to the heat conditions the strongest significant correlation is obtained between snow depth sd and streamflow with a lag time of 130 days 4 months the values of rk range from 0 380 to 0 699 with a lag time of 0 days while the values of rk change with a time lag of 10 to180 days with the values of rk ranging from 0 714 to 0 792 the difference of rk demonstrates that cca can reduce the distortion of the relationship between the streamflow and factors caused by time lag effect ensuring the reliability of the simulated streamflow providing by rf 5 2 streamflow simulation table 3 and fig 6 summarize the simulated results of rf bnn sca during calibration period the simulated results of those three models agree well with the observed streamflow the best nse is obtained for rf with the value of 0 92 followed by sca 0 74 bnn 0 64 during the validation period rf also leads to the most satisfactory performance with nse being 0 84 while bnn sca are 0 81 and 0 80 respectively rf has better performances than other models table 3 shows the best simulation results of the three models are not obtained for all or a single factor indicating that the factors selection scheme avoids over fitting efficiently the interception between three statistical indicators including the pearson correlation coefficient standard deviation and root mean square error is generated in a taylor diagram the taylor diagrams represent the results of rf are the closest to the observed streamflow indicating the rf can effectively capture the variability of streamflow the statistics of the validation performance in the three periods are summarized in table 4 the rf model has the best performance in entire simulation horizon and snow melting period with nse being 0 84 and 0 74 respectively indicating that the rf has the most robust generic ability in the three models the result demonstrates that rf can identify the complex relationship between factors and streamflow in snow melting period for the mountainous regions fig 7 shows the details about the simulated streamflow in fig 7 a the results of the three methods are in good agreement with the observed and their values of nse range from 0 66 to 0 92 in calibration period the three methods are accurate in simulating valley values the mean value of relative error between the observed streamflow and the streamflow simulated by rf bnn sca are 11 7 14 5 and 13 6 respectively for the peak value of 2005 2010 2012 and 2015 the mean relative error of the results of the rf bnn sca are 37 2 54 65 and 44 85 respectively in validation period for the peak value of 2016 2017 and 2018 the mean relative error of the results simulated by the rf bnn sca are 13 2 13 0 and 53 1 respectively for the valley value of 2016 2017 and 2018 the relative error of the streamflow simulated by the three models ranges from 12 1 to 88 8 fig 7 b and c present the capacity of the three models with the validation dataset in the different periods in snow melting period the mean relative error of the peak and valley values for different models are rf 18 1 bnn 35 6 sca 40 6 and sca 19 8 bnn 28 6 rf 41 7 respectively in non melting period the mean relative error of the peak and valley values are bnn 13 4 rf 22 9 sca 21 1 and bnn 64 5 sca 71 28 rf 72 2 respectively fig 8 shows the frequency plots and qq plots for the standardized residual error a standardized residual is a ratio the ratio shows the difference between the observed count and the expected count in the frequency plots if the residual is standard normally distributed 95 of its points should be within 2 standard deviations from the mean 2 2 wang et al 2015 in the qq plot the data are distributed normally if all the points fall close to the straight line for the standardized residual of the rf bnn and sca the proportions are 95 1 93 3 and 94 1 respectively the distribution of the standardized residual indicates that though there more factors should be taken into account the results of the three models are acceptable 5 3 impact on the simulation performance by the time lag fig 9 presents the different simulation capacity of methods caused by the time lag effect of factors similar to the setting in the cca analysis the time lag effect from 0 to 180 days is analyzed the best models for each method are tested the first 25 and third 75 quartile of the value of kge are used to measure the good performance influenced by the lag time when the lag time increases the values of kge of the methods with the same factor have similar trend for example when the factor is swr the value of kge would first decrease and increase later for the temperature t tmin and tmax the values of kge of the methods exceeds the third quartile with the lag time from 0 to 30 days indicating that rf and other methods can effectively identify the relationship between temperature and streamflow with the lag time varies from 0 to 30 days the results of the factor swr are similar to that of t indicating that the interval between the time lag effect of heat conditions e g temperature radiation is weak to runoff generation less than one month the time lag effect on performance is weak when the thermal conditions e g temperature are factors for factor spr the value of kge exceeds the third quartile with the lag time from 30 to 70 days similarly for factor p the value of kge exceeds the third quartile with the lag time from 60 to 90 days the results of spr and p indicate there is a long interval between the impact of the precipitation conditions e g snowfall and the runoff generation precipitation conditions bring strong time lag effect at least one month in this study on performance 5 4 main factors influencing streamflow fig 10 displays the simulation results in snow melting period the highest lowest and average streamflow are 2836 52 m3 s 580 42 m3 s and 1414 52 m3 s respectively in the non snowmelt period the highest lowest and average streamflow of the 81 treatments are 3062 61 m3 s 608 29 m3 s and 1343 85 m3 s respectively in entire simulation horizon the highest lowest and average streamflow of the 34 treatments are 3365 19 m3 s 617 08 m3 s and 1390 75 m3 s respectively the large fluctuation range of streamflow demonstrates the fa is efficient to identify the sensitivity of the variation of streamflow fig 11 a presents the main effects of the four factors on the streamflow the factors are the factors of rf including t p swr and spr the predictands are average annual flow aaf average flow in snow melting period afs and average flow in non melting period afn take the plot of t in aaf as an example when the t level is from low to medium aaf increases from 1145 14 m3 s to 1185 04 m3 s when the t level is from medium to high aaf increases from 1185 04 m3 s to 1968 86 m3 s the slope of the line is positive indicating that t has a positive effect on aaf compared with the other three factors the t has the steepest slope demonstrating that t has the dominant effect on aaf in three periods the four factors have positive effects on streamflow when the four factors t p swr and spr are from the low level to the high level the aaf increases 823 72 m3 s 416 28 m3 s 623 06 m3 s and 699 07 m3 s respectively in the entire simulation horizon the order of streamflow variation responding to factors variation are t 823 72 m3 s spr 699 07 m3 s swr 623 06 m3 s p 416 28 m3 s similarly for afs the order in snow melting period are swr 713 95 m3 s t 490 24 m3 s p 481 44 m3 s spr 462 59 m3 s and for afn the order in non melting period are t 773 73 m3 s spr 642 82 m3 s swr 589 37 m3 s p 485 09 m3 s the contributions of factors to variation of streamflow in snow melting non melting and entire simulation horizon are t 35 8 swr 23 73 p 23 13 spr 13 08 t 37 46 swr 21 44 p 18 21 spr 17 56 and t 39 02 swr 21 78 spr 18 44 p 15 13 respectively the results indicate that the temperature has the dominant impact on the variation of streamflow in snow melting and non melting periods in the mountainous regions it may be because the temperature affects both the hydrological process such as snowfall and snowmelt long term monitoring of the annual average temperature is necessary to the mountainous regions spr is the second main factor in entire simulation horizon and non melting period implying that snowfall can still have a significant impact on the generation of runoff in the non snowmelt period 5 5 interactive effects on streamflow fig 11 b to fig 11 d present the patterns of the interaction of factors on streamflow the interactions identify the effect of each factor on streamflow under the influence of another factor for the plot of p t row 1 column 2 in fig 11 b when t and p are at the low level the streamflow is 1107 29 m3 s when t is at the high level under the low p level the streamflow increases to 1751 95 m3 s hence when t is at the high level under the low p level the variation of streamflow is 644 66 m3 s the coinciding lines indicate there is no interaction between the two factors in entire simulation horizon the most strongly affected by t is spr the variation of streamflow would be 709 172 m3 s in snow melting period the typical interactions of factors on the variation of streamflow are spr t 358 87 m3 s swr p 544 47 m3 s t swr 691 45 m3 s and t spr 484 18 m3 s respectively the spr and t significantly affect each other s effect on streamflow this can be attributed to that the temperature influences the snowfall meanwhile the snow cover can reduce the temperature in non melting period the typical interactions of factors on the variation of streamflow are swr t 767 774 m3 s spr p 499 m3 s t swr 590 89 m3 s and p spr 714 61 m3 s respectively the interaction between t and swr has important effect on streamflow 5 6 comparison with other studies focus on the recent existing studies of the hydrological simulation and analysis in central asia ren et al 2018a and apel et al 2018 both developed statistical models for hydrological simulation but lacks the method to explore the relationship between runoff and factors jia et al 2020 developed a bnn fa for quantifying the effects of multiple factors on streamflow however almost all of these studies did not take into account the time lag effect between runoff and environmental factors therefore the main contribution of this study is to develop an integrated framework to analyze the streamflow variation by considering the time lag effect besides supply the hydrological analysis studies in the data sparse mountainous regions fed by both rainfall and glacier snow meltwater the main limitation of this research is that the statistical based approaches are likely prone to maximize fit for central tendencies rather than extremes it may lead to significant underestimation of peak value and overestimation of valley value rasel et al 2019 ordieres meré et al 2020 silatsa et al 2020 since the statistical relationship established by factors such as temperature is not sufficient to capture the long range hydrological process e g the variation of glaciers conducting hydrological studies by coupling

with and incorporated into statistical models e g rf to reveal the internal hydrological sub process of the adrb in the following research 6 conclusions in this study an integrated cca rf fa framework abbreviated as crff has been developed crff incorporates the cross correlation analysis cca random forest rf and factorial analysis fa within a general framework crff can help identify the time lag effect in the mixed runoff mechanism both rainfall and glacier snow meltwater tackle the problem of the simulation capacity degradation caused by the time lag effect besides it is capable of investigating the individual and interactive effects of meteorological and physical factors on runoff simulation crff has been applied to the amu darya river basin in this basin the effect of lag time on simulation capacity and the effect of factors on the streamflow variation have been analyzed the major findings are as follows i there is the strongest positive correlation between sd and streamflow with a lag time of 130 days there exists the strongest negative correlation between swr and streamflow with a lag time of 10 days ii compared with sca and bnn rf has the best simulation performance generic ability in snow melting and entire simulation horizon period and the nse are 0 838 and 0 744 respectively iii the time lag effects of heat conditions e g temperature is weak with a lag time being less than 30 days while that of precipitation conditions e g snow precipitation rate are strong with a lag time ranging from 30 to 90 days iv the t is the dominant factor to the runoff in adrb v in snow melting period the order of contribution to the variation of streamflow is t 35 8 swr 23 7 p 23 1 spr 13 1 in non melting period the order is t 37 5 swr 21 4 p 18 2 spr 17 6 interactions between factors 5 4 in entire simulation horizon the order is t 39 0 swr 21 8 spr 18 4 p 15 1 vi the interaction between t and swr has significant effect on the streamflow spr can still considerably affect the runoff generation in non melting period the findings help make optimizing water resource utilization planning and sustainable management strategy in the mountainous regions

4671,drought is a major natural hazard that causes significant economic loss across the world drought indexes derived from remote sensing data can provide dynamic information in real time facilitating drought assessments the evapotranspiration et deficit index etdi is derived from observations of et and potential et etdi is an indicator of agricultural drought in this study actual et was modeled using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator with remote sensing data and ground station observation data as input we investigated the efficacy of etdi to indicate regional agricultural drought in a major region of winter wheat production in northern china spatiotemporal changes in etdi agreed well with the standardized precipitation index spi on a 5 month scale and with the palmer drought severity index pdsi etdi also agreed well with the composite index of yield reduction ci which represents the provincial percentage area of cropland subject to drought stress ci performed better in agricultural regions where water was supplied by precipitation rather than irrigation changes in winter wheat yield due to meteorological events were highly correlated with etdi rather than spi or pdsi averaged across specific growth stages weather conditions had significant impacts in april jointing and boot stages of winter wheat development in hebei province in may heading and grain filling stages in shanxi province and from january through april in other provinces these results demonstrate that etdi is a suitable index for indicating regional agricultural drought in order to inform

drought is a recurring extreme event in various parts of the world it significantly impacts the environment water resources and regional agriculture dai 2013 hobbins et al 2016 zhang and zhou 2015 drought represents an extended imbalance between water supply and demand its physical manifestations are deficits in water storage and reduced fluxes such as lack of precipitation in meteorological drought decreased evapotranspiration et and absence of soil moisture in agricultural drought and reduced stream flow and depletion of surface storage in hydrologic drought hobbins et al 2016 precipitation deficit is an important factor in drought quantification and assessment it is considered to be a major indicator of increasing drought risk in the context of climate change sheffield and wood 2008 drought indexes representing precipitation deficit have provided valuable global information concerning hydrologic and meteorological drought mcevoy et al 2016 two major indexes are the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which is based only on precipitation and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 which is based on precipitation and air temperature tair pdsi and spi indexes have been reviewed in detail elsewhere liu et al 2016a 2016b mishra and cherkauer 2010 mu et al 2013 quiring 2010 however other climatic factors such as wind speed humidity and solar radiation can be important drivers in the depletion of soil moisture and evolution and persistence of drought mcevoy et al 2016 pdsi driven with tair based potential et pet estimates significantly affected the magnitude and direction of short and long term drought trends particularly in energy limited regions hobbins et al 2008 and overestimated the rate at which drought was increasing globally sheffield et al 2012 the controversy over global drought trends originated from the discrepancy in pet estimates between the tair based on thornthwaite method and physically based on penman monteith pm model dai 2013 sheffield et al 2012 an increase in tair does not necessarily imply that long term pet has also increased donohue et al 2010 hobbins et al 2016 roderick et al 2007 physical variables other than tair such as decreased radiation atmospheric humidity and wind speed can decrease pet using pm despite a generally increasing regional tair donohue et al 2010 mcvicar et al 2012 roderick et al 2009 sheffield et al 2012 yin et al 2015 in fact in the presence of lower soil moisture an increase in pet further results in vegetation water stress vicente serrano et al 2018 several drought indexes based on pet have been demonstrated that the pet was the most useful variable in intensifying and quantifying drought severity for example the standardized precipitation et index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 obtained by means of the standardization of the difference between precipitation and pet at different time scales has shown better performance compared to spi mcevoy et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2012 in addition the evaporative demand drought index eddi based only on pet has been formulated and applied hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris et al 2007 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 and demand sensitive drought index dsdi etienne et al 2016 consider both water supply and demand however the application of drought indexes considering only pet is inappropriate in regions with sufficient soil moisture conditions because a positive pet anomaly does not mean drought severity vicente serrano et al 2018 the differences or ratios between et and pet have been adopted for quantifying drought severity some drought indexes were developed such as the et deficit index edi yao et al 2010 the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 the drought severity index dsi mu et al 2013 the standardized et deficit index sedi kim and rhee 2016 vicente serrano et al 2018 kim et al 2019 and the et deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 the difference between et and pet was defined as et deficit which is more relevant than solely considering et or pet from agronomic and ecophysiological perspectives vicente serrano et al 2018 the aforementioned drought indexes and their relative strengths and limitations are summarized in table 1 et estimates are subject to many sources of uncertainty in contrast to pet qiu et al 2021 pet can be derived from relatively simple t air based or physically based models sheffield et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2018 reliable et estimates are essential for drought quantification because et has a significant effect on drought severity duration and spatial extent kim and rhee 2016 the availability of remote sensing data has allowed to simulate spatially continuous et and to overcome the low temporal and spatial coverage of station based observation et data aghakouchak et al 2015 kim et al 2019 however some simulations of remotely sensed et may contain a high degree of uncertainty due to heterogeneous soil and vegetation conditions and complex atmosphere plant soil interactions moreover the modeling processes often disregard irrigation in the water cycle resulting in large biases of modelled et kim et al 2019 it is expected that the remotely sensed et estimates are further improved to analyze and monitor drought alternatively in the study a boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps will be used to simulate the daily et driven by remote sensing leaf area index land cover type water holding capacity and daily data observed at meteorological ground stations the beps has exhibited a good performance in comparison with observed et zhou et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 liu et al 2013 2015 2016a 2016b meanwhile prior studies have shown that the reliability of the aforementioned drought indexes based on et deficit at regional or global scales narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 anderson et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2018 kim et al 2019 among them etdi is a good indicator to assess short term agricultural drought at a regional scale because it indicates both soil moisture and plant health it is effective when there is high spatial variability and when values are comparable across distances irrespective of climate zones narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 our overarching goal is to indicate regional agricultural drought using etdi the specific objectives of this study were to 1 estimate daily et using beps with remote sensed data and data observed at meteorological stations as input and validate the model by comparing predicted et with ground measurements of latent heat flux 2 investigate the suitability of using etdi by comparison with pdsi and spi and 3 use etdi to quantify the percentage of area exhibiting and affected by drought and the percentage area of total crop failure 2 study sites and materials 2 1 description of study area the study area from 29 41 n 110 15 e to 42

river hai river and huai river basins the principal soil type is loam of aeolian origin that over geological time has been relocated by the rivers the area is the china s most important agricultural region for winter wheat farmers employ an annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer corn cao et al 1995 irrigation is used during the growth period of winter wheat due to the summer dominant rainfall mcvicar et al 2012 severe spring and early summer droughts characterized by insufficient precipitation and uneven spatial distribution of precipitation in the growing season are the factors that most impacting winter wheat yields du et al 2013 in recent decades longer drought events are recorded and the area affected by drought has increased these events highlight the importance

simulation and validation of daily et 3 1 1 description of model the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps which is a simplified process model was improved by incorporating algorithms embedded in the forest bgc model biological processes modeled in forest bgc were incorporated into beps to model carbon flows and water flows in the soil plant atmosphere system liu et al 1997 2013 simulating et is an important part of beps which takes as input remotely sensed spatial data for leaf area index land cover type and water holding capacity together with daily meteorological data liu et al 2003a 2003b 2013c beps includes a complex model of radiation transport through the canopy that separates sunlit and shaded leaf areas to calculate photosynthesis and transpiration it also includes flexible spatial and temporal scale transformations together with an instantaneous farquhar photosynthesis model and runs at a daily time step amthor et al 2001 liu et al 2003 the sensitivities of et modeled by beps to changes in leaf area index stomatal conductance tair and humidity have been compared to those given by other models amthor et al 2001 potter et al 2001 in this study beps calculated each et component daily and summed the daily values to give monthly et for each pixel in the study area with a spatial resolution of 0 08 the details of beps have been described elsewhere chen et al 1999 liu

approach of liu et al 2003 3 1 2 interpolation of meteorological data spline interpolated meteorological data are important input for beps elevation data was derived from a digital elevation model dem and used as a covariate to interpolate surfaces for the meteorological data the daily gridded datasets with 8 km resolution were interpolated for 824 sites by a thin plate spline using the software package anusplin from the australian national university hutchinson 2017 anusplin was developed for fitting and interpolating hydrometeorological and climatological variables its advantages over other approaches are summarized in the auxiliary materials mcvicar et al 2010 2002 anusplin has been used for spatial interpolation of meteorological data for ncp mcvicar et al 2002 and for the entire global land surface mcvicar et al 2010 3 2 calculation and validation of etdi various methods have been developed to calculate pet that include tair based observations hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite 1948 observed radiation priestley and taylor 1972 and combination of radiation with aerodynamics as in pm penman 1948 monteith 1965 et or pet will be coupled with atmospheric moisture demand and thus affect water availability on land surfaces dai 2011 some commonly used drought indexes that include et or pet as factors are shown in table 1 most drought indexes focus on the demand side of moisture imbalance and therefore use pm to calculate pet giving the drought indicator a foundation in the observation of climate data 3 2 1 potential et the penman equation for pet penman 1948 as formulated by shuttleworth 1993 provides the most appropriate and accurate calculation of pet for a changing climate chen et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 pm approach should be preferred to methods that use only tair or radiation because it also uses observed physical factors and all the key variables that determine pet are explicit mcvicar et al 2012 mcevoy et al 2016 4 pet e pr e pa δ δ γ r n

give monthly et and pet for 1982 2012 the monthly water stress ratio ws was calculated as 5 ws pet e t pet the monthly medians maxima and minima of ws were obtained from the 372 month data for 31 years 1982 2012 the percentage of water stress anomalies for each month was calculated by 6 ws a i j mw s j w s i j mw s j min w s j 100 if w s i j m w s j 7 ws a i j mw s j w s i j max w s j m w s j

minwsj is the minimum water stress for month j and wsi j is the monthly water stress ratio the monthly water stress anomaly ranges from 100 very dry to 100 very wet etdi during any month ranged from 4

i j 1 ws a j 50 where etdij 1 represents etdi for the initial month and wsaj is the monthly water stress anomaly negative values of etdi indicate drier periods and positive values indicate wetter periods 3 3 suitability of etdi for indicating agricultural drought 3 3 1 composite index of yield reduction the composite index ci of crop yield reduction which indicates the severity of agricultural drought ma and xu 2013 office 2006 was used to assess the capacity of etdi to capture the areal extent and intensity of an actual agricultural drought the calculation of ci is 9 ci i 3 90 i 2 i 3 55 i 1 i 2 20 where i1 i2 i3 are the provincial level areal percentages of drought exhibiting areas drought affected areas and total crop failure areas relative to the crop sown area greater values of ci indicate more serious drought table 3 shows the classification of drought by ci value 3 3 2 relative yield of winter wheat most empirical research divides crop yield having a long time series into

by 11 y r y y t y t 100 4 results 4 1 validation of daily et the performance of the et model was validated using linear regression between modeled and observed et values fig 2 predicted daily et fitted very well with observed values the beps model explained about 79 7 yucheng 87 7 changbaishan 83 4 haibei and 68 4 neimenggu of the variation in the observed values of et root mean square error values rmse were respectively 0 80 0 82 0 74 and 0 65 mm d for yucheng warm temperate semihumid rainfed farmland which was in the study region shandong province and for changbaishan temperate mixed forest haibei alpine meadow and neimenggu temperate typically grassland which were outside the study region meanwhile in terms of the determination coefficient r 2 there are a better agreement between the predicted and observed values of et which was synthetized at a monthly scale fig 2 the daily time series for observed and predicted et in yucheng are shown in fig 3 predicted values of et were slightly greater than observed values in summer in 2003 2005 and slightly less in spring in 2004 2005 the beps model predicted the two peak seasonality of et due to the dual cropping system wheat and maize in yucheng 4 2 validation of etdi figs 4 and 5 show the spatial distribution of coefficients of correlation between etdi and pdsi and values of spi at different time scales fig 4 shows higher values of spatial correlation coefficients r between etdi and daily 5 month spi in comparison with monthly pdsi and 3 month and 1 month spi the correlations between etdi and pdsi between etdi and the spis respectively signify the coincident variability of etdi pdsi and spi in addition the r values of etdi with different spis are shown in fig 5 for 115 meteorological stations from 1982 to 2012 monthly etdi has the highest correlations with 4 month and 5 month spi with average values of r that reached 0 459 and 0 456 respectively severe extreme drought was indicated by the values of the monthly drought indexes dai 2011 etdi 3 0 pdsi 3 0 and spi 1 5 fig 6 shows monthly variation in per cent area of severe extreme drought in the study region for 1982 2012 as indicated by etdi pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi all indexes showed similar temporal trends and the droughts in 1984 1986 1997 1999 2000 and 2001 were clearly identified by etdi pdsi and spi the highest correlation was between etdi and 5 month spi r 0 486 p 0 05 followed by the correlations between etdi and pdsi r 0 386 p 0 05 3 month spi r 0 317 p 0 05 and 1 month spi r 0 081 p 0 05 4 3 etdi as an agricultural drought index 4 3 1 comparison with ci the composite index was calculated to represent yield reductions in crops in the six provinces greater values of ci indicated the occurrence of more serious drought we used ci to indicate the severity of agricultural drought and the area subjected to agricultural drought fig 7 shows the variation in ci for 1982 2012 and drought severity severe and extreme drought occurred mainly in 1991 1997 1999 2000 and 2001 in shanxi province in the other provinces moderate drought events occurred mainly before 2001 with ci values in the range 0 2 0 3 we calculated annual etdi and pdsi and site scale spi by province for crop growth periods fig 8 shows simple linear regressions between the three drought indexes and ci all three drought indexes showed clear monotonic decreasing relationships with ci etdi was slightly less scattered and showed a trend that better matched that of ci when compared to the other two drought indexes there were generally higher values of r 2 for the relationship between ci and etdi when compared to pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi there were more significant correlations between ci and etdi in the study region when compared with pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi table 4 particularly in jiangsu province comparison of the correlations for the six provinces shows that etdi was the most accurate drought index and that it accurately represented areas of drought in each province the correlation coefficients were in the order of henan hebei shandong shanxi anhui jiangsu fig 8 the percentage of area with extreme drought indicated by etdi in the six provinces was also better correlated with ci than with pdsi and spi table 5 the relatively low correlation in jiangsu province seen in table 5 was due to better irrigation from the crisscross river and canal network and the perfect farmland water conservancy facility the average irrigation level of irrigated farmland reached 78 6 which explains its position in fig 9 4 3 2 comparison with the winter wheat yield the drought indexes for different time scales were aggregated in each county 5 month spi 3 month spi 1 month spi january may pdsi and etdi for different periods in the winter wheat growing season fig 10 shows the correlations between winter wheat yields and drought indexes at different time scales in each county of the provinces the average values of the correlation coefficients were similar except in shanxi province which had higher correlations between yield and etdi and both pdsi and spi the highest correlation between crop yield and etdi or spi with various time scales was observed for 5 month spi for different time scales of etdi four of the six provinces anhui jiangsu henan shandong showed a relatively consistent trend with the greatest correlation being between yield and etdi averaged from january to april fig 10 a b d e this result indicates that longer droughts tended to better correlate with yield which means longer droughts have a greater effect on winter wheat yield hebei showed a high correlation between yield and etdi in april the jointing and boot stages of plant development fig 10 c which indicates the impact of drought on emerging and developing plants in april similarly in shanxi the correlation between yield and the various etdis was higher in april jointing and boot stages and may heading and grain filling stages fig 10 f furthermore the correlations between yield and 5 month spi and january may pdsi were higher than any correlations between yield and various etdis comparison between the provinces indicates that etdi was the best drought indicator for hebei shandong shanxi and henan provinces which substantially agrees with our results as discussed in section 4 3 1 4 3 3 regional indicators for typical drought years fig 11 shows the spatial distributions of etdi pdsi and 5 month spi over monthly intervals for crop growing periods studies and drought monitoring reports for the region identify years 1994 park and schubert 2010 1997 zhao et al 1998 and 2000 barriopedro et al 2012 wei et al 2004 as years with severe drought 4 3 3 1 1994 high tair and large scale drought occurred in the yangtze and huaihe river basins in 1994 according to meteorological records and as documented by park and schubert 2010 precipitation decreased by 30 50 from march to the end of june and then by 80 90 tair was continuously high the drought was prolonged throughout spring summer and autumn the drought index showed that anhui and jiangsu provinces experienced the most serious summer drought since 1949 according to agricultural statistics the severe drought in anhui and jiangsu provinces in 1994 resulted in significant agricultural losses drought exhibiting areas of 2 97 and 2 95 million ha and drought affected areas of 2 39 and 1 35 million ha while crop failure areas were 0 45 and 0 26 million ha respectively data source http www zzys moa gov cn fig 7 a and b also show that the highest values of ci were observed in jiangsu and anhui provinces in 1994 0 27 and 0 20 respectively fig 11 a shows that etdi was a good indicator of drought in jiangsu and anhui provinces from its onset until july drought prevailed in the two provinces from august to october etdi and 5 month spi both indicated drought conditions in jiangsu and anhui for this period pdsi was a good indicator of the serious drought in most regions of henan over the entire growth period according to the statistics we obtained ci fig 7 a and b indicated the severity of the drought in jiangsu and auhui and showed only a mild drought in henan with a value of 0 1683 4 3 3 2 1997 the agriculture statistics we obtained show that most of the study region except jiangsu and anhui province suffered severe drought that resulted in significant agricultural losses drought exhibiting area drought affected area and crop failure area was 11 25 7 27 and 1 36 million ha respectively http www zzys moa gov cn ci reached 0 3165 0 1906 0 1987 and 0 1498 in shanxi shandong hebei and henan provinces fig 7 c f respectively the study region exhibited sustained high tair and little rainfall from june due to the ei nino southern oscillation zhao et al 1998 fig 11 b shows that both etdi and 5 month spi were good indicators of the drought that occurred in four provinces from june and showed consistent spatial variation for drought and precipitation the spatial distributions of etdi and 5 month spi show that drought persisted into the summer and became more severe in the northern yangtze river basin the spatial distribution of pdsi showed that precipitation occurred over most of hebei province for the entire crop growth period the precipitation indicated by pdsi was inconsistent with the observed mild agricultural drought ci 0 1987 captured in the meteorological records for 1997 the spatial distributions therefore show that etdi was more sensitive to drought than other indicators 4 3 3 3 2000 an unprecedented drought affected most of northern china in 2000 there was less rainfall than normal particularly in spring and summer in autumn rainfall continued for some time in the southern area of the yellow and huai river basins large scale droughts were reported in scientific journals barriopedro et al 2012 wei et al 2004 and on the government website http english mep gov cn soe soechina2000 english climate climate e htm fig 11 c shows a good correspondence between etdi and 5 month spi in spatial representation of drought and precipitation the distribution of etdi shows that the severity of the drought weakened gradually and the affected area in northern hebei and eastern shandong lessened from july serious drought occurred in anhui hebei shanxi and shandong which were recognized as drought disaster areas the greatest ci values in the four provinces were 0 256 0 179 0 208 and 0 356 respectively statistics obtained for the drought and crop losses precisely matched the drought indicated by etdi and 5 month spi fig 11 c shows the extreme drought indicated by pdsi in henan from march to may which is the critical growing period for winter wheat however the lowest value of ci in henan was only 0 113 in 2000 fig 7 d which leads us to conclude that pdsi did not capture the drought and wet conditions in henan province in summary there is a better spatiotemporal correspondence between crop yield and etdi and 5 month spi than pdsi which suggests there are two independent factors that enable us to detect and diagnose droughts however etdi showed spatial consistency from month to month suggesting that it incorporated rolling medium term moisture conditions over a longer time period 5 discussion 5 1 simulation and validation of daily et et is a key component of the terrestrial water and energy cycles as a parameter it describes the status of water in an ecosystem more immediately than meteorological drought indexes anderson et al 2011 estimating the severity and frequency of drought at regional or global scales using an algorithm based on et has become critical to cope with possible drought disasters shukla et al 2011 several algorithms that predict et have been developed that model surface energy balance including one or two source models ts vi models empirical models and models based on the pm equation li et al 2009 wang and dickinson 2012 the improved pm equation monteith 1965 has been used for regional or global calculations of actual et and as the evaporation submodel in many distributed hydrological and land surface models sheffield et al 2012 essential components of the equation are the parameterized canopy conductance and soil water stress which provide additional estimates of plant and environmental resistance to atmospheric demand sheffield et al 2012 in contrast to other methods of calculating et the pm et model using remote sensing data eliminated surface tair and used vegetation indexes calculated by modeling surface energy balance and water vapor diffusion with parameters for plant physiological characteristics surface resistance and aerodynamic factors cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 sherwood et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 anderson et al 2013 found that pm performed better than models using precipitation and soil moisture to calculate et pet calculated using the penman equation is more accurate than other methods because it includes parameters for wetting and drying hobbins et al 2008 sheffield et al 2012 the pm equation simplifies canopy structure and is reasonably accurate when the canopy is closed thus being suitable for estimating et of farmland crops in arid areas wang et al 2012 the beps model an environmental process model was developed to calculate actual et at a regional scale input to the model is a combination of remote sensing data and data observed at ground stations importantly beps uses vegetation data to calculate the distribution of et liu et al 2003 beps is based on the improved pm equation monteith 1965 which separates sunlit and shaded leaves the model also takes into account the canopy structure by calculating lai and a clumping index for each vegetation type there are major advantages in calculating and mapping et by beps 1 the contribution of each constituent process to total et is explicitly quantified and the relationship between soil moisture and et is explicitly described 2 et can be calculated for a defined period rather than as a series of long term averages allowing temporal variation in et to be studied liu et al 2003 and 3 the comparatively high resolution spatial and temporal modeling produces a fine spatial et distribution beps performed well in comparison with eight other ecosystem models having the second lowest rmse for predicted et of a boreal forest amthor et al 2001 in a north american carbon program study rmse for beps was the eighth lowest among 24 models used to predict gross primary productivity schaefer et al 2012 several recent studies have calculated the difference between et predicted by beps and actual et in china liu et al 2010 2013 2015 2016a 2016b zhou et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 in this study we replaced observed lai data with the glass lai data for the same period liu et al 2013 et predicted by beps explained 79 88 89 17 of the variation in observed daily monthly et at four chinaflus sites the vales of r 2 and rmse we obtained indicated a better performance than that obtained by liu et al 2013 in addition there is a very consistent daily variation in et between modeled and observed values with two peak changes for the dual cropping system wheat maize in yucheng in the study area from 2003 to 2005 fig 3 et predictions by beps have been shown to be more accurate than observations using the remote sensing data product of mod16 mu et al 2011 which indicated one peak only did not show the typical variation of a dual cropping system and generally underestimated et especially for croplands liu et al 2013 velpuriet al 2013 5 2 validation of etdi in this study etdi showed good spatial correlations with pdsi and spi with different time scales particularly with pdsi fig 4 a and 5 month spi fig 4 b the average values of correlation coefficients of gridded etdi with 4 month and 5 month spi for 115 meteorological stations were 0 40 fig 5 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 showed that etdi was positively correlated with pdsi and with 3 month spi r 0 7 in contrast to spi at other time scales this result suggests that the dry and wet periods indicated by etdi agreed with those indicated by pdsi and spi a previous study showed that esi had reasonable spatial and temporal correlations with pdsi over the continental united states anderson et al 2011 the drought index modis dsi which was based on et was shown to accurately indicate evapotranspiration relative to precipitation and soil moisture at the province level zhang et al 2016 pdsi and spi have longer time spans than remote sensing drought indexes choi et al 2013 guttman 2010 concluded that pdsi was not useful as an indicator of short localized droughts because it is calculated over a relatively long time scale etdi has less autocorrelation lag than pdsi which suggests that it could be a good indicator of short term drought narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 we conclude that etdi can identify more frequent dry and wet periods at short time scales irrespective of climatic conditions fig 4 shows that in southern anhui province there were no good correlations although in several drought years there were consistent spatial patterns shown between etdi pdsi and 5 month spi fig 11 the scarce meteorological stations in southern anhui province shown in fig 1 may result in a large discrepancy between spatial interpolated and calculated pet based on meteorological stations in this case the etdi based on et deficit might display relatively large differences with pdsi and spi secondly land surface temperature lst in mountainous areas was noticeably affected by altitude underlying surface type and aspect deng et al 2018 huangshan jiuhuashan and tianmushan mountains occupy most of the areas in southern anhui province in this study the t air data was used to simulate et rather than lst data but lst is strongly modulated by et anderson et al 2007 which may lead to the uncertainty of et calculation in mountainous areas additionally other uncertainties of et calculation may include persistent cloud cover and low solar illumination significantly constraining remote sensing data collection fensholt and proud 2012 most of the regional et flux results from plant transpiration and evaporation from precipitation intercepted on the canopy in lush vegetation areas mu et al 2013 5 3 suitability of etdi for indicating agricultural drought correlations between etdi and 5 month spi were good but spi does not take into account the effects of soil land use crop growth and tair anomalies that are critical to identifying agricultural drought narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 recent research into the impact of drought on agriculture showed that severe droughts caused significant crop loss in some drought prone countries wang et al 2014 severe droughts also resulted in significant reductions in crop yield in china ming et al 2015 qin et al 2014 as a vital component of the hydrological cycle and energy balance et is a more effective and key parameter for representing soil moisture status of the soil vegetation system and describing the moisture transferring from land surface to the atmosphere anderson et al 2011 sepulcre canto et al 2014 high et deficit will cause stomatal closure then decreasing in the photosynthetic activity and net primary production vicente serrano et al 2015 2018 thus etdi derived from et calculated by the swat model can be used to indicate agricultural drought and quantify drought severity narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 kim and rhee 2016 showed that 9 month sedi also based on the et deficit performs better than the precipitation dependent 9 month spi in identifying agricultural droughts indicated by the vegetation health index vhi similarly for evaluating performance of etdi for indicating regional agricultural drought we compared ci with etdi pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi from 1982 to 2012 we found that ci agreed well with etdi suggesting that etdi can indicate the intensity and severity of agricultural drought both pdsi and spi showed good correlations with ci although etdi showed better correlations with ci than pdsi or spi except in jiangsu province fig 8 table 3 thus etdi can indicate soil moisture stress there were good correlations between etdi and ci in percentage areas of severe extreme drought table 5 in most provinces that used little irrigation other than jiangsu province southern jiangsu province surrounds the yangtze delta and the terrain slopes gently and is crisscrossed by a water network that reduces the need for artificial irrigation dsi which is derived from modis et pet and ndvi data is a comprehensive drought index that represents the extent of natural irrigation mu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 showed a good correlation between dsi and soil moisture in agricultural provinces with adequate precipitation and a poor correlation in provinces that required agricultural irrigation however etdi combines information from vegetation conditions with information about et and uncertainties in either component can explain the relatively low correlations in jiangsu province zhang et al 2016 used dsi to show that the effects of drought on winter wheat yield varied at different growth stages they found that the most significant effects occurred at the heading and grain filling stages we obtained the same result for shanxi province however in hebei the most severe effects were found during the jointing and boot stages in april and in other provinces we found higher correlations for etdi averaged across january april this can be explained by the very high frequency and duration of drought were very high in shanxi fig 7 f and hebei fig 7 c in which agricultural areas are mostly in semiarid regions precipitation was the factor that mainly limited crop yields and in shanxi there was little irrigation other provinces have more sophisticated irrigation infrastructures fig 9 and are thus less vulnerable to agricultural drought we note that drought is not the only factor that affects winter wheat yield despite performing differently in the six provinces etdi is an effective indicator of winter wheat yield at the county level may and april are the key months especially in shanxi and hebei provinces for evaluating etdi as an indicator of drought at the county level 6 conclusions drought indexes that can be calculated from et have been developed in the last decades to indicate agricultural drought and show a remarkable superiority over other indicators we examined the suitability of etdi as a regional indicator of agricultural drought in northern china s principal winter wheat producing provinces by examining how well it captured regional agricultural drought severity and the effects of drought on winter wheat yield the main conclusions from the study are summarized as follow 1 there was a good consistency in spatial patterns between etdi 5 month spi and pdsi etdi was spatially consistent from month to month which showed an inclusion over time of natural medium term moisture conditions 2 the drought intensity severity and percent areas represented by etdi were more consistent with those indicated by ci rather than those indicated by pdsi or spi etdi performed well in indicating agricultural drought at provincial level we obtained better correlations between etdi and ci for hebei shandong shanxi and henan provinces which are less irrigated compared with anhui and jiangsu provinces indicating that etdi is more suitable as a drought indicator in regions where crops water is supplied by precipitation rather than irrigation 3 greater correlations at the county level between etdi and winter wheat yields affected by meteorological conditions showed that reasonably dry or wet conditions in the growing season are favorable for wheat production future studies should consider a higher temporal resolution of etdi crop growth is a continuous process and drought has varying effects on a crop according to growth stage because crop water requirements change over the growth period etdi at a smaller time scale will provide a more comprehensive indication of the effects of agricultural drought on crops pet derived from site level meteorological data is subject to inherited uncertainties due to spatial interpolation an index should be an operational indicator of both flash droughts and sustained droughts and it must offer an early warning of developing drought conditions further work is needed to calculate daily potential et and obtain higher temporal resolution etdi with finer spatial resolution in order to decrease the uncertainties from limitations of limited data it is also extremely important to develop an effective framework within which developing agricultural drought conditions can be assessed at different

4671,drought is a major natural hazard that causes significant economic loss across the world drought indexes derived from remote sensing data can provide dynamic information in real time facilitating drought assessments the evapotranspiration et deficit index etdi is derived from observations of et and potential et etdi is an indicator of agricultural drought in this study actual et was modeled using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator with remote sensing data and ground station observation data as input we investigated the efficacy of etdi to indicate regional agricultural drought in a major region of winter wheat production in northern china spatiotemporal changes in etdi agreed well with the standardized precipitation index spi on a 5 month scale and with the palmer drought severity index pdsi etdi also agreed well with the composite index of yield reduction ci which represents the provincial percentage area of cropland subject to drought stress ci performed better in agricultural regions where water was supplied by precipitation rather than irrigation changes in winter wheat yield due to meteorological events were highly correlated with etdi rather than spi or pdsi averaged across specific growth stages weather conditions had significant impacts in april jointing and boot stages of winter wheat development in hebei province in may heading and grain filling stages in shanxi province and from january through april in other provinces these results demonstrate that etdi is a suitable index for indicating regional agricultural drought in order to inform drought mitigation activities keywords evapotranspiration deficit index etdi palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation index spi crop yield agricultural drought 1 introduction drought is a recurring extreme event in various parts of the world it significantly impacts the environment water resources and regional agriculture dai 2013 hobbins et al 2016 zhang and zhou 2015 drought represents an extended imbalance between water supply and demand its physical manifestations are deficits in water storage and reduced fluxes such as lack of precipitation in meteorological drought decreased evapotranspiration et and absence of soil moisture in agricultural drought and reduced stream flow and depletion of surface storage in hydrologic drought hobbins et al 2016 precipitation deficit is an important factor in drought quantification and assessment it is considered to be a major indicator of increasing drought risk in the context of climate change sheffield and wood 2008 drought indexes representing precipitation deficit have provided valuable global information concerning hydrologic and meteorological drought mcevoy et al 2016 two major indexes are the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 which is based only on precipitation and the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 which is based on precipitation and air temperature tair pdsi and spi indexes have been reviewed in detail elsewhere liu et al 2016a 2016b mishra and cherkauer 2010 mu et al 2013 quiring 2010 however other climatic factors such as wind speed humidity and solar radiation can be important drivers in the depletion of soil moisture and evolution and persistence of drought mcevoy et al 2016 pdsi driven with tair based potential et pet estimates significantly affected the magnitude and direction of short and long term drought trends particularly in energy limited regions hobbins et al 2008 and overestimated the rate at which drought was increasing globally sheffield et al 2012 the controversy over global drought trends originated from the discrepancy in pet estimates between the tair based on thornthwaite method and physically based on penman monteith pm model dai 2013 sheffield et al 2012 an increase in tair does not necessarily imply that long term pet has also increased donohue et al 2010 hobbins et al 2016 roderick et al 2007 physical variables other than tair such as decreased radiation atmospheric humidity and wind speed can decrease pet using pm despite a generally increasing regional tair donohue et al 2010 mcvicar et al 2012 roderick et al 2009 sheffield et al 2012 yin et al 2015 in fact in the presence of lower soil moisture an increase in pet further results in vegetation water stress vicente serrano et al 2018 several drought indexes based on pet have been demonstrated that the pet was the most useful variable in intensifying and quantifying drought severity for example the standardized precipitation et index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 obtained by means of the standardization of the difference between precipitation and pet at different time scales has shown better performance compared to spi mcevoy et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2012 in addition the evaporative demand drought index eddi based only on pet has been formulated and applied hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris et al 2007 tsakiris and vangelis 2005 and demand sensitive drought index dsdi etienne et al 2016 consider both water supply and demand however the application of drought indexes considering only pet is inappropriate in regions with sufficient soil moisture conditions because a positive pet anomaly does not mean drought severity vicente serrano et al 2018 the differences or ratios between et and pet have been adopted for quantifying drought severity some drought indexes were developed such as the et deficit index edi yao et al 2010 the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 the drought severity index dsi mu et al 2013 the standardized et deficit index sedi kim and rhee 2016 vicente serrano et al 2018 kim et al 2019 and the et deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 the difference between et and pet was defined as et deficit which is more relevant than solely considering et or pet from agronomic and ecophysiological perspectives vicente serrano et al 2018 the aforementioned drought indexes and their relative strengths and limitations are summarized in table 1 et estimates are subject to many sources of uncertainty in contrast to pet qiu et al 2021 pet can be derived from relatively simple t air based or physically based models sheffield et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2018 reliable et estimates are essential for drought quantification because et has a significant effect on drought severity duration and spatial extent kim and rhee 2016 the availability of remote sensing data has allowed to simulate spatially continuous et and to overcome the low temporal and spatial coverage of station based observation et data aghakouchak et al 2015 kim et al 2019 however some simulations of remotely sensed et may contain a high degree of uncertainty due to heterogeneous soil and vegetation conditions and complex atmosphere plant soil interactions moreover the modeling processes often disregard irrigation in the water cycle resulting in large biases of modelled et kim et al 2019 it is expected that the remotely sensed et estimates are further improved to analyze and monitor drought alternatively in the study a boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps will be used to simulate the daily et driven by remote sensing leaf area index land cover type water holding capacity and daily data observed at meteorological ground stations the beps has exhibited a good performance in comparison with observed et zhou et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 liu et al 2013 2015 2016a 2016b meanwhile prior studies have shown that the reliability of the aforementioned drought indexes based on et deficit at regional or global scales narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 anderson et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2018 kim et al 2019 among them etdi is a good indicator to assess short term agricultural drought at a regional scale because it indicates both soil moisture and plant health it is effective when there is high spatial variability and when values are comparable across distances irrespective of climate zones narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 our overarching goal is to indicate regional agricultural drought using etdi the specific objectives of this study were to 1 estimate daily et using beps with remote sensed data and data observed at meteorological stations as input and validate the model by comparing predicted et with ground measurements of latent heat flux 2 investigate the suitability of using etdi by comparison with pdsi and spi and 3 use etdi to quantify the percentage of area exhibiting and affected by drought and the percentage area of total crop failure 2 study sites and materials 2 1 description of study area the study area from 29 41 n 110 15 e to 42 37 n 122 43 e is 907100 km2 it includes five provinces of the north china plain ncp hebei henan shandong anhui jiangsu and shanxi province fig 1 the major river basins in the plain are the yellow river hai river and huai river basins the principal soil type is loam of aeolian origin that over geological time has been relocated by the rivers the area is the china s most important agricultural region for winter wheat farmers employ an annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer corn cao et al 1995 irrigation is used during the growth period of winter wheat due to the summer dominant rainfall mcvicar et al 2012 severe spring and early summer droughts characterized by insufficient precipitation and uneven spatial distribution of precipitation in the growing season are the factors that most impacting winter wheat yields du et al 2013 in recent decades longer drought events are recorded and the area affected by drought has increased these events highlight the importance of monitoring agricultural drought in this region piao et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2005 2 2 data 2 2 1 remote sensing data land cover modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data

simulation and validation of daily et 3 1 1 description of model the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps which is a simplified process model was improved by incorporating algorithms embedded in the forest bgc model biological processes modeled in forest bgc were incorporated into beps to model carbon flows and water flows in the soil plant atmosphere system liu et al 1997 2013 simulating et is an important part of beps which takes as input remotely sensed spatial data for leaf area index land cover type and water holding capacity together with daily meteorological data liu et al 2003a 2003b 2013c beps includes a complex model of radiation transport through the canopy that separates sunlit and shaded leaf areas to calculate photosynthesis and transpiration it also includes flexible spatial and temporal scale transformations together with an instantaneous farquhar photosynthesis model and runs at a daily time step amthor et al 2001 liu et al 2003 the sensitivities of et modeled by beps to changes in leaf area index stomatal conductance tair and humidity have been compared to those given by other models amthor et al 2001 potter et al 2001 in this study beps calculated each et component daily and summed the daily values to give monthly et for each pixel in the study area with a spatial resolution of 0 08 the details of beps have been described elsewhere chen et al 1999 liu et al 2003 2013 2015 2016a 2016b thus only a brief description is given here the et model was 1 et t plant t under e plant s plant e soil s ground where tplant is transpiration from the canopy mm d

approach of liu et al 2003 3 1 2 interpolation of meteorological data spline interpolated meteorological data are important input for beps elevation data was derived from a digital elevation model dem and used as a covariate to interpolate surfaces for the meteorological data the daily gridded datasets with 8 km resolution were interpolated for 824 sites by a thin plate spline using the software package anusplin from the australian national university hutchinson 2017 anusplin was developed for fitting and interpolating hydrometeorological and climatological variables its advantages over other approaches are summarized in the auxiliary materials mcvicar et al 2010 2002 anusplin has been used for spatial interpolation of meteorological data for ncp mcvicar et al 2002 and for the entire global land surface mcvicar et al 2010 3 2 calculation and validation of etdi various methods have been developed to calculate pet that include tair based observations hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite 1948 observed radiation priestley and taylor 1972 and combination of radiation with aerodynamics as in pm penman 1948 monteith 1965 et or pet will be coupled with atmospheric moisture demand and thus affect water availability on land surfaces dai 2011 some commonly used drought indexes that include et or pet as factors are shown in table 1 most drought indexes focus on the demand side of moisture imbalance and therefore use pm to calculate pet giving the drought indicator a foundation in the observation of climate data 3 2 1 potential et the penman equation for pet penman 1948 as formulated by shuttleworth 1993 provides the most appropriate and accurate calculation of pet for a changing climate chen et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 pm approach should be preferred to methods that use only tair or radiation because it also uses observed physical factors and all the key variables that determine pet are explicit mcvicar et al 2012 mcevoy et al 2016 4 pet e pr e pa δ δ γ r n

give monthly et and pet for 1982 2012 the monthly water stress ratio ws was calculated as 5 ws pet e t pet the monthly medians maxima and minima of ws were obtained from the 372 month data for 31 years 1982 2012 the percentage of water stress anomalies for each month was calculated by 6 ws a i j mw s j w s i j mw s j min w s j 100 if w s i j m w s j 7 ws a i j mw s j w s i j max w s j m w s j

i j 1 ws a j 50 where etdij 1 represents etdi for the initial month and wsaj is the monthly water stress anomaly negative values of etdi indicate drier periods and positive values indicate wetter periods 3 3 suitability of etdi for indicating agricultural drought 3 3 1 composite index of yield reduction the composite index ci of crop yield reduction which indicates the severity of agricultural drought ma and xu 2013 office 2006 was used to assess the capacity of etdi to capture the areal extent and intensity of an actual agricultural drought the calculation of ci is 9 ci i 3 90 i 2 i 3 55 i

by 11 y r y y t y t 100 4 results 4 1 validation of daily et the performance of the et model was validated using linear regression between modeled and observed et values fig 2 predicted daily et fitted very well with observed values the beps model explained about 79 7 yucheng 87 7 changbaishan 83 4 haibei and 68 4 neimenggu of the variation in the observed values of et root mean square error values rmse were respectively 0 80 0 82 0 74 and 0 65 mm d for yucheng warm temperate semihumid rainfed farmland which was in the study region shandong province and for changbaishan temperate mixed forest haibei alpine meadow and neimenggu temperate typically grassland which were outside the study region meanwhile in terms of the determination coefficient r 2 there are a better agreement between the predicted and observed values of et which was synthetized at a monthly scale fig 2 the daily time series for observed and predicted et in yucheng are shown in fig 3 predicted values of et were slightly greater than observed values in summer in 2003 2005 and slightly less in spring in 2004 2005 the beps model predicted the two peak seasonality of et due to the dual cropping system wheat and maize in yucheng 4 2 validation of etdi figs 4 and 5 show the spatial distribution of coefficients of correlation between etdi and pdsi and values of spi at different time scales fig 4 shows higher values of spatial correlation coefficients r between etdi and daily 5 month spi in comparison with monthly pdsi and 3 month and 1 month spi the correlations between etdi and pdsi between etdi and the spis respectively signify the coincident variability of etdi pdsi and spi in addition the r values of etdi with different spis are shown in fig 5 for 115 meteorological stations from 1982 to 2012 monthly etdi has the highest correlations with 4 month and 5 month spi with average values of r that reached 0 459 and 0 456 respectively severe extreme drought was indicated by the values of the monthly drought indexes dai 2011 etdi 3 0 pdsi 3 0 and spi 1 5 fig 6 shows monthly variation in per cent area of severe extreme drought in the study region for 1982 2012 as indicated by etdi pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi all indexes showed similar temporal trends and the droughts in 1984 1986 1997 1999 2000 and 2001 were clearly identified by etdi pdsi and spi the highest correlation was between etdi and 5 month spi r 0 486 p 0 05 followed by the correlations between etdi and pdsi r 0 386 p 0 05 3 month spi r 0 317 p 0 05 and 1 month spi r 0 081 p 0 05 4 3 etdi as an agricultural drought index 4 3 1 comparison with ci the composite index was calculated to represent yield reductions in crops in the six provinces greater values of ci indicated the occurrence of more serious drought we used ci to indicate the severity of agricultural drought and the area subjected to agricultural drought fig 7 shows the variation in ci for 1982 2012 and drought severity severe and extreme drought occurred mainly in 1991 1997 1999 2000 and 2001 in shanxi province in the other provinces moderate drought events occurred mainly before 2001 with ci values in the range 0 2 0 3 we calculated annual etdi and pdsi and site scale spi by province for crop growth periods fig 8 shows simple linear regressions between the three drought indexes and ci all three drought indexes showed clear monotonic decreasing relationships with ci etdi was slightly less scattered and showed a trend that better matched that of ci when compared to the other two drought indexes there were generally higher values of r 2 for the relationship between ci and etdi when compared to pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi there were more significant correlations between ci and etdi in the study region when compared with pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi table 4 particularly in jiangsu province comparison of the correlations for the six provinces shows that etdi was the most accurate drought index and that it accurately represented areas of drought in each province the correlation coefficients were in the order of henan hebei shandong shanxi anhui jiangsu fig 8 the percentage of area with extreme drought indicated by etdi in the six provinces was also better correlated with ci than with pdsi and spi table 5 the relatively low correlation in jiangsu province seen in table 5 was due to better irrigation from the crisscross river and canal network and the perfect farmland water conservancy facility the average irrigation level of irrigated farmland reached 78 6 which explains its position in fig 9 4 3 2 comparison with the winter wheat yield the drought indexes for different time scales were aggregated in each county 5 month spi 3 month spi 1 month spi january may pdsi and etdi for different periods in the winter wheat growing season fig 10 shows the correlations between winter wheat yields and drought indexes at different time scales in each county of the provinces the average values of the correlation coefficients were similar except in shanxi province which had higher correlations between yield and etdi and both pdsi and spi the highest correlation between crop yield and etdi or spi with various time scales was observed for 5 month spi for different time scales of etdi four of the six provinces anhui jiangsu henan shandong showed a relatively consistent trend with the greatest correlation being between yield and etdi averaged from january to april fig 10 a b d e this result indicates that longer droughts tended to better correlate with yield which means longer droughts have a greater effect on winter wheat yield hebei showed a high correlation between yield and etdi in april the jointing and boot stages of plant development fig 10 c which indicates the impact of drought on emerging and developing plants in april similarly in shanxi the correlation between yield and the various etdis was higher in april jointing and boot stages and may heading and grain filling stages fig 10 f furthermore the correlations between yield and 5 month spi and january may pdsi were higher than any correlations between yield and various etdis comparison between the provinces indicates that etdi was the best drought indicator for hebei shandong shanxi and henan provinces which substantially agrees with our results as discussed in section 4 3 1 4 3 3 regional indicators for typical drought years fig 11 shows the spatial distributions of etdi pdsi and 5 month spi over monthly intervals for crop growing periods studies and drought monitoring reports for the region identify years 1994 park and schubert 2010 1997 zhao et al 1998 and 2000 barriopedro et al 2012 wei et al 2004 as years with severe drought 4 3 3 1 1994 high tair and large scale drought occurred in the yangtze and huaihe river basins in 1994 according to meteorological records and as documented by park and schubert 2010 precipitation decreased by 30 50 from march to the end of june and then by 80 90 tair was continuously high the drought was prolonged throughout spring summer and autumn the drought index showed that anhui and jiangsu provinces experienced the most serious summer drought since 1949 according to agricultural statistics the severe drought in anhui and jiangsu provinces in 1994 resulted in significant agricultural losses drought exhibiting areas of 2 97 and 2 95 million ha and drought affected areas of 2 39 and 1 35 million ha while crop failure areas were 0 45 and 0 26 million ha respectively data source http www zzys moa gov cn fig 7 a and b also show that the highest values of ci were observed in jiangsu and anhui provinces in 1994 0 27 and 0 20 respectively fig 11 a shows that etdi was a good indicator of drought in jiangsu and anhui provinces from its onset until july drought prevailed in the two provinces from august to october etdi and 5 month spi both indicated drought conditions in jiangsu and anhui for this period pdsi was a good indicator of the serious drought in most regions of henan over the entire growth period according to the statistics we obtained ci fig 7 a and b indicated the severity of the drought in jiangsu and auhui and showed only a mild drought in henan with a value of 0 1683 4 3 3 2 1997 the agriculture statistics we obtained show that most of the study region except jiangsu and anhui province suffered severe drought that resulted in significant agricultural losses drought exhibiting area drought affected area and crop failure area was 11 25 7 27 and 1 36 million ha respectively http www zzys moa gov cn ci reached 0 3165 0 1906 0 1987 and 0 1498 in shanxi shandong hebei and henan provinces fig 7 c f respectively the study region exhibited sustained high tair and little rainfall from june due to the ei nino southern oscillation zhao et al 1998 fig 11 b shows that both etdi and 5 month spi were good indicators of the drought that occurred in four provinces from june and showed consistent spatial variation for drought and precipitation the spatial distributions of etdi and 5 month spi show that drought persisted into the summer and became more severe in the northern yangtze river basin the spatial distribution of pdsi showed that precipitation occurred over most of hebei province for the entire crop growth period the precipitation indicated by pdsi was inconsistent with the observed mild agricultural drought ci 0 1987 captured in the meteorological records for 1997 the spatial distributions therefore show that etdi was more sensitive to drought than other indicators 4 3 3 3 2000 an unprecedented drought affected most of northern china in 2000 there was less rainfall than normal particularly in spring and summer in autumn rainfall continued for some time in the southern area of the yellow and huai river basins large scale droughts were reported in scientific journals barriopedro et al 2012 wei et al 2004 and on the government website http english mep gov cn soe soechina2000 english climate climate e htm fig 11 c shows a good correspondence between etdi and 5 month spi in spatial representation of drought and precipitation the distribution of etdi shows that the severity of the drought weakened gradually and the affected area in northern hebei and eastern shandong lessened from july serious drought occurred in anhui hebei shanxi and shandong which were recognized as drought disaster areas the greatest ci values in the four provinces were 0 256 0 179 0 208 and 0 356 respectively statistics obtained for the drought and crop losses precisely matched the drought indicated by etdi and 5 month spi fig 11 c shows the extreme drought indicated by pdsi in henan from march to may which is the critical growing period for winter wheat however the lowest value of ci in henan was only 0 113 in 2000 fig 7 d which leads us to conclude that pdsi did not capture the drought and wet conditions in henan province in summary there is a better spatiotemporal correspondence between crop yield and etdi and 5 month spi than pdsi which suggests there are two independent factors that enable us to detect and diagnose droughts however etdi showed spatial consistency from month to month suggesting that it incorporated rolling medium term moisture conditions over a longer time period 5 discussion 5 1 simulation and validation of daily et et is a key component of the terrestrial water and energy cycles as a parameter it describes the status of water in an ecosystem more immediately than meteorological drought indexes anderson et al 2011 estimating the severity and frequency of drought at regional or global scales using an algorithm based on et has become critical to cope with possible drought disasters shukla et al 2011 several algorithms that predict et have been developed that model surface energy balance including one or two source models ts vi models empirical models and models based on the pm equation li et al 2009 wang and dickinson 2012 the improved pm equation monteith 1965 has been used for regional or global calculations of actual et and as the evaporation submodel in many distributed hydrological and land surface models sheffield et al 2012 essential components of the equation are the parameterized canopy conductance and soil water stress which provide additional estimates of plant and environmental resistance to atmospheric demand sheffield et al 2012 in contrast to other methods of calculating et the pm et model using remote sensing data eliminated surface tair and used vegetation indexes calculated by modeling surface energy balance and water vapor diffusion with parameters for plant physiological characteristics surface resistance and aerodynamic factors cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 sherwood et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 anderson et al 2013 found that pm performed better than models using precipitation and soil moisture to calculate et pet calculated using the penman equation is more accurate than other methods because it includes parameters for wetting and drying hobbins et al 2008 sheffield et al 2012 the pm equation simplifies canopy structure and is reasonably accurate when the canopy is closed thus being suitable for estimating et of farmland crops in arid areas wang et al 2012 the beps model an environmental process model was developed to calculate actual et at a regional scale input to the model is a combination of remote sensing data and data observed at ground stations importantly beps uses vegetation data to calculate the distribution of et liu et al 2003 beps is based on the improved pm equation monteith 1965 which separates sunlit and shaded leaves the model also takes into account the canopy structure by calculating lai and a clumping index for each vegetation type there are major advantages in calculating and mapping et by beps 1 the contribution of each constituent process to total et is explicitly quantified and the relationship between soil moisture and et is explicitly described 2 et can be calculated for a defined period rather than as a series of long term averages allowing temporal variation in et to be studied liu et al 2003 and 3 the comparatively high resolution spatial and temporal modeling produces a fine spatial et distribution beps performed well in comparison with eight other ecosystem models having the second lowest rmse for predicted et of a boreal forest amthor et al 2001 in a north american carbon program study rmse for beps was the eighth lowest among 24 models used to predict gross primary productivity schaefer et al 2012 several recent studies have calculated the difference between et predicted by beps and actual et in china liu et al 2010 2013 2015 2016a 2016b zhou et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 in this study we replaced observed lai data with the glass lai data for the same period liu et al 2013 et predicted by beps explained 79 88 89 17 of the variation in observed daily monthly et at four chinaflus sites the vales of r 2 and rmse we obtained indicated a better performance than that obtained by liu et al 2013 in addition there is a very consistent daily variation in et between modeled and observed values with two peak changes for the dual cropping system wheat maize in yucheng in the study area from 2003 to 2005 fig 3 et predictions by beps have been shown to be more accurate than observations using the remote sensing data product of mod16 mu et al 2011 which indicated one peak only did not show the typical variation of a dual cropping system and generally underestimated et especially for croplands liu et al 2013 velpuriet al 2013 5 2 validation of etdi in this study etdi showed good spatial correlations with pdsi and spi with different time scales particularly with pdsi fig 4 a and 5 month spi fig 4 b the average values of correlation coefficients of gridded etdi with 4 month and 5 month spi for 115 meteorological stations were 0 40 fig 5 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 showed that etdi was positively correlated with pdsi and with 3 month spi r 0 7 in contrast to spi at other time scales this result suggests that the dry and wet periods indicated by etdi agreed with those indicated by pdsi and spi a previous study showed that esi had reasonable spatial and temporal correlations with pdsi over the continental united states anderson et al 2011 the drought index modis dsi which was based on et was shown to accurately indicate evapotranspiration relative to precipitation and soil moisture at the province level zhang et al 2016 pdsi and spi have longer time spans than remote sensing drought indexes choi et al 2013 guttman 2010 concluded that pdsi was not useful as an indicator of short localized droughts because it is calculated over a relatively long time scale etdi has less autocorrelation lag than pdsi which suggests that it could be a good indicator of short term drought narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 we conclude that etdi can identify more frequent dry and wet periods at short time scales irrespective of climatic conditions fig 4 shows that in southern anhui province there were no good correlations although in several drought years there were consistent spatial patterns shown between etdi pdsi and 5 month spi fig 11 the scarce meteorological stations in southern anhui province shown in fig 1 may result in a large discrepancy between spatial interpolated and calculated pet based on meteorological stations in this case the etdi based on et deficit might display relatively large differences with pdsi and spi secondly land surface temperature lst in mountainous areas was noticeably affected by altitude underlying surface type and aspect deng et al 2018 huangshan jiuhuashan and tianmushan mountains occupy most of the areas in southern anhui province in this study the t air data was used to simulate et rather than lst data but lst is strongly modulated by et anderson et al 2007 which may lead to the uncertainty of et calculation in mountainous areas additionally other uncertainties of et calculation may include persistent cloud cover and low solar illumination significantly constraining remote sensing data collection fensholt and proud 2012 most of the regional et flux results from plant transpiration and evaporation from precipitation intercepted on the canopy in lush vegetation areas mu et al 2013 5 3 suitability of etdi for indicating agricultural drought correlations between etdi and 5 month spi were good but spi does not take into account the effects of soil land use crop growth and tair anomalies that are critical to identifying agricultural drought narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 recent research into the impact of drought on agriculture showed that severe droughts caused significant crop loss in some drought prone countries wang et al 2014 severe droughts also resulted in significant reductions in crop yield in china ming et al 2015 qin et al 2014 as a vital component of the hydrological cycle and energy balance et is a more effective and key parameter for representing soil moisture status of the soil vegetation system and describing the moisture transferring from land surface to the atmosphere anderson et al 2011 sepulcre canto et al 2014 high et deficit will cause stomatal closure then decreasing in the photosynthetic activity and net primary production vicente serrano et al 2015 2018 thus etdi derived from et calculated by the swat model can be used to indicate agricultural drought and quantify drought severity narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 kim and rhee 2016 showed that 9 month sedi also based on the et deficit performs better than the precipitation dependent 9 month spi in identifying agricultural droughts indicated by the vegetation health index vhi similarly for evaluating performance of etdi for indicating regional agricultural drought we compared ci with etdi pdsi 5 month spi 3 month spi and 1 month spi from 1982 to 2012 we found that ci agreed well with etdi suggesting that etdi can indicate the intensity and severity of agricultural drought both pdsi and spi showed good correlations with ci although etdi showed better correlations with ci than pdsi or spi except in jiangsu province fig 8 table 3 thus etdi can indicate soil moisture stress there were good correlations between etdi and ci in percentage areas of severe extreme drought table 5 in most provinces that used little irrigation other than jiangsu province southern jiangsu province surrounds the yangtze delta and the terrain slopes gently and is crisscrossed by a water network that reduces the need for artificial irrigation dsi which is derived from modis et pet and ndvi data is a comprehensive drought index that represents the extent of natural irrigation mu et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 showed a good correlation between dsi and soil moisture in agricultural provinces with adequate precipitation and a poor correlation in provinces that required agricultural irrigation however etdi combines information from vegetation conditions with information about et and uncertainties in either component can explain the relatively low correlations in jiangsu province zhang et al 2016 used dsi to show that the effects of drought on winter wheat yield varied at different growth stages they found that the most significant effects occurred at the heading and grain filling stages we obtained the same result for shanxi province however in hebei the most severe effects were found during the jointing and boot stages in april and in other provinces we found higher correlations for etdi averaged across january april this can be explained by the very high frequency and duration of drought were very high in shanxi fig 7 f and hebei fig 7 c in which agricultural areas are mostly in semiarid regions precipitation was the factor that mainly limited crop yields and in shanxi there was little irrigation other provinces have more sophisticated irrigation infrastructures fig 9 and are thus less vulnerable to agricultural drought we note that drought is not the only factor that affects winter wheat yield despite performing differently in the six provinces etdi is an effective indicator of winter wheat yield at the county level may and april are the key months especially in shanxi and hebei provinces for evaluating etdi as an indicator of drought at the county level 6 conclusions drought indexes that can be calculated from et have been developed in the last decades to indicate agricultural drought and show a remarkable superiority over other indicators we examined the suitability of etdi as a regional indicator of agricultural drought in northern china s principal winter wheat producing provinces by examining how well it captured regional agricultural drought severity and the effects of drought on winter wheat yield the main conclusions from the study are summarized as follow 1 there was a good consistency in spatial patterns between etdi 5 month spi and pdsi etdi was spatially consistent from month to month which showed an inclusion over time of natural medium term moisture conditions 2 the drought intensity severity and percent areas represented by etdi were more consistent with those indicated by ci rather than those indicated by pdsi or spi etdi performed well in indicating agricultural drought at provincial level we obtained better correlations between etdi and ci for hebei shandong shanxi and henan provinces which are less irrigated compared with anhui and jiangsu provinces indicating that etdi is more suitable as a drought indicator in regions where crops water is supplied by precipitation rather than irrigation 3 greater correlations at the county level between etdi and winter wheat yields affected by meteorological conditions showed that reasonably dry or wet conditions in the growing season are favorable for wheat production future studies should consider a higher temporal resolution of etdi crop growth is a continuous process and drought has varying effects on a crop according to growth stage because crop water requirements change over the growth period etdi at a smaller time scale will provide a more comprehensive indication of the effects of agricultural drought on crops pet derived from site level meteorological data is subject to inherited uncertainties due to spatial interpolation an index should be an operational indicator of both flash droughts and sustained droughts and it must offer an early warning of developing drought conditions further work is needed to calculate daily potential et and obtain higher temporal resolution etdi with finer spatial resolution in order to decrease the uncertainties from limitations of limited data it is also extremely important to develop an effective framework within which developing agricultural drought conditions can be assessed at different growth stages making flash and sustained droughts more detectable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

4672,streamflow the key component of catchment scale hydrology is acknowledged as being induced by climate change and land use alterations the potential quantification of these hydrological drivers on streamflow variations is quite challenging this study quantitatively assesses the isolated influences of climate change and land use alterations on the streamflow variations in the brahmani 36 800 km2 and baitarani 12 094 km2 river catchments of eastern india by applying three complementary techniques involving i m dmc approach traditional trend analysis ii m scarq approach slope change ratio approach and iii swat based hydrological modeling approach the hydro meteorological precipitation temperature and streamflow data variation and its significance are studied at a decadal time spell followed by the mann kendall test and the linear regression technique the relative contributions of changing climate θ ji c and land use alterations θ ji l are quantified at a decadal time spell considering the initial time spells as baseline periods 1979 1988 1989 1998 and 1999 2008 and the subsequent time spells as impacted periods 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 outcomes of our comparative assessment of the study area indicate that the empirical approaches m dmc and m scarq result in land use alterations as a dominant contributing factor in streamflow variations however the performance of the swat based hydrological approach specifies identical contributions from both the climate and land use changes the diversity in results from these three approaches is associated with different sources of errors and uncertainty thus it is necessary to interpret the results of different separation approaches cautiously while addressing the adaptive management of a catchment for sustainable water resources planning in the future keywords climate change land use alterations m dmc approach m scarq approach swat approach 1 introduction streamflow is the collective response of land surface characteristics climatologic variables precipitation and temperature and geologic factors of the sub surface environment that are processed in a river basin herschy 2002 it is a fundamental element of the hydrologic cycle govindaraju 2019 that is considered to be essential for quantifying catchment conveyance storage processes knapp et al 2019 and easily available source to maintain various water demands maity and kashid 2011 sahoo et al 2020 however earlier studies reported a significant variation in streamflow from different catchments around the world the decline of streamflow trend is documented in the colorado river nash and gleick 1991 south central ethiopia legesse et al 2003 yellow river basin of china wang et al 2010 northeast brazil catchments montenegro and ragab 2010 southern italy d agostino et al 2010 northern china jiang et al 2011 the loess plateau of china gao et al 2016 gomati river india abeysingha et al 2016 godavari river india kuriqi et al 2020 and goulburn river australia patil et al 2020 further evidence on increasing streamflow trends are found in some catchments of australia jones et al 2006 san joaquin watershed california ficklin et al 2009 brahmani river india islam et al 2012 north platte river wyoming acharya et al 2012 and huaihe river china zhang et al 2013 thus the streamflow variation and its impact need to be addressed for a better understanding of catchment scale water resources management the acronyms used in this study are listed in table 1 the changing of climatic conditions and human alterations are crucial for disparities of the terrestrial hydrological processes including streamflow variation as well as catchment scale water resources vörösmarty et al 2000 lahmer et al 2001 nijssen et al 2001 walling and fang 2003 oki and kanae 2006 juckem et al 2008 morán tejeda et al 2010 wada et al 2011 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2020 ali et al 2020 fluctuations in fundamental components of the hydrological cycle such as precipitation magnitude and extent of streamflow soil moisture content and evaporation are observed as a consequence of changing climate gleick 1986 dooge 1992 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2019a 2019b however the human interference is observed behind the alteration of the hydrological cycle and water availability through influencing infiltration rate evapotranspiration albedo and canopy interception bosch and hewlett 1982 sahin and hall 1996 rose and peters 2001 brown et al 2005 scanlon et al 2007 rientjes et al 2011 shao et al 2019 moreover the hydrologic influence of changing climate and human interference need precise attention for the planning of optimum water resources management of a catchment with growing concerns in water scarcity and its adverse impact on population growth wang et al 2013 thus it is necessary to have in depth knowledge of the complex response of streamflow due to combined as well as isolated effects of changing climate and human alterations several studies addressed the integrated hydrologic influence of changing climate and human activities on streamflow variations ranjan et al 2006 guo et al 2008 qi et al 2009 mango et al 2011 cuo et al 2013 wang et al 2013 mittal et al 2016 sun et al 2016 han et al 2019 however conclusions drawn from such studies with a lack of quantitative contributions of climate impact and human alteration are inadequate to direct for proper water resources planning and management therefore isolating the impacts of these factors on streamflow variations has become a crucial concern for researchers in present scenarios juckem et al 2008 ma et al 2010 wang and hejazi 2011 renner et al 2014 gao et al 2016 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 xin et al 2019 several approaches have been developed by researchers to quantify the significant contributions of human modifications and changing climate on streamflow variations the reported approaches are categorized as an experimental approach conceptual approach analytical approach and hydrological modeling approach dey and mishra 2017 the experimental approach which is a purely empirical based approach including the time trend method lee 1980 and paired catchment observations bosch and hewlett 1982 is analyzed using field hydrological data both these approaches are limited to small catchments 1 km2 with identical climate conditions li et al 2009 zhao et al 2009 xu et al 2018 meanwhile the conceptual approach with the applicability of budyko hypothesis budyko 1948 1974 and tomer schilling framework tomer and schilling 2009 is the better physically realistic method applied for separation analysis of changing climate and human interference with the water balance and energy concepts of catchment scale hydrology using long term precipitation p streamflow q pet and aet data series however the budyko hypothesis initially explained the streamflow variation under changing climate with an assumption of no human alteration which is stated as sensitivity elasticity of streamflow schaake 1990 dooge et al 1999 arora 2002 ma et al 2010 liang et al 2013 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 bai et al 2014 sinha et al 2018 further budyko parameters ω including soil properties topography and vegetation type are incorporated with the budyko hypothesis to address the climate change impact as well as catchment characteristics in streamflow variation fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 2004 ma et al 2008 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 luo et al 2020 the budyko hypothesis is modified as the decomposition method to explore the spatial and temporal variability of climate variation and catchment properties on streamflow deviations wang and hejazi 2011 sun et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 xin et al 2019 further the analytical approach including the climate elasticity method precipitation and temperature based schaake 1990 fu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 yang and yang 2011 liang et al 2013 and hydrological sensitivity method milly and dunne 2002 zuo et al 2014 guo et al 2014 is proposed to study the behaviours of streamflow under changing climate condition precipitation and temperature however the hydrological modeling approach is applied widely in several river basins with its ability to address the catchment specific research goals subjected to data availability as well as model structure complexity dey and mishra 2017 the application of several hydrological models like the dicasm montenegro and ragab 2010 gbhm ma et al 2010 mike nam petchprayoon et al 2010 mike she wang et al 2013 mike 11 chai et al 2019 simhyd model jones et al 2006 swat fan et al 2010 dong et al 2014 bu et al 2018 stream options bouwer et al 2006 vic model wang et al 2010 acharya et al 2012 chawla and mujumdar 2015 and wbm gibson et al 2006 are found satisfactory for contribution assessment of different drivers in streamflow variations however the quantitative information about the relative contributions of changing climate and human interference is contrasting for the same catchment using different methods wu et al 2017 as well as using the same method for different catchments zhai and tao 2017 thus the selection of a suitable separation method for a particular catchment is crucial and biased selecting a traditional trend analysis approach to slope change ratio method where land use change is assumed to be stationary along with a hydrological modeling approach that integrates both climate change and land use alterations as major drivers of streamflow variations may portray the reliability of a suitable approach at regional catchment therefore a comparative assessment of the above approaches of contribution analysis will be beneficial for policymakers while planning water resources management at a regional scale in light of the above literature appraisal the foremost concerns of this study are to address 1 how the hydro meteorological data vary under different time scales using distinct trend analysis methods 2 can separation of the changing climate impact and land use modifications on streamflow variation be quantified on a decadal scale and 3 what feedback can be drawn using several complementary separations approaches traditional approach to model based approach in two composite river catchments to direct these research problems the goal of the study is to isolate changing climate and land use modifications on streamflow variation using three complementary separation approaches i e traditional trend analysis approach m dmc slope change ratio approach m scraq and the hydrological modeling swat based approach in the composite brahmani and baitarani river catchment the influence of the above drivers is assessed at a decadal scale to portray the quantitative contribution statistics of these driving factors followed by errors and uncertainties resulted from the three mentioned approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the 799 km long brahmani river catchment 20 28 n 23 35 n 83 52 e 87 50 e drains to the bay of bengal of eastern india along with 360 km long the baitarani river catchment 20 30 n 22 20 n 85 05 e 87 05 e the brahmani river catchment 36 800 km2 together with the baitarani river catchment 12 094 km2 covers the major parts of jharkhand and odisha and a small portion of chhattisgarh the combined study area fig 1 is portrayed by wide ranging topography with elevation varying to 1192 m from msl the land use types of the study area are covered with agricultural land followed by water bodies fallow and wasteland forest class and built up urban land visakh et al 2019 however other human adaptations like the rengali reservoir and salandi dam are present at the upstream of jenapur and anandapur gauging stations of the brahmani and baitarani river catchments respectively thus it makes an interesting case study to explore the streamflow alteration due to climate change and or land use modifications that are expected to disturb the entire flow regime of the study area further the study area has experienced frequent flooding i e an extreme climatic event in the past years of 1980 1984 1985 1991 1994 1999 2001 2003 2006 2008 2011 2014 and 2017 rai et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 hence isolating the influence of changing climate from land use modifications on streamflow variation has become a contemporary issue in the present scenario as both the catchments fall under the zone of the subtropical monsoon climate annual report 2011 12 they receive about 80 of the annual precipitation during the monsoon months of june to september jjas sahoo et al 2020 the approximate annual precipitation of the study area is observed to be 1450 mm dahm et al 2019 further the average annual temperature ranges from 20 c to 37 c in the study area the soils in the brahmani river catchment are classified as red sandy and loamy soils red and yellow soils mixed red and black soils and coastal alluvium chaturvedi 2011 and rich red loamy to gravely detritus for the baitarani river catchment paul et al 2019 since the characteristics of both the river basins have significant variations they are modeled and analyzed separately in the present study

maps are required for the analysis of the hydrological modeling approach the dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m is obtained from the aster website https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp decadal land use data having a spatial resolution of 100 m 100 m is collected from the ornl daac the eosdis the nasa data centers handled by the esdis project roy et al 2015 das et al 2018 the details of the areal extent of land use classes are shown in fig 2 the soil map with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km obtained from the fao is used for this study however due to the absence of reservoir and dam operation data these details are not considered in this work 2 3 methodology the entire study period is parted into four sub periods with 10 years of time spell to evaluate the potential contributions of changing climate and land use modifications on decadal streamflow variation the sub periods are named as d1 1979 1988 d2 1989 1998 d3 1999 2008 and d4 2009 2018 trend analyses using the linear trend and mann kendall test are performed to identify the trends of precipitation temperature and streamflow during each decade the quantitative analysis of these factors on streamflow variation is assessed using three complementary approaches of the m dmc approach the m scraq approach and the swat based hydrological modeling approach the flow chart of the overall methodology of this study is outlined in fig 3 the details of the above methods are explained in subsequent sections 2 3 1 trend analysis the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a statistical non parametric analysis is performed in this study to identify the trends of hydro meteorological time series precipitation temperature and streamflow at an annual scale the mann kendall test statistic s of variable x time series with n observations is given by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where x i and x j sequential data values of observed time series while i j n length of observed time series data and sgn x j x i characterization sign of a function that is equal to 1 0 1 if x j is less than equal to or greater than x i respectively further the final mann kendall static value z is given as 2 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 where var s variance of s here the z values are considered as normally distributed the mann kendall test is performed at a significance level of 0 05 when the absolute z value is greater than 1 96 the determined trend is significant the magnitude of the trend σ is estimated by hirsch et al 1982 3 σ m e d i a n x j x i j 1 f o r a l l i j further to justify the mann kendall test results linear trend analysis is performed changnon and demissie 1996 beguería et al 2003 morán tejeda et al 2010 petchprayoon et al 2010 swain et al 2020 2 3 2 the m dmc approach the dmc is a simple linear regression based approach that is previously used for evaluating the trend and consistency of long term time series of hydro meteorological data mu et al 2010 gao et al 2011 this approach has been further explored for the separation analysis of changing climate and human interference on streamflow variation using the relationship between cumulative streamflow and cumulative precipitation xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in this study we have used a multiple linear regression based dmc m dmc approach considering cumulative streamflow cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature liang et al 2020 the main procedures of modified dmc are given by 4 i 1 n 1 q i obs a i 1 n 1 p i obs b i 1 n 1 t i obs c where p i obs t i obs and q i obs are the observed cumulative precipitation temperature and streamflow respectively a and b are regression coefficients and c is the intercept i is the years of the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and n is the total number of years cumulative streamflow is simulated for the assessment period using corresponding cumulative observed precipitation and temperature for further analysis the separation procedures are as follows 5 δ q ji t q j obs q i obs 6 δ q ji l q j obs q j sim 7 δ q ji c q j sim q i obs 8 θ ji c δ q ji c δ q ji t 100 9 θ ji l δ q ji l δ q ji t 100 where δ q t is the total streamflow variation δ q c and δ q l are the average streamflow variations due to the climate change and land use modifications respectively θ c and θ l are the contribution of climate change and land use modifications on streamflow variation respectively i and j is the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades 2 3 3 the m scraq approach the concepts of the scraq statistical approach were introduced to study the independent contributions of climate and human activities on streamflow variations focusing on precipitation as the only climatic factor wang et al 2012 further the modified scraq approach is well explained by two basic climate changing factors i e precipitation and temperature to isolate the potential impacts of changing climate from human activities on streamflow variation liang et al 2020 this method is based on the slope change ratios of hydro meteorological data however the assumption considered in this method is that the baseline period has a negligible impact of human activities on streamflow variation than the assessment period and climate change is the only contributing factor the detailed steps of the m scraq applied for this study are outlined as follows i the slope change ratios of cumulative streamflow δ q precipitation δ p and temperature δ t are estimated as 10 δ q ji δ q j δ q i δ q i 100 11 δ p ji δ p j δ p i δ p i 100 12 δ t ji δ t j δ t i δ t i 100 where δ q is the slopes of the linear relationship between the observed year and cumulative streamflow m3 s a δ p and δ q are the linear slopes of cumulative precipitation mm a and temperature c a respectively i and j are the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades ii the isolation of climate change impact from the land use modifications on streamflow is determined as 13 c ji p δ p ji δ q ji 100 14 c ji t δ t ji δ q ji 100 15 θ ji c c ji p c ji t 16 θ ji l 100 θ ji c where c p c t θ c and θ l are the contributions of precipitation temperature climate change and land use modifications on streamflow variations i and j are the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades 2 3 4 hydrological modeling approach to isolate the climate induced streamflow from human impact it is necessary to select a hydrological model that links both the human activities and climatic forcing on the hydrologic response of a catchment thus the physically based quasi distributed hydrological model swat is used in this study in which the digital elevation model dem soil land use and climate data are given as the inputs with the gis interface to simulate different hydrological processes arnold et al 1993 this model is widely used for the quantification of climate change impacts and human interferences in several river basins of the world ma et al 2009 li et al 2009 fan et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 dong et al 2014 bu et al 2018 in this study the catchment modeling of the study area is performed in swat2012 interface arnold et al 2012a 2012b winchell et al 2013 with an arcgis 10 3 arcview extension shi et al 2017 giri et al 2018 megersa et al 2019 gusain et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for separation analysis land use modifications are considered as the only human interference in this study which is expected to affect the water consumption pattern due to population growth high industrial demand leading to variation in streamflow and altered agricultural land as a result of urbanization since the derived land use data of the same resolution being used in the past decades 1979 1988 1989 1998 and 1999 2008 are not available for the recent decade 2009 2018 the hydrological model based separation analysis is limited up to the 3rd decade to evaluate the contributions of climatic forcing and land use modifications three model setups are formulated as the base models for different decades which are outlined in table 2 the brahmani and baitarani river catchments are discretized into 25 and 27 sub basins respectively the designed models are calibrated separately for both the catchments with the observed streamflow of representative decades the entire brahmani river catchment is calibrated at jenapur 20 53 24 n 86 0 36 e gauging station anandapur 21 13 46 n 86 7 30 e gauging station is considered as a calibration point for the baitarani river catchment the models are calibrated using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup interface on a monthly scale abbaspour 2014 sensitivity analysis of model parameters is performed by the lh oat sampling approach van griensven and meixner 2007 besides 3 years 1976 78 1986 88 and 1996 98 7 years 1979 85 1989 95 and 1999 2005 and 3 years 1986 88 1996 98 and 2006 08 of datasets are considered for knock up calibration and validation periods for all the models m1 m2 and m3 respectively the model performances are evaluated by the performance indicators the correlation coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ens and the pbias that are given as 17 r 2 i 1 n q i o q o q i m q m 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 i 1 n q i m q m 2 18 e ns 1 i 1 n q i o q i m 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2

streamflow and n is the total number of the data points based on the model performances the model simulated streamflow is extended for separation analysis further six scenario combinations fig 4 with different land use classes and climate combinations as outlined in table 2 are proposed to quantify the relative impacts of changing climate and land use modifications the procedures for the separation of climate impact and land use modifications using swat are given as follows 20 δ q ji c q l i c j q l i c i 21 δ q ji l q l j c i q l i c i δ q ji t δ q ji c δ q ji l 23 θ ji c δ q ji c δ q ji t 100 24 θ ji l δ q ji l δ q ji t 100 where δ q c and δ q l are average streamflow change due to climate change and land use modifications respectively δ q t is the total streamflow variation θ c and θ l are the relative contribution of climate and land use modifications on streamflow change respectively i and j are the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades 3 results 3 1 detection of hydro meteorological trends the statistical characteristics fig 5 of hydro meteorological variables precipitation temperature and streamflow for the entire study period 1979 2018 showed temporal heterogeneity in the study area the total annual precipitation during the study period is considerably varied from 923 05 mm to 1786 55 mm over the brahmani river catchment and from 1093 mm to 2024 mm over the baitarani river catchment the overall observed mean annual temperature in both the catchments are ranged from 25 5 c to 27 4 c throughout the study period similarly the fluctuations in the mean streamflow are observed in the range 173 89 957 13 m3 s and 41 97 300 13 m3 s in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments during the entire study period respectively the mann kendall as well as linear trend statistics of precipitation temperature and streamflow of the brahmani and baitarani river catchments for the period from 1979 to 2018 are shown in table 3 the trend analysis is performed at an annual scale at a 95 confidence level the results of both the trend analysis methods show that there is no significant trend in the precipitation data series in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments conversely the mean annual temperature of the entire study period 1979 2018 shows a decreasing trend with a significance of 0 02 while using the mann kendall test in the baitarani river catchment further a decreasing trend in the temperature data series is detected with a significance of 0 04 in the c1 1979 1988 time spell for both the catchments while using the linear trend analysis the c1 1979 1988 time spell of the average annual streamflow data series shows a decreasing trend with the mann kendall test as compared to the linear trend test ve trend with a significance value of 0 04 in the brahmani river catchment however there is no significant trend observed in the streamflow of the baitarani river catchment interestingly the slope values of the trends mann kendall linear for the brahmani river catchment are found contrasting in the precipitation data of c1 80 9 mm year 0 16 mm year and c4 37 9 mm year 4 84 mm year in the temperature data of the total period 0 05 c year 0 01 c year c2 0 04 c year 0 02 c year and c3 0 05 c year 0 01 c year and in the streamflow data of the total period 17 77 m3 s year 0 92 m3 s year and c1 17 66 m3 s year 28 59 m3 s year similarly the corresponding estimates for the baitarani river catchment with the mann kendall linear trend tests are in the total period of temperature 0 04 c year 0 01 c year and streamflow 16 54 m3 s year 0 48 m3 s year c2 time spell of precipitation 16 88 mm year 14 22 mm year and temperature 0 01 c year 0 02 c year and c3 time spell of precipitation 37 46 mm year 26 43 mm year and temperature 0 06 c year 0 01 c year the trends in the annual precipitation data series decadal as well as a total period showed positive slopes most of the time in both the catchments however a decreasing trend is observed in the temperature time series in both the catchment nevertheless the streamflow data series exhibited a positive trend except for the c3 time spell and c2 time spell in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments respectively 3 2 evaluation of the m dmc approach considering the cumulative streamflow cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature a linear correlation equation is obtained for the baseline period by multiple linear regression techniques to simulate the natural runoff in the impacted period in the m dmc method as outlined in table 4 the regression coefficients a and b and intercept c is obtained from the linear correlation equation that is used to simulate the streamflow for the impacted period the variations in streamflow are estimated as differences between the observed streamflow during the impacted period and that of the baseline period further the individual impacts of climate change and land use alteration are assessed as described in section 2 3 2 in 1989 1998 d2 the contributions of climate change impact and land use alterations are 110 61 and 10 61 for the brahmani river catchment and 233 61 and 133 61 for the baitarani river catchment however the individual influence of the contributing factors climate change and land use alterations exhibited asymptotic values for the brahmani river 1091 13 and 991 13 and baitarani river 1804 31 and 1904 31 catchments during 1999 2008 d2 further the results of 2009 2018 d3 revealed that the streamflow variation is sensitive to land use alterations 133 80 and 201 03 than the changing climate 33 80 and 101 03 in both the catchments brahmani and baitarani however the separation analysis using the m dmc approach presented contrasting results as compared to the hydrological model based approach and the m scraq approach 3 3 assessment of the m scraq approach based on the m scraq technique the impacts of changing climate and anthropogenic activities on streamflow variation in the study area are quantified during the assessment period that includes 1989 1998 d2 1999 2008 d3 and 2009 2018 d4 for this analysis the previous decade 1978 1988 is considered as a baseline period for each assessment period here land use alteration is considered as the only anthropogenic activity the impacts of the climatic factors and land use alterations on the streamflow variations with the m scraq analysis are outlined in table 5 the results of the m scraq analysis showed the contributions of changing climate including the impact of precipitation as well as temperature in this method the influence of land use change is witnessed to be comparatively higher than the impact of climate change on streamflow variations in all the assessment periods in the brahmani river catchment the land use alterations accounted for 82 70 52 22 and 79 41 whereas 89 92 71 33 and 73 10 in the baitarani river catchment in the corresponding assessment periods d2 d3 and d4 similarly the contributions of changing climate on decadal d2 d3 and d4 streamflow variation are 17 30 47 78 and 20 59 in the brahmani river catchment while 10 08 28 67 and 26 90 in the baitarani river catchment further the contributions of precipitation 13 13 36 04 and 17 08 showed a higher impact than the impact of temperature 4 17 11 74 and 3 51 on decadal d2 d3 and d4 streamflow variations in the brahmani river catchment however the relative contributions of both climatic factors precipitation and temperature are heterogonous in the baitarani river catchment the observed contributions from temperature are 5 38 9 11 and 4 21 whereas the influence of precipitation showed 4 70 19 56 and 22 69 on decadal d2 d3 and d4 streamflow variations of the baitarani river catchment 3 4 hydrological model swat calibration and performance the swat model combinations as mentioned in table 2 are calibrated by fine tuning the model parameters to achieve the best fit between the observed and simulated streamflow at jenapur brahmani and anandapur baitarani gauging stations table 6 the model parameters and their ranges are selected based on a literature assessment of the eastern india catchments paul et al 2019 visakh et al 2019 swain et al 2020 model parameters that are noticed to be effective in terms of hydrological processes streamflow generations and water balance of the study area included baseflow alpha factor alpha bf baseflow alpha factor for bank storage alpha bnk curve number cn2 effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 manning s roughness value ch n2 groundwater delay gw delay threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn groundwater revap coefficient gw revap threshold evaporation in the shallow aquifer revapmn and available water in first soil layer sol awc the models are calibrated at a monthly time scale and validated using the above best fit calibrated model parameters the model simulated and observed streamflow of respective models are shown 95 confidence interval figs 6 and 7 the agreement between the model simulated and observed streamflow is noticed to be satisfactory from the respective figures the model performances r2 ens pbias during the calibration and validation periods in the corresponding catchments table 7 are found to be within the acceptable limits with r2 0 6 ens 0 5 and pbias 25 as stated by moriasi et al 2007 hence swat can be acknowledged as a promising hydrological tool for the study area to further analyze the relative contributions of changing climate and altered land use on streamflow the stated scenario combinations fig 4 are simulated using the best fit sensitive parameter values of the respective models the resulting streamflow from different scenarios viz s1 l1c2 s2 l1c3 s3 l2c1 s4 l2c3 s5 l3c1 and s6 l3c2 of the corresponding catchments are used for hydrological model based separation analysis table 8 considering the 1st decade 1979 1988 as the baseline period the 2nd decade 1989 1998 and the 3rd decade 1999 2008 are taken as the impacted period in 1989 1998 the impact of climate change θ 21 c on streamflow variation is quantified as 43 54 brahmani river catchment and 45 54 baitarani river catchment with the remaining contribution from the land use alteration θ 21 l in the brahmani river 56 46 and baitarani river 54 46 catchments the attribution of climate change θ 31 c 85 45 and 61 92 to streamflow variation is observed to be higher than the land use change θ 31 l 14 55 and 38 08 in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments when d3 1999 2008 is compared to d1 1979 1988 further the impacted period 1999 2008 is compared with the baseline period 1989 1998 the changing climate θ 32 c and land use modifications θ 32 l accounted for 41 67 and 58 33 of the streamflow variation in the brahmani river catchment respectively however in the baitarani river catchment the climate change impact 51 37 on the streamflow variation is slightly higher than that of the land use change impact 48 63 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic response to catchment topography and climate variables the areal extents of different catchment topography land use classes are presented in fig 2 note that seven major land use classes including agricultural land deciduous forest barren land shrubland mixed forest water body and urban land are expected to influence the hydrologic processes of the brahmani and baitarani river catchment it is observed that almost 50 of the entire baitarani river catchment is covered with agricultural land the increasing trends of agricultural land use in both the catchments would lead to more irrigation water use resulting in a decreasing rate of streamflow however the streamflow is an integrated response of other climatic variables like precipitation and temperature herschy 2002 thus the identified streamflow variation trend is almost increasing for all the time spell except in the 3rd decade 1999 2008 in the brahmani river catchment and the 2nd decade 1989 1998 in the baitarani river catchment fig 5 which may be viewed as a combined effect of climate variables and catchment topography the urban land use class is noticed to cover less area in both the catchments 2 during all the time spells further it is witnessed from fig 2 that the land use classes of both the catchments are quite contrasting water spreading area in terms of a river basin dams reservoir and other water storing measures is more in the brahmani river catchment than the baitarani river catchment barren land is spotted to be higher in the brahmani river catchment which accelerates the annual and seasonal streamflow along with agricultural land welde and gebremariam 2017 the association of meteorological factors precipitation and temperature with hydrological data streamflow portrays that the trend patterns of streamflow during all the time spells are relatively similar to the precipitation patterns fig 5 however the temperature time series showed a significant trend in the 1st decade 1979 1988 for both the catchments while using the linear trend analysis table 3 the obtained trend values and their slopes from two different methods mann kendal test and linear trend test are distinct at a 95 significance level for the precipitation temperature and streamflow data series the concept of both these tests may be the reason behind diverse results the linear trend test is a slope based test that is employed to witness the fluctuations in the data series however the mann kendall test is rank based that is used for its increased ability to detect trends in the data series as compared to the slope based tests yue and pilon 2004 the overall analysis is expected to influence the relative contribution assessment of changing climate and land use alterations to streamflow variations of the study area 4 2 comparative assessment of quantitative results a comparison of the relative contribution results obtained from three different methods m dmc m scraq and swat model is shown in fig 8 the results of the empirical method m dmc and m scraq indicate that the land use alterations have a dominating impact on streamflow variations of the study area as compared to the hydrological model based swat approach the discrepancy in the results of different methods may be due to the data used in the respective methods for the separation analysis wu et al 2017 the empirical statistical methods consider only hydro meteorological precipitation temperature and streamflow data series for the contribution analysis while neglected the other aspects like potential evapotranspiration and the details of human activities however the quantitative influence of temperature and precipitation is well explained in the m scarq method liang et al 2020 then the relative contributions of land use alterations to the streamflow variations are explained theoretically by the difference of contributions of climate impact from 100 percentages eq 16 which lack the physical meaning of land use impacts on the catchment scale hydrological processes further the m dmc approach relates the concept of reconstructed streamflow for the impacted period using the multiple linear regression statistics of the baseline period for the brahmani river catchment the correlation coefficients between the observed and reconstructed streamflow of the impacted periods 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 are found out to be 0 0023 0 0002 and 0 0035 respectively similarly the observed correlation coefficients are 0 08 0 09 0 01 for the baitarani river catchment respectively this indicates that less than 10 of the observed streamflow variations can be explained by the reconstructed multiple linear equations moving forward the estimated streamflow variations due to the land use alteration eq 6 and climate change eq 7 are physically the coupled impacts of both the drivers that are theoretically assumed as the influence of the individual driver in this method comparing the empirical methods with the hydrological model based swat method the outcomes from the swat approach are more convincing as it integrates the climatic factors with the land use variations that portray the complete hydrological cycle of a catchment guse et al 2016 jung and kim 2018 the swat approach simulates the key hydrological process components surface runoff lateral flow return flow evapotranspiration water stored in the soil profile as soil moisture evapotranspiration transmission losses that are mostly climate driven arnold et al 2012a 2012b further the plant growth model of the swat interface affects transpiration and sub surface water movement of a catchment that are influenced by different types of land covers and land use alterations leng et al 2020 even the antecedent condition affects in exacerbating overall storage volumes of a catchment saksena et al 2019 which is limited in this study the past study on the composite brahmani baitarani river catchment showed that climatic factors have a major influence on streamflow variations swain et al 2020 conversely the quantitative analysis of the present study indicates that both the changing climate and land use alterations have almost equal contributions to streamflow variations in the study area initially it is assumed that climate change and land use alterations are independent during separation analysis however practically these two factors are inter related zeng et al 2015 that is the reason for parallel contributions from these two factors in the study area further the influence of anthropogenic activities on streamflow variations of the brahmani and baitarani river catchments is complex considering the other anthropogenic activities such as reservoir operation and excess water demand may explain the inherent processes of contribution analysis however these diverse anthropogenic factors are not distinguished in this study to avoid their surplus or offset responses during the hydrological modeling 4 3 uncertainties and error from each approach in this study the m dmc approach the m scarq approach and the hydrological model based swat approach are used to quantify the influence of land use alterations and climate change on streamflow variations at a decadal scale nevertheless the results of the impact analysis using these three approaches are conflicting due to the various sources of uncertainty and errors the m dmc based separation analysis extends a straight forward technique to study the individual influence of changing climate and land use alterations on streamflow variations without any detailed spatial information as an input similarly the m scarq method is a simple technique to quantify the relative impacts of the above contributing factors that use only climate precipitation and temperature and streamflow data further the m scarq approach is capable of isolating the relative contributions of precipitation and temperature on streamflow variations which is an advantage over the m dmc approach liang et al 2020 however both the methods are unable to portray the impacts of topographic variability distinctly as well as other complex anthropogenic activities thus the outcomes obtained via these approaches may be associated with a large degree of uncertainty with an improvement in linking climate data to topographic variations the hydrological model based approach is used as the most promising method that includes comprehensive hydrological processes clark et al 2015 in the case of the swat approach certain uncertainties exist in the model calibration and validation as a consequence of large input data requirements and model complexity dey and mishra 2017 at the same time the quality of hydro meteorological data is another source of uncertainty zhang et al 2012 the operation of the rengali reservoir in the brahmani river catchment affects the seasonal variations of different hydrological processes mainly streamflow generation which includes annual maximum streamflow annual minimum streamflow dry season streamflow and wet season streamflow accordingly there may be certain errors in accounting for the swat simulated streamflow due to the unavailability of reservoir operation data furthermore the empirical and statistical approaches require less input parameters precipitation temperature and streamflow for the separation analysis while the swat hydrological model has more data requirements precipitation temperature streamflow reservoir operation data land use classes and soil information and its outcome is believed to be more reliable zhang et al 2018 thus the results of the considered approaches in this study are different from each other 4 4 insights for water resources policy makers from the above analysis a significant discrepancy is observed in the potential contributions from the changing climate and land use alterations on streamflow variations using different approaches further the response of both the brahmani and baitarani river catchments to the above separation approaches is diverse in line with the outcomes of the hydrological model swat approach it is concluded that the potential contributions from climate change and land use alteration to streamflow variation in the study area are temporally heterogeneous this is expected to influence the catchment scale water resources management meanwhile the traditional methods of implemented heuristic strategy management may not reflect the changes in the hydrological regimes distinctly thus individual effects of varying climate and land use change should be deliberated comprehensively to develop a coordinated water resources management policy zhang et al 2018 further we suggest that necessary strategies should be devised to address the critical approach of climate change millar et al 2007 and adaptive management for land use modifications which can enable the catchment and reservoir structures to sustain and enhance their advantages to the stakeholders georgakakos et al 2012 5 conclusions by using i the m dmc approach ii the m scarq approach and iii a swat based hydrological modeling approach our study focussed the individual impacts of changing climatic variables and land use alterations on the fundamental hydrologic response of a catchment i e streamflow variations of the composite brahmani baitarani river catchment of eastern india over the past four decades 1979 2018 the framework of separation analysis is performed at a decadal time spell considering each subsequent decade as an impacted period and the previous decade as a baseline period however the results from these three approaches do not harmonize due to the diversity in sources of uncertainty and errors allied with the approaches based on the above assessment the key findings of our study are outlined as follows 1 the trend analysis of hydro meteorological data viz precipitation temperature and streamflow of the study area revealed that the streamflow variation patterns are complementary with the precipitation patterns 2 the swat based hydrological modeling approach explained the contributions of climate change impact and land use alterations to the streamflow variations more realistically than other approaches in the study area 3 both the drivers climate change and land use alterations showed identical contributions towards streamflow variations while the swat based approach is used in the study area however the empirical approach highlights more contributions of land use alterations to streamflow variations 4 irrespective of various errors and uncertainties each approach has individual advantages that can be applied to check its capability in other catchments as far as our knowledge the comparative assessment of climate change isolation from land use transformations to streamflow variations at decadal time spell is novel in the brahmani and baitarani river catchment though the study is performed well using single site calibrations considering multi site calibration may enhance the performance of the hydrological model swat implications of the present study to the contribution analysis of future streamflow variations can give a new insight into the judicious planning of water resources by the policymakers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4672,streamflow the key component of catchment scale hydrology is acknowledged as being induced by climate change and land use alterations the potential quantification of these hydrological drivers on streamflow variations is quite challenging this study quantitatively assesses the isolated influences of climate change and land use alterations on the streamflow variations in the brahmani 36 800 km2 and baitarani 12 094 km2 river catchments of eastern india by applying three complementary techniques involving i m dmc approach traditional trend analysis ii m scarq approach slope change ratio approach and iii swat based hydrological modeling approach the hydro meteorological precipitation temperature and streamflow data variation and its significance are studied at a decadal time spell followed by the mann kendall test and the linear regression technique the relative contributions of changing climate θ ji c and land use alterations θ ji l are quantified at a decadal time spell considering the initial time spells as baseline periods 1979 1988 1989 1998 and 1999 2008 and the subsequent time spells as impacted periods 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 outcomes of our comparative assessment of the study area indicate that the empirical approaches m dmc and m scarq result in land use alterations as a dominant contributing factor in streamflow variations however the performance of the swat based hydrological approach specifies identical contributions from both the climate and land use changes the diversity in results from these three approaches is associated with different sources of errors and uncertainty thus it is necessary to interpret the results of different separation approaches cautiously while addressing the adaptive management of a catchment for sustainable water resources planning in the future keywords climate change land use alterations m dmc approach m scarq approach swat approach 1 introduction streamflow is the collective response of land surface characteristics climatologic variables precipitation and temperature and geologic factors of the sub surface environment that are processed in a river basin herschy 2002 it is a fundamental element of the hydrologic cycle govindaraju 2019 that is considered to be essential for quantifying catchment conveyance storage processes knapp et al 2019 and easily available source to maintain various water demands maity and kashid 2011 sahoo et al 2020 however earlier studies reported a significant variation in streamflow from different catchments around the world the decline of streamflow trend is documented in the colorado river nash and gleick 1991 south central ethiopia legesse et al 2003 yellow river basin of china wang et al 2010 northeast brazil catchments montenegro and ragab 2010 southern italy d agostino et al 2010 northern china jiang et al 2011 the loess plateau of china gao et al 2016 gomati river india abeysingha et al 2016 godavari river india kuriqi et al 2020 and goulburn river australia patil et al 2020 further evidence on increasing streamflow trends are found in some catchments of australia jones et al 2006 san joaquin watershed california ficklin et al 2009 brahmani river india islam et al 2012 north platte river wyoming acharya et al 2012 and huaihe river china zhang et al 2013 thus the streamflow variation and its impact need to be addressed for a better understanding of catchment scale water resources management the acronyms used in this study are listed in table 1 the changing of climatic conditions and human alterations are crucial for disparities of the terrestrial hydrological processes including streamflow variation as well as catchment scale water resources vörösmarty et al 2000 lahmer et al 2001 nijssen et al 2001 walling and fang 2003 oki and kanae 2006 juckem et al 2008 morán tejeda et al 2010 wada et al 2011 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2020 ali et al 2020 fluctuations in fundamental components of the hydrological cycle such as precipitation magnitude and extent of streamflow soil moisture content and evaporation are observed as a consequence of changing climate gleick 1986 dooge 1992 wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2019a 2019b however the human interference is observed behind the alteration of the hydrological cycle and water availability through influencing infiltration rate evapotranspiration albedo and canopy interception bosch and hewlett 1982 sahin and hall 1996 rose and peters 2001 brown et al 2005 scanlon et al 2007 rientjes et al 2011 shao et al 2019 moreover the hydrologic influence of changing climate and human interference need precise attention for the planning of optimum water resources management of a catchment with growing concerns in water scarcity and its adverse impact on population growth wang et al 2013 thus it is necessary to have in depth knowledge of the complex response of streamflow due to combined as well as isolated effects of changing climate and human alterations several studies addressed the integrated hydrologic influence of changing climate and human activities on streamflow variations ranjan et al 2006 guo et al 2008 qi et al 2009 mango et al 2011 cuo et al 2013 wang et al 2013 mittal et al 2016 sun et al 2016 han et al 2019 however conclusions drawn from such studies with a lack of quantitative contributions of climate impact and human alteration are inadequate to direct for proper water resources planning and management therefore isolating the impacts of these factors on streamflow variations has become a crucial concern for researchers in present scenarios juckem et al 2008 ma et al 2010 wang and hejazi 2011 renner et al 2014 gao et al 2016 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 xin et al 2019 several approaches have been developed by researchers to quantify the significant contributions of human modifications and changing climate on streamflow variations the reported approaches are categorized as an experimental approach conceptual approach analytical approach and hydrological modeling approach dey and mishra 2017 the experimental approach which is a purely empirical based approach including the time trend method lee 1980 and paired catchment observations bosch and hewlett 1982 is analyzed using field hydrological data both these approaches are limited to small catchments 1 km2 with identical climate conditions li et al 2009 zhao et al 2009 xu et al 2018 meanwhile the conceptual approach with the applicability of budyko hypothesis budyko 1948 1974 and tomer schilling framework tomer and schilling 2009 is the better physically realistic method applied for separation analysis of changing climate and human interference with the water balance and energy concepts of catchment scale hydrology using long term precipitation p streamflow q pet and aet data series however the budyko hypothesis initially explained the streamflow variation under changing climate with an assumption of no human alteration which is stated as sensitivity elasticity of streamflow schaake 1990 dooge et al 1999 arora 2002 ma et al 2010 liang et al 2013 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 bai et al 2014 sinha et al 2018 further budyko parameters ω including soil properties topography and vegetation type are incorporated with the budyko hypothesis to address the climate change impact as well as catchment characteristics in streamflow variation fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 2004 ma et al 2008 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 luo et al 2020 the budyko hypothesis is modified as the decomposition method to explore the spatial and temporal variability of climate variation and catchment properties on streamflow deviations wang and hejazi 2011 sun et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 xin et al 2019 further the analytical approach including the climate elasticity method precipitation and temperature based schaake 1990 fu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 yang and yang 2011 liang et al 2013 and hydrological sensitivity method milly and dunne 2002 zuo et al 2014 guo et al 2014 is proposed to study the behaviours of streamflow under changing climate condition precipitation and temperature however the hydrological modeling approach is applied widely in several river basins with its ability to address the catchment specific research goals subjected to data availability as well as model structure complexity dey and mishra 2017 the application of several hydrological models like the dicasm montenegro and ragab 2010 gbhm ma et al 2010 mike nam petchprayoon et al 2010 mike she wang et al 2013 mike 11 chai et al 2019 simhyd model jones et al 2006 swat fan et al 2010 dong et al 2014 bu et al 2018 stream options bouwer et al 2006 vic model wang et al 2010 acharya et al 2012 chawla and mujumdar 2015 and wbm gibson et al 2006 are found satisfactory for contribution assessment of different drivers in streamflow variations however the quantitative information about the relative contributions of changing climate and human interference is contrasting for the same catchment using different methods wu et al 2017 as well as using the same method for different catchments zhai and tao 2017 thus the selection of a suitable separation method for a particular catchment is crucial and biased selecting a traditional trend analysis approach to slope change ratio method where land use change is assumed to be stationary along with a hydrological modeling approach that integrates both climate change and land use alterations as major drivers of streamflow variations may portray the reliability of a suitable approach at regional catchment therefore a comparative assessment of the above approaches of contribution analysis will be beneficial for policymakers while planning water resources management at a regional scale in light of the above literature appraisal the foremost concerns of this study are to address 1 how the hydro meteorological data vary under different time scales using distinct trend analysis methods 2 can separation of the changing climate impact and land use modifications on streamflow variation be quantified on a decadal scale and 3 what feedback can be drawn using several complementary separations approaches traditional approach to model based approach in two composite river catchments to direct these research problems the goal of the study is to isolate changing climate and land use modifications on streamflow variation using three complementary separation approaches i e traditional trend analysis approach m dmc slope change ratio approach m scraq and the hydrological modeling swat based approach in the composite brahmani and baitarani river catchment the influence of the above drivers is assessed at a decadal scale to portray the quantitative contribution statistics of these driving factors followed by errors and uncertainties resulted from the three mentioned approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the 799 km long brahmani river catchment 20 28 n 23 35 n 83 52 e 87 50 e drains to the bay of bengal of eastern india along with 360 km long the baitarani river catchment 20 30 n 22 20 n 85 05 e 87 05 e the brahmani river catchment 36 800 km2 together with the baitarani river catchment 12 094 km2 covers the major parts of jharkhand and odisha and a small portion of chhattisgarh the combined study area fig 1 is portrayed by wide ranging topography with elevation varying to 1192 m from msl the land use types of the study area are covered with agricultural land followed by water bodies fallow and wasteland forest class and built up urban land visakh et al 2019 however other human adaptations like the rengali reservoir and salandi dam are present at the upstream of jenapur and anandapur gauging stations of the brahmani and baitarani river catchments respectively thus it makes an interesting case study to explore the streamflow alteration due to climate change and or land use modifications that are expected to disturb the entire flow regime of the study area further the study area has experienced frequent flooding i e an extreme climatic event in the past years of 1980 1984 1985 1991 1994 1999 2001 2003 2006 2008 2011 2014 and 2017 rai et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 hence isolating the influence of changing climate from land use modifications on streamflow variation has become a contemporary issue in the present scenario as both the catchments fall under the zone of the subtropical monsoon climate annual report 2011 12 they receive about 80 of the annual precipitation during the monsoon months of june to september jjas sahoo et al 2020 the approximate annual precipitation of the study area is observed to be 1450 mm dahm et al 2019 further the average annual temperature ranges from 20 c to 37 c in the study area the soils in the brahmani river catchment are classified as red sandy and loamy soils red and yellow soils mixed red and black soils and coastal alluvium chaturvedi 2011 and rich red loamy to gravely detritus for the baitarani river catchment paul et al 2019 since the characteristics of both the river basins have significant variations they are modeled and analyzed separately in the present study 2 2 input data sources and pre processing the meteorological data precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature are procured from the imd pune rajeevan et al 2006 the obtained 0 25 imd precipitation data pai et al 2014 has been successfully applied in different studies like drought characterization sharma and mujumdar 2017 bisht et al 2019 dash et al 2019 flood analysis jena et al

2016 bhadoriya et al 2020 marak et al 2020 dash et al 2020a 2020b to maintain the spatial resolution uniformity in this study the obtained temperature data of 1 grid information is resampled to 0 25 by applying the bilinear interpolation approach bisht et al 2019 peng et al 2019 the pre and post processing of meteorological data are performed using matlab 2014b software the observed daily streamflow 1979 2018 is attained from the cwc bhubaneswar for anandapur baitarani river catchment and jenapur brahmani river catchment gauging stations besides the above data dem land use and soil maps are required for the analysis of the hydrological modeling approach the dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m is obtained from the aster website https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp decadal land use data having a spatial resolution of 100 m 100 m is collected from the ornl daac the eosdis the nasa data centers handled by the esdis project roy et al 2015 das et al 2018 the details of the areal extent of land use classes are shown in fig 2 the soil map with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km obtained from the fao is used for this study however due to the absence of reservoir and dam operation data these details are not considered in this work 2 3 methodology the entire study period is parted into four sub periods with 10 years of time spell to evaluate the potential contributions of changing climate and land use modifications on decadal streamflow variation the sub periods are named as d1 1979 1988 d2 1989 1998 d3 1999 2008 and d4 2009 2018 trend analyses using the linear trend and mann kendall test are performed to identify the trends of precipitation temperature and streamflow during each decade the quantitative analysis of these factors on streamflow variation is assessed using three complementary approaches of the m dmc approach the m scraq approach and the swat based hydrological modeling approach the flow chart of the overall methodology of this study is outlined in fig 3 the details of the above methods are explained in subsequent sections 2 3 1 trend analysis the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a statistical non parametric analysis is performed in this study to identify the trends of hydro meteorological time series precipitation temperature and streamflow at an annual scale the mann kendall test statistic s of variable x time series with n observations is given by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where x i and x j sequential data values of observed time series while i j n length of observed time series data and sgn x j x i characterization sign of a function that is equal to 1 0 1 if x j is less than equal to or greater than x i respectively further the final mann kendall static value z is given as 2 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 where var s variance of s here the z values are considered as normally distributed the mann kendall test is performed at a significance level of 0 05 when the absolute z value is greater than 1 96 the determined trend is significant the magnitude of the trend σ is estimated by hirsch et al 1982 3 σ m e d i a n x j x i j 1 f o r a l l i j further to justify the mann kendall test results linear trend analysis is performed changnon and demissie 1996 beguería et al 2003 morán tejeda et al 2010 petchprayoon et al 2010 swain et al 2020 2 3 2 the m dmc approach the dmc is a simple linear regression based approach that is previously used for evaluating the trend and consistency of long term time series of hydro meteorological data mu et al 2010 gao et al 2011 this approach has been further explored for the separation analysis of changing climate and human interference on streamflow variation using the relationship between cumulative streamflow and cumulative precipitation xue et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in this study we have used a multiple linear regression based dmc m dmc approach considering cumulative streamflow cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature liang et al 2020 the main procedures of modified dmc are given by 4 i 1 n 1 q i obs a i 1 n 1 p i obs b i 1 n 1 t i obs c where p i obs t i obs and q i obs are the observed cumulative precipitation temperature and streamflow respectively a and b are regression coefficients and c is the intercept i is the years of the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and n is the total number of years cumulative streamflow is simulated for the assessment period using corresponding cumulative observed precipitation and temperature for further analysis the separation procedures are as follows 5 δ q ji t q j obs q i obs 6 δ q ji l q j obs q j sim 7 δ q ji c q j sim q i obs 8 θ ji c δ q ji c δ q ji t 100 9 θ ji l δ q ji l δ q ji t 100 where δ q t is the total streamflow variation δ q c and δ q l are the average streamflow variations due to the climate change and land use modifications respectively θ c and θ l are the contribution of climate change and land use modifications on streamflow variation respectively i and j is the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades 2 3 3 the m scraq approach the concepts of the scraq statistical approach were introduced to study the independent contributions of climate and human activities on streamflow variations focusing on precipitation as the only climatic factor wang et al 2012 further the modified scraq approach is well explained by two basic climate changing factors i e precipitation and temperature to isolate the potential impacts of changing climate from human activities on streamflow variation liang et al 2020 this method is based on the slope change ratios of hydro meteorological data however the assumption considered in this method is that the baseline period has a negligible impact of human activities on streamflow variation than the assessment period and climate change is the only contributing factor the detailed steps of the m scraq applied for this study are outlined as follows i the slope change ratios of cumulative streamflow δ q precipitation δ p and temperature δ t are estimated as 10 δ q ji δ q j δ q i δ q i 100 11 δ p ji δ p j δ p i δ p i 100 12 δ t ji δ t j δ t i δ t i 100 where δ q is the slopes of the linear relationship between the observed year and cumulative streamflow m3 s a δ p and δ q are the linear slopes of cumulative precipitation mm a and temperature c a respectively i and j are the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades ii the isolation of climate change impact from the land use modifications on streamflow is determined as 13 c ji p δ p ji δ q ji 100 14 c ji t δ t ji δ q ji 100 15 θ ji c c ji p c ji t 16 θ ji l 100 θ ji c where c p c t θ c and θ l are the contributions of precipitation temperature climate change and land use modifications on streamflow variations i and j are the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades 2 3 4 hydrological modeling approach to isolate the climate induced streamflow from human impact it is necessary to select a hydrological model that links both the human activities and climatic forcing on the hydrologic response of a catchment thus the physically based quasi distributed hydrological model swat is used in this study in which the digital elevation model dem soil land use and climate data are given as the inputs with the gis interface to simulate different hydrological processes arnold et al 1993 this model is widely used for the quantification of climate change impacts and human interferences in several river basins of the world ma et al 2009 li et al 2009 fan et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 dong et al 2014 bu et al 2018 in this study the catchment modeling of the study area is performed in swat2012 interface arnold et al 2012a 2012b winchell et al 2013 with an arcgis 10 3 arcview extension shi et al 2017 giri et al 2018 megersa et al 2019 gusain et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for separation analysis land use modifications are considered as the only human interference in this study which is expected to affect the water consumption pattern due to population growth high industrial demand leading to variation in streamflow and altered agricultural land as a result of urbanization since the derived land use data of the same resolution being used in the past decades 1979 1988 1989 1998 and 1999 2008 are not available for the recent decade 2009 2018 the hydrological model based separation analysis is limited up to the 3rd decade to evaluate the contributions of climatic forcing and land use modifications three model setups are formulated as the base models for different decades which are outlined in table 2 the brahmani and baitarani river catchments are discretized into 25 and 27 sub basins respectively the designed models are calibrated separately for both the catchments with the observed streamflow of representative decades the entire brahmani river catchment is calibrated at jenapur 20 53 24 n 86 0 36 e gauging station anandapur 21 13 46 n 86 7 30 e gauging station is considered as a calibration point for the baitarani river catchment the models are calibrated using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup interface on a monthly scale abbaspour 2014 sensitivity analysis of model parameters is performed by the lh oat sampling approach van griensven and meixner 2007 besides 3 years 1976 78 1986 88 and 1996 98 7 years 1979 85 1989 95 and 1999 2005 and 3 years 1986 88 1996 98 and 2006 08 of datasets are considered for knock up calibration and validation periods for all the models m1 m2 and m3 respectively the model performances are evaluated by the performance indicators the correlation coefficient r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ens and the pbias that are given as 17 r 2 i 1 n q i o q o q i m q m 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 i 1 n q i m q m 2 18 e ns 1 i 1 n q i o q i m 2 i 1 n q i o q o 2 19 pbias i 1 n q i m q i o 100 i 1 n q i o where q o is the mean observed streamflow q i o is the i th observed streamflow q i m is the i th model simulated streamflow q m is the mean model simulated streamflow and n is the total number of the data points based on the model performances the model simulated streamflow is extended for separation analysis further six scenario combinations fig 4 with different land use classes and climate combinations as outlined in table 2 are proposed to quantify the relative impacts of changing climate and land use modifications the procedures for the separation of climate impact and land use modifications using swat are given as follows 20 δ q ji c q l i c j q l i c i 21 δ q ji l q l j c i q l i c i δ q ji t δ q ji c δ q ji l 23 θ ji c δ q ji c δ q ji t 100 24 θ ji l δ q ji l δ q ji t 100 where δ q c and δ q l are average streamflow change due to climate change and land use modifications respectively δ q t is the total streamflow variation θ c and θ l are the relative contribution of climate and land use modifications on streamflow change respectively i and j are the baseline period 1 2 3 n 1 and assessment period 2 to n respectively and n is the total number of decades 3 results 3 1 detection of hydro meteorological trends the statistical characteristics fig 5 of hydro meteorological variables precipitation temperature and streamflow for the entire study period 1979 2018 showed temporal heterogeneity in the study area the total annual precipitation during the study period is considerably varied from 923 05 mm to 1786 55 mm over the brahmani river catchment and from 1093 mm to 2024 mm over the baitarani river catchment the overall observed mean annual temperature in both the catchments are ranged from 25 5 c to 27 4 c throughout the study period similarly the fluctuations in the mean streamflow are observed in the range 173 89 957 13 m3 s and 41 97 300 13 m3 s in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments during the entire study period respectively the mann kendall as well as linear trend statistics of precipitation temperature and streamflow of the brahmani and baitarani river catchments for the period from 1979 to 2018 are shown in table 3 the trend analysis is performed at an annual scale at a 95 confidence level the results of both the trend analysis methods show that there is no significant trend in the precipitation data series in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments conversely the mean annual temperature of the entire study period 1979 2018 shows a decreasing trend with a significance of 0 02 while using the mann kendall test in the baitarani river catchment further a decreasing trend in the temperature data series is detected with a significance of 0 04 in the c1 1979 1988 time spell for both the catchments while using the linear trend analysis the c1 1979 1988 time spell of the average annual streamflow data series shows a decreasing trend with the mann kendall test as compared to the linear trend test ve trend with a significance value of 0 04 in the brahmani river catchment however there is no significant trend observed in the streamflow of the baitarani river catchment interestingly the slope values of the trends mann kendall linear for the brahmani river catchment are found contrasting in the precipitation data of c1 80 9 mm year 0 16 mm year and c4 37 9 mm year 4 84 mm year in the temperature data of the total period 0 05 c year 0 01 c year c2 0 04 c year 0 02 c year and c3 0 05 c year 0 01 c year and in the streamflow data of the total period 17 77 m3 s year 0 92 m3 s year and c1 17 66 m3 s year 28 59 m3 s year similarly the corresponding estimates for the baitarani river catchment with the mann kendall linear trend tests are in the total period of temperature 0 04 c year 0 01 c year and streamflow 16 54 m3 s year 0 48 m3 s year c2 time spell of precipitation 16 88 mm year 14 22 mm year and temperature 0 01 c year 0 02 c year and c3 time spell of precipitation 37 46 mm year 26 43 mm year and temperature 0 06 c year 0 01 c year the trends in the annual precipitation data series decadal as well as a total period showed positive slopes most of the time in both the catchments however a decreasing trend is observed in the temperature time series in both the catchment nevertheless the streamflow data series exhibited a positive trend except for the c3 time spell and c2 time spell in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments respectively 3 2 evaluation of the m dmc approach considering the cumulative streamflow cumulative precipitation and cumulative temperature a linear correlation equation is obtained for the baseline period by multiple linear regression techniques to simulate the natural runoff in the impacted period in the m dmc method as outlined in table 4 the regression coefficients a and b and intercept c is obtained from the linear correlation equation that is used to simulate the streamflow for the impacted period the variations in streamflow are estimated as differences between the observed streamflow during the impacted period and that of the baseline period further the individual impacts of climate change and land use alteration are assessed as described in section 2 3 2 in 1989 1998 d2 the contributions of climate change impact and land use alterations are 110 61 and 10 61 for the brahmani river catchment and 233 61 and 133 61 for the baitarani river catchment however the individual influence of the contributing factors climate change and land use alterations exhibited asymptotic values for the brahmani river 1091 13 and 991 13 and baitarani river 1804 31 and 1904 31 catchments during 1999 2008 d2 further the results of 2009 2018 d3 revealed that the streamflow variation is sensitive to land use alterations 133 80 and 201 03 than the changing climate 33 80 and 101 03 in both the catchments brahmani and baitarani however the separation analysis using the m dmc approach presented contrasting results as compared to the hydrological model based approach and the m scraq approach 3 3 assessment of the m scraq approach based on the m scraq technique the impacts of changing climate and anthropogenic activities on streamflow variation in the study area are quantified during the assessment period that includes 1989 1998 d2 1999 2008 d3 and 2009 2018 d4 for this analysis the previous decade 1978 1988 is considered as a baseline period for each assessment period here land use alteration is considered as the only anthropogenic activity the impacts of the climatic factors and land use alterations on the streamflow variations with the m scraq analysis are outlined in table 5 the results of the m scraq analysis showed the contributions of changing climate including the impact of precipitation as well as temperature in this method the influence of land use change is witnessed to be comparatively higher than the impact of climate change on streamflow variations in all the assessment periods in the brahmani river catchment the land use alterations accounted for 82 70 52 22 and 79 41 whereas 89 92 71 33 and 73 10 in the baitarani river catchment in the corresponding assessment periods d2 d3 and d4 similarly the contributions of changing climate on decadal d2 d3 and d4 streamflow variation are 17 30 47 78 and 20 59 in the brahmani river catchment while 10 08 28 67 and 26 90 in the baitarani river catchment further the contributions of precipitation 13 13 36 04 and 17 08 showed a higher impact than the impact of temperature 4 17 11 74 and 3 51 on decadal d2 d3 and d4 streamflow variations in the brahmani river catchment however the relative contributions of both climatic factors precipitation and temperature are heterogonous in the baitarani river catchment the observed contributions from temperature are 5 38 9 11 and 4 21 whereas the influence of precipitation showed 4 70 19 56 and 22 69 on decadal d2 d3 and d4 streamflow variations of the baitarani river catchment 3 4 hydrological model swat calibration and performance the swat model combinations as mentioned in table 2 are calibrated by fine tuning the model parameters to achieve the best fit between the observed and simulated streamflow at jenapur brahmani and anandapur baitarani gauging stations table 6 the model parameters and their ranges are selected based on a literature assessment of the eastern india catchments paul et al 2019 visakh et al 2019 swain et al 2020 model parameters that are noticed to be effective in terms of hydrological processes streamflow generations and water

model simulated and observed streamflow of respective models are shown 95 confidence interval figs 6 and 7 the agreement between the model simulated and observed streamflow is noticed to be satisfactory from the respective figures the model performances r2 ens pbias during the calibration and validation periods in the corresponding catchments table 7 are found to be within the acceptable limits with r2 0 6 ens 0 5 and pbias 25 as stated by moriasi et al 2007 hence swat can be acknowledged as a promising hydrological tool for the study area to further analyze the relative contributions of changing climate and altered land use on streamflow the stated scenario combinations fig 4 are simulated using the best fit sensitive parameter values of the respective models the resulting streamflow from different scenarios viz s1 l1c2 s2 l1c3 s3 l2c1 s4 l2c3 s5 l3c1 and s6 l3c2 of the corresponding catchments are used for hydrological model based separation analysis table 8 considering the 1st decade 1979 1988 as the baseline period the 2nd decade 1989 1998 and the 3rd decade 1999 2008 are taken as the impacted period in 1989 1998 the impact of climate change θ 21 c on streamflow variation is quantified as 43 54 brahmani river catchment and 45 54 baitarani river catchment with the remaining contribution from the land use alteration θ 21 l in the brahmani river 56 46 and baitarani river 54 46 catchments the attribution of climate change θ 31 c 85 45 and 61 92 to streamflow variation is observed to be higher than the land use change θ 31 l 14 55 and 38 08 in the brahmani and baitarani river catchments when d3 1999 2008 is compared to d1 1979 1988 further the impacted period 1999 2008 is compared with the baseline period 1989 1998 the changing climate θ 32 c and land use modifications θ 32 l accounted for 41 67 and 58 33 of the streamflow variation in the brahmani river catchment respectively however in the baitarani river catchment the climate change impact 51 37 on the streamflow variation is slightly higher than that of the land use change impact 48 63 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic response to catchment topography and climate variables the areal extents of different catchment topography land use classes are presented in fig 2 note that seven major land use classes including agricultural land deciduous forest barren land shrubland mixed forest water body and urban land are expected to influence the hydrologic processes of the brahmani and baitarani river catchment it is observed that almost 50 of the entire baitarani river catchment is covered with agricultural land the increasing trends of agricultural land use in both the catchments would lead to more irrigation water use resulting in a decreasing rate of streamflow however the streamflow is an integrated response of other climatic variables like precipitation and temperature herschy 2002 thus the identified streamflow variation trend is almost increasing for all the time spell except in the 3rd decade 1999 2008 in the brahmani river catchment and the 2nd decade 1989 1998 in the baitarani river catchment fig 5 which may be viewed as a combined effect of climate variables and catchment topography the urban land use class is noticed to cover less area in both the catchments 2 during all the time spells further it is witnessed from fig 2 that the land use classes of both the catchments are quite contrasting water spreading area in terms of a river basin dams reservoir and other water storing measures is more in the brahmani river catchment than the baitarani river catchment barren land is spotted to be higher in the brahmani river catchment which accelerates the annual and seasonal streamflow along with agricultural land welde and gebremariam 2017 the association of meteorological factors precipitation and temperature with hydrological data streamflow portrays that the trend patterns of streamflow during all the time spells are relatively similar to the precipitation patterns fig 5 however the temperature time series showed a significant trend in the 1st decade 1979 1988 for both the catchments while using the linear trend analysis table 3 the obtained trend values and their slopes from two different methods mann kendal test and linear trend test are distinct at a 95 significance level for the precipitation temperature and streamflow data series the concept of both these tests may be the reason behind diverse results the linear trend test is a slope based test that is employed to witness the fluctuations in the data series however the mann kendall test is rank based that is used for its increased ability to detect trends in the data series as compared to the slope based tests yue and pilon 2004 the overall analysis is expected to influence the relative contribution assessment of changing climate and land use alterations to streamflow variations of the study area 4 2 comparative assessment of quantitative results a comparison of the relative contribution results obtained from three different methods m dmc m scraq and swat model is shown in fig 8 the results of the empirical method m dmc and m scraq indicate that the land use alterations have a dominating impact on streamflow variations of the study area as compared to the hydrological model based swat approach the discrepancy in the results of different methods may be due to the data used in the respective methods for the separation analysis wu et al 2017 the empirical statistical methods consider only hydro meteorological precipitation temperature and streamflow data series for the contribution analysis while neglected the other aspects like potential evapotranspiration and the details of human activities however the quantitative influence of temperature and precipitation is well explained in the m scarq method liang et al 2020 then the relative contributions of land use alterations to the streamflow variations are explained theoretically by the difference of contributions of climate impact from 100 percentages eq 16 which lack the physical meaning of land use impacts on the catchment scale hydrological processes further the m dmc approach relates the concept of reconstructed streamflow for the impacted period using the multiple linear regression statistics of the baseline period for the brahmani river catchment the correlation coefficients between the observed and reconstructed streamflow of the impacted periods 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 are found out to be 0 0023 0 0002 and 0 0035 respectively similarly the observed correlation coefficients are 0 08 0 09 0 01 for the baitarani river catchment respectively this indicates that less than 10 of the observed streamflow variations can be explained by the reconstructed multiple linear equations moving forward the estimated streamflow variations due to the land use alteration eq 6 and climate change eq 7 are physically the coupled impacts of both the drivers that are theoretically assumed as the influence of the individual driver in this method comparing the empirical methods with the hydrological model based swat method the outcomes from the swat approach are more convincing as it integrates the climatic factors with the land use variations that portray the complete hydrological cycle of a catchment guse et al 2016 jung and kim 2018 the swat approach simulates the key hydrological process components surface runoff lateral flow return flow evapotranspiration water stored in the soil profile as soil moisture evapotranspiration transmission losses that are mostly climate driven arnold et al 2012a 2012b further the plant growth model of the swat interface affects transpiration and sub surface water movement of a catchment that are influenced by different types of land covers and land use alterations leng et al 2020 even the antecedent condition affects in exacerbating overall storage volumes of a catchment saksena et al 2019 which is limited in this study the past study on the composite brahmani baitarani river catchment showed that climatic factors have a major influence on streamflow variations swain et al 2020 conversely the quantitative analysis of the present study indicates that both the changing climate and land use alterations have almost equal contributions to streamflow variations in the study area initially it is assumed that climate change and land use alterations are independent during separation analysis however practically these two factors are inter related zeng et al 2015 that is the reason for parallel contributions from these two factors in the study area further the influence of anthropogenic activities on streamflow variations of the brahmani and baitarani river catchments is complex considering the other anthropogenic activities such as reservoir operation and excess water demand may explain the inherent processes of contribution analysis however these diverse anthropogenic factors are not distinguished in this study to avoid their surplus or offset responses during the hydrological modeling 4 3 uncertainties and error from each approach in this study the m dmc approach the m scarq approach and the hydrological model based swat approach are used to quantify the influence of land use alterations and climate change on streamflow variations at a decadal scale nevertheless the results of the impact analysis using these three approaches are conflicting due to the various sources of uncertainty and errors the m dmc based separation analysis extends a straight forward technique to study the individual influence of changing climate and land use alterations on streamflow variations without any detailed spatial information as an input similarly the m scarq method is a simple technique to quantify the relative impacts of the above contributing factors that use only climate precipitation and temperature and streamflow data further the m scarq approach is capable of isolating the relative contributions of precipitation and temperature on streamflow variations which is an advantage over the m dmc approach liang et al 2020 however both the methods are unable to portray the impacts of topographic variability distinctly as well as other complex anthropogenic activities thus the outcomes obtained via these approaches may be associated with a large degree of uncertainty with an improvement in linking climate data to topographic variations the hydrological model based approach is used as the most promising method that includes comprehensive hydrological processes clark et al 2015 in the case of the swat approach certain uncertainties exist in the model calibration and validation as a consequence of large input data requirements and model complexity dey and mishra 2017 at the same time the quality of hydro meteorological data is another source of uncertainty zhang et al 2012 the operation of the rengali reservoir in the brahmani river catchment affects the seasonal variations of different hydrological processes mainly streamflow generation which includes annual maximum streamflow annual minimum streamflow dry season streamflow and wet season streamflow accordingly there may be certain errors in accounting for the swat simulated streamflow due to the unavailability of reservoir operation data furthermore the empirical and statistical approaches require less input parameters precipitation temperature and streamflow for the separation analysis while the swat hydrological model has more data requirements precipitation temperature streamflow reservoir operation data land use classes and soil information and its outcome is believed to be more reliable zhang et al 2018 thus the results of the considered approaches in this study are different from each other 4 4 insights for water resources policy makers from the above analysis a significant discrepancy is observed in the potential contributions from the changing climate and land use alterations on streamflow variations using different approaches further the response of both the brahmani and baitarani river catchments to the above separation approaches is diverse in line with the outcomes of the hydrological model swat approach it is concluded that the potential contributions from climate change and land use alteration to streamflow variation in the study area are temporally heterogeneous this is expected to influence the catchment scale water resources management meanwhile the traditional methods of implemented heuristic strategy management may not reflect the changes in the hydrological regimes distinctly thus individual effects of varying climate and land use change should be deliberated comprehensively to develop a coordinated water resources management policy zhang et al 2018 further we suggest that necessary strategies should be devised to address the critical approach of climate change millar et al 2007 and adaptive management for land use modifications which can enable the catchment and reservoir structures to sustain and enhance their advantages to the stakeholders georgakakos et al 2012 5 conclusions by using i the m dmc approach ii the m scarq approach and iii a swat based hydrological modeling approach our study focussed the individual impacts of changing climatic variables and land use alterations on the fundamental hydrologic response of a catchment i e streamflow variations of the composite brahmani baitarani river catchment of eastern india over the past four decades 1979 2018 the framework of separation analysis is performed at a decadal time spell considering each subsequent decade as an impacted period and the previous decade as a baseline period however the results from these three approaches do not harmonize due to the diversity in sources of uncertainty and errors allied with the approaches based on the above assessment the key findings of our study are outlined as follows 1 the trend analysis of hydro meteorological data viz precipitation temperature and streamflow of the study area revealed that the streamflow variation patterns are complementary with the precipitation patterns 2 the swat based hydrological modeling approach explained the contributions of climate change impact and land use alterations to the streamflow variations more realistically than other approaches in the study area 3 both the drivers climate change and land use alterations showed identical contributions towards streamflow variations while the swat based approach is used in the study area however the empirical approach highlights more contributions of land use alterations to streamflow variations 4 irrespective of various errors and uncertainties each approach has individual advantages that can be applied to check its capability in other catchments as far as our knowledge the comparative assessment of climate change isolation from land use transformations to streamflow variations at decadal time spell is novel in the brahmani and baitarani river catchment though the study is performed well using single site calibrations considering multi site calibration may enhance the performance of the hydrological model swat implications of the present study to the contribution analysis of future streamflow

4673,cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is one of the few techniques that can directly acquire information about the temporal dynamics of soil water content swc at a hectometer scale the performance of crns depends on the climate soil and conditions of the underlying surface the region of red soil in china is characterized by heterogeneous land uses combination of upland and paddy fields distinct dry wet periods and low contents of soil organic carbon the applicability of crns has not yet been evaluated under the subtropical hydroclimatic conditions of this region we therefore compared spatially averaged swc measured using crns with point scale data measured using time domain reflectometry tdr at five locations and oven dried soil samples collected at 27 locations across the crns footprint in an agricultural ecosystem of the red soil region between march 2019 and february 2020 the footprint of crns varied with time the horizontal radius of crns varied between 175 m in july and 215 m in october with a mean of 194 m and the measuring depth varied between 16 cm in march and 23 cm in august with a mean of 19 cm the relative contribution of rainfed cropland citrus land and paddy fields were 86 7 10 7 and 2 6 respectively the differences of the relative contribution among land uses were determined by the distance to the sensor and the area which were less affected by the types of land use the neutron count rate n0 counts h was weakly temporally variable with a mean coefficient of variation of 3 the influence of its variation on the accuracy of crns however should not be ignored both the timing and frequency of sampling affected the calculation of n0 occasional sampling in the dry season is a recommended strategy to acquire an accurate n0 of a region crns performed well for determining the dynamics of spatially averaged swc in heterogeneous landscapes more specifically the accuracy of crns was comparable with those using the oven drying method with r 2 root mean square error and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0 86 0 026 cm3 cm3 and 0 81 respectively this study evaluated the applicability of crns in a region with complex climatic hydrological and underlying surface conditions these results are useful for developing a reasonable sampling strategy for acquiring an accurate n0 and calibrating the crns future studies however should focus on the application of the crns technique to resolve the eco environmental issues of the region keywords cosmic ray neutron sensing soil moisture hectometer scale subtropical climatic region agricultural ecosystem 1 introduction soil water content swc at multiple scales plays a fundamental role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles and in the exchange of energy between the land surface and the atmosphere brocca et al 2011 katul et al 2012 wang et al 2020 swc controls a series of hydrological geochemical and ecological processes romano 2014 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 specifically swc especially swc of the surface soil is an essential variable for assessing droughts carrão et al 2016 managing irrigation li et al 2019 preventing erosion and predicting floods mahoney et al 2020 information about swc however is difficult to acquire due to its high variability over both time and space gao and shao 2012 swc is usually monitored at point scales mainly due to the easy access of the measurement technique several proven techniques e g frequency domain reflectometry and time domain reflectometry tdr can accurately determine the temporal dynamics of swc at a point scale peters et al 2013 point scale swc information however is not always reliable in fields of study such as agricultural management and hydrological modelling so information at larger scales is required high spatial heterogeneity requires scaling up swc information from the point scale to larger scales which is costly or even unpractical satellite based earth technologies are definitely better at obtaining large scale swc information than multi point measurements ochsner et al 2013 satellite based observation plays a crucial role in calibrating regional hydrological processes but cannot adequately detect these processes at an intermediate scale due to its low spatial resolution duygu and akyürek 2019 and shallow measuring depth peng et al 2017 mesoscale swc information from radii of about 100 1000 m could fill the gap between a ground based point scale and satellite based large scale observations zhu et al 2020 data at hectometer scales for example can help to improve the accuracy of remote sensing products dong et al 2014 franz et al 2015 and are intermediate between the two scales for studying diverse hydrological and ecological functions which is essential for resolving the challenging task of transforming spatial scales swc information at a hectometer scale unfortunately remains scarce around the globe direct measurement of swc at hectometer scales remains challenging calculations from point scale observations using classical statistics or geostatistical theory is presently mostly used for obtaining information about swc at hectometer scales zreda et al 2012 this method however has high labor costs and inevitably introduces errors during scaling up cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is one of the few techniques that can directly measure mean swc of an area covering a much larger footprint than any other current ground based method montzka et al 2017 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 the footprint for crns varies with climatic and hydrological conditions specifically it is closely associated with air pressure desilets and zreda 2013 and swc köhli et al 2015 for example the horizontal measuring radius ranged between 200 m in a region with a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate cai and pang 2018 and 580 m in a region with a subfrigid semi humid monsoon climate zhu et al 2016 the depth of measurement can vary between 15 cm in wet regions and 83 cm in dry regions köhli et al 2015 due to the differences in swc zreda et al 2008 as a continuous noninvasive monitoring technique at hectometer scales crns has attracted much attention since it was first introduced to environmental science by zreda et al 2008 crns is a robust technique applicable in diverse ecosystems from forest lv et al 2014 to grassland zhu et al 2018 and to desert schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 ecosystems and in diverse climatic regions from humid bogena et al 2013 to semi arid wang et al 2019 and to arid and extremely arid jakobi et al 2018 regions crns has been extensively applied in the last decade to validate satellite based swc products duygu and akyürek 2019 estimate soil hydraulic properties brunetti et al 2019 and model hydrology evans et al 2016 the underlying surface condition among many factors strongly affects the performance of crns flat and uniform underlying surfaces are ideal for supporting a high accuracy of estimation hydrogen introduced by vegetation would also disturb the conversion of swc from observed neutron counts correcting for biomass could help to improve the accuracy of estimation of swc e g nguyen et al 2017 schrön et al 2017 but eliminating the effect of vegetation especially for dispersed land uses remains challenging wang et al 2019 in addition crns is extremely sensitive to surface water e g ponds and irrigation within its footprint due to the large amount of hydrogen in water regions with complex underlying surface conditions have therefore attracted much attention for testing the applicability of crns for example wang et al 2019 successfully estimated spatially averaged swc in semi arid climatic regions with heterogeneous land use types and terrains in three soils with diverse textures from loamy sand to sandy loam li et al 2019 however found that crns in a similar climatic region was not feasible for monitoring the dynamics of swc with a drip irrigation system due to the noise of the crns sensors dimitrova petrova et al 2020 recently reported that using crns to estimate averaged swc was challenging in a mixed agricultural landscape in scotland they further argued that the shallow depth of measurement and high uncertainty of the sensor were major challenges which may have been partly due to the extremely wet environment of their study area the applicability of crns is affected by a combination of climate hydrology soil terrain and land use evaluating the performance of crns under diverse conditions is therefore essential and valuable the region of red soil in china covering an area of 2 17 million km2 gao et al 2020 is important for the production of grain and fruit soil erosion and seasonal drought two primary issues in this region are closely associated with the status of swc of the surface soil crns therefore has great potential in resolving the eco environmental issues in this region this region however is characterized by a typical monsoon climate distinct wet and dry seasons dispersed land uses rainfed upland and flooded paddy fields and clay and barren soil low organic carbon contents which complicate accurate estimation of swc at a hectometer scale using crns to our knowledge the applicability of crns in this region has not been reported china does not yet have a widespread crns network such as those that have been established in the usa australia germany and other countries zreda et al 2012 baatz et al 2014 hawdon et al 2014 most of the current crns sites in china were installed in arid and semi arid regions with a desert steppe ecosystem cai and pang 2018 an alpine meadow ecosystem zhu et al 2017 or a grassland dominated ecosystem wang et al 2019 climate hydrology soil and underlying surface conditions of these locations differ greatly from those in the humid red soil region the objectives of this study were therefore to 1 identify the extent of the crns footprint under subtropical hydroclimatic conditions 2 clarify the relative contributions of land uses to crns signals in heterogeneous landscapes and 3 evaluate the performance of crns in estimating the temporal dynamics of spatially averaged swc in the red soil region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was in the region of red soil in china red soil is one of the primary zonal soil types accounting for 12 3 of the chinese mainland a crns system was installed on a slope in the sunjia agricultural watershed 28 13 45 28 14 12 n 116 53 58 116 54 28 e which is one of the critical zones of observation of china fig 1 the study area has distinct characteristics of climate soil and underlying surface conditions the study area has a warm and humid subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual air temperature is 17 8 with a high of 29 2 in july and a low of 5 6 in january snow is uncommon in this area due to the warm climate annual rainfall is higher than the potential evapotranspiration with means of 1800 mm and 1200 mm respectively gao et al 2019 the area has a rainy season from april to june accounting for 50 of the total annual rainfall evapotranspiration however always exceeds rainfall in the next three months which generally leads to a serious seasonal drought the highly variable rainfall among seasons leads to a high temporal heterogeneity of swc the dynamics of critical meteorological indices during the study period are shown in fig 2 the soils of the study area were developed from quaternary red clays the soils on the slope are clay or clayey loam of the usda classification system suggesting a weak ability to effectively retain moisture in soil pores they have a high clay content and a low content of organic carbon with means in the top 30 cm of 35 1 and 0 56 respectively the clay content increases slightly from 33 1 to 37 4 and soil organic carbon content decreases rapidly from 0 82 to 0 31 with depth within the 0 30 cm soil profile table 1 detailed information of the soil properties for the slope is presented in table 1 the elevation of the slope varied between 44 m and 50 m a s l the vegetation of the study area is dispersed including citrus land rainfed cropland and paddy fields the proportions of these three vegetation types in a circle with a radius of 200 m around the sensor were around 27 42 and 30 respectively fig 1b most of the paddy fields were at least 120 m from the sensors and were flooded by irrigation water during most of the growing season from may to july for early rice and from july to october for late rice the rainfed cropland was planted with peanut watermelon pepper cassava and sweet potato during the study period of these crops peanut was most common accounting for around 50 of the area pepper covered a small area 5 and was 10 60 m from the sensor the pepper was the only crop type irrigated of the upland ecosystem with a frequency of 2 3 days between august and november due to the drought during this period 2 2 data collection and analysis swc was measured between march 2019 and february 2020 using crns tdr and by weighing soil samples before and after oven drying swc was measured using crns at 24 h moving averages similar methods are always used to decrease uncertainty due to the sensor e g li et al 2019 baatz et al 2015 the weighted mean swc measured using the oven drying method at 27 locations across the study area could be considered as the true mean at the hectometer scale swc measured using tdr at a resolution of 5 min may well represent the temporal dynamics of swc at the point scale soil moisture data from tdr together with data from the oven drying method were used to evaluate the performance of crns the locations of the sampling sites for the three methods are shown in fig 1 2 2 1 swc measured using crns 1 crns system a crns system hydroinnova company albuquerque usa contains two sensors a data logger a solar panel and a storage battery fig 1d one sensor is used to detect epithermal neutrons for calculating the content of liquid water the other sensor is a thermal neutron sensor which can be used to calculate the solid water included no solid water e g snow and ice however was observed during the study period so swc was estimated based on the counts of epithermal neutrons meteorological data such as air temperature relative humidity air pressure and precipitation were monitored hourly during the study period 2 extent of the crns footprint the crns footprint varied among the study sites due to differences in the status of swc and in the meteorological conditions the crns footprint therefore needed to be identified at each site the contributions of swc at diverse spatial positions and depths across the footprint of the sensors were considered equal in the early stage of the appearance of crns technique mean swc of the footprint was therefore generally calculated using arithmetic means for calibrating the crns signal e g franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 however found that the contribution of swc to crns was strongly correlated with the distance from the sensors and the soil depth accordingly a method based on weighting distance and depth was proposed by köhli et al 2015 which was found more accurate in swc estimation than the direct method using arithmetic means tian et al 2016 cai and pang 2018 we therefore used the kohli et al 2015 weighting method in the present study an air pressure of 101 3 kpa and bare soil were set as the standard conditions based on the theory of the weighting method 3 calibration of raw neutron density in addition to swc atmospheric water vapor air pressure solar radiation and vegetation biomass affect the strength of cosmic rays and thus the number of epithermal neutrons produced by collisions these factors therefore affect the equilibrium concentration of neutrons at the soil surface which differ among study regions we did not consider vegetation correction due to the lack of accurate biomass data we therefore used a three step correction for determining neutron density to compare results among different climatic regions air pressure fluctuates over space and time we used the formula proposed by desilets and zreda 2001 to calculate the correction coefficient of air pressure fp 1 f p exp p 0 p l where p0 kpa is the reference air pressure the mean during the calibration period p kpa is the actual air pressure and l is the mass attenuation of high energy neutrons which is about 137 64 g cm2 in our study area in addition to soil water atmospheric water vapor is an important source of hydrogen atoms the density of water vapor however varies among climatic regions we used the formula proposed by rosolem et al 2013 to correct for the density of water vapor 2 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ ρ 0 where fwv is a correction coefficient for atmospheric water vapor ρ g m3 is the absolute density of water vapor in our study area and ρ0 g m3 is the density of water vapor under the reference condition which is always set to zero solar activity affects the density of cosmic rays which are mainly reflected by solar radiation the correction coefficient for solar radiation fi was obtained by zreda et al 2012 3 f i i m i a where im counts h is the density of epithermal neutrons measured at jungfraujoch switzerland during the calibration period and ia counts h is the reference neutron density the mean neutron density measured at jungfraujoch during the same period the overall correction for measuring neutron counts using crns could therefore be described as 4 n n f p f wv f i where n counts h is the corrected neutron density and n counts h is the raw density measured using crns 4 convert neutron counts into swc we used the method proposed by desilets et al 2010 to convert observed neutrons counts into swc 5 θ ρ b ρ w a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 where ρb and ρw g cm3 are the densities of soil and water respectively n0 is the neutron count rate counts h in dry soil and a0 a1 and a2 are constants 0 0808 0 372 and 0 115 respectively mean swc was calculated for each sampling occasion using 162 swc samples 27 locations with six soil depths using a method based on weighting neutron intensity n0 could thereby be obtained for each sampling occasion to identify the influence of sampling strategy on the performances of n0 we calculated n0 based on the signal on the driest sampling occasion 24 august mean n0 in the dry period 29 july to 6 september and the mean n0 of 10 sampling occasions the counts of epithermal neutrons measured using crns were accordingly converted to swc based on the calculated n0 of the corresponding sampling strategies 2 2 2 swc measured using tdr and the oven drying method tdr sensors cs655 campbell company utah usa were installed at five locations along a sloped peanut field for comparing the dynamics of swc at hectometer and point scales fig 1b the dynamics of swc was monitored with a temporal resolution of 5 min at depths of 5 and 20 cm the sensors were calibrated in the laboratory using the top 30 cm of the soils at the study site a good power function was identified between swc measured by the tdr sensors and the weighting method with an r 2 of 0 995 data not shown swc measured in the field was converted using the identified equation gravitational swc and the corresponding soil bulk density were measured using the oven drying method at 27 locations across the study area the 27 locations were distributed evenly in six directions around the sensors fig 1c for each direction swc data were collected at positions 10 25 75 120 and 170 m from the sensors the sampling locations at the 170 m positions however were not available for three directions due to the appearance of the paddy fields at around 150 m to the sensors soil samples for measuring swc were collected from six soil layers 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 and 25 30 cm using 40 cm3 aluminum boxes samples of undisturbed soil for determining bulk density were collected from the same layers using a 100 cm3 cutting ring these samples were dried at 105 to constant weights to obtain the gravitational swc and bulk density swc was measured at the 27 locations on 10 occasions from march to december 2019 at sampling intervals of about one month the bulk densities of the rainfed croplands to a depth of 20 cm were determined using the same sampling strategy as for swc due to the effects of tillage i e on 10 sampling occasions at the top 20 cm with 5 cm interval and were collected once in march 2019 below 20 cm samples for determining the bulk density of citrus land were collected once in march 2019 at all six depths at the top 30 cm with 5 cm interval the performance of crns was tested by converting the swcs of the oven dried samples to the spatially averaged value using the same weighting as identified footprint of crns the swcs of the flooded paddy fields were difficult to measure using the oven drying method on 10 sampling occasions with the same strategy to the rainfed cropland and citrus land we used an approximate method to estimate the swcs of the paddy fields before the paddy fields were flooded we installed one sensor at a depth of 10 cm at each location to automatically monitor swc the profile soil samples were collected twice immediately after the flooded water was discharged to measure swc using oven drying method the relationship among the swcs of the soil layers was thereby established the profile swcs on the 10 sampling occasions could be estimated using this relationship and the swcs measured with the sensor 2 2 3 assessment of accuracy we used root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse to identify the applicability of crns in this region 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n v i q i 2 where n is the number of sampling occasions 10 in this study and vi and qi are swc measured using the oven drying method and crns respectively 7 nse 1 i 1 n v i q i 2 i 1 n v i q 2 where qi and q are swc and mean swc measured using crns respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal dynamics of swc the dynamics of swc to a depth of 30 cm measured using the oven drying method at the 27 locations were highly variable between march and december 2019 the swc could be divided into three stages decreasing relatively stable and increasing fig 3 a swc in the first stage decreased from 0 33 in april to 0 17 in august swc in the second stage fluctuated slightly from august to december varying from 0 17 in august to 0 20 in october swc was not measured using the oven drying method for january and february but the tdr sensors indicated that swc was quickly recharged by rainwater during this period the third stage from december to the following march was therefore characterized by an obvious increase in swc the features of the three stages were mainly a balance between rainfall and evapotranspiration swc in the rainy season tended to decrease inconsistent with previous findings that the rainy season was a major period for recharging swc nandintsetseg and shinoda 2011 this contradiction could be ascribed to the joint effect of the target soil depth climatic conditions and sampling strategy we measured swc at a depth of 30 cm which was more sensitive to environmental conditions than deeper soil for example gao et al 2020 reported that the temporal variability of swc in our study area decreased from 17 1 to 1 9 with increasing soil depths the frequent transition between rainy and sunny days in this area may have caused the high temporal variability of surface swc a high swc in shallow soil layers is difficult to maintain even during the rainy season due to the low capacity of red soil to retain water in pores with the intense solar radiation swc was measured using oven drying method at least three days after rainfall event so a decrease in surface swc in the rainy season from april to august is therefore reasonable land use played an important role in controlling the magnitude and dynamics of surface swc swc was higher in the citrus land than rainfed cropland with means of 0 26 and 0 24 respectively fig 3a the temporal variation of swc was lower in citrus land than rainfed cropland at all six depths fig 3b these differences were likely caused by the higher canopy interception and lower evaporation of the citrus than the cropland transpiration has been reported to be high in citrus land with water mainly absorbed from deep soil layers tahir et al 2016 surface swc may therefore be higher and temporally more stable in the citrus than the cropland swc for the two land uses however was generally similar across the entire study period suggesting the dominant contribution of meteorological conditions 3 2 crns footprint horizontal measuring radius measuring depth and corresponding weights at diverse positions were calculated for crns using nonlinear weighting the horizontal radius in this region varied between 175 m in july and 215 m in october with a mean of 194 m due to the effects of air pressure and swc fig 4 the measurement radius was comparable with the findings of cai and pang 2018 and nguyen et al 2017 who found that the measuring radius varied between 191 and 257 m in the wulanchabu desert ecosystem in china and 200 m in a forested ecosystem in south korea respectively the horizontal radius in our study however was only half those reported by franz et al 2016 for northeastern austria and zhu et al 2018 for the northern qinghai tibet plateau the large differences in the measuring radii were likely caused by the diverse elevations among these studies e g 4600 m in the study by zhu et al 2018 and only 47 m in our study air pressure and density are low at regions with high elevation which is advantageous to the long distance transfer of neutrons due to fewer collisions köhli et al 2015 horizontal radii can therefore be large in regions at high elevations desilets and zreda 2013 the contribution of weighting to swc in our study was also spatially dependent the area within 20 m of the sensors accounted for about 50 of the variation and the contribution increased to 80 when the distance increased to 100 m fig 4 the crns measuring depth was closely associated with the status of swc measuring depth varied between 16 cm in march with a swc of 0 32 and 23 cm in august with a swc of 0 17 fig 3a and fig 5 mean measuring depth was 19 cm which was deeper than in the study by vather et al 2018 with a depth of 11 cm seasonal drought during our study led to a low swc in the shallow soil layers and thus a deep measuring depth in addition köhli et al 2015 suggested that swc of the surface layer contributed more to the variation of crns measurements than swc of the deeper layers specifically swc at a depth of 5 cm in our study contributed half of the total variation fig 5b variable footprint in the horizontal and vertical directions was likely an important reason for higher temporal variation of swc measured by crns than point scale monitoring using tdr with ranges of 0 3 and 0 19 and cvs of 0 25 and 0 21 respectively table 2 the tdr sensor measured swc at a fixed depth and scope which would decrease the fluctuation of swc the variable footprint of the crns however was not the only factor contributing to its stronger fluctuation than the tdr based swc the irrigation of the pepper field during the seasonal period of drought i e august to november during the study period was another cause of the fluctuation of the crns signal even with no appreciable rainfall the peanut field with the tdr sensor however was not irrigated the noise from the crns may have also contributed to the strong temporal variability of swc dimitrova petrova et al 2020 3 3 relative contributions of land uses to the crns signal the rainfed cropland citrus land and paddy fields were the three main components of the footprint of crns with the proportion of the footprint of 42 27 and 30 respectively we evaluated the relative contributions of the three land uses to the crns signal in addition to further check the role of paddy fields we compared the relative contributions of the three land uses under two conditions considering the swc data of paddy fields or not during n0 calculation the relative contributions of the rainfed cropland citrus land and paddy fields were 86 7 10 7 and 2 6 respectively including the swc data of the paddy fields the rainfed cropland was the only land use with ranges of 0 25 m to the sensor which contributed 67 3 to the crns signal fig 6 the rainfed cropland and the citrus land covered 72 7 and 27 3 of the scope between 25 and 75 m to the sensor which contributed 12 7 and 4 7 to the crns signal respectively fig 6 the cropland covered a much larger area between the scopes of 25 and 75 m to the sensor but its relative contribution was lower than those of 0 10 and 10 25 m fig 6 this difference was mainly caused by the rapidly decreasing weighting of swc to the crns signal with increasing distance to the sensor swc was much higher in the paddy fields than the other land uses but its relative contribution was only 2 6 mainly due to the large distance to the sensor fig 6 the contribution per area of paddy field was replaced by the mean contribution of the other two land uses at the same distance to the sensor when the swcs of the paddy fields were excluded the relative contribution of the three land uses were then 84 4 11 7 and 3 9 for cropland citrus land and paddy fields respectively fig 6 the relative contribution increased for the paddy fields and decreased for the other two land uses specifically the relative contributions increased for the land uses within 75 m of the sensor and decreased for those farther than 75 m fig 6 this cut off was associated with the distribution of the paddy fields the paddy fields were not within 75 m of the sensors most were in the range of 120 200 m fig 6 the distribution of the land uses or the distance to the sensor and their area therefore played a more important role than the type of land use in determining the contribution to the crns signal 3 4 accuracy of crns for measuring swc n0 was calculated for 10 sampling occasions to convert the neutron counts obtained by crns into swc n0 varied between 1276 and 1391 during the study period with a mean and cv of 1331 and 3 respectively the temporal dynamics of swc were obtained based on each n0 we compared the temporal dynamics of swc measured using crns to those measured using the classical oven drying method and tdr to evaluate the applicability of crns in this region the dynamics of swc derived from crns with single sampling generally tended to be similar to those of swc based on the oven drying method fig 7 a n0 was very weakly variable across the entire hydrological year but the magnitude of swc calculated based on these methods differed significantly fig 7a n0 calculated based on single sampling in the wet season generally overestimated swc compared to swc determined by oven drying sampling in the dry season probably generates a more accurate n0 for calculating swc than does sampling in the wet season in addition to the timing of sampling sampling frequency affected the accuracy of swc calculated from the crns signal due to the poor performance of sampling in the wet season we only compared the accuracy of swc based on single sampling on the driest date 24 august three samplings in the dry season and sampling across the hydrological year the swcs of crns based on single sampling on the driest date followed well with the tendency of swc based on the other two methods fig 7b the linear correlation between the swcs measured by crns with single sampling and by the oven drying method was acceptable with r 2 rmse and nse of 0 84 0 04 cm3 cm3 and 0 55 respectively fig 8 a the accuracy of swc using three samplings in the dry season was higher than that based on single sampling fig 7b this higher accuracy was indicated by the stronger linear correlation between the swc measured using crns based on three sampling and by the oven drying method with higher r 2 and nse and lower rmse and closer to the 1 1 line compared with that of single sampling fig 8a surprisingly the dynamics of swc nearly overlapped based on n0 calculated from three samplings in the dry season and the 10 samplings across the hydrological year fig 7b and fig 8a both the timing and the frequency of sampling affected the accuracy of swc calculated from the crns signal n0 is generally considered constant with a specific region e g li et al 2019 but its temporal variability should not be ignored single sampling may be insufficient for calculating n0 of a region sampling in the dry season is more likely to provide an accurate n0 than sampling in the wet season sampling at a high frequency across a long period will undoubtedly tend to provide a reasonable n0 such a sampling strategy however is not recommended for balancing cost and efficiency several samplings in the dry season three samplings in our study could provide almost the same accuracy as that based on a higher sampling frequency e g 10 samplings a year occasional samplings under relatively dry hydrological conditions is therefore recommended in regions similar to ours the crns technique performed well for measuring swc at the hectometer scale swc based on crns matched well with precipitation seasonal drought and swc measured using tdr at point scale all swcs measured using the oven drying method on 10 occasions were near the curve of swc dynamics measured using crns even when using single sampling on the driest date fig 8a the two methods deviated the most among the 10 validation occasions on 24 august when swc was 4 3 higher in absolute value using crns than the oven drying method this deviation may be due to the frequent irrigation of pepper filed during the seasonal period of drought the area of the pepper crop was limited with only several hundred square meters but the distance to the crns sensor was within 60 m repeated irrigation leads to the disturbance and fluctuation of crns signals but has no effect on land planted with peanut where with tdr sensors were installed swc measured by crns was therefore overestimated in august more specifically the two methods were strongly linearly correlated with a slope near 1 and r 2 rmse and nse of 0 86 0 026 cm3 cm3 and 0 81 respectively fig 8a the accuracy of crns in this region was comparable with that reported by zhu et al 2018 for the northern tibetan plateau their study area was characterized by flat terrain mostly a single vegetation type and high neutron counts which are advantageous for obtaining highly accurate crns signals the high accuracy comparable with other studies indicated that crns has great potential to be applied in this region with relatively complex underlying surface conditions the crns technique has obvious advantages for determining mean swc at the hectometer scale compared to traditional point scale monitoring swcs measured using the oven drying method at the hectometer scale and using tdr at five locations at the point scale were significantly correlated fig 8b indicating that both swc dynamics and the factors controlling swc were similar at the two scales the correlation however was much weaker than that between crns and the oven drying method r 2 rmse and nse all performed worse when using point scale data instead of swc measured using crns fig 8 the slope of the fitted curve between oven drying and point scale data was farther from the 1 1 line than the slope for the crns based data set 0 58 and 1 00 respectively fig 8 this low slope suggested that swc at the hectometer scale was probably overestimated under dry conditions and underestimated under wet conditions if using point scale monitoring at peanut land instead many factors likely contributed to the differences of swc measured using crns and tdr firstly the difference in the scope of coverage in the horizontal direction for the two techniques was a major reason crns covered an area with a diameter of about 190 m in this study in contrast the tdr sensors could only measure the swc for an area with a diameter of several centimeters high spatial heterogeneity thus led to diverse behaviors between the two scales secondly swc was only measured at the point scale on land planted with peanut land whereas the 190 m crns footprint contained multiple land uses diverse land uses have much different hydrological functions for example tahir et al 2016 found that rainfed cropland in our study area had more severe soil erosion and a lower moisture holding capacity than citrus land which led to a lower swc and higher temporal variability gao et al 2016 and may have accounted for the higher swc measured using crns than the five tdr sensors the measuring depth for crns also varied with the status of swc increasing with decreasing swc the depth of measurement for the tdr sensors however was only determined at installation which was independent of swc the difference in measuring depth may thus have accounted for much of the difference in performance between the two techniques especially under extremely dry and wet conditions vather et al 2018 the hydrogen in the vegetation would also likely affect the performance of crns baroni et al 2018 but not the tdr sensors which would increase the difference between the techniques the underlying surface of the southern red soil region is relatively complex but crns still performed well in determining the spatial mean swc at the hectometer scale this good performance under complex hydrological and underlying surface conditions indicated the robust applicability of the crns technique crns has great potential to bridge the gap in swc measurements between point scale monitoring and large scale satellite products in multiple environments crns would also be a useful tool for resolving the ecological issues of the red soil region such as predicting soil erosion and seasonal drought 4 conclusions the applicability of crns as a technique for acquiring information about the temporal dynamics of spatial mean swc at a hectometer scale has not been evaluated in the region of red soil in china under subtropical hydroclimatic conditions we tested the accuracy of crns under relatively complex underlying surface conditions by comparing the performances of crns and the oven drying method across the study area and tdr monitoring at the point scale we drew the following conclusions 1 the crns horizontal radius and measuring depth varied over time with means of 194 m and 19 cm respectively measuring depth was more temporally variable than the horizontal radius 2 the type of land use affected the crns signal but much less than the distance to the crns sensor the relative contribution of the flooded paddy fields covering an area 30 of the footprint to the crns signal was only 2 6 because most of the fields were more than 120 m from the sensor 3 both the timing and frequency of sampling affected the accuracy of n0 sampling in the dry season would probably provide a more accurate n0 for a region than sampling in the wet season occasional sampling in the dry season is recommended for balancing cost and efficiency 4 the crns technique could accurately estimate spatial mean swc in a heterogeneous landscapes under a subtropical monsoon climate estimation accuracy was comparable with swc measured using the oven drying method across the study area and much higher than tdr based monitoring at limited locations the crns technique was a robust tool for acquiring information about the dynamics of swc at the hectometer scale the study area was surrounded by paddy fields and we did not correct for factors of the vegetation but swc could still be estimated with high accuracy our findings are therefore of great value for expanding the

4673,cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is one of the few techniques that can directly acquire information about the temporal dynamics of soil water content swc at a hectometer scale the performance of crns depends on the climate soil and conditions of the underlying surface the region of red soil in china is characterized by heterogeneous land uses combination of upland and paddy fields distinct dry wet periods and low contents of soil organic carbon the applicability of crns has not yet been evaluated under the subtropical hydroclimatic conditions of this region we therefore compared spatially averaged swc measured using crns with point scale data measured using time domain reflectometry tdr at five locations and oven dried soil samples collected at 27 locations across the crns footprint in an agricultural ecosystem of the red soil region between march 2019 and february 2020 the footprint of crns varied with time the horizontal radius of crns varied between 175 m in july and 215 m in october with a mean of 194 m and the measuring depth varied between 16 cm in march and 23 cm in august with a mean of 19 cm the relative contribution of rainfed cropland citrus land and paddy fields were 86 7 10 7 and 2 6 respectively the differences of the relative contribution among land uses were determined by the distance to the sensor and the area which were less affected by the types of land use the neutron count rate n0 counts h was weakly temporally variable with a mean coefficient of variation of 3 the influence of its variation on the accuracy of crns however should not be ignored both the timing and frequency of sampling affected the calculation of n0 occasional sampling in the dry season is a recommended strategy to acquire an accurate n0 of a region crns performed well for determining the dynamics of spatially averaged swc in heterogeneous landscapes more specifically the accuracy of crns was comparable with those using the oven drying method with r 2 root mean square error and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0 86 0 026 cm3 cm3 and 0 81 respectively this study evaluated the applicability of crns in a region with complex climatic hydrological and underlying surface conditions these results are useful for developing a reasonable sampling strategy for acquiring an accurate n0 and calibrating the crns future studies however should focus on the application of the crns technique to resolve the eco environmental issues of the region keywords cosmic ray neutron sensing soil moisture hectometer scale subtropical climatic region agricultural ecosystem 1 introduction soil water content swc at multiple scales plays a fundamental role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles and in the exchange of energy between the land surface and the atmosphere brocca et al 2011 katul et al 2012 wang et al 2020 swc controls a series of hydrological geochemical and ecological processes romano 2014 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 specifically swc especially swc of the surface soil is an essential variable for assessing droughts carrão et al 2016 managing irrigation li et al 2019 preventing erosion and predicting floods mahoney et al 2020 information about swc however is difficult to acquire due to its high variability over both time and space gao and shao 2012 swc is usually monitored at point scales mainly due to the easy access of the measurement technique several proven techniques e g frequency domain reflectometry and time domain reflectometry tdr can accurately determine the temporal dynamics of swc at a point scale peters et al 2013 point scale swc information however is not always reliable in fields of study such as agricultural management and hydrological modelling so information at larger scales is required high spatial heterogeneity requires scaling up swc information from the point scale to larger scales which is costly or even unpractical satellite based earth technologies are definitely better at obtaining large scale swc information than multi point measurements ochsner et al 2013 satellite based observation plays a crucial role in calibrating regional hydrological processes but cannot adequately detect these processes at an intermediate scale due to its low spatial resolution duygu and akyürek 2019 and shallow measuring depth peng et al 2017 mesoscale swc information from radii of about 100 1000 m could fill the gap between a ground based point scale and satellite based large scale observations zhu et al 2020 data at hectometer scales for example can help to improve the accuracy of remote sensing products dong et al 2014 franz et al 2015 and are intermediate between the two scales for studying diverse hydrological and ecological functions which is essential for resolving the challenging task of transforming spatial scales swc information at a hectometer scale unfortunately remains scarce around the globe direct measurement of swc at hectometer scales remains challenging calculations from point scale observations using classical statistics or geostatistical theory is presently mostly used for obtaining information about swc at hectometer scales zreda et al 2012 this method however has high labor costs and inevitably introduces errors during scaling up cosmic ray neutron sensing crns is one of the few techniques that can directly measure mean swc of an area covering a much larger footprint than any other current ground based method montzka et al 2017 dimitrova petrova et al 2020 the footprint for crns varies with climatic and hydrological conditions specifically it is closely associated with air pressure desilets and zreda 2013 and swc köhli et al 2015 for example the horizontal measuring radius ranged between 200 m in a region with a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate cai and pang 2018 and 580 m in a region with a subfrigid semi humid monsoon climate zhu et al 2016 the depth of measurement can vary between 15 cm in wet regions and 83 cm in dry regions köhli et al 2015 due to the differences in swc zreda et al 2008 as a continuous noninvasive monitoring technique at hectometer scales crns has attracted much attention since it was first introduced to environmental science by zreda et al 2008 crns is a robust technique applicable in diverse ecosystems from forest lv et al 2014 to grassland zhu et al 2018 and to desert schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 ecosystems and in diverse climatic regions from humid bogena et al 2013 to semi arid wang et al 2019 and to arid and extremely arid jakobi et al 2018 regions crns has been extensively applied in the last decade to validate satellite based swc products duygu and akyürek 2019 estimate soil hydraulic properties brunetti et al 2019 and model hydrology evans et al 2016 the underlying surface condition among many factors strongly affects the performance of crns flat and uniform underlying surfaces are ideal for supporting a high accuracy of estimation hydrogen introduced by vegetation would also disturb the conversion of swc from observed neutron counts correcting for biomass could help to improve the accuracy of estimation of swc e g nguyen et al 2017 schrön et al 2017 but eliminating the effect of vegetation especially for dispersed land uses remains challenging wang et al 2019 in addition crns is extremely sensitive to surface water e g ponds and irrigation within its footprint due to the large amount of hydrogen in water regions with complex underlying surface conditions have therefore attracted much attention for testing the applicability of crns for example wang et al 2019 successfully estimated spatially averaged swc in semi arid climatic regions with heterogeneous land use types and terrains in three soils with diverse textures from loamy sand to sandy loam li et al 2019 however found that crns in a similar climatic region was not feasible for monitoring the dynamics of swc with a drip irrigation system due to the noise of the crns sensors dimitrova petrova et al 2020 recently reported that using crns to estimate averaged swc was challenging in a mixed agricultural landscape in scotland they further argued that the shallow depth of measurement and high uncertainty of the sensor were major challenges which may have been partly due to the extremely wet environment of their study area the applicability of crns is affected by a combination of climate hydrology soil terrain and land use evaluating the performance of crns under diverse conditions is therefore essential and valuable the region of red soil in china covering an area of 2 17 million km2 gao et al 2020 is important for the production of grain and fruit soil erosion and seasonal drought two primary issues in this region are closely associated with the status of swc of the surface soil crns therefore has great potential in resolving the eco environmental issues in this region this region however is characterized by a typical monsoon climate distinct wet and dry seasons dispersed land uses rainfed upland and flooded paddy fields and clay and barren soil low organic carbon contents which complicate accurate estimation of swc at a hectometer scale using crns to our knowledge the applicability of crns in this region has not been reported china does not yet have a widespread crns network such as those that have been established in the usa australia germany and other countries zreda et al 2012 baatz et al 2014 hawdon et al 2014 most of the current crns sites in china were installed in arid and semi arid regions with a desert steppe ecosystem cai and pang 2018 an alpine meadow ecosystem zhu et al 2017 or a grassland dominated ecosystem wang et al 2019 climate hydrology soil and underlying surface conditions of these locations differ greatly from those in the humid red soil region the objectives of this study were therefore to 1 identify the extent of the crns footprint under subtropical hydroclimatic conditions 2 clarify the relative contributions of land uses to crns signals in heterogeneous landscapes and 3 evaluate the performance of crns in estimating the temporal dynamics of spatially averaged swc in the red soil region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was in the region of red soil in china red soil is one of the primary zonal soil types accounting for 12 3 of the chinese mainland a crns system was installed on a slope in the sunjia agricultural watershed 28 13 45 28 14 12 n 116 53 58 116 54 28 e which is one of the critical zones of observation of china fig 1 the study area has distinct characteristics of climate soil and underlying surface conditions the study area has a warm and humid subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual air temperature is 17 8 with a high of 29 2 in july and a low of 5 6 in january snow is uncommon in this area due to the warm climate annual rainfall is higher than the potential evapotranspiration with means of 1800 mm and 1200 mm respectively gao et al 2019 the area has a rainy season from april to june accounting for 50 of the total annual rainfall evapotranspiration however always exceeds rainfall in the next three months which generally leads to a serious seasonal drought the highly variable rainfall among seasons leads to a high temporal heterogeneity of swc the dynamics of critical meteorological indices during the study period are shown in fig 2 the soils of the study area were developed from quaternary red clays the soils on the slope are clay or clayey loam of the usda classification system suggesting a weak ability to effectively retain moisture in soil pores they have a high clay content and a low content of organic carbon with means in the top 30 cm of 35 1 and 0 56 respectively the clay content increases slightly from 33 1 to 37 4 and soil organic carbon content decreases rapidly from 0 82 to 0 31 with depth within the 0 30 cm soil profile table 1 detailed information of the soil properties for the slope is presented in table 1 the elevation of the slope varied between 44 m and 50 m a s l the vegetation of the study area is dispersed including citrus land rainfed cropland and paddy fields the proportions of these three vegetation types in a circle with a radius of 200 m around the sensor were around 27 42 and 30 respectively fig 1b most of the paddy fields were at least 120 m from the sensors and were flooded by irrigation water during most of the growing season from may to july for early rice and from july to october for late rice the rainfed cropland was planted with peanut watermelon pepper cassava and sweet potato during the study period of these crops peanut was most common accounting for around 50 of the area pepper covered a small area 5 and was 10 60 m from the sensor the pepper was the only crop type irrigated of the upland ecosystem with a frequency of 2 3 days between august and november due to the drought during this period 2 2 data collection and analysis swc was measured between march 2019 and february 2020 using crns tdr and by weighing soil samples before and after oven drying swc was measured using crns at 24 h moving averages similar methods are always used to decrease uncertainty due to the sensor e g li et al 2019 baatz et al 2015 the weighted mean swc measured using the oven drying method at 27 locations across the study area could be considered as the true mean at the hectometer scale swc measured using tdr at a resolution of 5 min may well represent the temporal dynamics of swc at the point scale soil moisture data from tdr together with data from the oven drying method were used to evaluate the performance of crns the locations of the sampling sites for the three methods are shown in fig 1 2 2 1 swc measured using crns 1 crns system a crns system hydroinnova company albuquerque usa contains two sensors a data logger a solar panel and a storage battery fig 1d one sensor is used to detect epithermal neutrons for calculating the content of liquid water the other sensor is a thermal neutron sensor which can be used to calculate the solid water included no solid water e g snow and ice however was observed during the study period so swc was estimated based on the counts of epithermal neutrons meteorological data such as air temperature relative humidity air pressure and precipitation were monitored hourly during the study period 2 extent of the crns footprint the crns footprint varied among the study sites due to differences in the status of swc and in the meteorological conditions the crns footprint therefore needed to be identified at each site the contributions of swc at diverse spatial positions and depths across the footprint of the sensors were considered equal in the early stage of the appearance of crns technique mean swc of the footprint was therefore generally calculated using arithmetic means for calibrating the crns signal e g franz et al 2012 köhli et al 2015 however found that the contribution of swc to crns was strongly correlated with the distance from the sensors and the soil depth accordingly a method based on weighting distance and depth was proposed by köhli et al 2015 which was found more accurate in swc estimation than the direct method using arithmetic means tian et al 2016 cai and pang 2018 we therefore used the kohli et al 2015 weighting method in the present study an air pressure of 101 3 kpa and bare soil were set as the standard conditions based on the theory of the weighting method 3 calibration of raw neutron density in addition to swc atmospheric water vapor air pressure solar radiation and vegetation biomass affect the strength of cosmic rays and thus the number of epithermal neutrons produced by collisions these factors therefore affect the equilibrium concentration of neutrons at the soil surface which differ among study regions we did not consider vegetation correction due to the lack of accurate biomass data we therefore used a three step correction for determining neutron density to compare results among different climatic regions air pressure fluctuates over space and time we used the formula proposed by desilets and zreda 2001 to calculate the correction coefficient of air pressure fp 1 f p exp p 0 p l where p0 kpa is the reference air pressure the mean during the calibration period p kpa is the actual air pressure and l is the mass attenuation of high energy neutrons which is about 137 64 g cm2 in our study area in addition to soil water atmospheric water vapor is an important source of hydrogen atoms the density of water vapor however varies among climatic regions we used the formula proposed by rosolem et al 2013 to correct for the density of water vapor 2 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ ρ 0 where fwv is a correction coefficient for atmospheric water vapor ρ g m3 is the absolute density of water vapor in our study area and ρ0 g m3 is the density of water vapor under the reference condition which is always set to zero solar activity affects the density of cosmic rays which are mainly reflected by solar radiation the correction coefficient for solar radiation fi was obtained by zreda et al 2012 3 f i i m i a where im counts h is the density of epithermal neutrons measured at jungfraujoch switzerland during the calibration period and ia counts h is the reference neutron density the mean neutron density measured at jungfraujoch during the same period the overall correction for measuring neutron counts using crns could therefore be described as 4 n n f p f wv f i where n counts h is the corrected neutron density and n counts h is the raw density measured using crns 4 convert neutron counts into swc we used the method proposed by desilets et al 2010 to convert observed neutrons counts into swc 5 θ ρ b ρ w a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 where ρb and ρw g cm3 are the densities of soil and water respectively n0 is the neutron count rate counts h in dry soil and a0 a1 and a2 are constants 0 0808 0 372 and 0 115 respectively mean swc was calculated for each sampling occasion using 162 swc samples 27 locations with six soil depths using a method based on weighting neutron intensity n0 could thereby be obtained for each sampling occasion to identify the influence of sampling strategy on the performances of n0 we calculated n0 based on the signal on the driest sampling occasion 24 august mean n0 in the dry period 29 july to 6 september and the mean n0 of 10 sampling occasions the counts of epithermal neutrons measured using crns were accordingly converted to swc based on the calculated n0 of the corresponding sampling strategies 2 2 2 swc measured using tdr and the oven drying method tdr sensors cs655 campbell company utah usa were installed at five locations along a sloped peanut field for comparing the dynamics of swc at hectometer and point scales fig 1b the dynamics of swc was monitored with a temporal resolution of 5 min at depths of 5 and 20 cm the sensors were calibrated in the laboratory using the top 30 cm of the soils at the study site a good power function was identified between swc measured by the tdr sensors and the weighting method with an r 2 of 0 995 data not shown swc measured in the field was converted using the identified equation gravitational swc and the corresponding soil bulk density were measured using the oven drying method at 27 locations across the study area the 27 locations were distributed evenly in six directions around the sensors fig 1c for each direction swc data were collected at positions 10 25 75 120 and 170 m from the sensors the sampling locations at the 170 m positions however were not available for three directions due to the appearance of the paddy fields at around 150 m to the sensors soil samples for measuring swc were collected from six soil layers 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 and 25 30 cm using 40 cm3 aluminum boxes samples of undisturbed soil for determining bulk density were collected from the same layers using a 100 cm3 cutting ring these samples were dried at 105 to constant weights to obtain the gravitational swc and bulk density swc was measured at the 27 locations on 10 occasions from march to december 2019 at sampling intervals of about one month the bulk densities of the rainfed croplands to a depth of 20 cm were determined using the same sampling strategy as for swc due to the effects of tillage i e on 10 sampling occasions at the top 20 cm with 5 cm interval and were collected once in march 2019 below 20 cm samples for determining the bulk density of citrus land were collected once in march 2019 at all six depths at the top 30 cm with 5 cm interval the performance of crns was tested by converting the swcs of the oven dried samples to the spatially averaged value using the same weighting as identified footprint of crns the swcs of the flooded paddy fields were difficult to measure using the oven drying method on 10 sampling occasions with the same strategy to the rainfed cropland and citrus land we used an approximate method to estimate the swcs of the paddy fields before the paddy fields were flooded we installed one sensor at a depth of 10 cm at each location to automatically monitor swc the profile soil samples were collected twice immediately after the flooded water was discharged to measure swc using oven drying method the relationship among the swcs of the soil layers was thereby established the profile swcs on the 10 sampling occasions could be estimated using this relationship and the swcs measured with the sensor 2 2 3 assessment of accuracy we used root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse to identify the applicability of crns in this region 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n v i q i 2 where n is the number of sampling occasions 10 in this study and vi and qi are swc measured using the oven drying method and crns respectively 7 nse 1 i 1 n v i q i 2 i 1 n v i q 2 where qi and q are swc and mean swc measured using crns respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal dynamics of swc the dynamics of swc to a depth of 30 cm measured using the oven drying method at the 27 locations were highly variable between march and december 2019 the swc could be divided into three stages decreasing relatively stable and increasing fig 3 a swc in the first stage decreased from 0 33 in april to 0 17 in august swc in the second stage fluctuated slightly from august to december varying from 0 17 in august to 0 20 in october swc was not measured using the oven drying method for january and february but the tdr sensors indicated that swc was quickly recharged by rainwater during this period the third stage from december to the following march was therefore characterized by an obvious increase in swc the features of the three stages were mainly a balance between rainfall and evapotranspiration swc in the rainy season tended to decrease inconsistent with previous findings that the rainy season was a major period for recharging swc nandintsetseg and shinoda 2011 this contradiction could be ascribed to the joint effect of the target soil depth climatic conditions and sampling strategy we measured swc at a depth of 30 cm which was more sensitive to environmental conditions than deeper soil for example gao et al 2020 reported that the temporal variability of swc in our study area decreased from 17 1 to 1 9 with increasing soil depths the frequent transition between rainy and sunny days in this area may have caused the high temporal variability of surface swc a high swc in shallow soil layers is difficult to maintain even during the rainy season due to the low capacity of red soil to retain water in pores with the intense solar radiation swc was measured using oven drying method at least three days after rainfall event so a decrease in surface swc in the rainy season from april to august is therefore reasonable land use played an important role in controlling the magnitude and dynamics of surface swc swc was higher in the citrus land than rainfed cropland with means of 0 26 and 0 24 respectively fig 3a the temporal variation of swc was lower in citrus land than rainfed cropland at all six depths fig 3b these differences were likely caused by the higher canopy interception and lower evaporation of the citrus than the cropland transpiration has been reported to be high in citrus land with water mainly absorbed from deep soil layers tahir et al 2016 surface swc may therefore be higher and temporally more stable in the citrus than the cropland swc for the two land uses however was generally similar across the entire study period suggesting the dominant contribution of meteorological conditions 3 2 crns footprint horizontal measuring radius measuring depth and corresponding weights at diverse positions were calculated for crns using nonlinear weighting the horizontal radius in this region varied between 175 m in july and 215 m in october with a mean of 194 m due to the effects of air pressure and swc fig 4 the measurement radius was comparable with the findings of cai and pang 2018 and nguyen et al 2017 who found that the measuring radius varied between 191 and 257 m in the wulanchabu desert ecosystem in china and 200 m in a forested ecosystem in south korea respectively the horizontal radius in our study however was only half those reported by franz et al 2016 for northeastern austria and zhu et al 2018 for the northern qinghai tibet plateau the large differences in the measuring radii were likely caused by the diverse elevations among these studies e g 4600 m in the study by zhu et al 2018 and only 47 m in our study air pressure and density are low at regions with high elevation which is advantageous to the long distance transfer of neutrons due to fewer collisions köhli et al 2015 horizontal radii can therefore be large in regions at high elevations desilets and zreda 2013 the contribution of weighting to swc in our study was also spatially dependent the area within 20 m of the sensors accounted for about 50 of the variation and the contribution increased to 80 when the distance increased to 100 m fig 4 the crns measuring depth was closely associated with the status of swc measuring depth varied between 16 cm in march with a swc of 0 32 and 23 cm in august with a swc of 0 17 fig 3a and fig 5 mean measuring depth was 19 cm which was deeper than in the study by vather et al 2018 with a depth of 11 cm seasonal drought during our study led to a low swc in the shallow soil layers and thus a deep measuring depth in addition köhli et al 2015 suggested that swc of the surface layer contributed more to the variation of crns measurements than swc of the deeper layers specifically swc at a depth of 5 cm in our study contributed half of the total variation fig 5b variable footprint in the horizontal and vertical directions was likely an important reason for higher temporal variation of swc measured by crns than point scale monitoring using tdr with ranges of 0 3 and 0 19 and cvs of 0 25 and 0 21 respectively table 2 the tdr sensor measured swc at a fixed depth and scope which would decrease the fluctuation of swc the variable footprint of the crns however was not the only factor contributing to its stronger fluctuation than the tdr based swc the irrigation of the pepper field during the seasonal period of drought i e august to november during the study period was another cause of the fluctuation of the crns signal even with no appreciable rainfall the peanut field with the tdr sensor however was not irrigated the noise from the crns may have also contributed to the strong temporal variability of swc dimitrova petrova et al 2020 3 3 relative contributions of land uses to the crns signal the rainfed cropland citrus land and paddy fields were the three main components of the footprint of crns with the proportion of the footprint of 42 27 and 30 respectively we evaluated the relative contributions of the three land uses to the crns signal in addition to further check the role of paddy fields we compared the relative contributions of the three land uses under two conditions considering the swc data of paddy fields or not during n0 calculation the relative contributions of the rainfed cropland citrus land and paddy fields were 86 7 10 7 and 2 6 respectively including the swc data of the paddy fields the rainfed cropland was the only land use with ranges of 0 25 m to the sensor which contributed 67 3 to the crns signal fig 6 the rainfed cropland and the citrus land covered 72 7 and 27 3 of the scope between 25 and 75 m to the sensor which contributed 12 7 and 4 7 to the crns signal respectively fig 6 the cropland covered a much larger area between the scopes of 25 and 75 m to the sensor but its relative contribution was lower than those of 0 10 and 10 25 m fig 6 this difference was mainly caused by the rapidly decreasing weighting of swc to the crns signal with increasing distance to the sensor swc was much higher in the paddy fields than the other land uses but its relative contribution was only 2 6 mainly due to the large distance to the sensor fig 6 the contribution per area of paddy field was replaced by the mean contribution of the other two land uses at the same distance to the sensor when the swcs of the paddy fields were excluded the relative contribution of the three land uses were then 84 4 11 7 and 3 9 for cropland citrus land and paddy fields respectively fig 6 the relative contribution increased for the paddy fields and decreased for the other two land uses specifically the relative contributions increased for the land uses within 75 m of the sensor and decreased for those farther than 75 m fig 6 this cut off was associated with the distribution of the paddy fields the paddy fields were not within 75 m of the sensors most were in the range of 120 200 m fig 6 the distribution of the land uses or the distance to the sensor and their area therefore played a more important role than the type of land use in determining the contribution to the crns signal 3 4 accuracy of crns for measuring swc n0 was calculated for 10 sampling occasions to convert the neutron counts obtained by crns into swc n0 varied between 1276 and 1391 during the study period with a mean and cv of 1331 and 3 respectively the temporal dynamics of swc were obtained based on each n0 we compared the temporal dynamics of swc measured using crns to those measured using the classical oven drying method and tdr to evaluate the applicability of crns in this region the dynamics of swc derived from crns with single sampling generally tended to be similar to those of swc based on the oven drying method fig 7 a n0 was very weakly variable across the entire hydrological year but the magnitude of swc calculated based on these methods differed significantly fig 7a n0 calculated based on single sampling in the wet season generally overestimated swc compared to swc determined by oven drying sampling in the dry season probably generates a more accurate n0 for calculating swc than does sampling in the wet season in addition to the timing of sampling sampling frequency affected the accuracy of swc calculated from the crns signal due to the poor performance of sampling in the wet season we only compared the accuracy of swc based on single sampling on the driest date 24 august three samplings in the dry season and sampling across the hydrological year the swcs of crns based on single sampling on the driest date followed well with the tendency of swc based on the other two methods fig 7b the linear correlation between the swcs measured by crns with single sampling and by the oven drying method was acceptable with r 2 rmse and nse of 0 84 0 04 cm3 cm3 and 0 55 respectively fig 8 a the accuracy of swc using three samplings in the dry season was higher than that based on single sampling fig 7b this higher accuracy was indicated by the stronger linear correlation between the swc measured using crns based on three sampling and by the oven drying method with higher r 2 and nse and lower rmse and closer to the 1 1 line compared with that of single sampling fig 8a surprisingly the dynamics of swc nearly overlapped based on n0 calculated from three samplings in the dry season and the 10 samplings across the hydrological year fig 7b and fig 8a both the timing and the frequency of sampling affected the accuracy of swc calculated from the crns signal n0 is generally considered constant with a specific region e g li et al 2019 but its temporal variability should not be ignored single sampling may be insufficient for calculating n0 of a region sampling in the dry season is more likely to provide an accurate n0 than sampling in the wet season sampling at a high frequency across a long period will undoubtedly tend to provide a reasonable n0 such a sampling strategy however is not recommended for balancing cost and efficiency several samplings in the dry season three samplings in our study could provide almost the same accuracy as that based on a higher sampling frequency e g 10 samplings a year occasional samplings under relatively dry hydrological conditions is therefore recommended in regions similar to ours the crns technique performed well for measuring swc at the hectometer scale swc based on crns matched well with precipitation seasonal drought and swc measured using tdr at point scale all swcs measured using the oven drying method on 10 occasions were near the curve of swc dynamics measured using crns even when using single sampling on the driest date fig 8a the two methods deviated the most among the 10 validation occasions on 24 august when swc was 4 3 higher in absolute value using crns than the oven drying method this deviation may be due to the frequent irrigation of pepper filed during the seasonal period of drought the area of the pepper crop was limited with only several hundred square meters but the distance to the crns sensor was within 60 m repeated irrigation leads to the disturbance and fluctuation of crns signals but has no effect on land planted with peanut where with tdr sensors were installed swc measured by crns was therefore overestimated in august more specifically the two methods were strongly linearly correlated with a slope near 1 and r 2 rmse and nse of 0 86 0 026 cm3 cm3 and 0 81 respectively fig 8a the accuracy of crns in this region was comparable with that reported by zhu et al 2018 for the northern tibetan plateau their study area was characterized by flat terrain mostly a single vegetation type and high neutron counts which are advantageous for obtaining highly accurate crns signals the high accuracy comparable with other studies indicated that crns has great potential to be applied in this region with relatively complex underlying surface conditions the crns technique has obvious advantages for determining mean swc at the hectometer scale compared to traditional point scale monitoring swcs measured using the oven drying method at the hectometer scale and using tdr at five locations at the point scale were significantly correlated fig 8b indicating that both swc dynamics and the factors controlling swc were similar at the two scales the correlation however was much weaker than that between crns and the oven drying method r 2 rmse and nse all performed worse when using point scale data instead of swc measured using crns fig 8 the slope of the fitted curve between oven drying and point scale data was farther from the 1 1 line than the slope for the crns based data set 0 58 and 1 00 respectively fig 8 this low slope suggested that swc at the hectometer scale was probably overestimated under dry conditions and underestimated under wet conditions if using point scale monitoring at peanut land instead many factors likely contributed to the differences of swc measured using crns and tdr firstly the difference in the scope of coverage in the horizontal direction for the two techniques was a major reason crns covered an area with a diameter of about 190 m in this study in contrast the tdr sensors could only measure the swc for an area with a diameter of several centimeters high spatial heterogeneity thus led to diverse behaviors between the two scales secondly swc was only measured at the point scale on land planted with peanut land whereas the 190 m crns footprint contained multiple land uses diverse land uses have much different hydrological functions for example tahir et al 2016 found that rainfed cropland in our study area had more severe soil erosion and a lower moisture holding capacity than citrus land which led to a lower swc and higher temporal variability gao et al 2016 and may have accounted for the higher swc measured using crns than the five tdr sensors the measuring depth for crns also varied with the status of swc increasing with decreasing swc the depth of measurement for the tdr sensors however was only determined at installation which was independent of swc the difference in measuring depth may thus have accounted for much of the difference in performance between the two techniques especially under extremely dry and wet conditions vather et al 2018 the hydrogen in the vegetation would also likely affect the performance of crns baroni et al 2018 but not the tdr sensors which would increase the difference between the techniques the underlying surface of the southern red soil region is relatively complex but crns still performed well in determining the spatial mean swc at the hectometer scale this good performance under complex hydrological and underlying surface conditions indicated the robust applicability of the crns technique crns has great potential to bridge the gap in swc measurements between point scale monitoring and large scale satellite products in multiple environments crns would also be a useful tool for resolving the ecological issues of the red soil region such as predicting soil erosion and seasonal drought 4 conclusions the applicability of crns as a technique for acquiring information about the temporal dynamics of spatial mean swc at a hectometer scale has not been evaluated in the region of red soil in china under subtropical hydroclimatic conditions we tested the accuracy of crns under relatively complex underlying surface conditions by comparing the performances of crns and the oven drying method across the study area and tdr monitoring at the point scale we drew the following conclusions 1 the crns horizontal radius and measuring depth varied over time with means of 194 m and 19 cm respectively measuring depth was more temporally variable than the horizontal radius 2 the type of land use affected the crns signal but much less than the distance to the crns sensor the relative contribution of the flooded paddy fields covering an area 30 of the footprint to the crns signal was only 2 6 because most of the fields were more than 120 m from the sensor 3 both the timing and frequency of sampling affected the accuracy of n0 sampling in the dry season would probably provide a more accurate n0 for a region than sampling in the wet season occasional sampling in the dry season is recommended for balancing cost and efficiency 4 the crns technique could accurately estimate spatial mean swc in a heterogeneous landscapes under a subtropical monsoon climate estimation accuracy was comparable with swc measured using the oven drying method across the study area and much higher than tdr based monitoring at limited locations the crns technique was a robust tool for acquiring information about the dynamics of swc at the hectometer scale the study area was surrounded by paddy fields and we did not correct for factors of the vegetation but swc could still be estimated with high accuracy our findings are therefore of great value for expanding the

4674,the δ2h and δ18o values isotope values of porewater in soils have been used as natural tracers in many research disciplines conventional methods to determine the isotope values of porewater require extraction of water from the soil to extract soil porewater cryogenic vacuum distillation is a commonly used technique based on extraction techniques porewater can be considered to be composed of extractable and non extractable two components based on the goal of most studies porewater consists of active and inactive two components of which only the active part is of interest because different porewater components are interrelated through isotope exchange in principle the conventional distillation technique cannot extract the active porewater without changing its original isotopic composition regardless of whether recovery of the active porewater is complete or not thus using the isotope results determined on the extracted water to represent the active porewater in soil may lead to variable results here we describe a new distillation strategy for extraction of porewater for determining active porewater isotope values the extraction uses a lower extraction temperature that is comparable to natural conditions the isotope values are determined on the extracted water corresponding to different recoveries resulted from multi step extraction the final results of the active porewater can be derived indirectly from the multi step extraction this study demonstrates that in some cases the conventional one step extraction technique may not be capable for accurate determination of isotope values of the active porewater the multi step extraction technique described in this paper can be used to give more reliable results multi step extraction is similar to direct equilibration methods in that it determines the porewater component which plays an active part in the water cycle regardless of whether extraction of the porewater is complete or not multi step extraction method could provide an alternative approach to direct equilibration methods in some special cases or provide a way to test the reliability of other methods for the determination of δ2h and δ18o values of soil porewater keywords porewater extraction stable water isotopes multi step extraction 1 introduction stable water isotopes 2h 18o have been widely used in many research disciplines e g herczeg and leaney 2011 mueller et al 2014 beyer et al 2018 liu et al 2020 pan et al 2020 in soils stable water isotope compositions δ2h and δ 18o vary temporally and spatially due to many factors e g evaporation water uptake by vegetation changes in climate and land cover vegetation types and soil physicochemical properties gaj et al 2017 tan et al 2017 measurements of water δ 2h and δ 18o values thereby enable the understanding of current and historical stresses acting on soil water and have been used to investigate key factors affecting water movement in the unsaturated zone such as evaporation transpiration solute mixing and preferential flow gazis and feng 2004 vargas et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 for instance bertrand et al 2014 used stable water isotopes to differentiate the uptake of unsaturated zone water and groundwater by trees in a temperate alluvial system in switzerland zheng et al 2019 combined measurements of moisture content and stable water isotopes to investigate soil water movement and groundwater recharge in a headwater catchment of the north china plain except for direct equilibration techniques koehler et al 2000 rübel et al 2002 hendry et al 2004 2015 kelln et al 2007 wassenaar et al 2008 conventional methods to determine the stable water isotope composition of porewater require extraction of water from the soil and it is expected that the measured isotope values on the extracted porewater reflect those values of the porewater that was originally in the soil a number of porewater extraction techniques for acquiring water samples have been developed over the last a few decades for the determination of stable water isotope compositions these techniques include mechanical pressing frape and patterson 1981 suction lysimeters stewart and mcdonnell 1991 centrifugation whelan and barrow 1980 microdistillation with zinc turner and gailitis 1988 azeotropic distillation with kerosene or toluene revesz and woods 1990 and cryogenic vacuum distillation west et al 2006 quade et al 2019 of these techniques cryogenic vacuum distillation is the most commonly used approach for water extraction from unsaturated soil samples xylem plant and cell materials because it is easy to operate and works particularly well for samples with low water contents west et al 2006 altinier et al 2007 koeniger et al 2011 ignatev et al 2013 there is evidence that measurement results of porewater stable isotopes depend strongly on porewater extraction methods large discrepancies of isotope results have been reported by numerous studies between different approaches such as mechanical squeezing suction lysimeters centrifugation distillation and direct equilibration e g walker et al 1994 kelln et al 2001 figueroa johnson et al 2007 orlowski et al 2016 sprenger et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 even comparisons between the same extraction method e g cryogenic vacuum distillation showed significant discrepancies of the isotope results the general consensus is that the discrepancies are attributed to different porewater recoveries walker et al 1994 orlowski et al 2018 porewater can be categorized into different types for example a gravitational water water retained in the macropores of the soil matrix b capillary water water in fine channels or capillaries formed between soil particles c hygroscopic water physically adsorbed water on soil particle surface and d chemically bound water in the soil landon et al 1999 figueroa johnson et al 2007 each type of the water behaves differently due to different potential energy the potential energy decreases from type a to d and the difficulty to extract the water increases with decreasing potential energy hillel 2004 the proportions of type a b c and d water in soil depend on a number of factors hillel 2004 meißner et al 2014 gaj et al 2017 generally with decreasing porewater content the relative proportions of type a and b decrease while the relative proportions of type c and d increase in order to achieve the lowest potential energy hillel 2004 because each type of porewater has different potential energy the stable isotopic signature for different water types should be different depending on the difference between the bond strength of the light and heavy isotopes porewater can be classified into two types according to its mobility whether it is mobile or immobile depends on factors such as mechanical force gravity squeezing centrifugation etc physico chemical processes temperature surface tension etc and isotope exchange when cryogenic distillation is used to extract porewater the method is carried out with temperatures generally around 100 it is believed that in this way the mobile water can be extracted and extraction of immobile water can be avoided some studies have implied that to remove all the porewater depending on soil the drying temperature should be in the range of 100 300 c under vacuum conditions gardner et al 2001 mitchell and soga 2005 van de velde and bowen 2013 several studies have examined proportions of porewater removed and retained in soil samples using centrifugation cryogenic vacuum distillation azeotropic distillation and microdistillation methods the removable proportion of porewater varies depending on soil type water content extraction temperature and extraction time walker et al 1994 araguás araguás et al 1995 orlowski et al 2013 newberry et al 2017 tsuruta et al 2019 recently rao et al 2017 conducted a series experiments on porewater extraction by using cryogenic vacuum distillation method in their experiments a reference water with known δ2h and δ18o values was added to pre dried sandy soil with water contents between 5 and 20 and the added water was subsequently extracted they obtained relationships of extracted porewater isotope values vs porewater recovery under different experimental conditions with porewater recovery covering a wide range from 15 to 100 they found that at extraction temperatures lower than 105 only part of the porewater was extractable they found further that during water evaporation isotopic exchange between the vapour and remaining water in the soil matrix occurs under near equilibrium conditions furthermore the experimental data was analysed using rayleigh distillation model they found that the modelled δ 2h and δ 18o values vs porewater recoveries did not fit the experimental data when the porewater recovery was relatively high e g 80 on the other hand the modelled results provided better fit to the experimental data only if the recovery was relatively low e g 80 two questions then arise 1 because isotope values of the extracted porewater depend on porewater recovery if under different conditions different amount of porewater is extractable what will be the correct recovery for determining isotope values of the porewater 2 because there may exist inactive porewater i e porewater that does not take part in the water cycle under natural conditions e g temperatures lower than 60 is there a way to determine the isotope values of the active porewater i e porewater that takes part in the water cycle and avoid interference of the inactive porewater the objective of this paper was to try to answer these two questions 2 methods in this paper we use published data of rao et al 2017 for discussions the followings are the results published by rao et al 2017 pertinent to the discussion in this paper for experimental details and full data set refer to rao et al 2017 and the supplemental material file of their paper 2 1 materials sandy soil collected from the ordos desert china was used for the experiments the soil was composed mainly of quartz feldspar and muscovite the soil had grain sizes ranging between 100 and 250 µm rao et al 2011 the water used for the experiments had an isotopic composition of 7 94 0 2 for δ18o and 49 5 2 for δ2h respectively 2 2 preparation of wet soil samples the soil was dried in the oven at 105 c stirred occasionally until thoroughly dry 12 hr the dryness of the sand could be checked by weighing the soil repeatedly wet soil samples were prepared with different water contents and different sample sizes after hydration the vials containing wetted soil were shaken and stored at room temperature in darkness for at least two weeks before porewater extraction 2 3 extraction of porewater a vacuum extraction line with cryogenic collection of the vapor was used for extraction similar to that used by araguás araguás et al 1995 and west et al 2006 porewater samples were obtained under different conditions temperature time soil amount water content 2 4 determination of isotopic compositions analyses of stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were performed using mass spectrometer mat 253 connected with a thermal combustion elemental analyzer tc ea at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university china the analytical precisions of the mass spectrometer are 0 2 for δ18o and 2 for δ2h respectively 3 results 3 1 behaviour of isotope values in extracted porewater rao et al 2017 found that the distillation of porewater is a process in which isotopic fractionation can be described by rayleigh fractionation fig 1 fig 1 is similar to that found by orlowski et al 2018 for a silty sand with water contents between 8 and 20 an investigation of the δ2h vs δ18o relationship is important plotting on a straight line with a slope of ca 8 in the δ2h vs δ18o relationship indicates that the water vapor is produced from the same source in an equilibrium process such a process can be described by the rayleigh equation fig 1b shows for very low water amounts see empty circles in fig 1b the δ2h vs δ18o relationship shows greater uncertainties it may indicate that either the extraction device needs a minimum water amount of 1 5 g in order to obtain reliable results or the greater uncertainties are the effects of residual water that remained in the soil after dry soil preparation in this paper we use δ18o data for discussion the discussion is also applicable for δ2h data because the δ2h and δ18o values are coupled see fig 1 the percent recovery of porewater increases as the distillation time increases for given distillation time the recoveries of porewater depend on evaporation rates of porewater for the same soil the evaporation rates are functions of 1 sample size i e amount of soil 2 porewater content and 3 distillation temperature as examples fig 2 shows porewater recoveries vs distillation time for different temperatures porewater contents and sample amount associated with porewater recovery the stable isotopic compositions in extracted water change accordingly thus by defining δ δ as the difference between δ18o δ2h as well of the extracted water δextr and the added reference water δr 1 δ δ δ extr δ r δ δ will depend on the distillation temperature and time as an example fig 3 shows changes of δ δ18o with distillation time for different temperatures it can be seen in figs 2 and 3 that even if water recovery rates were close to 100 extracted isotope results differed from the reference water the isotope results were depleted in comparison to the reference water though the porewater contents were low e g 5 see fig 3b and the distillation time was prolonged the depletion was more significant if extraction temperatures were lower sample sizes were larger and soil water contents were lower fig 4 shows δ18o values of the extracted water in dependence of recovery under different conditions fig 4 also shows δ18o value of the added water δ r we use the rayleigh equation to simulate the relationship between δ 18o and recovery in the simulations it is assumed that the water in the soil is a single type i e the porewater has the same potential energy with a constant fractionation factor α moreover we assume that the distillation of porewater is under equilibrated conditions rayleigh fractionational distillation the results show that 1 the modelled initial isotopic compositions are generally lower than the added reference water the difference is greater for lower water content samples compare the two horizontal lines in fig 4 dashed and solid 2 the simulated line depends on sample size water content and temperature 3 under otherwise the same experimental conditions e g same sample amount water content the measured values show greater deviations from the calculated values at higher temperature and 4 particularly for low water content samples the experimental results with recoveries close to 100 do not fit to the simulated lines showing more enriched values see the points between the two horizontal lines in fig 4 these observations can be explained by the relative contributions of b type and c type waters first we consider the simplest case namely the soil contains only one single type of water in this case we can assume that the fractionation factor α of the porewater is a constant during the entire extraction process in the rayleigh process where the water is being removed from the pool the enrichments of heavier isotopes in the remaining water will increase exponentially with decreasing fraction of remaining water mook 2000 using parameters obtained from our experiments we calculated δ 18o value in the remaining water as a function of removed water results of our calculations are shown in fig 5 in our calculations we use α 0 992 and initial δ 18o value 7 94 fig 5 shows that the increase of δ18o value becomes more rapid towards the end of the process recovery 80 e g with water recovery increases from 90 to 99 the δ18o value of the remaining pool increases from 10 50 to 29 29 and from 99 to 99 99 the δ18ovalue increases further to 67 92 table 1 contains calculated average δ 18o values of porewater removed from soil by the rayleigh process corresponding to different recovery intervals fractions the calculations are based on data shown in fig 5 α 0 992 δ 18oi 7 94 as shown in table 1 while the δ 18o value of the first extracted 10 fraction is 14 64 the last fractions contain much more 18o in the above discussion we assume that there is only one type of porewater however there is a consensus that not all of the water in the soil can be removed during vacuum extraction and the enriched residual water in the soil can influence isotopic composition of the extracted porewater e g araguás araguás et al 1995 newberry et al 2017 thielemann et al 2019 thus the reference water after added to the dry soil can be regarded as a two component system consisting of two water pools with different isotopic compositions the δ18o δ2h values of the initial porewater can be represented by the relationship 2 δ i δ b f b δ c f c where δi δb and δc represent isotopic composition of the initial porewater type b and c porewater respectively fb and fc are fractions of type b and c porewater respectively combining fb 1 fc with eq 2 3 δ i δ b 1 f c δ c f c during distillation of the porewater some c type water may be co extracted with b type water for incomplete extraction of the porewater eq 3 becomes 4 δ extr δ b 1 f c δ c f c where δ extr δ b δ c are δ18o δ2h values of total extracted water b type and c type water in the extract fc is fraction of extracted c type water at the early stage of extraction the extracted water is dominated by b type water because the value of fc is relatively small i e 1 fc 1 and δc fc 0 eq 4 becomes 5 δ extr δ b approaching the end of extraction when the recovery approaching 100 the b type water in the residual water can be neglected i e fc 1 for the water that remains in the soil further extraction will cause c type water to be dominant in the extracted water for the last a few percent of porewater eq 4 becomes 6 δ extr δ c this last a few percent of water is highly enriched in 2h and 18o δ c δ b as shown by simulations mook 2000 the enrichments of heavier isotopes in the remaining water increase exponentially with decreasing fraction of remaining water therefore addition of the last a few percent of extracted water will cause the total δ18o δ2h values increase significantly see fig 4 the points between 90 and 100 recovery because for definite soil amount the total soil surface area is a constant the soil should contain a constant amount of c type water consequently the higher the porewater content the smaller the fc from eq 2 δ b becomes more dominant than δ c with higher water contents that is the modelled line depends on porewater contents fig 4 shows the c type water has more effect on soils with lower water contents as indicated by the values plotted above the solid line which are from samples extracted at 105 eq 2 represents the weighted average value of the active porewater it takes into account the relative importance activity of the two types of porewater the activity of a type of water depends on temperature soil characteristics etc at sufficiently low temperature eq 2 reduces to δi δbfb the fact that δ 18oi δ 18or indicates the existence of different types of soil water 3 2 multi step extraction method in quantitative analysis the accuracy of the determined results of the analyte e g quantity concentration may be affected by many factors two of these factors are 1 loss of analyte during manipulation of the sample prior to measurements such as adsorption of the analyte on the surface of glass or plastic ware that are used during sample preparation or incomplete extraction of the analyte from the matrix and 2 gain of analyte during manipulation of the sample prior to measurements such as sample contamination memory effect for this reason relative instead of absolute measurements are widely used ways to avoid inaccurate results the method used in this paper to determine the isotope values of porewater is analogous to the problem as illustrated in fig 6 as illustrated in fig 6 assuming that two liquid phases oil and water are contained in a vessel both contain dissolved salt and the salt is more concentrated in water phase than in oil as illustrated by darker color the two liquid phases do not exchange salt under normal conditions assuming that the salt in oil is not homogeneous i e the salt concentration decreases gradually with decreasing oil depth as illustrated by decreasing darkness of the color question to determine the average salt concentration in the total oil if liquid extraction pumping out and determination of the average salt concentration in the extracted liquid is the only way how to determine the average salt concentration that is dissolved in the oil phase apparently if extraction of oil is incomplete the determined salt concentration of the extracted oil will be different from the real value with increasing recovery of oil the determined salt concentration on the extracted oil will be closer to the real value however it is difficult to pump out all the oil without touching the water increasing pumping depth will cause increasing turbulence in the oil water boundary layer causing mixing of oil with water pumping out not only all the oil but also some water will cause the determined salt concentration to be higher than the real value because the water phase contains much more salt compare the darkness of the two liquid phases now instead of pumping out the oil in a single step let us pump out the oil to different depths and determine the average salt concentration related to the oil depth from the oil surface e g from depth between 0 and 10 m the determined average salt concentration 1 0 g ml from depth between 0 and 15 m the determined average salt concentration 1 5 g ml of course it is not necessary to be a linear relationship in this way we can obtain a relationship between average salt concentration and oil depth based on this relationship we can extrapolate the depth from the oil surface to the water oil boundary and obtain the average salt concentration of all the oil this method requires that the depth of the oil phase is known in a somewhat analogous way the water after being added to the soil is changed into extractable and non extractable two components fig 7 the existence of non extractable component e g adsorption of c type water on sand mineral surfaces will reduce porewater recovery under conditions used by the conventional extraction techniques araguás araguás et al 1995 rao et al 2017 newberry et al 2017 leading to apparently depleted heavier isotopes in recovered porewater even if 100 recovery of the porewater can be experimentally achieved e g by using a higher temperature see the points in fig 4 between the two horizontal lines extraction of the total porewater is not desired because some of the porewater may not be active i e it does not play an active part in the water cycle like the situation illustrated in fig 6 it is practically impossible to determine the isotope values of the active porewater by using the conventional one step extraction methods for this reason we propose to use the multi step extraction method to determine porewater isotope values with the multi step extraction method the porewater δ 18o δ 2h value can be obtained by fitting the measured data using the rayleigh model fig 4 in order to avoid extracting inactive water the extraction temperature should be lower e g 60 c besides by fitting the measured data those values which are close to 100 recovery should be avoided 4 discussions 4 1 why one step extraction methods may not be suitable for accurate determination of porewater isotope values the δ2h and δ18o values of porewater in soil are commonly determined on water obtained by extraction techniques numerous studies have shown that extraction conditions temperature time and vacuum along with soil properties may affect extracted soil water isotope results porewater in soil can be categorized into different types with different potential energy although having different potential energy the different water types may not be distinct from each other i e there is a transition between different water types for example with decreasing soil pore size it becomes more and more difficult for gravitational porewater to drain and gradually the gravitational water transitions to capillary water similarly water can be easily extracted from capillary pores with a relatively larger size with decreasing pore size it becomes more and more difficult to extract water from capillary pores under otherwise the same extraction conditions because different extraction techniques extract different fractions of porewater associated with different isotopic compositions comparisons between different extraction techniques often result in inconsistent results in isotope values even comparisons between the same extraction method showed significant discrepancies of the isotope results see e g walker et al 1994 orlowski et al 2016 orlowski et al 2018 for mechanical separation techniques which do not involve phase change the difference in porewater recovery may also cause inconsistent results in isotope values for example weaker centrifugation force may extract capillary water that exists in larger soil pores while stronger centrifugation force could extract more water that exists in smaller soil pores brenot et al 2015 utilized stable isotope characterization in an experimental field and demonstrated that porewater samples collected by porous cup samplers and drainage samplers are not equivalent and correspond to different water dynamics in soils with different residence time recently gaj and mcdonnell 2019 showed that soil particle size has effects on fractionation between soil water and water vapor if porewater δ 2h and δ 18o values are determined on water obtained by extraction techniques depending on extraction conditions and soil characteristics different water recoveries may be achieved roughly we can consider the porewater to be composed of two parts with one part that can be extracted and the other part that cannot be extracted whether the water is extractable or not depends on extraction conditions and soil characteristics one of the objectives to extract porewater in many research disciplines is to determine the isotope values of the part of porewater that is active i e porewater that takes part in the water cycle regardless of the types that is whether it exists in capillaries or adsorbed on grain surfaces etc it is difficult to distinguish between the part of water which is active in processes involved in the water cycle from that part of water which is not active simply by whether it is extractable or non extractable in fact all types of porewater would be extractable depending on conditions for example higher temperatures could cause a release of porewater that is not involved in the water cycle and or not available by plants e g water by oxidation of organics and dihydroxylation of hydroxide containing minerals on the other hand though some water types cannot be extracted e g due to low temperature or too short extraction time they still can be an active part in the water cycle for example porewater existing in capillary pores or adsorbed on soil grain surface may be plant available though part of the water is non extractable the situation is illustrated in fig 7 the conventional methods use a one step distillation to extract the porewater the isotope values of the extracted water are determined on the extracted water and the values are taken to represent the final results clearly the conventional one step extraction technique may not be suitable to achieve the objective mentioned above because the extractable part of porewater varies depending not only on extraction conditions but also on soil characteristics therefore it is not possible to standardize porewater extraction conditions fig 5 and table 1 show that a small fraction of residual water may have a non negligible contribution to the final results fig 7 shows that even if the active water can be recovered completely i e 100 recovery some heavier isotopes could remain in the inactive porewater after extraction because extreme conditions during extraction may cause isotope exchange between different isotope pools and thus the extracted water cannot represent the part of active porewater that was originally in the soil thielemann et al 2019 show that different water pools may exchange isotopes leading to a different water isotopic composition even upon complete extraction of the water from soil 4 2 the multi step extraction technique in general the higher the recovery of porewater the more sensitive the determined isotope values to the recovery cf fig 4 this is because with increasing recovery more and more water could be extracted that is highly enriched in heavier isotopes fig 5 and table 1 there is no strict distinction between extractable and non extractable porewater for this reason the determined porewater isotope values vary depending on extraction conditions using multi step extraction from the extracted vapor the isotope values of the active porewater can be derived based on the fractionation law regardless of whether the active porewater is extractable or not the inactive part of porewater does not appear in the equilibration process because it cannot exchange isotopes with its external environment fig 7 the multi step extraction method measures the isotope values vs recovery of the water vapor that is removed from the porewater it does not extract all the soil water the method considers the porewater as a single mass which is in equilibrium with the vapor and it does not care what porewater types the water mass may consist of fig 7 with this method the isotope values of the unknown porewater as a whole can be derived from the law of isotope fractionation regardless of the completeness of the extraction the isotope values of the porewater derived in this way reflect the part of water in the soil that is active under normal environmental conditions e g temperatures 60 c and excludes the part of porewater that is inactive but may become active under certain laboratory conditions thus this method may provide more reliable information about the active water part using the multi step method each sample must be treated prior to extraction to determine the water content and then each sample must be extracted many times in order to obtain water samples corresponding to different recoveries therefore the method may only be practical in some special cases e g where cryogenic distillation is the only method available for accurately determining the isotope values of the porewater and the soil contains non negligible fraction of water that is inactive under normal environmental conditions but may become active under laboratory conditions in those cases considering the possible misleading interpretation of the measurement results see e g orlowski et al 2018 the extra laboratory work should eventually pay off 4 3 the alternative techniques for determining porewater isotope values the principle of the multi step extraction method is conceptually similar to that of the direct equilibration method koehler et al 2000 rübel et al 2002 wassenaar et al 2008 hendry et al 2015 by measuring the gas water vapor h2 co2 or water which was in isotope equilibrium with the porewater the porewater isotope values can be derived based on the law of isotope fractionation similar to the multi step extraction method the direct equilibration method considers porewater as one single water pool which can exchange isotopes with its external environment under temperature conditions comparable to those in the nature the direct equilibration technique provides an important and cost effective improvement over the conventional one step extraction methods though the multi step extraction method described in this paper could give basically more reliable isotope results it is clearly not cost effective thus for routine analyses it is recommended to use direct equilibration methods whenever possible unless in some cases where the multi step extraction offers larger gains 5 conclusions the commonly used approaches for determining δ2h and δ18o values of porewater are based on one step extraction of porewater and determination of isotope values on the extracted porewater the determined results from the extracted porewater are taken to represent the isotope values of the porewater that was originally in the soil in many cases the one step distillation technique may not be suitable for accurate determination of porewater isotope values because of two facts 1 the temperature used for porewater extraction is too high compared to natural conditions and 2 no standard extraction conditions exist e g sample dependent extraction temperature and time in the first case the part of porewater which is inactive under natural conditions might be activated and thus affect the results in the second case the results may be different depending on laboratory conditions this paper uses a new extraction strategy for extracting porewater for the determination of isotope values of the active porewater compared to the conventional one step extraction technique which uses relatively higher temperatures this approach uses a much lower distillation temperature that is similar to those governing the processes involved in the water cycle 60 c thus it may avoid extreme conditions and minimize interference to the porewater system e g isotope exchange between inactive and active porewater using the multi step extraction approach the δ 2h and δ 18o values of the porewater are derived by extrapolating the measured values this approach thus may avoid under or over estimation of the isotope values of the active porewater though the multiple step extraction technique described in this paper can be used to give more reliable results this method will increase the cost for determining porewater 2h and 18o compositions it may be unrealistic to expect a laboratory to be able to handle large number of soil samples by using this method in routine analyses in recent years automated high precision measurement techniques for determining porewater δ2h and δ18o values have been developed these techniques are based on direct equilibration and provide an important and cost effective improvement over conventional one step extraction methods although not cost effective the method described in this paper may be used in some special cases e g for situations where the measurement accuracy is a top priority the pore water consists of non negligible fraction of water that is not active under normal conditions but may be extracted under laboratory conditions and sufficient water can be obtained from the soil to provide an alternative approach to the direct equilibration methods or provide a possibility to test the reliability of other methods for the determination of δ 2h and δ18o values of porewater for simplicity the discussion in this paper used data obtained on sandy soil planning of more experimental studies are being made for other soil types such as soil that is rich in clay minerals and or substances of organic origin and the special soil type from loess plateau northwest china in addition a comparison between the multi step extraction method and the direct equilibration method may provide more understanding related to porewater isotope value determination credit authorship contribution statement sanyuan jiang conceptualization methodology writing original draft wenbo

4674,the δ2h and δ18o values isotope values of porewater in soils have been used as natural tracers in many research disciplines conventional methods to determine the isotope values of porewater require extraction of water from the soil to extract soil porewater cryogenic vacuum distillation is a commonly used technique based on extraction techniques porewater can be considered to be composed of extractable and non extractable two components based on the goal of most studies porewater consists of active and inactive two components of which only the active part is of interest because different porewater components are interrelated through isotope exchange in principle the conventional distillation technique cannot extract the active porewater without changing its original isotopic composition regardless of whether recovery of the active porewater is complete or not thus using the isotope results determined on the extracted water to represent the active porewater in soil may lead to variable results here we describe a new distillation strategy for extraction of porewater for determining active porewater isotope values the extraction uses a lower extraction temperature that is comparable to natural conditions the isotope values are determined on the extracted water corresponding to different recoveries resulted from multi step extraction the final results of the active porewater can be derived indirectly from the multi step extraction this study demonstrates that in some cases the conventional one step extraction technique may not be capable for accurate determination of isotope values of the active porewater the multi step extraction technique described in this paper can be used to give more reliable results multi step extraction is similar to direct equilibration methods in that it determines the porewater component which plays an active part in the water cycle regardless of whether extraction of the porewater is complete or not multi step extraction method could provide an alternative approach to direct equilibration methods in some special cases or provide a way to test the reliability of other methods for the determination of δ2h and δ18o values of soil porewater keywords porewater extraction stable water isotopes multi step extraction 1 introduction stable water isotopes 2h 18o have been widely used in many research disciplines e g herczeg and leaney 2011 mueller et al 2014 beyer et al 2018 liu et al 2020 pan et al 2020 in soils stable water isotope compositions δ2h and δ 18o vary temporally and spatially due to many factors e g evaporation water uptake by vegetation changes in climate and land cover vegetation types and soil physicochemical properties gaj et al 2017 tan et al 2017 measurements of water δ 2h and δ 18o values thereby enable the understanding of current and historical stresses acting on soil water and have been used to investigate key factors affecting water movement in the unsaturated zone such as evaporation transpiration solute mixing and preferential flow gazis and feng 2004 vargas et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 for instance bertrand et al 2014 used stable water isotopes to differentiate the uptake of unsaturated zone water and groundwater by trees in a temperate alluvial system in switzerland zheng et al 2019 combined measurements of moisture content and stable water isotopes to investigate soil water movement and groundwater recharge in a headwater catchment of the north china plain except for direct equilibration techniques koehler et al 2000 rübel et al 2002 hendry et al 2004 2015 kelln et al 2007 wassenaar et al 2008 conventional methods to determine the stable water isotope composition of porewater require extraction of water from the soil and it is expected that the measured isotope values on the extracted porewater reflect those values of the porewater that was originally in the soil a number of porewater extraction techniques for acquiring water samples have been developed over the last a few decades for the determination of stable water isotope compositions these techniques include mechanical pressing frape and patterson 1981 suction lysimeters stewart and mcdonnell 1991 centrifugation whelan and barrow 1980 microdistillation with zinc turner and gailitis 1988 azeotropic distillation with kerosene or toluene revesz and woods 1990 and cryogenic vacuum distillation west et al 2006 quade et al 2019 of these techniques cryogenic vacuum distillation is the most commonly used approach for water extraction from unsaturated soil samples xylem plant and cell materials because it is easy to operate and works particularly well for samples with low water contents west et al 2006 altinier et al 2007 koeniger et al 2011 ignatev et al 2013 there is evidence that measurement results of porewater stable isotopes depend strongly on porewater extraction methods large discrepancies of isotope results have been reported by numerous studies between different approaches such as mechanical squeezing suction lysimeters centrifugation distillation and direct equilibration e g walker et al 1994 kelln et al 2001 figueroa johnson et al 2007 orlowski et al 2016 sprenger et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 even comparisons between the same extraction method e g cryogenic vacuum distillation showed significant discrepancies of the isotope results the general consensus is that the discrepancies are attributed to different porewater recoveries walker et al 1994 orlowski et al 2018 porewater can be categorized into different types for example a gravitational water water retained in the macropores of the soil matrix b capillary water water in fine channels or capillaries formed between soil particles c hygroscopic water physically adsorbed water on soil particle surface and d chemically bound water in the soil landon et al 1999 figueroa johnson et al 2007 each type of the water behaves differently due to different potential energy the potential energy decreases from type a to d and the difficulty to extract the water increases with decreasing potential energy hillel 2004 the proportions of type a b c and d water in soil depend on a number of factors hillel 2004 meißner et al 2014 gaj et al 2017 generally with decreasing porewater content the relative proportions of type a and b decrease while the relative proportions of type c and d increase in order to achieve the lowest potential energy hillel 2004 because each type of porewater has different potential energy the stable isotopic signature for different water types should be different depending on the difference between the bond strength of the light and heavy isotopes porewater can be classified into two types according to its mobility whether it is mobile or immobile depends on factors such as mechanical force gravity squeezing centrifugation etc physico chemical processes temperature surface tension etc and isotope exchange when cryogenic distillation is used to extract porewater the method is carried out with temperatures generally around 100 it is believed that in this way the mobile water can be extracted and extraction of immobile water can be avoided some studies have implied that to remove all the porewater depending on soil the drying temperature should be in the range of 100 300 c under vacuum conditions gardner et al 2001 mitchell and soga 2005 van de velde and bowen 2013 several studies have examined proportions of porewater removed and retained in soil samples using centrifugation cryogenic vacuum distillation azeotropic distillation and microdistillation methods the removable proportion of porewater varies depending on soil type water content extraction temperature and extraction time walker et al 1994 araguás araguás et al 1995 orlowski et al 2013 newberry et al 2017 tsuruta et al 2019 recently rao et al 2017 conducted a series experiments on porewater extraction by using cryogenic vacuum distillation method in their experiments a reference water with known δ2h and δ18o values was added to pre dried sandy soil with water contents between 5 and 20 and the added water was subsequently extracted they obtained relationships of extracted porewater isotope values vs porewater recovery under different experimental conditions with porewater recovery covering a wide range from 15 to 100 they found that at extraction temperatures lower than 105 only part of the porewater was extractable they found further that during water evaporation isotopic exchange between the vapour and remaining water in the soil matrix occurs under near equilibrium conditions furthermore the experimental data was analysed using rayleigh distillation model they found that the modelled δ 2h and δ 18o values vs porewater recoveries did not fit the experimental data when the porewater recovery was relatively high e g 80 on the other hand the modelled results provided better fit to the experimental data only if the recovery was relatively low e g 80 two questions then arise 1 because isotope values of the extracted porewater depend on porewater recovery if under different conditions different amount of porewater is extractable what will be the correct recovery for determining isotope values of the porewater 2 because there may exist inactive porewater i e porewater that does not take part in the water cycle under natural conditions e g temperatures lower than 60 is there a way to determine the isotope values of the active porewater i e porewater that takes part in the water cycle and avoid interference of the inactive porewater the objective of this paper was to try to answer these two questions 2 methods in this paper we use published data of rao et al 2017 for discussions the followings are the results published by rao et al 2017 pertinent to the discussion in this paper for experimental details and full data set refer to rao et al 2017 and the supplemental material file of their paper 2 1 materials sandy soil collected from the ordos desert china was used for the experiments the soil was composed mainly of quartz feldspar and muscovite the soil had grain sizes ranging between 100 and 250 µm rao et al 2011 the water used for the experiments had an isotopic composition of 7 94 0 2 for δ18o and 49 5 2 for δ2h respectively 2 2 preparation of wet soil samples the soil was dried in the oven at 105 c stirred occasionally until thoroughly dry 12 hr the dryness of the sand could be checked by weighing the soil repeatedly wet soil samples were prepared with different water contents and different sample sizes after hydration the vials containing wetted soil were shaken and stored at room temperature in darkness for at least two weeks before porewater extraction 2 3 extraction of porewater a vacuum extraction line with cryogenic collection of the vapor was used for extraction similar to that used by araguás araguás et al 1995 and west et al 2006 porewater samples were obtained under different conditions temperature time soil amount water content 2 4 determination of isotopic compositions analyses of stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were performed using mass spectrometer mat 253 connected with a thermal combustion elemental analyzer tc ea at the state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering hohai university china the analytical precisions of the mass spectrometer are 0 2 for δ18o and 2 for δ2h respectively 3 results 3 1 behaviour of isotope values in extracted porewater rao et al 2017 found that the distillation of porewater is a process in which isotopic fractionation can be described by rayleigh fractionation fig 1 fig 1 is similar to that found by orlowski et al 2018 for a silty sand with water contents between 8 and 20 an investigation of the δ2h vs δ18o relationship is important plotting on a straight line with a slope of ca 8 in the δ2h vs δ18o relationship indicates that the water vapor is produced from the same source in an equilibrium process such a process can be described by the rayleigh equation fig 1b shows for very low water amounts see empty circles in fig 1b the δ2h vs δ18o relationship shows greater uncertainties it may indicate that either the extraction device needs a minimum water amount of 1 5 g in order to obtain reliable results or the greater uncertainties are the effects of residual water that remained in the soil after dry soil preparation in this paper we use δ18o data for discussion the discussion is also applicable for δ2h data because the δ2h and δ18o values are coupled see fig 1 the percent recovery of porewater increases as the distillation time increases for given distillation time the recoveries of porewater depend on evaporation rates of porewater for the same soil the evaporation rates are functions of 1 sample size i e amount of soil 2 porewater content and 3 distillation temperature as examples fig 2 shows porewater recoveries vs distillation time for different temperatures porewater contents and sample amount associated with porewater recovery the stable isotopic compositions in extracted water change accordingly thus by defining δ δ as the difference between δ18o δ2h as well of the extracted water δextr and the added reference water δr 1 δ δ δ extr δ r δ δ will depend on the distillation temperature and time as an example fig 3 shows changes of δ δ18o with distillation time for different temperatures it can be seen in figs 2 and 3 that even if water recovery rates were close to 100 extracted isotope results differed from the reference water the isotope results were depleted in comparison to the reference water though the porewater contents were low e g 5 see fig 3b and the distillation time was prolonged the depletion was more significant if extraction temperatures were lower sample sizes were larger and soil water contents were lower fig 4 shows δ18o values of the extracted water in dependence of recovery under different conditions fig 4 also shows δ18o value of the added water δ r we use the rayleigh equation to simulate the relationship between δ 18o and recovery in the simulations it is assumed that the water in the soil is a single type i e the porewater has the same potential energy with a constant fractionation factor α moreover we assume that the distillation of porewater is under equilibrated conditions rayleigh fractionational distillation the results show that 1 the modelled initial isotopic compositions are generally lower than the added reference water the difference is greater for lower water content samples compare the two horizontal lines in fig 4 dashed and solid 2 the simulated line depends on sample size water content and temperature 3 under otherwise the same experimental conditions e g same sample amount water content the measured values show greater deviations from the calculated values at higher temperature and 4 particularly for low water content samples the experimental results with recoveries close to 100 do not fit to the simulated lines showing more enriched values see the points between the two horizontal lines in fig 4 these observations can be explained by the relative contributions of b type and c type waters first we consider the simplest case namely the soil contains only one single type of water in this case we can assume that the fractionation factor α of the porewater is a constant during the entire extraction process in the rayleigh process where the water is being removed from the pool the enrichments of heavier isotopes in the remaining water will increase exponentially with decreasing fraction of remaining water mook 2000 using parameters obtained from our experiments we calculated δ 18o value in the remaining water as a function of removed water results of our calculations are shown in fig 5 in our calculations we use α 0 992 and initial δ 18o value 7 94 fig 5 shows that the increase of δ18o value becomes more rapid towards the end of the process recovery 80 e g with water recovery increases from 90 to 99 the δ18o value of the remaining pool increases from 10 50 to 29 29 and from 99 to 99 99 the δ18ovalue increases further to 67 92 table 1 contains calculated average δ 18o values of porewater removed from soil by the rayleigh process corresponding to different recovery intervals fractions the calculations are based on data shown in fig 5 α 0 992 δ 18oi 7 94 as shown in table 1 while the δ 18o value of the first extracted 10 fraction is 14 64 the last fractions contain much more 18o in the above discussion we assume that there is only one type of porewater however there is a consensus that not all of the water in the soil can be removed during vacuum extraction and the enriched residual water in the soil can influence isotopic composition of the extracted porewater e g araguás araguás et al 1995 newberry et al 2017 thielemann et al 2019 thus the reference water after added to the dry soil can be regarded as a two component system consisting of two water pools with different isotopic compositions the δ18o δ2h values of the initial porewater can be represented by the relationship 2 δ i δ b f b δ c f c where δi δb and δc represent isotopic composition of the initial porewater type b and c porewater respectively fb and fc are fractions of type b and c porewater respectively combining fb 1 fc with eq 2 3 δ i δ b 1 f c δ c f c during distillation of the porewater some c type water may be co extracted with b type water for incomplete extraction of the porewater eq 3 becomes 4 δ extr δ b 1 f c δ c f c where δ extr δ b δ c are δ18o δ2h values of total extracted water b type and c type water in the extract fc is fraction of extracted c type water at the early stage of extraction the extracted water is dominated by b type water because the value of fc is relatively small i e 1 fc 1 and δc fc 0 eq 4 becomes 5 δ extr δ b approaching the end of extraction when the recovery approaching 100 the b type water in the residual water can be neglected i e fc 1 for the water that remains in the soil further extraction will cause c type water to be dominant in the extracted water for the last a few percent of porewater eq 4 becomes 6 δ extr δ c this last a few percent of water is highly enriched in 2h and 18o δ c δ b as shown by simulations mook 2000 the enrichments of heavier isotopes in the remaining water increase exponentially with decreasing fraction of remaining water therefore addition of the last a few percent of extracted water will cause the total δ18o δ2h values increase significantly see fig 4 the points between 90 and 100 recovery because for definite soil amount the total soil surface area is a constant the soil should contain a constant amount of c type water consequently the higher the porewater content the smaller the fc from eq 2 δ b becomes more dominant than δ c with higher water contents that is the modelled line depends on porewater contents fig 4 shows the c type water has more effect on soils with lower water contents as indicated by the values plotted above the solid line which are from samples extracted at 105 eq 2 represents the weighted average value of the active porewater it takes into account the relative importance activity of the two types of porewater the activity of a type of water depends on temperature soil characteristics etc at sufficiently low temperature eq 2 reduces to δi δbfb the fact that δ 18oi δ 18or indicates the existence of different types of soil water 3 2 multi step extraction method in quantitative analysis the accuracy of the determined results of the analyte e g quantity concentration may be affected by many factors two of these factors are 1 loss of analyte during manipulation of the sample prior to measurements such as adsorption of the analyte on the surface of glass or plastic ware that are used during sample preparation or incomplete extraction of the analyte from the matrix and 2 gain of analyte during manipulation of the sample prior to measurements such as sample contamination memory effect for this reason relative instead of absolute measurements are widely used ways to avoid inaccurate results the method used in this paper to determine the isotope values of porewater is analogous to the problem as illustrated in fig 6 as illustrated in fig 6 assuming that two liquid phases oil and water are contained in a vessel both contain dissolved salt and the salt is more concentrated in water phase than in oil as illustrated by darker color the two liquid phases do not exchange salt under normal conditions assuming that the salt in oil is not homogeneous i e the salt concentration decreases gradually with decreasing oil depth as illustrated by decreasing darkness of the color question to determine the average salt concentration in the total oil if liquid extraction pumping out and determination of the average salt concentration in the extracted liquid is the only way how to determine the average salt concentration that is dissolved in the oil phase apparently if extraction of oil is incomplete the determined salt concentration of the extracted oil will be different from the real value with increasing recovery of oil the determined salt concentration on the extracted oil will be closer to the real value however it is difficult to pump out all the oil without touching the water increasing pumping depth will cause increasing turbulence in the oil water boundary layer causing mixing of oil with water pumping out not only all the oil but also some water will cause the determined salt concentration to be higher than the real value because the water phase contains much more salt compare the darkness of the two liquid phases now instead of pumping out the oil in a single step let us pump out the oil to different depths and determine the average salt concentration related to the oil depth from the oil surface e g from depth between 0 and 10 m the determined average salt concentration 1 0 g ml from depth between 0 and 15 m the determined average salt concentration 1 5 g ml of course it is not necessary to be a linear relationship in this way we can obtain a relationship between average salt concentration and oil depth based on this relationship we can extrapolate the depth from the oil surface to the water oil boundary and obtain the average salt concentration of all the oil this method requires that the depth of the oil phase is known in a somewhat analogous way the water after being added to the soil is changed into extractable and non extractable two components fig 7 the existence of non extractable component e g adsorption of c type water on sand mineral surfaces will reduce porewater recovery under conditions used by the conventional extraction techniques araguás araguás et al 1995 rao et al 2017 newberry et al 2017 leading to apparently depleted heavier isotopes in recovered porewater even if 100 recovery of the porewater can be experimentally achieved e g by using a higher temperature see the points in fig 4 between the two horizontal lines extraction of the total porewater is not desired because some of the porewater may not be active i e it does not play an active part in the water cycle like the situation illustrated in fig 6 it is practically impossible to determine the isotope values of the active porewater by using the conventional one step extraction methods for this reason we propose to use the multi step extraction method to determine porewater isotope values with the multi step extraction method the porewater δ 18o δ 2h value can be obtained by fitting the measured data using the rayleigh model fig 4 in order to avoid extracting inactive water the extraction temperature should be lower e g 60 c besides by fitting the measured data those values which are close to 100 recovery should be avoided 4 discussions 4 1 why one step extraction methods may not be suitable for accurate determination of porewater isotope values the δ2h and δ18o values of porewater in soil are commonly determined on water obtained by extraction techniques numerous studies have shown that extraction conditions temperature time and vacuum along with soil properties may affect extracted soil water isotope results porewater in soil can be categorized into different types with different potential energy although having different potential energy the different water types may not be distinct from each other i e there is a transition between different water types for example with decreasing soil pore size it becomes more and more difficult for gravitational porewater to drain and gradually the gravitational water transitions to capillary water similarly water can be easily extracted from capillary pores with a relatively larger size with decreasing pore size it becomes more and more difficult to extract water from capillary pores under otherwise the same extraction conditions because different extraction techniques extract different fractions of porewater associated with different isotopic compositions comparisons between different extraction techniques often result in inconsistent results in isotope values even comparisons between the same extraction method showed significant discrepancies of the isotope results see e g walker et al 1994 orlowski et al 2016 orlowski et al 2018 for mechanical separation techniques which do not involve phase change the difference in porewater recovery may also cause inconsistent results in isotope values for example weaker centrifugation force may extract capillary water that exists in larger soil pores while stronger centrifugation force could extract more water that exists in smaller soil pores brenot et al 2015 utilized stable isotope characterization in an experimental field and demonstrated that porewater samples collected by porous cup samplers and drainage samplers are not equivalent and correspond to different water dynamics in soils with different residence time recently gaj and mcdonnell 2019 showed that soil particle size has effects on fractionation between soil water and water vapor if porewater δ 2h and δ 18o values are determined on water obtained by extraction techniques depending on extraction conditions and soil characteristics different water recoveries may be achieved roughly we can consider the porewater to be composed of two parts with one part that can be extracted and the other part that cannot be extracted whether the water is extractable or not depends on extraction conditions and soil characteristics one of the objectives to extract porewater in many research disciplines is to determine the isotope values of the part of porewater that is active i e porewater that takes part in the water cycle regardless of the types that is whether it exists in capillaries or adsorbed on grain surfaces etc it is difficult to distinguish between the part of water which is active in processes involved in the water cycle from that part of water which is not active simply by whether it is extractable or non extractable in fact all types of porewater would be extractable depending on conditions for example higher temperatures could cause a release of porewater that is not involved in the water cycle and or not available by plants e g water by oxidation of organics and dihydroxylation of hydroxide containing minerals on the other hand though some water types cannot be extracted e g due to low temperature or too short extraction time they still can be an active part in the water cycle for example porewater existing in capillary pores or adsorbed on soil grain surface may be plant available though part of the water is non extractable the situation is illustrated in fig 7 the conventional methods use a one step distillation to extract the porewater the isotope values of the extracted water are determined on the extracted water and the values are taken to represent the final results clearly the conventional one step extraction technique may not be suitable to achieve the objective mentioned above because the extractable part of porewater varies depending not only on extraction conditions but also on soil characteristics therefore it is not possible to standardize porewater extraction conditions fig 5 and table 1 show that a small fraction of residual water may have a non negligible contribution to the final results fig 7 shows that even if the active water can be recovered completely i e 100 recovery some heavier isotopes could remain in the inactive porewater after extraction because extreme conditions during extraction may cause isotope exchange between different isotope pools and thus the extracted water cannot represent the part of active porewater that was originally in the soil thielemann et al 2019 show that different water pools may exchange isotopes leading to a different water isotopic composition even upon complete extraction of the water from soil 4 2 the multi step extraction technique in general the higher the recovery of porewater the more sensitive the determined isotope values to the recovery cf fig 4 this is because with increasing recovery more and more water could be extracted that is highly enriched in heavier isotopes fig 5 and table 1 there is no strict distinction between extractable and non extractable porewater for this reason the determined porewater isotope values vary depending on extraction conditions using multi step extraction from the extracted vapor the isotope values of the active porewater can be derived based on the fractionation law regardless of whether the active porewater is extractable or not the inactive part of porewater does not appear in the equilibration process because it cannot exchange isotopes with its external environment fig 7 the multi step extraction method measures the isotope values vs recovery of the water vapor that is removed from the porewater it does not extract all the soil water the method considers the porewater as a single mass which is in equilibrium with the vapor and it does not care what porewater types the water mass may consist of fig 7 with this method the isotope values of the unknown porewater as a whole can be derived from the law of isotope fractionation regardless of the completeness of the extraction the isotope values of the porewater derived in this way reflect the part of water in the soil that is active under normal environmental conditions e g temperatures 60 c and excludes the part of porewater that is inactive but may become active under certain laboratory conditions thus this method may provide more reliable information about the active water part using the multi step method each sample must be treated prior to extraction to determine the water content and then each sample must be extracted many times in order to obtain water samples corresponding to different recoveries therefore the method may only be practical in some special cases e g where cryogenic distillation is the only method available for accurately determining the isotope values of the porewater and the soil contains non negligible fraction of water that is inactive under normal environmental conditions but may become active under laboratory conditions in those cases considering the possible misleading interpretation of the measurement results see e g orlowski et al 2018 the extra laboratory work should eventually pay off 4 3 the alternative techniques for determining porewater isotope values the principle of the multi step extraction method is conceptually similar to that of the direct equilibration method koehler et al 2000 rübel et al 2002 wassenaar et al 2008 hendry et al 2015 by measuring the gas water vapor h2 co2 or water which was in isotope equilibrium with the porewater the porewater isotope values can be derived based on the law of isotope fractionation similar to the multi step extraction method the direct equilibration method considers porewater as one single water pool which can exchange isotopes with its external environment under temperature conditions comparable to those in the nature the direct equilibration technique provides an important and cost effective improvement over the conventional one step extraction methods though the multi step extraction method described in this paper could give basically more reliable isotope results it is clearly not cost effective thus for routine analyses it is recommended to use direct equilibration methods whenever possible unless in some cases where the multi step extraction offers larger gains 5 conclusions the commonly used approaches for determining δ2h and δ18o values of porewater are based on one step extraction of porewater and determination of isotope values on the extracted porewater the determined results from the extracted porewater are taken to represent the isotope values of the porewater that was originally in the soil in many cases the one step distillation technique may not be suitable for accurate determination of porewater isotope values because of two facts 1 the temperature used for porewater extraction is too high compared to natural conditions and 2 no standard extraction conditions exist e g sample dependent extraction temperature and time in the first case the part of porewater which is inactive under natural conditions might be activated and thus affect the results in the second case the results may be different depending on laboratory conditions this paper uses a new extraction strategy for extracting porewater for the determination of isotope values of the active porewater compared to the conventional one step extraction technique which uses relatively higher temperatures this approach uses a much lower distillation temperature that is similar to those governing the processes involved in the water cycle 60 c thus it may avoid extreme conditions and minimize interference to the porewater system e g isotope exchange between inactive and active porewater using the multi step extraction approach the δ 2h and δ 18o values of the porewater are derived by extrapolating the measured values this approach thus may avoid under or over estimation of the isotope values of the active porewater though the multiple step extraction technique described in this paper can be used to give more reliable results this method will increase the cost for determining porewater 2h and 18o compositions it may be unrealistic to expect a laboratory to be able to handle large number of soil samples by using this method in routine analyses in recent years automated high precision measurement techniques for determining porewater δ2h and δ18o values have been developed these techniques are based on direct equilibration and provide an important and cost effective improvement over conventional one step extraction methods although not cost effective the method described in this paper may be used in some special cases e g for situations where the measurement accuracy is a top priority the pore water consists of non negligible fraction of water that is not active under normal conditions but may be extracted under laboratory conditions and sufficient water can be obtained from the soil to provide an alternative approach to the direct equilibration methods or provide a possibility to test the reliability of other methods for the determination of δ 2h and δ18o values of porewater for simplicity the discussion in this paper used data obtained on sandy soil planning of more experimental studies are being made for other soil types such as soil that is rich in clay minerals and or substances of organic origin and the special soil type from loess plateau northwest china in addition a comparison between the multi step extraction method and the direct equilibration method may provide more understanding related to porewater isotope value determination credit authorship contribution statement sanyuan jiang conceptualization methodology writing original draft wenbo
