18430,the use of microbial fuel cells mfcs for wastewater treatment fits in a circular economy context as they can produce electricity by the removal of organic matter in the wastewater activated carbon ac granules are an attractive electrode material for bioanodes in mfcs as they are cheap and provide electroactive bacteria with a large surface area for attachment the characterization of biofilm growth on ac granules however is challenging due to their high roughness and three dimensional structure in this research we show that 3d magnetic resonance imaging mri can be used to visualize biofilm distribution and determine its volume on irregular shaped single ac granules in a non destructive way while being combined with electrochemical and biomass analyses ten ac granules with electroactive biofilm i e granular bioanodes were collected at different growth stages 3 to 21 days after microbial inoculation from a multi anode mfc and t1 weighted 3d mri experiments were performed for three dimensional biofilm visualization with time a more homogeneous biofilm distribution and an increased biofilm thickness could be observed in the 3d mri images biofilm volumes varied from 0 4 μl day 4 to 2 μl day 21 and were linearly correlated r2 0 9 to the total produced electric charge and total nitrogen content of the granular bioanodes with values of 66 4 c μl 1 and 17 μg n μl 1 respectively in future in situ mri measurements could be used to monitor biofilm growth and distribution on ac granules graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial fuel cells activated carbon granules porous electrodes magnetic resonance imaging biofilm distribution biofilm volume 1 introduction recovery of resources from waste streams is necessary to transit towards renewable forms of energy and a circular economy wastewater streams from industries agriculture and households are known to be a valuable source of organics and nutrients that can be recovered and used for energy production mo and zhang 2013 nir et al 2018 zeeman and kujawa roeleveld 2011 the microbial fuel cell mfc is a technology that uses bacteria to clean wastewater by oxidizing the organics while simultaneously producing electricity allen and bennetto 1993 heilmann and logan 2006 rozendal et al 2008 shimoyama et al 2008 this oxidation reaction occurs at the anode where bacteria grow by forming a biofilm on the surface of the electrode known as bioanode however the application of mfcs on up scaled wastewater treatment processes remains challenging due to the expected non favorable conditions such as complex substrates changes in temperature or increased internal resistances of the system for these reasons and the stagnating power production trend mfcs have shown in the last decade even at laboratory scale up to 5 w m 2 cathode surface area logan et al 2015 the ability of mfcs to compete with other wastewater treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion has been hindered arends and verstraete 2012 ter heijne et al 2011 electrode material properties e g biocompatibility electrical conductivity and surface area are of importance for the performance of mfcs and hence the power density wei et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 carbonaceous materials are widely used as they are cheap and hold most of the desired electrode properties among them activated carbon ac granules have a three dimensional structure and a large specific surface area even larger than 2000 m2 g 1 qu and shi 1998 that allows for good biofilm attachment hence leading to a high volumetric power density in this research we use single ac granules as previously described by caizán juanarena and co workers caizán juanarena et al 2019 where up to 24 granular bioanodes of different sizes and types were electrochemically and microbiologically studied under the same conditions i e same reactor system many studies focus on electrochemical borsje et al 2016 deeke et al 2012 rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 and physical properties frackowiak and béguin 2001 kastening et al 1997 pastor villegas and durán valle 2002 of ac while quantification and distribution of biofilm on such electrode material are less extensively addressed these are important parameters to determine as biofilm growth plays a crucial role on the performance of mfcs moreover when using rough three dimensional and porous materials such as ac granules it is of particular interest to get more information about biofilm development on the electrode surface a wide variety of techniques is available for biofilm characterization beyenal et al 2004 neu et al 2010 valladares linares et al 2016 biofilm quantification can be done by using well established methods such as protein analysis van eerten jansen et al 2013 and total nitrogen tn molenaar et al 2018 content analysis which relate to the total amount of biomass however these techniques are destructive and cannot give any information about biofilm distribution on electrode surfaces which is an important parameter to better understand the growing behaviour and limitations of biofilms and determine features such as the biofilm thickness to this aim the spatial distribution of a biofilm is commonly obtained by microscopy techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem marzorati et al 2018 saba et al 2017 zakaria et al 2018 or confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm saba et al 2017 sun et al 2016 however they are destructive e g sem need the addition of chemicals e g clsm and can only scan small areas of an electrode as shown by tejedor sanz and co workers on activated carbon granules tejedor sanz et al 2018 optical coherence tomography oct has been used to visualize the structure of biofilms growing on glass slides wagner et al 2010b and carriers li et al 2016 a recent study has demonstrated accurate measurements of biofilm volume and thickness of an active bioanode growing on an electrode surface both in situ and non invasively molenaar et al 2018 however the three dimensional nature of ac granules impedes the application of oct on these specific electrodes unlike the more or less flat surfaces used in other studies fortunato and leiknes 2017 haisch and niessner 2007 xi et al 2006 therefore other techniques need to be used to visualize and quantify biofilm growth on ac granules and in this way add to the information obtained about these granular bioanodes in previous studies borsje et al 2016 caizán juanarena et al 2019 in this context magnetic resonance imaging mri is a technique that has already been used to visualize biofilms in different applications and that is attractive to characterize biofilms growing on our electrodes magnetic resonance imaging mri a technique well known from medical diagnostics is suitable for visualization and characterization of biofilms gonzalez gil et al 2001 manz et al 2003 neu et al 2010 phoenix and holmes 2008 ramanan et al 2013 ranzinger et al 2016 for an overview on recent studies in biofilm research using mri a book chapter is available herrling et al 2019 existing mri research studies on biofilms have mainly focused on biofilm structure transport of water i e diffusion and flow and metal ions in and around biofilms bartacek et al 2016 herrling et al 2017 manz et al 2005 mclean et al 2008 phoenix and holmes 2008 ramanan et al 2010 seymour et al 2004 van as and lens 2001 wieland et al 2001 localized spectroscopic measurements on metabolites present in biofilm mclean et al 2008 and biofilm growth on carriers even with complex geometry herrling et al 2017 2015 leferink et al 2014 mclean et al 2008 von der schulenburg et al 2008b vrouwenvelder et al 2009 and in porous media e g seymour et al 2007 furthermore 3d mri has also been used to visualize biofilm growth on a flat carrier majors et al 2005 mclean et al 2008 renslow et al 2010 in a tube reactor wagner et al 2010a and on complex geometries in porous media applications nott et al 2005 von der schulenburg et al 2008a specifically mri research of biofilm growth on electrodes as carriers has revealed information about diffusion coefficients renslow et al 2013b and metabolic activity i e electron transfer renslow et al 2013a within the biofilm growing on flat electrodes in this study we generalize this previous approach of imaging a biofilm on a 2d flat electrode geometry renslow et al 2014 2013a 2013b to 3d biofilm visualization and also quantification on an electrode material ac granules with a rather irregular 3d shape and surface where the main challenge is to make a clear distinction between biofilm and both the electrode material and surrounding water as opposed to a flat 2d electrode surface where the support shape is well defined because of the irregular features of ac granules and the thin biofilm layer high resolution 3d images are needed i e at sub hundred micrometre resolution these resolutions are usually difficult to obtain in mri due to the low sensitivity of the technique and would require long experimental times of days to weeks to shorten experimental times while obtaining such high resolution images high magnetic field strengths are needed as the sensitivity of the mri technique increases with increasing magnetic field strength webb 2012 to obtain high resolution 3d images in reasonable experimental times this study was therefore conducted at a magnetic field strength of 14 1 t leferink et al 2014 which is much stronger than the 1 5 and 3 t mri scanners used for conventional medical imaging magnetic field strengths used in biofilm mri research are commonly ranging between 4 7 t e g herrling et al 2017 and 11 7 t e g renslow et al 2013b to achieve higher spatial resolutions in view of the smaller dimensions of biofilms but biofilm studies have also been performed at very low field strengths of 0 7 t e g bartacek et al 2016 since mri is an imaging modality based on the detection of the magnetic moments spins of hydrogen nuclei in a magnetic field after excitation with an appropriate pulse sequence westbrook and talbot 2018 it allows to visualize the distribution of hydrogen nuclei in e g biological samples as water is the most abundant component containing hydrogen in biological samples the main application is to image water distribution to distinguish different tissues within a biological sample we can make use of the differences in magnetic resonance mr signal lifetimes of water in those tissues compared to the surrounding bulk water called relaxation times t1 and or t2 as the bulk water signal has a different relaxation time than the biofilm water signal van as and lens 2001 mri signal acquisition timings such as repetition time tr and echo time te can be selected to maximize the contrast between biofilm and bulk water which will lead to different signal intensities an optimized tr leads to a contrast based on t1 relaxation time while an optimized te leads to a contrast based on t2 relaxation time to select one of these contrast types the other has to be minimized thus for t1 contrast we minimize te to avoid t2 weighting while for t2 contrast we maximize tr to avoid t1 weighting westbrook and talbot 2018 based on this image contrast the biofilm region can be selected and the distribution can be visualized the aim of this research was to develop an mri protocol to non destructively visualize and quantify the three dimensional biofilm distribution on single ac granules which were grown as bioanodes in a multi anode mfc to this end we investigated whether biofilm water could be distinguished from bulk water by t1 relaxation time at a high magnetic field strength 14 1 t 3d mri images of granular bioanodes collected at different growth stages were acquired and biofilm distribution and volume were determined biofilm quantification with mri was complemented with measurements of total nitrogen content and total produced electric charge of the same granular bioanodes 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of ac granules the type of ac granules used are commercially known as pk 1 3 cabot norit nederland b v amersfoort the netherlands they were prepared as explained in a previous publication by caizan juanarena and co workers caizán juanarena et al 2019 first sieved using an aperture size between 1 and 2 mm retsch germany then individually selected for an approximate spherical shape and finally weighted their volume was estimated by using the apparent density provided by the manufacturer i e 0 3 g ml 1 their radius was approximated from the volume by assuming a spherical shape of the granule their outer surface area was also estimated assuming an spherical shape without considering the possible roughness or pores where bacteria could have access to the measured values of weight and the estimated values of volume and surface area can be seen in the supplementary information s1 after selection granules were treated with 22 hydrochloric acid hcl for 24 h to remove surface organic contamination and metal impurities and washed three times with demi water wu et al 2015 this cleaning procedure is common practice and useful for comparative experiments additionally for mri experiments it was a crucial step as the ac granules should contain as little concentration of iron ions as possible in order to avoid image artefacts in the supplementary information s2 the composition of ac granules before and after the acid treatment can be seen measured with inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 2 preparation and operation of the mfc a custom made mfc reactor was built see the schematic top view in fig 1 b consisting of a 2 3 l container as the anode chamber and a glass tube in the middle as the cathode chamber the anode chamber had 2 l of anolyte 10 mm nach3coo 3h2o 1 ml l 1 wolfe s vitamin solution 1 ml l 1 wolfe s modified mineral solution 3 7 mm nh4cl 1 6 mm kcl 30 mm na2hpo4 2h2o 19 mm kh2po4 of which 0 2 l was an inoculum from another active mfc ran on acetate the cathode chamber had an approximate volume of 0 13 l 100 mm k3fecn6 30 mm na2hpo4 2h2o 19 mm kh2po4 where a 24 cm2 graphite felt was used as electrode material attached to a titanium wire 1 mm diameter 36 cm long as current collector a cation exchange membrane fumasep fkb fuma tech gmbh st ingbert germany of 1 76 cm2 was placed on the bottom of the cathode chamber in contact with the anode chamber the lid of the container had several holes one for the cathode chamber ø 2 5 cm one for the inflow of substrate ø 1 5 cm one for the reference electrode 3 m kcl ag agcl 0 199 v vs nhe ø 1 5 cm and 29 for the working electrodes ø 1 cm additionally a hole on the side of the container was made for the outflow ø 1 5 cm the effect of the distance between working and the reference electrodes on current production was neglected as the latter one was placed outside of the electric field single granules were held separately with clamps made of titanium wire ø 1 mm see fig 1a one side of the clamp had the shape of a hook where the granule could be fixated the contact area with the granule was minimized using yellow non conductive resin revlon colorstay that served to limit bacterial growth on the clamp the other side of the titanium wire was passed through a rubber that fitted the size of the holes on the lid for the working electrodes the average resistance of the clamps was 0 8 1 ω between the two ends each clamp was connected to a channel from a multiwe32 module ivium technologies eindhoven the netherlands which can operate up to 32 working electrodes that share common reference and counter electrodes all working electrodes one abiotic and 10 biotic were operated at 0 35 v vs ag agcl with continuous anolyte inflow as the anode potential was controlled versus the reference electrode the counter electrode was of no influence to the current production and biofilm growth this would not be the case if instead the cell voltage was controlled the abiotic granule consisted of a 2 mm diameter glass bead b braun biotech international schwarzenberg germany covered with ptfe tape acetate concentration was maintained above 5 mm anaerobic conditions were ensured with n2 flushing and the stirring velocity was fixed at 100 rpm electric current was monitored with a sampling time of 600 s until granular bioanodes were collected from the reactor see s1 for the exact days total produced electric charge by each bioanode was calculated according to equation 1 1 q t 0 t i d t where q t is the total produced electric charge c i is the current a and t is the overall time s during which current was measured after collecting each granular bioanode the rubber stopper was replaced with a new stopper to avoid oxygen leakage into the reactor prior to mri measurements clamped granular bioanodes were submerged 2 to 3 times in a buffer solution without nitrogen 1 6 mm kcl 30 mm na2hpo4 2h2o 19 mm kh2po4 to avoid accounting for additional nitrogen content from the anolyte in the total nitrogen analysis each granular bioanode was then transferred to a 3 mm diameter mr tube hilgenberg malsfeld germany containing the same buffer solution and an agar block 2 w w of approximately 8 mm placed at the bottom see fig 1c 2 3 mri measurements mri measurements were performed on a 14 1 t bruker avance iii 600 spectrometer bruker karlsruhe germany controlled by paravision 5 or 6 the micro5 imaging probe was equipped with a micro5 gradient set driven by great60 amplifiers located at magnefy magnetic resonance research facility wageningen the netherlands the rf coil used was a 1h 2h saddle coil insert with the inner coil being the 1h coil with a diameter of 5 mm and the outer coil being a 2h coil not used in this study all mri measurements were performed at room temperature 293 k with no extra temperature control 2 3 1 t1 map a 2d spin echo rarevtr sequence echo time 2 93 ms 5 different

reconstruction to process the 3d dataset a script was written in idl version 6 4 itt visual information solutions boulder co usa a threshold was set above the noise intensity level to mask areas with no signal intensity furthermore we corrected for the inhomogeneous intensity of the bulk water signal as function of position due to the inhomogeneity of the b1 field which is caused by the geometry of the detection coil namely the saddle geometry after this correction a threshold was set above the image intensity corresponding to bulk water to distinguish volume elements voxels containing biofilm from those containing bulk water the dataset containing the threshold images was then loaded into imagej fiji schindelin et al 2012 and a 3d volume reconstruction was done using the image j 3d viewer schmid et al 2010 applying a resampling factor of 2 voxels with a signal intensity higher than the threshold attributed to biofilm were summed up and multiplied by the volume of a single voxel 28 μm 3 resulting in the biofilm volume based on biofilm volumes and the estimation of the outer surface area of ac granules the average biofilm thickness was calculated at each growth stage as reported in the supplementary information s1 2 5 total nitrogen tn analysis after mri measurements granular bioanodes were processed with the laton total nitrogen lck cuvette test with a concentration range of 20 100 mg l 1 tnb hach manchester united kingdom this method measures organic and inorganic bound nitrogen excluding elemental nitrogen n2 0 2 ml of miliq water was added to the reaction vessel together with the granular bioanode which was directly transferred from the mr tube direct contact between the liquids in the reaction vessel water and the mr tube buffer ensured that the granular bioanode could move with little interference the digestion step in the reaction vessel consisted of 30 min at 120 c the digested sample 0 5 ml was transferred from the reaction vessel to the lck cuvette from which the nitrogen concentration mg n l 1 was read after 15 min this concentration was converted to mg n by correcting for the initial added volume of miliq water i e 0 2 ml the nitrogen content of ac granules without biofilm i e not placed in the reactor and treated with 22 hcl was found to be around 1 mg l 1 which is more than 10 times lower than for granules with biofilm this residual nitrogen in abiotic granules could originate from the ac that contains some nitrogen however the exact value is difficult to specify as it will depend on the dry weight of each granule 3 results and discussion in this section we present and discuss i the mri method used to visualize the biofilm growing on ac granules ii the 3d mri images obtained at different biofilm growth stages of different granular bioanodes iii the image processing and determination of biofilm volume and iv the correlation between biofilm volume and both the total produced electric charge and total nitrogen content of single granular bioanodes 3 1 distinguishing biofilm water from bulk water using mri differences in t1 relaxation times provide the means to control contrast in mri experiments therefore it is important to quantify this parameter for both biofilm water and bulk water consisting of a buffer solution without nitrogen see experimental section fig 2 a shows the resulting 2d images for the repetition time tr varying from 0 1 s left to 5 s right the absolute image intensity increases with increasing tr as the magnetization is given more time to recover the signal intensity of each pixel was fitted as a function of tr with a mono exponential recovery curve in fig 2b we plotted the curve fitted for two pixels corresponding to biofilm water red and bulk water blue marked in fig 2a as example with this analysis a proton density map known as signal amplitude map fig 2c left and a t1 parameter map fig 2c right were obtained the amplitude map shows that the proton density a u is lower inside the biofilm than in the bulk water while the ac granule has a very low proton density due to absence of mobile protons in the ac and a too short signal relaxation time t2 for the water in the pores to be observable by mri the t1 map shows that t1 values of biofilm water 0 4 0 7 s and bulk water 2 s can indeed be distinguished a trend which was also seen by hoskin and co workers hoskins et al 1999 the t1 value of the biofilm water was lower than the bulk water value as the t1 relaxation time of water spins is affected by the different local physical and chemical environment in the biofilm belton and ratcliffe 1985 a t1 value of the ac granule could not be established due to the low intensity of the signal having established that biofilm and bulk water signal could be distinguished by their difference in t1 relaxation time the tr for maximum image contrast was determined using the recovery curves we used the value of tr at which the difference in signal intensity i e the contrast between bulk water and biofilm was the largest in this case we chose to use a tr of 0 7 s as indicated by the black dotted line fig 2b for all subsequent 3d mri experiments on the bioanodes as an alternative method to generate image contrast we proved on the same ac granule as used for t1 experiments in fig 2 that t2 weighting could be used as well to distinguish biofilm water t2 apparent 15 30 ms from bulk water t2 apparent 40 ms the reported apparent t2 values are specific for the resolution 47 47 200 μm3 and magnetic field strength 14 1 t used in this t2 experiment edzes et al 1998 however the low contrast we found between biofilm and the ac granule with t2 weighted images supplementary information s3 would impede the distinction and subsequent quantification of biofilm the contrast between biofilm water and bulk water in t2 experiments was also lower than in t1 experiments due to the smaller difference in t2 relaxation times at the required high resolutions edzes et al 1998 additionally performing full t2 weighted 3d experiments would take longer experimental time than t1 weighted experiments in fact it would require a tr of 5 t1 max with t1 max being the highest t1 relaxation time among the components in this case of bulk water t1 2 s therefore t1 weighted mri images were preferred for the present study 3 2 biofilm distribution using 3d mri fig 3 a shows a cross section of the 3d dataset of a granular bioanode where the biofilm was grown for 11 days the signal intensity of biofilm was higher than both the ac granule and the bulk water and could thus be used to determine biofilm growth as a cross section is not representative for the biofilm distribution on the whole granule surface a 3d reconstruction of the biofilm was made after selecting the voxels containing biofilm in each cross section by applying a threshold on the signal intensity fig 3b a 3d reconstruction of the biofilm showed the biofilm distribution and coverage fig 3c reconstruction depicted from three different angles turned around the vertical axis cross sections threshold images and images of the 3d volume reconstruction of every granular bioanode can be found in the supplementary information s4 additionally videos of the 3d reconstruction of each of the studied granules can also be found in the supplementary information video files the whole surface of the ac granule at day 11 was covered with biofilm except for an area that corresponds to the position of the clamp used as current collector this partly covered the surface of the ac granules hence preventing biofilm growth on this area therefore this served as an internal control within the 3d images indicating that bulk water at the granular surface was not falsely attributed to biofilm volume which is the case when a surface acts as a relaxation sink godefroy et al 2001 this internal control served thus as proof that mri image artefacts were not interfering in our study using the 3d reconstructions of all different granular bioanodes see supplementary information s4 and the video files we assessed biofilm growth at different days at early stages days 3 and 4 there were large surface areas of the ac granules that were not covered and the biofilm distribution was not homogeneous over the surface at later stages days 6 and 7 the biofilm was more equally distributed over the granule surface but it was still not very thick more mature granular bioanodes grown for 11 days or more had thicker biofilms that allowed for a clearer view of the biofilm distribution on the ac granule it is important to highlight that the area of the clamp was visible in every granular bioanode which served as an internal control as previously explained at the early growth stages when the biofilm was not much developed the area covered by the clamp was not as distinct as for more mature biofilms however when compared to an abiotic granule see also supplementary information s4 and video files this latter did not show a hole and the whole granule surface was instead covered by an equidistant signal originating from the surface of the ac granule acting as a relaxation sink godefroy et al 2001 3 3 biofilm volume determination using 3d mri fig 4 a shows the biofilm volume of 10 granular bioanodes each with different ac granule weight collected from the reactor at different days values ranged from 0 4 μl on day 4 to 2 μl on day 21 an increased biofilm volume is observed with longer growth periods for the time range studied here as biofilm thickness is known to be a crucial parameter for the electrochemical activity of bioanodes sun et al 2016 the average biofilm thickness was calculated assuming that the whole outer surface area of the granules was completely covered by biofilm see supplementary information s1 the lowest average thickness estimated was at day 4 with a value of 27 8 μm while the highest average thickness was 165 9 μm for the granular bioanode collected at day 21 this biofilm thickness is in the same range as reported for electroactive biofilms on macroscopically flat anodes jana et al 2014 molenaar et al 2018 the increasing thickness may be a contributing factor to the decrease of electric current production by the bioanodes over time as shown in fig 4b in fact some studies korth et al 2015 savéant 1986 have revealed that diffusion limitations increase with thicker biofilms which may hinder current production of the system 3 4 comparison of biofilm volume with total produced electric charge and total nitrogen content electric current production was recorded for each granular bioanode during the biofilm growth period see fig 4b most of them reached the maximum current ranging from 57 to 119 μa approximately 3 4 days after inoculation after those days the current decreased to values between 87 in day 6 and 44 in day 22 of the maximum current value in fact three weeks after inoculation current values seemed to approach a steady state this current curve appears to be characteristic for bioanodes that are continuously fed and controlled at a certain potential molenaar et al 2018 the variability of current values among granular bioanodes might relate to the granular material itself due to its irregularities in shape surface and porosity even when the raw material the activation process and the selected granule size is the same this variability was already found in a previous research study caizán juanarena et al 2019 where the reproducibility of single ac granules was proven for different granule sizes and types we expect current production to be related to biofilm volume as electroactive bacteria gain energy from transporting electrons from the substrate to the electrode to prove this we correlated the biofilm volume with the total produced electric charge i e current integrated over time see experimental section fig 4c revealed a linear relation of 66 4 c μl 1 r2 0 9 this value is in the same order of magnitude but 1 6 fold higher than the linear relation found for bioanodes by oct measurements molenaar et al 2018 similarly total nitrogen content can be used as an indication of biofilm growth as both the bacteria and the extracellular polymeric substances eps that are part of the biofilm contribute to the nitrogen content in fact the biofilm volume determined from 3d mri images was linearly related to total the total nitrogen content of granular bioanodes fig 4d the relation found was 17 μg n μl 1 r2 0 9 by characterizing the biofilm on the same granule using three different approaches in fact by recording the current production electrochemically determining the biofilm volume with mri and indirectly quantifying the biomass with total nitrogen content analysis makes this study complete especially correlating the total produced electric charge and the biofilm volume is a valuable information which is difficult to obtain non destructively with other methods nevertheless we believe mri should be seen as a complementary technique to other quantitative methods like protein and nitrogen analyses and particularly be used in studies where biofilm distribution or volume might give extra relevant information about the electrode biofilm interface or the mfc performance in general in this study we did not continuously monitor the same bioanode at different growth stages in terms of volume as the bioanode was permanently removed from the reactor on the day of the mri measurement however we showed that the correlation between electric charge nitrogen content and volume of the 10 measured bioanodes was independent from their growth stage and electrical performance meaning a larger number of samples would not give any extra information on this matter to make sure that these linear correlations did not deviate from the actual values due to a possible biofilm stability issue as consequence of long mri experimental times with no substrate additional total nitrogen analyses were done with fresh granular bioanodes directly collected from the reactor i e without any mri measurements the relation between nitrogen content and total produced electric charge was found to be similar see supplementary information s5 indicating that sample handling and the duration of mri measurement time had little effect on the amount of biofilm grown on ac granules and confirming the non destructive nature of mri even though biofilm detachment proved to be negligible based on these data the effect of the long experimental times and substrate absence during mri measurements on the biofilm morphology was not addressed to this aim in situ measurements are needed where bioanodes do not deviate from their original state and growth curve and where thus a non invasive nature is also achieved 3 5 challenges and outlook regarding the resolution used to visualize the biofilm distribution on ac granules mri images with a resolution of 28 μm 3 were sufficient to elucidate biofilm distribution but not to discriminate individual bacterial cells 1 μm bond and lovley 2003 or clusters below 28 μm potentially present in surface cavities or inner pores of the ac granules in fact by using sem to visualize the cross section of ac granules we found that bacterial growth occurred in their inner pores see supplementary information s6 therefore this might have caused an underestimation of biofilm growth on ac granules however 28 μm 3 was the optimum resolution with acceptable measurement times 24 h nevertheless previous research on single ac granules caizán juanarena et al 2019 showed a positive linear relation between nitrogen content as quantification of biomass and the outer surface area of granular electrodes strongly indicating a big contribution of biofilm growth on the surface this means 3d mri measurements in this study were able to cover to a large extent the total biofilm volume of granular bioanodes if we consider that mri can additionally show the distribution of biofilm over the electrode surface unlike other indirect quantitative measurements of biomass such as nitrogen or protein analyses it can be considered a valuable technique to study biofilms on flat but also porous electrodes higher resolutions than 28 μm 3 would allow to image the biofilm distribution more accurately but would require longer measurement times that might damage the integrity of the biofilm to achieve higher resolutions more sensitive detection coils or accelerated measurement techniques tsao and kozerke 2012 are recommended for the future another approach to achieve higher resolutions is to use an mri scanner with a higher magnetic field strength in fact within this research we also imaged granular bioanodes at 22 t but the paramagnetic ions present in ac granules see supplementary information s2 had a stronger effect on the mr signal at this field strength and the resulting image artefacts made biofilm quantification infeasible images not shown at 14 1 t the paramagnetic ions did not cause severe artefacts and therefore did not disturb biofilm visualization and quantification as this effect decreases with decreasing magnetic field strength high resolution 3d mri measurements on electrode materials as presented in this study can be easily applied to other complex geometry biofilms with other complex geometries of support structures the limiting factor to the smallest resolvable features is the maximum resolution attainable at a given magnetic field strength with the desired measurement time if the biofilm is not attached to an electrode support this could be even easier as measurements might suffer less from susceptibility artefacts as for the determination of biofilm volume it depends on several steps that can introduce errors that are not exactly quantifiable the choice of the threshold value in the image processing step is therefore crucial if this value is too high biofilm will not be counted while if the threshold is too low voxels containing bulk water will be attributed to biofilm in fact in the threshold images fig 3b and supplementary information s4 several voxels in the bulk water region and the pore water of granules are accounted as biofilm while in the biofilm region certain areas are instead not counted as such the signal intensity encountered within ac granules could mean that protons originating from either water or biofilm water were present in the internal pore structure of the granules this is difficult to resolve using mri due to the resolution of the 3d mri images 28 μm 3 and the presence of e g iron ions see supplementary information s2 that can cause mri image artefacts inside the granule furthermore even though we corrected for image intensity differences caused by an inhomogeneity in the detector of the mri equipment see experimental section small differences in image intensity remain and can cause local over or underestimation of the biofilm volume another inaccuracy results from partial volume effects gonzález ballester et al 2002 this means that if the voxel of 28 μm 3 is partly filled with biofilm and partly filled with bulk water it might not be accounted as biofilm volume the estimation of the partial volume effect has not been done in this study additionally to obtain a more accurate biofilm thickness from the 3d mri volume data determining the exact interfacial area between the biofilm and the ac granule would also be needed however this requires more sophisticated image processing procedures in any case mri image artefacts should always be carefully considered for biofilm visualization purposes as the signal identified as biofilm could originate from a different source e g relaxation sinks at the surface of the ac granule a next step in biofilm characterization of granular bioanodes with mri would be to perform in situ measurements renslow et al 2014 so that biofilm development can be followed in time for the same ac granules with no change in their growth conditions to this end the clamp containing the single bioanode could be inserted into the magnet in a flow cell which would allow flow of influent and effluent in that case efforts to reduce acquisition time i e more sensitive detector accelerated techniques tsao and kozerke 2012 in 3d mri measurements would be highly recommended as it would be preferable to stop the flow during mri measurements to minimize artefacts the material of the clamp i e current collector would need to be carefully selected to minimize susceptibility artefacts originating from the setup in the same way when working with real wastewater special attention should be paid to artefacts that might occur due to the complex composition of wastewater that contains e g more soluble metals than the lab electrolyte in case granular bioanodes with no attached current collector are collected from up scaled reactors treating wastewater as done in e g rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 developing a specific protocol for it could provide information about biofilm growth over time on these electrodes but again not for the same ac granule as in this study furthermore mri presents opportunities for biofilm research not only regarding structural information but also related to the study of its chemical composition by combining mri for localization with nmr spectroscopy for chemical compound identification localized detection of chemical compounds is already feasible in 20 30 μm thick 2d plane mclean et al 2008 renslow et al 2014 however currently the resolution is still too low to detect relevant low metabolite concentrations at the high spatial resolutions which would be required for the thin biofilm on the bioanodes of this study by translating recent sensitivity enhancement methods from the field of biomedical mri such as chemical exchange saturation transfer cest wu et al 2016 or spin hyperpolarization techniques nikolaou et al 2015 the metabolite concentrations could be detected with a higher spatial resolution in the future with the further improvements of this study as well as the other possibilities of biofilm characterization that mri offers i e diffusion and detection of chemical compounds this technique would not only serve to quantify and visualize biofilms in three dimensional electrode materials but also could provide strategies to improve the power output as well as to potentially elucidate on the degradation of complex organics during bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusions determining the distribution and morphology of electroactive biofilms as well as quantifying them is of upmost importance since biofilm growth ultimately determines the performance of microbial fuel cells mfcs in the case of activated carbon ac granules this is of particular interest in order to better understand the interaction between the biofilm and such highly porous electrode material in this study we have shown that high field 14 1 t magnetic resonance imaging mri can be used for high resolution 28 μm 3 imaging of thin biofilms 28 116 μm growing on granular electrodes in a multi anode mfc by using 3d mri we could visualize the electroactive biofilm on single ac granule surfaces with a high contrast between biofilm and bulk water and subsequently determine the biofilm volume as well as estimate its thickness at different growth stages from day 3 to day 22 for ac granules this would have not been possible to obtain with electrochemical chemical or other microscopy techniques moreover as it is a non destructive technique biofilm quantification was combined with another analytical technique i e total nitrogen content analysis to yield complementary information therefore the innovation of this study relies on the combination of using mri on granular electrodes complementary with other quantification techniques additionally high resolution 3d mri enabled the quantification of arbitrarily shaped thin biofilms growing on arbitrarily shaped electrodes for the first time in the future in situ experiments can be used to monitor biofilm growth and distribution on the same single ac granule

18430,the use of microbial fuel cells mfcs for wastewater treatment fits in a circular economy context as they can produce electricity by the removal of organic matter in the wastewater activated carbon ac granules are an attractive electrode material for bioanodes in mfcs as they are cheap and provide electroactive bacteria with a large surface area for attachment the characterization of biofilm growth on ac granules however is challenging due to their high roughness and three dimensional structure in this research we show that 3d magnetic resonance imaging mri can be used to visualize biofilm distribution and determine its volume on irregular shaped single ac granules in a non destructive way while being combined with electrochemical and biomass analyses ten ac granules with electroactive biofilm i e granular bioanodes were collected at different growth stages 3 to 21 days after microbial inoculation from a multi anode mfc and t1 weighted 3d mri experiments were performed for three dimensional biofilm visualization with time a more homogeneous biofilm distribution and an increased biofilm thickness could be observed in the 3d mri images biofilm volumes varied from 0 4 μl day 4 to 2 μl day 21 and were linearly correlated r2 0 9 to the total produced electric charge and total nitrogen content of the granular bioanodes with values of 66 4 c μl 1 and 17 μg n μl 1 respectively in future in situ mri measurements could be used to monitor biofilm growth and distribution on ac granules graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial fuel cells activated carbon granules porous electrodes magnetic resonance imaging biofilm distribution biofilm volume 1 introduction recovery of resources from waste streams is necessary to transit towards renewable forms of energy and a circular economy wastewater streams from industries agriculture and households are known to be a valuable source of organics and nutrients that can be recovered and used for energy production mo and zhang 2013 nir et al 2018 zeeman and kujawa roeleveld 2011 the microbial fuel cell mfc is a technology that uses bacteria to clean wastewater by oxidizing the organics while simultaneously producing electricity allen and bennetto 1993 heilmann and logan 2006 rozendal et al 2008 shimoyama et al 2008 this oxidation reaction occurs at the anode where bacteria grow by forming a biofilm on the surface of the electrode known as bioanode however the application of mfcs on up scaled wastewater treatment processes remains challenging due to the expected non favorable conditions such as complex substrates changes in temperature or increased internal resistances of the system for these reasons and the stagnating power production trend mfcs have shown in the last decade even at laboratory scale up to 5 w m 2 cathode surface area logan et al 2015 the ability of mfcs to compete with other wastewater treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion has been hindered arends and verstraete 2012 ter heijne et al 2011 electrode material properties e g biocompatibility electrical conductivity and surface area are of importance for the performance of mfcs and hence the power density wei et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 carbonaceous materials are widely used as they are cheap and hold most of the desired electrode properties among them activated carbon ac granules have a three dimensional structure and a large specific surface area even larger than 2000 m2 g 1 qu and shi 1998 that allows for good biofilm attachment hence leading to a high volumetric power density in this research we use single ac granules as previously described by caizán juanarena and co workers caizán juanarena et al 2019 where up to 24 granular bioanodes of different sizes and types were electrochemically and microbiologically studied under the same conditions i e same reactor system many studies focus on electrochemical borsje et al 2016 deeke et al 2012 rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 and physical properties frackowiak and béguin 2001 kastening et al 1997 pastor villegas and durán valle 2002 of ac while quantification and distribution of biofilm on such electrode material are less extensively addressed these are important parameters to determine as biofilm growth plays a crucial role on the performance of mfcs moreover when using rough three dimensional and porous materials such as ac granules it is of particular interest to get more information about biofilm development on the electrode surface a wide variety of techniques is available for biofilm characterization beyenal et al 2004 neu et al 2010 valladares linares et al 2016 biofilm quantification can be done by using well established methods such as protein analysis van eerten jansen et al 2013 and total nitrogen tn molenaar et al 2018 content analysis which relate to the total amount of biomass however these techniques are destructive and cannot give any information about biofilm distribution on electrode surfaces which is an important parameter to better understand the growing behaviour and limitations of biofilms and determine features such as the biofilm thickness to this aim the spatial distribution of a biofilm is commonly obtained by microscopy techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem marzorati et al 2018 saba et al 2017 zakaria et al 2018 or confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm saba et al 2017 sun et al 2016 however they are destructive e g sem need the addition of chemicals e g clsm and can only scan small areas of an electrode as shown by tejedor sanz and co workers on activated carbon granules tejedor sanz et al 2018 optical coherence tomography oct has been used to visualize the structure of biofilms growing on glass slides wagner et al 2010b and carriers li et al 2016 a recent study has demonstrated accurate measurements of biofilm volume and thickness of an active bioanode growing on an electrode surface both in situ and non invasively molenaar et al 2018 however the three dimensional nature of ac granules impedes the application of oct on these specific electrodes unlike the more or less flat surfaces used in other studies fortunato and leiknes 2017 haisch and niessner 2007 xi et al 2006 therefore other techniques need to be used to visualize and quantify biofilm growth on ac granules and in this way add to the information obtained about these granular bioanodes in previous studies borsje et al 2016 caizán juanarena et al 2019 in this context magnetic resonance imaging mri is a technique that has already been used to visualize biofilms in different applications and that is attractive to characterize biofilms growing on our electrodes magnetic resonance imaging mri a technique well known from medical diagnostics is suitable for visualization and characterization of biofilms gonzalez gil et al 2001 manz et al 2003 neu et al 2010 phoenix and holmes 2008 ramanan et al 2013 ranzinger et al 2016 for an overview on recent studies in biofilm research using mri a book chapter is available herrling et al 2019 existing mri research studies on biofilms have mainly focused on biofilm structure transport of water i e diffusion and flow and metal ions in and around biofilms bartacek et al 2016 herrling et al 2017 manz et al 2005 mclean et al 2008 phoenix and holmes 2008 ramanan et al 2010 seymour et al 2004 van as and lens 2001 wieland et al 2001 localized spectroscopic measurements on metabolites present in biofilm mclean et al 2008 and biofilm growth on carriers even with complex geometry herrling et al 2017 2015 leferink et al 2014 mclean et al 2008 von der schulenburg et al 2008b vrouwenvelder et al 2009 and in porous media e g seymour et al 2007 furthermore 3d mri has also been used to visualize biofilm growth on a flat carrier majors et al 2005 mclean et al 2008 renslow et al 2010 in a tube reactor wagner et al 2010a and on complex geometries in porous media applications nott et al 2005 von der schulenburg et al 2008a specifically mri research of biofilm growth on electrodes as carriers has revealed information about diffusion coefficients renslow et al 2013b and metabolic activity i e electron transfer renslow et al 2013a within the biofilm growing on flat electrodes in this study we generalize this previous approach of imaging a biofilm on a 2d flat electrode geometry renslow et al 2014 2013a 2013b to 3d biofilm visualization and also quantification on an electrode material ac granules with a rather irregular 3d shape and surface where the main challenge is to make a clear distinction between biofilm and both the electrode material and surrounding water as opposed to a flat 2d electrode surface where the support shape is well defined because of the irregular features of ac granules and the thin biofilm layer high resolution 3d images are needed i e at sub hundred micrometre resolution these resolutions are usually difficult to obtain in mri due to the low sensitivity of the technique and would require long experimental times of days to weeks to shorten experimental times while obtaining such high resolution images high magnetic field strengths are needed as the sensitivity of the mri technique increases with increasing magnetic field strength webb 2012 to obtain high resolution 3d images in reasonable experimental times this study was therefore conducted at a magnetic field strength of 14 1 t leferink et al 2014 which is much stronger than the 1 5 and 3 t mri scanners used for conventional medical imaging magnetic field strengths used in biofilm mri research are commonly ranging between 4 7 t e g herrling et al 2017 and 11 7 t e g renslow et al 2013b to achieve higher spatial resolutions in view of the smaller dimensions of biofilms but biofilm studies have also been performed at very low field strengths of 0 7 t e g bartacek et al 2016 since mri is an imaging modality based on the detection of the magnetic moments spins of hydrogen nuclei in a magnetic field after excitation with an appropriate pulse sequence westbrook and talbot 2018 it allows to visualize the distribution of hydrogen nuclei in e g biological samples as water is the most abundant component containing hydrogen in biological samples the main application is to image water distribution to distinguish different tissues within a biological sample we can make use of the differences in magnetic resonance mr signal lifetimes of water in those tissues compared to the surrounding bulk water called relaxation times t1 and or t2 as the bulk water signal has a different relaxation time than the biofilm water signal van as and lens 2001 mri signal acquisition timings such as repetition time tr and echo time te can be selected to maximize the contrast between biofilm and bulk water which will lead to different signal intensities an optimized tr leads to a contrast based on t1 relaxation time while an optimized te leads to a contrast based on t2 relaxation time to select one of these contrast types the other has to be minimized thus for t1 contrast we minimize te to avoid t2 weighting while for t2 contrast we maximize tr to avoid t1 weighting westbrook and talbot 2018 based on this image contrast the biofilm region can be selected and the distribution can be visualized the aim of this research was to develop an mri protocol to non destructively visualize and quantify the three dimensional biofilm distribution on single ac granules which were grown as bioanodes in a multi anode mfc to this end we investigated whether biofilm water could be distinguished from bulk water by t1 relaxation time at a high magnetic field strength 14 1 t 3d mri images of granular bioanodes collected at different growth stages were acquired and biofilm distribution and volume were determined biofilm quantification with mri was complemented with measurements of total nitrogen content and total produced electric charge of the same granular bioanodes 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of ac granules the type of ac granules used are commercially known as pk 1 3 cabot norit nederland b v amersfoort the netherlands they were prepared as explained in a previous publication by caizan juanarena and co workers caizán juanarena et al 2019 first sieved using an aperture size between 1 and 2 mm retsch germany then individually selected for an approximate spherical shape and finally weighted their volume was estimated by using the apparent density provided by the manufacturer i e 0 3 g ml 1 their radius was approximated from the volume by assuming a spherical shape of the granule their outer surface area was also estimated assuming an spherical shape without considering the possible roughness or pores where bacteria could have access to the measured values of weight and the estimated values of volume and surface area can be seen in the supplementary information s1 after selection granules were treated with 22 hydrochloric acid hcl for 24 h to remove surface organic contamination and metal impurities and washed three times with demi water wu et al 2015 this cleaning procedure is common practice and useful for comparative experiments additionally for mri experiments it was a crucial step as the ac granules should contain as little concentration of iron ions as possible in order to avoid image artefacts in the supplementary information s2 the composition of ac granules before and after the acid treatment can be seen measured with inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 2 preparation and operation of the mfc a custom made mfc reactor was built see the schematic top view in fig 1 b consisting of a 2 3 l container as the anode chamber and a glass tube in the middle as the cathode

was used as electrode material attached to a titanium wire 1 mm diameter 36 cm long as current collector a cation exchange membrane fumasep fkb fuma tech gmbh st ingbert germany of 1 76 cm2 was placed on the bottom of the cathode chamber in contact with the anode chamber the lid of the container had several holes one for the cathode chamber ø 2 5 cm one for the inflow of substrate ø 1 5 cm one for the reference electrode 3 m kcl ag agcl 0 199 v vs nhe ø 1 5 cm and 29 for the working electrodes ø 1 cm additionally a hole on the side of the container was made for the outflow ø 1 5 cm the effect of the distance between working and the reference electrodes on current production was neglected as the latter one was placed outside of the electric field single granules were held separately with clamps made of titanium wire ø 1 mm see fig 1a one side of the clamp had the shape of a hook where the granule could be fixated the contact area with the granule was minimized using yellow non conductive resin revlon colorstay that served to limit bacterial growth on the clamp the other side of the titanium wire was passed through a rubber that fitted the size of the holes on the lid for the working electrodes the average resistance of the clamps was 0 8 1 ω between the two ends each clamp was connected to a channel from a multiwe32 module ivium technologies eindhoven the netherlands which can operate up to 32 working electrodes that share common reference and counter electrodes all working electrodes one abiotic and 10 biotic were operated at 0 35 v vs ag agcl with continuous anolyte inflow as the anode potential was controlled versus the reference electrode the counter electrode was of no influence to the current production and biofilm growth this would not be the case if instead the cell voltage was controlled the abiotic granule consisted of a 2 mm diameter glass bead b braun biotech international schwarzenberg germany covered with ptfe tape acetate concentration was maintained above 5 mm anaerobic conditions were ensured with n2 flushing and the stirring velocity was fixed at 100 rpm electric current was monitored with a sampling time of 600 s until granular bioanodes were collected from the reactor see s1 for the exact days total produced electric charge by each bioanode was calculated according to equation 1 1 q t 0 t i d t where q t is the total produced electric charge c i is the current a and t is the overall time s during which current was measured after collecting each granular bioanode the rubber stopper was replaced with a new stopper to avoid oxygen leakage into the reactor prior to mri measurements clamped granular bioanodes were submerged 2 to 3 times in a buffer solution without nitrogen 1 6 mm kcl 30 mm na2hpo4 2h2o 19 mm kh2po4 to avoid accounting for additional nitrogen content from the anolyte in the total nitrogen analysis each granular bioanode was then transferred to a 3 mm diameter mr tube hilgenberg malsfeld germany containing the same buffer solution and an agar block 2 w w of approximately 8 mm placed at the bottom see fig 1c 2 3 mri measurements mri measurements were performed on a 14 1 t bruker avance iii 600 spectrometer bruker karlsruhe germany controlled by paravision 5 or 6 the micro5 imaging probe was equipped with a micro5 gradient set driven by great60 amplifiers located at magnefy magnetic resonance research facility wageningen the netherlands the rf coil used was a 1h 2h saddle coil insert with the inner coil being the 1h coil with a diameter of 5 mm and the outer coil being a 2h coil not used in this study all mri measurements were performed at room temperature 293 k with no extra temperature control 2 3 1 t1 map a 2d spin echo rarevtr sequence echo time 2 93 ms 5 different

reconstruction to process the 3d dataset a script was written in idl version 6 4 itt visual information solutions boulder co usa a threshold was set above the noise intensity level to mask areas with no signal intensity furthermore we corrected for the inhomogeneous intensity of the bulk water signal as function of position due to the inhomogeneity of the b1 field which is caused by the geometry of the detection coil namely the saddle geometry after this correction a threshold was set above the image intensity corresponding to bulk water to distinguish volume elements voxels containing biofilm from those containing bulk water the dataset containing the threshold images was then loaded into imagej fiji schindelin et al 2012 and a 3d volume reconstruction was done using the image j 3d viewer schmid et al 2010 applying a resampling factor of 2 voxels with a signal intensity higher than the threshold attributed to biofilm were summed up and multiplied by the volume of a single voxel 28 μm 3 resulting in the biofilm volume based on biofilm volumes and the estimation of the outer surface area of ac granules the average biofilm thickness was calculated at each growth stage as reported in the supplementary information s1 2 5 total nitrogen tn analysis after mri measurements granular bioanodes were processed with the laton total nitrogen lck cuvette test with a concentration range of 20 100 mg l 1 tnb hach manchester united kingdom this method measures organic and inorganic bound nitrogen excluding elemental nitrogen n2 0 2 ml of miliq water was added to the reaction vessel together with the granular bioanode which was directly transferred from the mr tube direct contact between the liquids in the reaction vessel water and the mr tube buffer ensured that the granular bioanode could move with little interference the digestion step in the reaction vessel consisted of 30 min at 120 c the digested sample 0 5 ml was transferred from the reaction vessel to the lck cuvette from which the nitrogen concentration mg n l 1 was read after 15 min this concentration was converted to mg n by correcting for the initial added volume of miliq water i e 0 2 ml the nitrogen content of ac granules without biofilm i e not placed in the reactor and treated with 22 hcl was found to be around 1 mg l 1 which is more than 10 times lower than for granules with biofilm this residual nitrogen in abiotic granules could originate from the ac that contains some nitrogen however the exact value is difficult to specify as it will depend on the dry weight of each granule 3 results and discussion in this section we present and discuss i the mri method used to visualize the biofilm growing on ac granules ii the 3d mri images obtained at different biofilm growth stages of different granular bioanodes iii the image processing and determination of biofilm volume and iv the correlation between biofilm volume and both the total produced electric charge and total nitrogen content of single granular bioanodes 3 1 distinguishing biofilm water from bulk water using mri differences in t1 relaxation times provide the means to control contrast in mri experiments therefore it is important to quantify this parameter for both biofilm water and bulk water consisting of a buffer solution without nitrogen see experimental section fig 2 a shows the resulting 2d images for the repetition time tr varying from 0 1 s left to 5 s right the absolute image intensity increases with increasing tr as the magnetization is given more time to recover the signal intensity of each pixel was fitted as a function of tr with a mono exponential recovery curve in fig 2b we plotted the curve fitted for two pixels corresponding to biofilm water red and bulk water blue marked in fig 2a as example with this analysis a proton density map known as signal amplitude map fig 2c left and a t1 parameter map fig 2c right were obtained the amplitude map shows that the proton density a u is lower inside the biofilm than in the bulk water while the ac granule has a very low proton density due to absence of mobile protons in the ac and a too short signal relaxation time t2 for the water in the pores to be observable by mri the t1 map shows that t1 values of biofilm water 0 4 0 7 s and bulk water 2 s can indeed be distinguished a trend which was also seen by hoskin and co workers hoskins et al 1999 the t1 value of the biofilm water was lower than the bulk water value as the t1 relaxation time of water spins is affected by the different local physical and chemical environment in the biofilm belton and ratcliffe 1985 a t1 value of the ac granule could not be established due to the low intensity of the signal having established that biofilm and bulk water signal could be distinguished by their difference in t1 relaxation time the tr for maximum image contrast was determined using the recovery curves we used the value of tr at which the difference in signal intensity i e the contrast between bulk water and biofilm was the largest in this case we chose to use a tr of 0 7 s as indicated by the black dotted line fig 2b for all subsequent 3d mri experiments on the bioanodes as an alternative method to generate image contrast we proved on the same ac granule as used for t1 experiments in fig 2 that t2 weighting could be used as well to distinguish biofilm water t2 apparent 15 30 ms from bulk water t2 apparent 40 ms the reported apparent t2 values are specific for the resolution 47 47 200 μm3 and magnetic field strength 14 1 t used in this t2 experiment edzes et al 1998 however the low contrast we found between biofilm and the ac granule with t2 weighted images supplementary information s3 would impede the distinction and subsequent quantification of biofilm the contrast between biofilm water and bulk water in t2 experiments was also lower than in t1 experiments due to the smaller difference in t2 relaxation times at the required high resolutions edzes et al 1998 additionally performing full t2 weighted 3d experiments would take longer experimental time than t1 weighted experiments in fact it would require a tr of 5 t1 max with t1 max being the highest t1 relaxation time among the components in this case of bulk water t1 2 s therefore t1 weighted mri images were preferred for the present study 3 2 biofilm distribution using 3d mri fig 3 a shows a cross section of the 3d dataset of a granular bioanode where the biofilm was grown for 11 days the signal intensity of biofilm was higher than both the ac granule and the bulk water and could thus be used to determine biofilm growth as a cross section is not representative for the biofilm distribution on the whole granule surface a 3d reconstruction of the biofilm was made after selecting the voxels containing biofilm in each cross section by applying a threshold on the signal intensity fig 3b a 3d reconstruction of the biofilm showed the biofilm distribution and coverage fig 3c reconstruction depicted from three different angles turned around the vertical axis cross sections threshold images and images of the 3d volume reconstruction of every granular bioanode can be found in the supplementary information s4 additionally videos of the 3d reconstruction of each of the studied granules can also be found in the supplementary information video files the whole surface of the ac granule at day 11 was covered with biofilm except for an area that corresponds to the position of the clamp used as current collector this partly covered the surface of the ac granules hence preventing biofilm growth on this area therefore this served as an internal control within the 3d images indicating that bulk water at the granular surface was not falsely attributed to biofilm volume which is the case when a surface acts as a relaxation sink godefroy et al 2001 this internal control served thus as proof that mri image artefacts were not interfering in our study using the 3d reconstructions of all different granular bioanodes see supplementary information s4 and the video files we assessed biofilm growth at different days at early stages days 3 and 4 there were large surface areas of the ac granules that were not covered and the biofilm distribution was not homogeneous over the surface at later stages days 6 and 7 the biofilm was more equally distributed over the granule surface but it was still not very thick more mature granular bioanodes grown for 11 days or more had thicker biofilms that allowed for a clearer view of the biofilm distribution on the ac granule it is important to highlight that the area of the clamp was visible in every granular bioanode which served as an internal control as previously explained at the early growth stages when the biofilm was not much developed the area covered by the clamp was not as distinct as for more mature biofilms however when compared to an abiotic granule see also supplementary information s4 and video files this latter did not show a hole and the whole granule surface was instead covered by an equidistant signal originating from the surface of the ac granule acting as a relaxation sink godefroy et al 2001 3 3 biofilm volume determination using 3d mri fig 4 a shows the biofilm volume of 10 granular bioanodes each with different ac granule weight collected from the reactor at different days values ranged from 0 4 μl on day 4 to 2 μl on day 21 an increased biofilm volume is observed with longer growth periods for the time range studied here as biofilm thickness is known to be a crucial parameter for the electrochemical activity of bioanodes sun et al 2016 the average biofilm thickness was calculated assuming that the whole outer surface area of the granules was completely covered by biofilm see supplementary information s1 the lowest average thickness estimated was at day 4 with a value of 27 8 μm while the highest average thickness was 165 9 μm for the granular bioanode collected at day 21 this biofilm thickness is in the same range as reported for electroactive biofilms on macroscopically flat anodes jana et al 2014 molenaar et al 2018 the increasing thickness may be a contributing factor to the decrease of electric current production by the bioanodes over time as shown in fig 4b in fact some studies korth et al 2015 savéant 1986 have revealed that diffusion limitations increase with thicker biofilms which may hinder current production of the system 3 4 comparison of biofilm volume with total produced electric charge and total nitrogen content electric current production was recorded for each granular bioanode during the biofilm growth period see fig 4b most of them reached the maximum current ranging from 57 to 119 μa approximately 3 4 days after inoculation after those days the current decreased to values between 87 in day 6 and 44 in day 22 of the maximum current value in fact three weeks after inoculation current values seemed to approach a steady state this current curve appears to be characteristic for bioanodes that are continuously fed and controlled at a certain potential molenaar et al 2018 the variability of current values among granular bioanodes might relate to the granular material itself due to its irregularities in shape surface and porosity even when the raw material the activation process and the selected granule size is the same this variability was already found in a previous research study caizán juanarena et al 2019 where the reproducibility of single ac granules was proven for different granule sizes and types we expect current production to be related to biofilm volume as electroactive bacteria gain energy from transporting electrons from the substrate to the electrode to prove this we correlated the biofilm volume with the total produced electric charge i e current integrated over time see experimental section fig 4c revealed a linear relation of 66 4 c μl 1 r2 0 9 this value is in the same order of magnitude but 1 6 fold higher than the linear relation found for bioanodes by oct measurements molenaar et al 2018 similarly total nitrogen content can be used as an indication of biofilm growth as both the bacteria and the extracellular polymeric substances eps that are part of the biofilm contribute to the nitrogen content in fact the biofilm volume determined from 3d mri images was linearly related to total the total nitrogen content of granular bioanodes fig 4d the relation found was 17 μg n μl 1 r2 0 9 by characterizing the biofilm on the same granule using three different approaches in fact by recording the current production electrochemically determining the biofilm volume with mri and indirectly quantifying the biomass with total nitrogen content analysis makes this study complete especially correlating the total produced electric charge and the biofilm volume is a valuable information which is difficult to obtain non destructively with other methods nevertheless we believe mri should be seen as a complementary technique to other quantitative methods like protein and nitrogen analyses and particularly be used in studies where biofilm distribution or volume might give extra relevant information about the electrode biofilm interface or the mfc performance in general in this study we did not continuously monitor the same bioanode at different growth stages in terms of volume as the bioanode was permanently removed from the reactor on the day of the mri measurement however we showed that the correlation between electric charge nitrogen content and volume of the 10 measured bioanodes was independent from their growth stage and electrical performance meaning a larger number of samples would not give any extra information on this matter to make sure that these linear correlations did not deviate from the actual values due to a possible biofilm stability issue as consequence of long mri experimental times with no substrate additional total nitrogen analyses were done with fresh granular bioanodes directly collected from the reactor i e without any mri measurements the relation between nitrogen content and total produced electric charge was found to be similar see supplementary information s5 indicating that sample handling and the duration of mri measurement time had little effect on the amount of biofilm grown on ac granules and confirming the non destructive nature of mri even though biofilm detachment proved to be negligible based on these data the effect of the long experimental times and substrate absence during mri measurements on the biofilm morphology was not addressed to this aim in situ measurements are needed where bioanodes do not deviate from their original state and growth curve and where thus a non invasive nature is also achieved 3 5 challenges and outlook regarding the resolution used to visualize the biofilm distribution on ac granules mri images with a resolution of 28 μm 3 were sufficient to elucidate biofilm distribution but not to discriminate individual bacterial cells 1 μm bond and lovley 2003 or clusters below 28 μm potentially present in surface cavities or inner pores of the ac granules in fact by using sem to visualize the cross section of ac granules we found that bacterial growth occurred in their inner pores see supplementary information s6 therefore this might have caused an underestimation of biofilm growth on ac granules however 28 μm 3 was the optimum resolution with acceptable measurement times 24 h nevertheless previous research on single ac granules caizán juanarena et al 2019 showed a positive linear relation between nitrogen content as quantification of biomass and the outer surface area of granular electrodes strongly indicating a big contribution of biofilm growth on the surface this means 3d mri measurements in this study were able to cover to a large extent the total biofilm volume of granular bioanodes if we consider that mri can additionally show the distribution of biofilm over the electrode surface unlike other indirect quantitative measurements of biomass such as nitrogen or protein analyses it can be considered a valuable technique to study biofilms on flat but also porous electrodes higher resolutions than 28 μm 3 would allow to image the biofilm distribution more accurately but would require longer measurement times that might damage the integrity of the biofilm to achieve higher resolutions more sensitive detection coils or accelerated measurement techniques tsao and kozerke 2012 are recommended for the future another approach to achieve higher resolutions is to use an mri scanner with a higher magnetic field strength in fact within this research we also imaged granular bioanodes at 22 t but the paramagnetic ions present in ac granules see supplementary information s2 had a stronger effect on the mr signal at this field strength and the resulting image artefacts made biofilm quantification infeasible images not shown at 14 1 t the paramagnetic ions did not cause severe artefacts and therefore did not disturb biofilm visualization and quantification as this effect decreases with decreasing magnetic field strength high resolution 3d mri measurements on electrode materials as presented in this study can be easily applied to other complex geometry biofilms with other complex geometries of support structures the limiting factor to the smallest resolvable features is the maximum resolution attainable at a given magnetic field strength with the desired measurement time if the biofilm is not attached to an electrode support this could be even easier as measurements might suffer less from susceptibility artefacts as for the determination of biofilm volume it depends on several steps that can introduce errors that are not exactly quantifiable the choice of the threshold value in the image processing step is therefore crucial if this value is too high biofilm will not be counted while if the threshold is too low voxels containing bulk water will be attributed to biofilm in fact in the threshold images fig 3b and supplementary information s4 several voxels in the bulk water region and the pore water of granules are accounted as biofilm while in the biofilm region certain areas are instead not counted as such the signal intensity encountered within ac granules could mean that protons originating from either water or biofilm water were present in the internal pore structure of the granules this is difficult to resolve using mri due to the resolution of the 3d mri images 28 μm 3 and the presence of e g iron ions see supplementary information s2 that can cause mri image artefacts inside the granule furthermore even though we corrected for image intensity differences caused by an inhomogeneity in the detector of the mri equipment see experimental section small differences in image intensity remain and can cause local over or underestimation of the biofilm volume another inaccuracy results from partial volume effects gonzález ballester et al 2002 this means that if the voxel of 28 μm 3 is partly filled with biofilm and partly filled with bulk water it might not be accounted as biofilm volume the estimation of the partial volume effect has not been done in this study additionally to obtain a more accurate biofilm thickness from the 3d mri volume data determining the exact interfacial area between the biofilm and the ac granule would also be needed however this requires more sophisticated image processing procedures in any case mri image artefacts should always be carefully considered for biofilm visualization purposes as the signal identified as biofilm could originate from a different source e g relaxation sinks at the surface of the ac granule a next step in biofilm characterization of granular bioanodes with mri would be to perform in situ measurements renslow et al 2014 so that biofilm development can be followed in time for the same ac granules with no change in their growth conditions to this end the clamp containing the single bioanode could be inserted into the magnet in a flow cell which would allow flow of influent and effluent in that case efforts to reduce acquisition time i e more sensitive detector accelerated techniques tsao and kozerke 2012 in 3d mri measurements would be highly recommended as it would be preferable to stop the flow during mri measurements to minimize artefacts the material of the clamp i e current collector would need to be carefully selected to minimize susceptibility artefacts originating from the setup in the same way when working with real wastewater special attention should be paid to artefacts that might occur due to the complex composition of wastewater that contains e g more soluble metals than the lab electrolyte in case granular bioanodes with no attached current collector are collected from up scaled reactors treating wastewater as done in e g rodrigo quejigo et al 2018 developing a specific protocol for it could provide information about biofilm growth over time on these electrodes but again not for the same ac granule as in this study furthermore mri presents opportunities for biofilm research not only regarding structural information but also related to the study of its chemical composition by combining mri for localization with nmr spectroscopy for chemical compound identification localized detection of chemical compounds is already feasible in 20 30 μm thick 2d plane mclean et al 2008 renslow et al 2014 however currently the resolution is still too low to detect relevant low metabolite concentrations at the high spatial resolutions which would be required for the thin biofilm on the bioanodes of this study by translating recent sensitivity enhancement methods from the field of biomedical mri such as chemical exchange saturation transfer cest wu et al 2016 or spin hyperpolarization techniques nikolaou et al 2015 the metabolite concentrations could be detected with a higher spatial resolution in the future with the further improvements of this study as well as the other possibilities of biofilm characterization that mri offers i e diffusion and detection of chemical compounds this technique would not only serve to quantify and visualize biofilms in three dimensional electrode materials but also could provide strategies to improve the power output as well as to potentially elucidate on the degradation of complex organics during bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusions determining the distribution and morphology of electroactive biofilms as well as quantifying them is of upmost importance since biofilm growth ultimately determines the performance of microbial fuel cells mfcs in the case of activated carbon ac granules this is of particular interest in order to better understand the interaction between the biofilm and such highly porous electrode material in this study we have shown that high field 14 1 t magnetic resonance imaging mri can be used for high resolution 28 μm 3 imaging of thin biofilms 28 116 μm growing on granular electrodes in a multi anode mfc by using 3d mri we could visualize the electroactive biofilm on single ac granule surfaces with a high contrast between biofilm and bulk water and subsequently determine the biofilm volume as well as estimate its thickness at different growth stages from day 3 to day 22 for ac granules this would have not been possible to obtain with electrochemical chemical or other microscopy techniques moreover as it is a non destructive technique biofilm quantification was combined with another analytical technique i e total nitrogen content analysis to yield complementary information therefore the innovation of this study relies on the combination of using mri on granular electrodes complementary with other quantification techniques additionally high resolution 3d mri enabled the quantification of arbitrarily shaped thin biofilms growing on arbitrarily shaped electrodes for the first time in the future in situ experiments can be used to monitor biofilm growth and distribution on the same single ac granule in time as well as to implement this technique on electrode materials within other bioelectrochemical systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18431,laboratory scale experiments were conducted to investigate the bio transformation of the antidiabetic sitagliptin stg and the antihistamine fexofenadine fxf during wastewater treatment as inoculum either attached growth on carriers or suspended sludge from a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor hmbbr was used both target compounds were incubated in degradation experiments and quantified via lc ms ms for degradation kinetics furthermore transformation products tps were analyzed via high resolution mass spectrometry hrms structural elucidation of the tps was based on the high resolution molecular ion mass to propose a molecular formula and on ms2 fragmentation to elucidate the chemical structure of the tps in total 22 tps 9 tps for stg and 13 tps for fxf were detected in the experiments with stg and fxf for all tps chemical structures could be proposed stg was mainly transformed via amide hydrolysis and conjugation of the primary amine moiety in contrast fxf was predominantly transformed by oxidative reactions such as oxidation dehydrogenation and hydroxylation furthermore fxf was removed significantly faster in contact with carriers compared to suspended sludge whereas stg was degraded slightly faster in contact with suspended sludge moreover the primary tp of fxf was also degraded faster in contact with carriers leading to higher proportions of secondary tps thus the microbial community of both carriers and suspended sludge catalyzed the same primary transformation reactions but the transformation kinetics of fxf and the formation degradation of fxf tps were considerably higher in contact with carrier attached biomass the primary degradation of both target compounds in pilot and full scale conventional activated sludge cas and mbbr reactors reached 42 and 61 for fxf and stg respectively up to three of the identified tps of fxf and 8 tps of stg were detected in the effluents of pilot and full scale cas and mbbr graphical

oetken et al 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2010 ternes et al 2017 incomplete elimination has been observed for a large variety of micropollutants during conventional activated sludge cas treatment as wwtps are primarily designed to remove organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous micropollutants are mainly eliminated in wwtps by sorption and biotransformation hollender et al 2008 and for many organic compounds the latter has been identified as the main removal mechanism castronovo et al 2017 joss et al 2005 margot et al 2015 petrie et al 2014 reemtsma et al 2006 stumpf et al 1999 ternes et al 2004 the results of several studies confirmed that higher solid retention times srts can positively influence the removal of certain micropollutants during activated sludge treatment achermann et al 2018b falås et al 2012a kruglova et al 2016 petrie et al 2014 for this reason biofilm systems that offer longer retentions of grown biomass and potentially higher biodiversities of microbial communities might be an option to increase the micropollutant removal in the biological treatment steps of wwtps biofilm technologies involve attached biomass either on stationary surfaces e g biofilters or on smaller mobile carriers in suspension inside the reactor e g moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr both technologies provide an increased surface for microorganisms to grow on resulting in a biofilm with a

2019 golovko et al 2014 hermes et al 2018 kosonen and kronberg 2009 while xing et al 2018 showed that an enhanced nitrification could improve the primary degradation to about 85 fxf is administered as a racemic mixture both enantiomers are biologically active and camacho muñoz et al 2019 reported no differences on removal efficiencies between the two enantiomers due to the low removal rates in conventional wwtps fxf is emitted into receiving waters and it has been detected in surface water hermes et al 2018 kosonen and kronberg 2009 and groundwater wode et al 2015 in the low ng l 1 range even though fxf and stg were shown to be ubiquitously present in wastewater the knowledge on their biotransformation in wwtps is scarce and their degradability in contact with carrier attached biomass

wwtp koblenz and either carriers or sludge from the hybrid mbbr at wwtp koblenz see section 2 2 3 to attain a biomass concentration of about 1 g l 1 the final volume of the incubation mixture was approximately 250 ml the bottles were closed using screw caps with a silicone ptfe septum which was punctured with injection needles for aeration sampling and degassing in order to maintain oxic conditions the batches were constantly stirred and aerated after a short equilibration time of 1 h the batches were spiked with target compounds dissolved in ultra pure water either at 1 or 2 μg l 1 for studying the primary degradation kinetics or 100 μg l 1 for identifying tps to differentiate between biotic and abiotic removal processes additional batches setup with carriers and effluent were autoclaved two times for 15 min at 121 c and then spiked with target compounds the gas stream used for aeration was directed through 0 2 μm sterile syringe filters whatman to avoid any microbial

while being treated with sonication after scrubbing they were cleaned with ultra pure water dried for 24 h at 105 c and weighed again the carrier attached biomass was calculated as the difference

with carriers exp 2 1 and suspended sludge exp 2 2 collected from the hybrid mbbr at wwtp koblenz germany were conducted to identify tps of fxf during the experiments target compound spike 100 μg l 1 the formation of tps was observed in the aqueous phase over an incubation time of 16 d via qtof ms fxf was removed by 94 in contact with carrier attached biomass within 3 d and by 86 in contact with suspended sludge within 16 d fig 1 sorption processes were of minor importance for the decrease of fxf since the concentration in abiotic experiments only conducted with carrier attached biomass remained stable over the incubation time and the mean recovery in both biotic and abiotic experiments was 134 8 approximately 15 min after spiking thus the decrease of fxf in biotic batches was likely predominantly driven by biological processes in total 13 different tps were detected and all of them were found in experiments with both carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge only a difference in the intensity time courses was observed structural elucidation of the tps was based on the high resolution molecular ion mass esi esi which was used to propose a molecular formula and the ms2

reached maximum peak areas from 5 to 7 of the initial fxf peak area all other tps were considered to be of minor importance as their peak areas reached less than 1 of the initial fxf peak area while tp 499 tp 515 v and tp 353 appeared to be intermediates as their peak areas decreased after reaching a maximum the courses of tp 325 and tp 485 reached a plateau after 11 d and the peak area of tp 267

methylpropanoic acid consisting of part b minus a c3 unit m z 191 0703 c11h11o3 1 ppm were observed furthermore the diphenyl piperidin 4 yl methanol fragment consisting of part a of fxf molecule m z 268 1694 c18h22no 1 ppm and m z 250 1593 c18h20n 1 ppm after the loss of water supported the proposed chemical structure for details see si this was confirmed via the comparison with an authentic reference standard fexofenadione the observation that tp 499 was formed very quickly reaching 76 of fxf peak area within the first day of incubation with carriers and then decreased during the ongoing incubation is an indication that this tp was further transformed in contact with carriers fig 1a additional degradation experiments with tp 499 as the initial compound with carrier attached biomass exp 4 1 and 4 2 showed the formation of all other tps observed in experiments with fxf as the spiked compound moreover a back reaction of tp 499 to fxf partially occurred indicating that the reaction is reversible for details see si the reversibility of an alcohol oxidation and keto reduction respectively has already been reported for other micropollutants such as codeine wick et al 2011b climbazole brienza and chiron 2017 and sulisobenzone beel et al 2013 tp 515 was detected at a mean m z of 516 2742 c32h38no5 m h 1 ppm and was most likely formed by oxidation of the secondary alcohol tp 499 and a hydroxylation atomic modification of fxf o h2 as shown in fig 2 the extracted ion chromatogram xic of m z 516 2745 0 002 revealed at least 5 peaks tp 515 i to v see si of isobaric compounds which can be attributed to different possible positions of the formed hydroxyl moiety all of them showed an increasing intensity over the incubation time of 16 d tp 515 v m z 516 2749 1 ppm was the most intense peak reaching 30 of the initial fxf peak area within 9 d of incubation time with carriers tp 515 i to iv reached less than 1 of the initial fxf peak area characteristic fragment ions m z 233 1167 c14h17o3 2 ppm and m z 191 0702 c11h11o3 1 ppm in the ms2 spectrum positive ionization mode of tp 515 v revealed that part b remained unaltered see also fragmentation of tp 499 a proximate localization of the hydroxyl group in the predominant isomer tp 515 v was only possible using ms2 data required in negative ionization mode here fragment ions m z 282 1506 c18h20no2 2 ppm consisting of part a of the fxf molecule with an additional hydroxyl moiety and m z 105 0351 representing the cleavage of c7h5o 5 ppm gave clear hints for the hydroxyl group to be located at one of the benzene rings in part a of the tp 515 v molecule however the position of the introduced hydroxyl group of the other isomers could not be determined fig 2 furthermore tp 353 with a considerable lower molecular mass m z 354 2064 m h compared to fxf m z 502 2952 m h was observed reaching 5 of the initial fxf peak area within 11 d in contact with carrier attached biomass based on the proposed molecular formula c22h28no3 m h 0 1 ppm and the ms2 spectra it was postulated that part a of the fxf molecule remained unaltered fragment m z 250 1587 c18h20n 1 ppm while fragment m z 87 0441 c4h7o2 m h 7 ppm indicated that the benzoyl moiety in part b was oxidized resulting in an oxidative cleavage forming a terminal carboxylic acid at the butyl carbon chain a similar transformation of benzoyl moieties has already been observed in previous studies for the uv filter sulisobenzone beel et al 2013 and trimethoprim jewell et al 2016a this reaction is assumed to lead also to the formation of 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 methylpropanoic acid as cleavage product which however could not be observed in this study this might be explained by a fast microbial transformation mineralization or uptake into the biomass tp 325 reached 7 of the initial fxf peak area at the end of the incubation period with carriers based on the proposed molecular formula m z 326 1753 c20h24no3 m h 1 ppm tp 325 was formed from tp 353 via the loss of ethene c2h4 furthermore the fragment m z 140 0846 c7h12no2 12 ppm in the ms2 spectrum of tp 325 indicated the presence of a 2 piperidin 1 yl acetic acid unit for details see si this suggests that tp 325 is formed by an oxidation of tp 353 at the β carbon of the carboxylic moiety leading to the cleavage of acetate this β oxidation is a very common transformation process for compounds containing carboxyalkyl groups neilson and allard 2008 and has also been observed for micropollutants such as primaquine gulde et al 2016 or penciclovir prasse et al 2011 tp 267 has also a lower mass m z 268 1693 m h compared to fxf m z 502 2952 m h it reached up to 5 of the initial fxf peak area at the end of the incubation period with carriers based on the proposed molecular formula c18h22no 1 ppm and detection of characteristic fragments of the piperidine m z 82 0646 c5h8n 6 ppm as well as the diphenylmethyl moiety m z 167 0858 c13h11 2 ppm it was identified as diphenyl piperidin 4 yl methanol this could be confirmed by means of a commercially available reference standard the formation of tp 267 is proposed to occur via dealkylation of the tertiary amine since the decrease of fxf was much more rapid compared to the increase of tp 267 it can be assumed that tp 267 is not a primary tp of fxf rather it might be formed directly out of tp 499 or maybe more likely after β oxidation of tp 499 to tp 325 a n dealkylation of tertiary amines has already been observed for several micropollutants such as venlafaxine lidocaine pyrilamine n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide deet and valsartan gulde et al 2016 helbling et al 2010b in degradation experiments with carriers spiking tp 267 100 µg l 1 the formation of further tps was detected while the concentration of tp 267 decreased by 15 within 11 d of incubation according to their exact masses m z 284 1650 c18h22no2 2 ppm four isobaric tps formed in low amounts 1 of the spiked tp 267 peak area see si are formed by hydroxylation of tp 267 four structural isomers tp 283 i iv are in accordance with hydroxylation reactions taking place at the preferential ortho and para positions of the aromatic rings as well as the ortho and meta positions of the piperidine ring moreover two tps tp 281 i ii with exact masses m z 282 1493 c18h20no2 1 ppm were detected tp 281 i reached up to 2 of the initial tp 267 peak area further details see si the proposed molecular formula as well as the ms2 fragment m z 96 9456 c5h6no 13 ppm suggest a keto group at the piperidine ring details see si which can be explained by further oxidation of those two structural isomers of tp 283 with a hydroxyl group at the piperidine ring however all these tps of tp 267 could not be detected in experiments with fxf or tp 499 as the spiked substance this can be explained by both the low intensities of tp 267 in experiments with fxf or tp 499 maximum of 5 of the initial spike concentration and the rather slow formation of tp 281 and tp 283 with a detected exact mass m z 486 2640 a molecular formula of c31h36no4 m h 1 ppm was predicted for tp 485 this mass can be explained by a loss of one of the methyl groups in part b of the tp 499 molecule ms2 data confirmed this assumption as the fragment ion m z 219 1031 c13h15o3 7 ppm representing the loss of 2 4 butyrylphenyl propanoic acid part b without a methyl group was detected it is assumed that tp 485 was formed via the hydroxylation of one of the methyl moieties followed by further oxidation to an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid since dicarboxylic acids are rather unstable one of the carboxyl moieties was possibly cleaved decarboxylation tp 485 was formed by up to 6 of the initial fxf peak area within 11 d and remained stable for the following 5 d of incubation with carrier attached biomass further tps which will not be discussed in detail because their intensities were less than 1 of the initial fxf peak area tp 501 tp 517 tp 533 tp 531 were mainly intermediate products formed by combinations of one fold or two fold hydroxylation and oxidation of alcohol to keto moieties of the main tps the lab scale degradation of fxf at elevated concentrations was considerably slower in contact with suspended sludge removal of 86 within 16 d compared to carrier attached biomass removal of 94 within 3 d even though the same tps were detected in both experiments the intensities of the tps as well as their time courses showed specific differences over the incubation time fig 1 for the main product tp 499 the increase was much faster in contact with carrier attached biomass reaching 76 within 3 d of incubation compared to 81 within 9 d in contact with suspended sludge furthermore a decrease within the ongoing incubation was observed which was not observed in experiments with suspended sludge fig 1 similar results were attained for tp 515 v as it was formed to a significantly higher proportion by a factor of 4 in contact with carrier attached biomass fig 1 3 1 2 transformation pathway of fxf at environmental concentrations in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge in order to investigate the fate of fxf in contact with carrier attached and suspended sludge biomass lab scale experiments were conducted with environmentally relevant concentrations spiked at 1 μg l 1 of the target compound fxf is removed in contact with suspended biomass with a pseudo first order kinetic rate constant of 0 24 0 04 l g d 1 whereas the removal in contact with carrier attached biomass was significantly faster achieving a rate constant of 0 84 0 02 l g d 1 where g refers to grams biomass attached or suspended fig 3 a similar transformation pathway observed with elevated spike concentrations was also attained at environmental concentrations in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge however not all previously observed tps were detected most likely due to their low concentrations in contact with suspended sludge fxf was degraded by 80 within 7 d of incubation time consistent with experiments at high fxf concentrations tp 499 was the most dominant tp formed during the incubation period quantification of tp 499 revealed that 58 of the initial fxf concentration was transformed to tp 499 within 7 d the mass balance of fxf and tp 499 reached 80 fig 3b1 further tps detected were tp 515 v and tp 485 which could not be quantified by reference standards but reached 4 tp 485 and 2 tp 515 v of the initial fxf peak area hence it can be expected that there was still a small gap in the mass balance of about 15 fig 3b1 which might be explained by additional tps which have not been observed due to detection limits or method boundaries in degradation experiments with fxf in contact with carrier attached biomass tp 499 was also observed as the main primary tp however in contrast to experiments with suspended biomass tp 499 concentration did not continuously increase but decreased after reaching a maximum of 57 within 1 d of incubation time to about 10 after 7 d fig 3a1 while with suspended sludge only a minor formation of tp 515 v could be observed incubation with carriers led to an increase of tp 515 v to about 99 of the initial fxf peak area between 9 h and 7 d of incubation time fig 3a2 based on the peak areas the results indicate an almost quantitative transformation of tp 499 to the hydroxylated tp 515 v in addition the formation of tp 485 reaching 2 of initial fxf peak area tp 353 reaching 4 of initial fxf peak area and tp 267 reaching 6 of fxf initial concentration was observed with carriers therefore in contact with carrier attached biomass tp 499 is further transformed to tp 353 via oxidative cleavage at the benzoyl moiety to tp 267 via n dealkylation and to tp 485 via hydroxylation oxidation and decarboxylation neither tp 353 nor tp 267 was observed in experiments with suspended sludge at environmental spike concentrations which might be due to concentrations under the detection limits as conclusion the removal of fxf in lab scale experiments was four times faster in contact with carrier attached biomass compared to suspended sludge in addition also the primary product tp 499 was transformed considerably faster in contact with attached biomass which resulted in the detection of two more tps tp 353 and tp 267 therefore except for tp 485 all detected follow up tps of tp 499 tp 515 v tp 353 tp 267 were formed to a considerable higher proportion tp 515 v by a factor of 50 in contact with carrier attached biomass compared to suspended sludge only the transformation of tp 499 to tp 485 was observed to a slightly higher proportion in suspended sludge by a factor of 2 most of these observations at environmentally relevant concentrations generally fit the results gained from experiments with elevated concentrations table 2 this is especially true for the main transformation products tp 499 and tp 515 v which were formed to higher proportions tp 499 and tp 515 v and were further degraded tp 499 in contact with carrier attached biomass hence the carrier attached microorganisms facilitated the catalysis of some of the observed oxidative reactions such as the alcohol oxidation β oxidation n dealkylation and the aromatic hydroxylation leading to a faster degradation of fxf and formation of tp 499 tp 353 tp 267 and tp 515 v respectively this is in agreement with some previous studies reporting a faster degradation of certain micropollutants in contact with carrier attached biomass compared to suspended biomass falås et al 2013 zupanc et al 2013 for example falås et al 2013 observed a considerably faster transformation of diclofenac and valsartan whose primary tps are formed by hydroxylation jewell et al 2016b and oxidative n dealkylation helbling et al 2010b respectively 3 2 transformation of sitagliptin stg in lab scale experiments 3 2 1 identification of transformation products similar to fxf the transformation of stg was also studied at an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 in lab scale degradation experiments with carriers and suspended sludge measurements with lc qtof ms revealed a decrease of the stg concentration by 98 within 5 d fig 4 as well as the formation of several tps in both cases in contrast to fxf removal of stg was as fast in contact with carriers as with suspended sludge in total the formation of 9 different tps was observed and for all tps chemical structures could be proposed moreover the structures of 5 tps tp 192 tp 449 tp 406 tp 176 tp 190 were unambiguously confirmed with available reference standards further tps tp 408 tp 435 tp 505 and tp 507 were identified via characteristic fragment ions in the following section it will be referred to part a and b of stg molecule as it is specified in fig 6 the overall transformation pathway with proposed chemical structures of the formed tps and details on the reaction mechanisms are shown in fig 6 all tps found in incubation experiments with carrier attached biomass were also formed in contact with suspended sludge only slightly differences in the intensity time courses were observed transformation reactions consisted of conjugation reactions e g n acetylation oxidations oxidative deamination alpha and beta oxidation and amide hydrolysis which are described in detail in this section high resolution analysis revealed tp 449 as one of the quantitatively most relevant tps as its peak area reached about 17 and 7 of the spiked stg peak area within 3 d of incubation in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge respectively fig 4 by detecting the exact mass of m z 450 1357 and the fragment ions m z 258 0739 c12h11f3no2 1 ppm and m z 60 0442 c2h6no 3 ppm representing part a of stg molecule with an acetyl moiety and the cleaved acetylated primary amine respectively tp 449 could be proposed as n acteyl stg the proposed structure was also confirmed by means of an authentic reference standard tp 449 is formed via acteylation of the primary amine n acetylation can be catalyzed by n acetyltransferase with acetyl coenzyme a as acetyl donor and typically involves weakly basic nh2 groups testa and kramer 2008 acetylated products of pharmaceuticals such as sulfadiazine propranolol sulfamethoxazole smx and p aminosalicylic acid noda et al 1995 vree et al 1995 weber 1973 are also very common as human metabolites n acetylation has already been observed for sulfamethoxazole primaquine and mexilatine in wastewater treatment processes or incubation studies with activated sludge gulde et al 2016 hermes et al 2018 after reaching its maximum tp 449 concentration stayed stable for the ongoing incubation suggesting not to be further transformed separate incubation experiments with tp 449 in contact with carrier attached biomass exp 4 1 and 4 2 support this assumption as no removal was observed over an incubation time of 5 d see si n acetylations can be reversible reactions as it has been shown for n acetyl smx which is deconjugated rather fast in contact with activated sludge achermann et al 2018a göbel et al 2005 that was however not observed for acetylated stg here the balance appeared to lie on the side of the conjugated form see incubation experiments with tp 449 as initial compound in the si further conjugation reactions detected within the degradation of stg were the n formylation tp 435 m z 436 1192 c17h16f6n5o2 2 ppm and n succinylation tp 507 m z 508 1419 c20h20f6n5o4 1 ppm characteristic fragment ions elucidating their chemical structures were m z 244 0609 c11h9f3no2 12 ppm for tp 435 and m z 316 0780 c14h13f3no4 3 ppm for tp 507 for details see si however based on the maximum peak areas tp 435 and tp 507 were only marginally formed 1 within the degradation of stg fig 4 moreover in contrast to the acetylated stg tp 449 tp 435 and tp 507 were further transformed the detection of tp 505 m z 506 1254 c20h18f6n5o4 1 ppm with a mass difference of 2 h compared to tp 507 indicated that tp 507 can be further transformed to tp 505 by oxidation of the succinyl to a fumaryl moiety n fumarylation has also been observed for ortho chlorophenylpiperazine n demethylpheniramine secondary amine and for mexiletine primary amine and was proposed to proceed either via direct n fumarylation or n succinylation with following oxidation gulde et al 2016 the oxidation dehydrogenation of succinate to fumarate is part of the citric acid cycle and is catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase michal and schomburg 2002 tp 192 appeared to be the quantitative most relevant tp as the peak area reached about 25 and 32 of the spiked stg peak area in lab scale experiments with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge respectively fig 4 based on the detected exact mass m z 193 0695 in positive ionization mode and fragment ions m z 138 0272 c3h3f3n3 1 ppm and m z 56 0859 c3h6n 14 ppm representing the trifluoromethylated triazole part and the remaining part of the piperazine ring respectively tp 192 was identified as 3 trifluoromethyl 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 1 2 4 triazolo 4 3 a pyrazine formed by amide hydrolysis fig 6 this could be confirmed by comparison with an authentic reference standard separate degradation experiments with tp 192 exp 4 1 and 4 2 spike 2 μg l 1 or 100 μg l 1 revealed no significant decrease in tp 192 concentration within an incubation time of 3 d see si due to the fact that the recovery of the spiked tp 192 concentration in the batch experiments was 99 after 15 h removal by sorption seems to be of minor importance as a consequence tp 192 appears to be a rather stable tp of stg which is not or only very slowly further transformed tp 190 was only detected via measurements with lc ms ms in smrm mode and not via lc qtof ms though the identification and quantification of tp 190 as 2 2 4 5 trifluorophenyl acetic acid was possible by means of an authentic reference standard it is likely that tp 190 was formed out of the remaining part a of stg molecule after the cleavage of tp 192 via amide hydrolysis reactions which are likely to form tp 190 might be the amide hydrolysis supposed intermediate product sip 233 not observed and an oxidative deamination sip 232 fig 6 followed by beta oxidation at the c8 atom the time courses of tp 190 in experiments spiked with elevated stg concentrations are shown in fig 5 tp 190 was only detected in experiments with suspended sludge reaching a maximum amount of 33 of stg initial molar concentration after 5 d of incubation however tp 190 was further transformed as its concentration decreased within the ongoing incubation tp 176 with an exact mass of m z 175 0011 m h and the proposed molecular formula c7h2f3o2 1 ppm was identified as 2 4 5 trifluorobenzoic acid characteristic fragment ions such as m z 131 0101 c6h2f3 10 ppm and m z 111 0051 c6hf2 1 ppm represent the cleavage of co2 and subsequent loss of hf respectively the structure of tp 176 was unambiguously confirmed with an authentic reference standard the increase of the proportion of tp 176 to 9 of the initial stg molar concentration parallel to the decrease of tp 190 between incubation day 5 and 16 in the experiment with suspended sludge fig 5 might be an indication that tp 176 is formed from tp 190 this could be explained by an alpha oxidation at the c7 atom as for example has also been observed for phenylacetic acid in pure culture studies mohamed et al 2002 in experiments with carriers tp 176 concentration increased to 9 of the initial stg molar concentration within 5 d which was faster compared to suspended sludge see fig 5a and b this could also be an explanation for tp 190 not being detected in experiments with carriers since it might be very fast further transformed to tp 176 after reaching a maximum concentration tp 176 decreased suggesting that this tp might also be further transformed fig 5b a degradation of two fold fluorinated benzoate has already been observed in pure culture studies with pseudomonas putida jt 102 neilson and allard 2002 a further degradation product was tp 406 due to its exact mass m z 407 0930 and detected fragment ion m z 215 0320 c10h6f3o2 3 ppm representing part a of the molecule a chemical structure with a keto moity instead of the primary amine could be proposed c16h13f6n4o2 2 ppm structural confirmation was conducted using an analytical standard 1 3 trifluoromethyl 6 8 dihydro 5h 1 2 4 triazolo 4 3 a pyrazin 7 yl 4 2 4 5 trifluorophenyl butane 1 3 dione as a reference formation of tp 406 can be attributed to an oxidative dealkylation which in case of a primary amine can also be described as a deamination a systematic study of gulde et al 2016 showed that oxidative dealkylation is a typical transformation reaction for amines in contact with activated sludge even though it was found that primary amines were less accessible than secondary and tertiary amines another tp observed was tp 408 with an exact mass of m z 409 1097 c16h15f6n4o2 1 ppm structural elucidation was conducted via the fragment ion m z 391 0986 c16h13f6n4o 1 ppm which was formed by the loss of water neutral loss of 18 due to the fact that in the ms2 data of stg a loss of nh3 neutral loss 17 was observed instead of a water cleavage tp 408 was proposed to be formed from tp 406 by the reduction of the keto group resulting in an alcohol moiety further fragment ions such as m z 193 0699 c6h8f3n4 1 ppm and m z 171 0416 c9h6f3 1 ppm supported this conclusion nevertheless similar to tp 406 tp 408 did not occur in a significant proportion as its peak area reached less than 1 of the initial stg peak area in contact with carriers and suspended sludge moreover the time course of tp 408 over the incubation time revealed that it is further transformed because its intensities are decreasing after 1 d fig 4 separate lab scale experiments with the reference standard of tp 406 and carrier attached biomass confirmed that except for the n conjugated tps all other identified stg tps tp 176 tp 190 tp 192 and tp 408 were also observed during the incubation of tp 406 see si section s5 4 as already mentioned the formation of tp 408 can be explained by the reduction of the keto group of tp 406 formation of tp 192 might be attributed to an amide cleavage and tp 190 by a following beta oxidation of the remaining carboxylated part a of tp 406 fig 6 a further alpha oxidation of tp 190 trifluorophenylacetic acid would lead to tp 176 trifluorobenzoic acid however since in batch experiments with stg the concentrations of tp 406 were steadily increasing but remained very low 1 of the initial peak area of stg until the end of the incubation period fig 4 when no further formation of tp 192 could be observed it was assumed that tp 406 is not a major intermediate in the transformation pathway of stg rather it is expected that the major part of tp 192 tp 190 and tp 176 is formed from stg via amide cleavage formation of tp 192 followed by a beta oxidation and oxidative deamination of the remaining part a leading to tp 190 which is further transformed to trifluorobenzoic acid tp 176 by an alpha oxidation fig 6 for many compounds it has been reported that hydrolysis of tertiary amide moieties occurs only after a primary dealkylation reaction leading to a secondary amide helbling et al 2010a however in this study a n dealkylation which would lead to an opening of the piperazine ring of part b of stg could not be observed quantification of the tps for which authentic reference standards were available revealed that these tps accounted for 35 and 39 of the removed stg at the end of incubation in contact with carriers and suspended sludge respectively taking molar concentrations of stg tp 406 tp 192 and tp 449 into account since the sum of the peak areas of the other identified tps accounted for less than 2 of the initial stg peak area it seems unlikely that the lack in the mass balance can be fully explained by these tps in the autoclaved control with carriers a recovery of about 30 of the spiked amount of stg at the first sampling time point after 15 min indicated a loss of stg by sorption processes this would be in accordance with the fact that at the experimental ph mainly between 7 and 8 the amino group of stg pka 8 8 chemicalize 2019 is mainly positively charged the positive charge has been shown to lead to a considerable enhanced sorption of micropollutants to activated sludge stevens garmon et al 2011 wick et al 2011a considering the recovery of stg in the autoclaved experiments and the total organic carbon toc a log koc of 4 1 l kg 1 could be estimated for the carrier attached biomass this is in the same range as the log koc of 4 1 l kg 1 determined for stg in sorption experiments with river sediment boulard et al 2019 submitted 3 2 2 transformation of stg at environmental concentrations in contact with carrier attached and suspended sludge biomass to investigate whether the results from experiments with elevated stg concentrations can be transferred to environmentally relevant concentrations stg was also incubated in lab scale degradation experiments with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge under biotic and abiotic conditions the latter only with carrier attached biomass using an initial spike level of 1 μg l 1 in biotic experiments exp 1 1 and 1 2 an exponential decrease of stg concentrations was observed stg was removed by 99 from the liquid phase within 5 d of incubation in contact with both carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge fig 7 as discussed above it can be assumed that the removal of stg was caused by both sorption and degradation processes therefore only apparent first order rate constants k of stg for its overall dissipation in biotic experiments were calculated according to equation 1 in contrast to fxf stg was removed slightly faster in contact with suspended sludge k of 1 27 0 07 l g d 1 compared to carrier attached biomass k of 0 85 0 04 l g d 1 the detected tps of stg were comparable with the results gained from experiments with elevated concentrations whereas only 3 tp 192 tp 449 tp 406 out of 9 tps could be observed also here tp 192 formed via amide hydrolysis appeared to be the quantitatively most relevant tp as its concentration increased to 55 and 73 of the initial stg concentration within 3 d of incubation in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge respectively fig 7 tp 406 formed via oxidative deamination and tp 449 n acetylation were found to be only of minor importance as similar to the results from the high spike experiments their concentrations reached 1 and 9 in contact with carrier attached biomass and 1 and 5 in contact with suspended sludge respectively of the spiked stg concentration further tps might not have been observed due to their concentrations below the detection limits a higher formation of tp 192 most likely by amide hydrolysis in contact with suspended sludge compared to attached biomass could indicate that in contrast to certain oxidative reactions hydrolytic enzymes might be facilitated in the suspended sludge however systematic studies with a larger set of micropollutants which are known to be initially transformed by hydrolytic reactions would be needed to confirm this hypothesis the gap in the mass balance observed at the end of the incubation period was around 40 and 30 in batches with carriers and suspended sludge respectively and thus lower compared to the high spike experiments as discussed above it is likely that at least part of this gap is caused by sorption moreover i other competition reactions leading to unknown tps which were not amenable to the applied chromatographic and mass spectrometric method ii uptake into the biomass or iii mineralization of stg and or tps cannot be excluded studies with radiolabeled stg would be an option to close the mass balance but this was out of the scope of this study 3 3 the occurrence of stg and fxf and their biological tps in full scale wwtps and pilot plants in order to confirm that the formation of tps identified in lab scale experiments can also be observed in pilot and full scale wastewater treatment monitoring campaigns were carried out three 24 h composite samples were gained from the wwtp lundåkra time proportional sampling consisting of a full scale activated sludge cas treatment followed by a polishing mbbr pilot reactor 1 m³ 6 h hrt and from wwtp margretelund flow proportional sampling equipped with four aerated and non aerated for predenitrification bod removal nitrification postdenitrification average hrt of 8 h mbbr compartments volume 306 m³ 1500 m³ connected in series for details see section 2 2 both located in sweden in addition four time proportional 72 h composite samples were collected from two pilot sbrs one cas and one hybrid mbbr both with 12 h hrt and 12 d srt run in parallel at the wwtp koblenz germany see section 2 2 and the si the influent concentrations of fxf were in a rather narrow range between 0 30 wwtp lundåkra and 0 35 μg l 1 wwtp margretelund see fig 8 this is consistent with other studies reporting german raw wastewater concentrations of 0 15 0 54 μg l 1 hermes et al 2018 the full scale mbbr at wwtp margretelund removed fxf by 41 13 compared to no considerable removal in the cas treatment 6 9 and the polishing mbbr pilot plant 7 1 at lundåkra wwtp negligible removal of fxf observed in wwtp lundåkra is in accordance with already reported removal between 9 and 36 in conventional wastewater treatment bourgin et al 2018 camacho muñoz et al 2019 golovko et al 2014 hermes et al 2018 kosonen and kronberg 2009 in the pilot reactors at wwtp koblenz fxf was removed by 31 and 42 in the cas and hybrid mbbr respectively consistent with the lab experiments tp 499 appeared to be the major tp formed as it accounted for 148 and 97 of the removed fxf concentration in the cas and hybrid mbbr system at wwtp koblenz respectively an exception was the full scale mbbr at wwtp margretelund where the concentration of tp 499 in the effluent could only explain about 25 of the removed fxf concentration in addition to tp 499 the formation of two further secondary tps tp 515 v and tp 485 could be confirmed for both the cas and hybrid mbbr system at wwtp koblenz fig 8 however since no reference standards were available tp 515 v and tp 485 could not be quantified based on the peak area these tps accounted for approximately 30 of the removed fxf peak area detected influent concentrations for stg were between 0 8 μg l 1 wwtp margretelund and 2 5 μg l 1 wwtp koblenz fig 9 at wwtp lundåkra stg was removed to a minor extent in the cas step 22 8 while there was no significant removal in the pilot polishing mbbr 3 5 a relatively low removal of 19 11 was also observed for the full scale mbbr at the wwtp margretelund in contrast stg was removed to a higher extent in the sbrs at the wwtp koblenz both in the cas system 46 4 and the hybrid mbbr 61 7 for stg only a removal of 40 in conventional wastewater treatment was reported so far hermes et al 2018 in total up to 8 out of 9 tps observed in lab scale experiments were also detected in the effluent samples of the different full and pilot scale plants surprisingly in addition to the 3 tps also detected in the low spike lab experiments tp 192 tp 406 and tp 449 the samples from the full and pilot scale reactors confirmed the presence of 5 more tps tp 408 tp 190 tp 176 tp 507 and tp 435 which were previously exclusively detected in the high spike lab experiments three tps tp 449 tp 192 and tp 408 were already present in the influent samples suggesting that these tps are either minor human metabolites or to some extent already formed in the sewer system however except for tp 408 which has been identified as a metabolite after incubation with rat hepatocytes khreit et al 2016 higher concentrations of tps were measured in the effluent samples confirming their formation during biological wastewater treatment consistent with lab scale experiments tp 192 appeared to be the quantitatively most relevant tp reaching maximum effluent concentrations of 0 46 μg l 1 and 0 62 μg l 1 in the effluents of the cas and hybrid mbbr system of the wwtp koblenz respectively fig 9 this accounted for approximately 70 of the removed molar stg concentration in both sbrs in total tps contributing to the mass balance tp 192 tp 449 tp 406 explained approximately 80 of the removed stg which is in good accordance with results gained from the incubation experiments for the swedish mbbrs only a rather small part of the removed stg could be attributed to the identified tps however this might be explained by the rather low removal efficiency for stg leading to high uncertainties when calculating mass balances 4 conclusion lab scale degradation experiments with the two pharmaceuticals commonly found in wastewater fxf and stg in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge as well as monitoring campaigns for the occurrence of the studied compounds and their biological tps at full and pilot scale plants resulted in the following conclusions consistent with previous reports that carrier attached biofilms facilitate the transformation of certain micropollutants fxf was transformed significantly faster in contact with carriers than in contact with suspended sludge from a hybrid mbbr the oxidative formation and transformation of the primary tp of fxf tp 499 was catalyzed much faster in experiments with carriers thus it might be hypothesized that especially oxidative reactions are favored in carrier attached biomass in contrast suspended biomass might be assumed to be more capable of catalyzing certain hydrolytic reactions like the amide hydrolysis of stg to tp 192 which was formed to higher amounts in experiments with suspended sludge however more transformation studies comprising a large set of micropollutants with various functional moieties as well as different carrier attached biofilms are needed to confirm a general specificity towards certain transformation reactions moreover molecular biological investigations such as metatranscriptomics might be promising tools to investigate whether this specificity is also reflected by distinct differences in the abundance of certain enzymes and or microorganisms monitoring campaigns at pilot and full scale plants confirmed results from lab experiments that the usage of carriers can improve the removal of fxf the fxf tp 499 as well as the stg tps 192 and 449 were found to be the dominant tps and should therefore be included in up coming monitoring and effect studies to further assess their occurrence and fate in the urban water cycle as well as their ecotoxicological relevance declaration of

18431,laboratory scale experiments were conducted to investigate the bio transformation of the antidiabetic sitagliptin stg and the antihistamine fexofenadine fxf during wastewater treatment as inoculum either attached growth on carriers or suspended sludge from a hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor hmbbr was used both target compounds were incubated in degradation experiments and quantified via lc ms ms for degradation kinetics furthermore transformation products tps were analyzed via high resolution mass spectrometry hrms structural elucidation of the tps was based on the high resolution molecular ion mass to propose a molecular formula and on ms2 fragmentation to elucidate the chemical structure of the tps in total 22 tps 9 tps for stg and 13 tps for fxf were detected in the experiments with stg and fxf for all tps chemical structures could be proposed stg was mainly transformed via amide hydrolysis and conjugation of the primary amine moiety in contrast fxf was predominantly transformed by oxidative reactions such as oxidation dehydrogenation and hydroxylation furthermore fxf was removed significantly faster in contact with carriers compared to suspended sludge whereas stg was degraded slightly faster in contact with suspended sludge moreover the primary tp of fxf was also degraded faster in contact with carriers leading to higher proportions of secondary tps thus the microbial community of both carriers and suspended sludge catalyzed the same primary transformation reactions but the transformation kinetics of fxf and the formation degradation of fxf tps were considerably higher in contact with carrier attached biomass the primary degradation of both target compounds in pilot and full scale conventional activated sludge cas and mbbr reactors reached 42 and 61 for fxf and stg respectively up to three of the identified tps of fxf and 8 tps of stg were detected in the effluents of pilot and full scale cas and mbbr graphical abstract image 1 keywords biotransformation transformation products moving bed biofilm reactor sitagliptin fexofenadine 1 introduction it is well documented that the entry of polar micropollutants into surface waters and receiving aquatic compartments such as marine systems or ground water occurs via the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps a zoumpouli et al 2019 li and mclachlan 2019 nödler et al 2016 stumpf et al 1999 ternes 1998 and was shown to result in an increasing awareness due to the potential threat they pose on the environmental ecosystems and human health oetken et al 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2010 ternes et al 2017 incomplete elimination has been observed for a large variety of micropollutants during conventional activated sludge cas treatment as wwtps are primarily designed to remove organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorous micropollutants are mainly eliminated in wwtps by sorption and biotransformation hollender et al 2008 and for many organic compounds the latter has been identified as the main removal mechanism castronovo et al 2017 joss et al 2005 margot et al 2015 petrie et al 2014 reemtsma et al 2006 stumpf et al 1999 ternes et al 2004 the results of several studies confirmed that higher solid retention times srts can positively influence the removal of certain micropollutants during activated sludge treatment achermann et al 2018b falås et al 2012a kruglova et al 2016 petrie et al 2014 for this reason biofilm systems that offer longer retentions of grown biomass and potentially higher biodiversities of microbial communities might be an option to increase the micropollutant removal in the biological treatment steps of wwtps biofilm technologies involve attached biomass either on stationary surfaces e g biofilters or on smaller mobile carriers in suspension inside the reactor e g moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr both technologies provide an increased surface for microorganisms to grow on resulting in a biofilm with a variety of different conditions torresi et al 2016 mbbrs have recently been reported to be a promising alternative to improve the removal of compounds with no or limited degradation in cas treatment such as diclofenac clofibric acid and x ray contrast media casas et al 2015 falås et al 2012b jewell et al 2016b sitagliptin stg is an antidiabetic agent of the dipeptidyl peptidase iv inhibitor dpp 4 class and during the last 10 years 2007 2017 the prescription increased from 5 to 159 million daily defined dosages 0 1 g in germany the occurrence of stg in wastewater and receiving waters has rarely been investigated hermes et al 2018 martín et al 2012 posselt et al 2018 but maximum concentrations of 3 4 μg l 1 in influents and 0 2 μg l 1 in effluents of german wwtps have been reported hermes et al 2018 to the best of the authors knowledge only one study reported the fate of stg in three german wwtps and a mean removal of 40 was observed during the biological treatment step hermes et al 2018 furthermore scheurer et al 2017 investigated the biodegradability of stg in the zahn wellens test oecd 302 b concerning the biological formation of the very persistent and highly polar trifluoroacetic acid tfa an increase of tfa by less than 1 of the spiked stg concentration was observed while no further transformation products tps were identified the h1 antihistamine fexofenadine fxf is prescribed

kronberg 2009 and for uk wwtps at 2 2 μg l 1 camacho muñoz et al 2019 the removal rates of fxf tend to be low ranging between 9 and 36 for conventional wwtps bourgin et al 2018 camacho muñoz et al 2019 golovko et al 2014 hermes et al 2018 kosonen and kronberg 2009 while xing et al 2018 showed that an enhanced nitrification could improve the primary degradation to about 85 fxf is administered as a racemic mixture both enantiomers are biologically active and camacho muñoz et al 2019 reported no differences on removal efficiencies between the two enantiomers due to the low removal rates in conventional wwtps fxf is emitted into receiving waters and it has been detected in surface water hermes et al 2018 kosonen and kronberg 2009 and groundwater wode et al 2015 in the low ng l 1 range even though fxf and stg were shown to be ubiquitously present in wastewater the knowledge on their biotransformation in wwtps is scarce and their degradability in contact with carrier attached biomass as well as their tps and pathways have not been previously assessed therefore the aim of the present study was to i examine the degradation kinetics ii elucidate the chemical structure of the tps and iii propose the transformation pathways of the investigated compounds in contact with both carrier attached and suspended sludge biomass from a hybrid mbbr furthermore the transferability of the lab results was assessed by examining the formation of identified tps in monitoring campaigns of pilot and full scale mbbrs 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals r stg phosphate stg d4 phosphate stg tp 192

6 l final volume were collected from the influent and effluent of the reactors 2 3 incubation experiments several incubation experiments were conducted to determine degradation rate constants and to identify tps formed by degradation either in contact with carrier attached biomass or suspended sludge for an overview of the conducted experiments conditions and applications see table 1 sampling of the matrix and inoculation of the batch experiments took place within 5 h the experiments were performed in 500 ml glass bottles filled with filtered gf6 whatman dassel germany effluent wastewater wwtp koblenz and either carriers or sludge from the hybrid mbbr at wwtp koblenz see section 2 2 3 to attain a biomass concentration of about 1 g l 1 the final volume of the incubation mixture was approximately 250 ml the bottles were closed using screw caps with a silicone ptfe septum which was punctured with injection needles for aeration sampling and degassing in order to maintain oxic conditions the batches were constantly stirred and aerated after a short equilibration time of 1 h the batches were spiked with target compounds dissolved in ultra pure water either at 1 or 2 μg l 1 for studying the primary degradation kinetics or 100 μg l 1 for identifying tps to differentiate between biotic and abiotic removal processes additional batches setup with carriers and effluent were autoclaved two times for 15 min at 121 c and then spiked with target compounds the gas stream used for aeration was directed through 0 2 μm sterile syringe filters whatman to avoid any microbial contamination during incubation each setup was conducted in triplicate at fixed intervals 2 ml samples of each batch were taken for quantification of target compounds and identified tps and for structural elucidation of tps 2 4 determination of carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge concentration the carrier attached biomass was determined gravimetrically three replicates of 10 carriers were first rinsed carefully with ultra pure water to remove non attached biomass dried for 24 h at 105 c and then weighed the carriers were soaked twice in 3 m hcl and afterwards in detergent while being treated with sonication after scrubbing they were cleaned with ultra pure water dried for 24 h at 105 c and weighed again the carrier attached biomass was calculated as the difference between the two weights to determine the suspended sludge concentration three replicates of 25 ml each were taken out of the liquid phase of the reactor filtered onto dried and pre weighed glass fiber filters gf6 whatman which were then dried again for 24 h at 105 c and weighed 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 quantitative determination of target compounds and tps quantitative analysis of the target

binary pump to provide a gradient flow of the mobile phases ultra pure water with 0 1 acetic acid and acetonitrile a second isocratic pump to maintain a constant flow to the ms while the divert valve is in use an autosampler and a column oven chromatographic separation was achieved on a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column narrow bore rr 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm with a zorbax eclipse xdb c8 guard column 2 1 12

target compound were monitored for tps via hplc agilent 1260 series coupled with a qtof ms sciex 5600 tripletof the chromatographic method was similar to those described in section 2 5 1 for details

ultra 12 0 2 cambridgesoft 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of fexofenadine fxf in lab scale experiments 3 1 1 identification of transformation products lab scale degradation experiments with carriers exp 2 1 and suspended sludge exp 2 2 collected from the hybrid mbbr at wwtp koblenz germany were conducted to identify tps of fxf during the experiments target compound spike 100 μg l 1 the formation of tps was observed in the aqueous phase over an incubation time of 16 d via qtof ms fxf was removed by 94 in contact with carrier attached biomass within 3 d and by 86 in contact with suspended sludge within 16 d fig 1 sorption processes were of minor importance for the decrease of fxf since the concentration in abiotic experiments only conducted with carrier attached biomass remained stable over the incubation time and the mean recovery in both biotic and abiotic experiments was 134 8 approximately 15 min after spiking thus the decrease of fxf in biotic batches was likely predominantly driven by biological processes in total 13 different tps were detected and all of them were found in experiments with both carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge only a difference in the intensity time courses was observed structural elucidation of the tps was based on the high resolution molecular ion mass esi esi which was used to propose a molecular formula and the ms2 fragmentation spectrum providing structural information of the tps for all tps chemical structures could be proposed fig 2 moreover the structures of 2 tps tp 499 tp 267 were unambiguously confirmed via available authentic reference standards the time courses of tps reaching a peak area above 1 of the initial fxf peak area are shown in fig 1 for time courses of all tps see si section s3 in the following section it will be referred to part a and b of fxf molecule as it is indicated in fig 2 tp 499 and tp 515 v v corresponds to the most intense chromatographic isomeric peak of tp 515 were identified as the quantitatively most relevant tps reaching up to 76 and 30 respectively of the initial fxf peak area in experiments with carrier attached biomass fig 1 tp 353 tp 267 tp 325 and tp 485 reached maximum peak areas from 5 to 7 of the initial fxf peak area all other tps were considered to be of minor importance as their peak areas reached less than 1 of the initial fxf peak area while tp 499 tp 515 v and tp 353 appeared to be intermediates as their peak areas decreased after reaching a maximum the courses of tp 325 and tp 485 reached a plateau after 11 d and the peak area of tp 267 constantly increased fig 1 tp 499 is formed via oxidation of the secondary hydroxyl group forming a benzoyl moiety tp 499 fig 2 in positive ionization mode important characteristic fragment ions such as 2 4 butyrylphenyl 2 methylpropanoic acid m z 233 1174 c14h17o3 1 ppm mass accuracy representing part b see fxf molecule in fig 2 of the fxf molecule minus two hydrogen atoms and 2 4 formylphenyl 2 methylpropanoic acid consisting of part b minus a c3 unit m z 191 0703 c11h11o3 1 ppm were observed furthermore the diphenyl piperidin 4 yl methanol fragment consisting of part a of fxf molecule m z 268 1694 c18h22no 1 ppm and m z 250 1593 c18h20n 1 ppm after the loss of water supported the proposed chemical structure for details see si this was confirmed via the comparison with an authentic reference standard fexofenadione the observation that tp 499 was formed very quickly reaching 76 of fxf peak area within the first day of incubation with carriers and then decreased during the ongoing incubation is an indication that this tp was further transformed in contact with carriers fig 1a additional degradation experiments with tp 499 as the initial compound with carrier attached biomass exp 4 1 and 4 2 showed the formation of all other tps observed in experiments with fxf as the spiked compound moreover a back reaction of tp 499 to fxf partially occurred indicating that the reaction is reversible for details see si the reversibility of an alcohol oxidation and keto reduction respectively has already been reported for other micropollutants such as codeine wick et al 2011b climbazole brienza and chiron 2017 and sulisobenzone beel et al 2013 tp 515 was detected at a mean m z of 516 2742 c32h38no5 m h 1 ppm and was most likely formed by oxidation of the secondary alcohol tp 499 and a hydroxylation atomic modification of fxf o h2 as shown in fig 2 the extracted ion chromatogram xic of m z 516 2745 0 002 revealed at least 5 peaks tp 515 i to v see si of isobaric compounds which can be attributed to different possible positions of the formed hydroxyl moiety all of them showed an increasing intensity over the incubation time of 16 d tp 515 v m z 516 2749 1 ppm was the most intense peak reaching 30 of the initial fxf peak area within 9 d of incubation time with carriers tp 515 i to iv reached less than 1 of the initial fxf peak area characteristic fragment ions m z 233 1167 c14h17o3 2 ppm and m z 191 0702 c11h11o3 1 ppm in the ms2 spectrum positive ionization mode of tp 515 v revealed that part b remained unaltered see also fragmentation of tp 499 a proximate localization of the hydroxyl group in the predominant isomer tp 515 v was only possible using ms2 data required in negative ionization mode here fragment ions m z 282 1506 c18h20no2 2 ppm consisting of part a of the fxf molecule with an additional hydroxyl moiety and m z 105 0351 representing the cleavage of c7h5o 5 ppm gave clear hints for the hydroxyl group to be located at one of the benzene rings in part a of the tp 515 v molecule however the position of the introduced hydroxyl group of the other isomers could not be determined fig 2 furthermore tp 353 with a considerable lower molecular mass m z 354 2064 m h compared to fxf m z 502 2952 m h was observed reaching 5 of the initial fxf peak area within 11 d in contact with carrier attached biomass based on the proposed molecular formula c22h28no3 m h 0 1 ppm and the ms2 spectra it was postulated that part a of the fxf molecule remained unaltered fragment m z 250 1587 c18h20n 1 ppm while fragment m z 87 0441 c4h7o2 m h 7 ppm indicated that the benzoyl moiety in part b was oxidized resulting in an oxidative cleavage forming a terminal carboxylic acid at the butyl carbon chain a similar transformation of benzoyl moieties has already been observed in previous studies for the uv filter sulisobenzone beel et al 2013 and trimethoprim jewell et al 2016a this reaction is assumed to lead also to the formation of 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 methylpropanoic acid as cleavage product which however could not be observed in this study this might be explained by a fast microbial transformation mineralization or uptake into the biomass tp 325 reached 7 of the initial fxf peak area at the end of the incubation period with carriers based on the proposed molecular formula m z 326 1753 c20h24no3 m h 1 ppm tp 325 was formed from tp 353 via the loss of ethene c2h4 furthermore the fragment m z 140 0846 c7h12no2 12 ppm in the ms2 spectrum of tp 325 indicated the presence of a 2 piperidin 1 yl acetic acid unit for details see si this suggests that tp 325 is formed by an oxidation of tp 353 at the β carbon of the carboxylic moiety leading to the cleavage of acetate this β oxidation is a very common transformation process for compounds containing carboxyalkyl groups neilson and allard 2008 and has also been observed for micropollutants such as primaquine gulde et al 2016 or penciclovir prasse et al 2011 tp 267 has also a lower mass m z 268 1693 m h compared to fxf m z 502 2952 m h it reached up to 5 of the initial fxf peak area at the end of the incubation period with carriers based on the proposed molecular formula c18h22no 1 ppm and detection of characteristic fragments of the piperidine m z 82 0646 c5h8n 6 ppm as well as the diphenylmethyl moiety m z 167 0858 c13h11 2 ppm it was identified as diphenyl piperidin 4 yl methanol this could be confirmed by means of a commercially available reference standard the formation of tp 267 is proposed to occur via dealkylation of the tertiary amine since the decrease of fxf was much more rapid compared to the increase of tp 267 it can be assumed that tp 267 is not a primary tp of fxf rather it might be formed directly out of tp 499 or maybe more likely after β oxidation of tp 499 to tp 325 a n dealkylation of tertiary amines has already been observed for several micropollutants such as venlafaxine lidocaine pyrilamine n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide deet and valsartan gulde et al 2016 helbling et al 2010b in degradation experiments with carriers spiking tp 267 100 µg l 1 the formation of further tps was detected while the concentration of tp 267 decreased by 15 within 11 d of incubation according to their exact masses m z 284 1650 c18h22no2 2 ppm four isobaric tps formed in low amounts 1 of the spiked tp 267 peak area see si are formed by hydroxylation of tp 267 four structural isomers tp 283 i iv are in accordance with hydroxylation reactions taking place at the preferential ortho and para positions of the aromatic rings as well as the ortho and meta positions of the piperidine ring moreover two tps tp 281 i ii with exact masses m z 282 1493 c18h20no2 1 ppm were detected tp 281 i reached up to 2 of the initial tp 267 peak area further details see si the proposed molecular formula as well as the ms2 fragment m z 96 9456 c5h6no 13 ppm suggest a keto group at the piperidine ring details see si which can be explained by further oxidation of those two structural isomers of tp 283 with a hydroxyl group at the piperidine ring however all these tps of tp 267 could not be detected in experiments with fxf or tp 499 as the spiked substance this can be explained by both the low intensities of tp 267 in experiments with fxf or tp 499 maximum of 5 of the initial spike concentration and the rather slow formation of tp 281 and tp 283 with a detected exact mass m z 486 2640 a molecular formula of c31h36no4 m h 1 ppm was predicted for tp 485 this mass can be explained by a loss of one of the methyl groups in part b of the tp 499 molecule ms2 data confirmed this assumption as the fragment ion m z 219 1031 c13h15o3 7 ppm representing the loss of 2 4 butyrylphenyl propanoic acid part b without a methyl group was detected it is assumed that tp 485 was formed via the hydroxylation of one of the methyl moieties followed by further oxidation to an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid since dicarboxylic acids are rather unstable one of the carboxyl moieties was possibly cleaved decarboxylation tp 485 was formed by up to 6 of the initial fxf peak area within 11 d and remained stable for the following 5 d of incubation with carrier attached biomass further tps which will not be discussed in detail because their intensities were less than 1 of the initial fxf peak area tp 501 tp 517 tp 533 tp 531 were mainly intermediate products formed by combinations of one fold or two fold hydroxylation and oxidation of alcohol to keto moieties of the main tps the lab scale degradation of fxf at elevated concentrations was considerably slower in contact with suspended sludge removal of 86 within 16 d compared to carrier attached biomass removal of 94 within 3 d even though the same tps were detected in both experiments the intensities of the tps as well as their time courses showed specific differences over the incubation time fig 1 for the main product tp 499 the increase was much faster in contact with carrier attached biomass reaching 76 within 3 d of incubation compared to 81 within 9 d in contact with suspended sludge furthermore a decrease within the ongoing incubation was observed which was not observed in experiments with suspended sludge fig 1 similar results were attained for tp 515 v as it was formed to a significantly higher proportion by a factor of 4 in contact with carrier attached biomass fig 1 3 1 2 transformation pathway of fxf at environmental concentrations in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge in order to investigate the fate of fxf in contact with carrier attached and suspended sludge biomass lab scale experiments were conducted with environmentally relevant concentrations spiked at 1 μg l 1 of the target compound fxf is removed in contact with suspended biomass with a pseudo first order kinetic rate constant of 0 24 0 04 l g d 1 whereas the removal in contact with carrier attached biomass was significantly faster achieving a rate constant of 0 84 0 02 l g d 1 where g refers to grams biomass attached or suspended fig 3 a similar transformation pathway observed with elevated spike concentrations was also attained at environmental concentrations in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge however not all previously observed tps were detected most likely due to their low concentrations in contact with suspended sludge fxf was degraded by 80 within 7 d of incubation time consistent with experiments at high fxf concentrations tp 499 was the most dominant tp formed during the incubation period quantification of tp 499 revealed that 58 of the initial fxf concentration was transformed to tp 499 within 7 d the mass balance of fxf and tp 499 reached 80 fig 3b1 further tps detected were tp 515 v and tp 485 which could not be quantified by reference standards but reached 4 tp 485 and 2 tp 515 v of the initial fxf peak area hence it can be expected that there was still a small gap in the mass balance of about 15 fig 3b1 which might be explained by additional tps which have not been observed due to detection limits or method boundaries in degradation experiments with fxf in contact with carrier attached biomass tp 499 was also observed as the main primary tp however in contrast to experiments with suspended biomass tp 499 concentration did not continuously increase but decreased after reaching a maximum of 57 within 1 d of incubation time to about 10 after 7 d fig 3a1 while with suspended sludge only a minor formation of tp 515 v could be observed incubation with carriers led to an increase of tp 515 v to about 99 of the initial fxf peak area between 9 h and 7 d of incubation time fig 3a2 based on the peak areas the results indicate an almost quantitative transformation of tp 499 to the hydroxylated tp 515 v in addition the formation of tp 485 reaching 2 of initial fxf peak area tp 353 reaching 4 of initial fxf peak area and tp 267 reaching 6 of fxf initial concentration was observed with carriers therefore in contact with carrier attached biomass tp 499 is further transformed to tp 353 via oxidative cleavage at the benzoyl moiety to tp 267 via n dealkylation and to tp 485 via hydroxylation oxidation and decarboxylation neither tp 353 nor tp 267 was observed in experiments with suspended sludge at environmental spike concentrations which might be due to concentrations under the detection limits as conclusion the removal of fxf in lab scale experiments was four times faster in contact with carrier attached biomass compared to suspended sludge in addition also the primary product tp 499 was transformed considerably faster in contact with attached biomass which resulted in the detection of two more tps tp 353 and tp 267 therefore except for tp 485 all detected follow up tps of tp 499 tp 515 v tp 353 tp 267 were formed to a considerable higher proportion tp 515 v by a factor of 50 in contact with carrier attached biomass compared to suspended sludge only the transformation of tp 499 to tp 485 was observed to a slightly higher proportion in suspended sludge by a factor of 2 most of these observations at environmentally relevant concentrations generally fit the results gained from experiments with elevated concentrations table 2 this is especially true for the main transformation products tp 499 and tp 515 v which were formed to higher proportions tp 499 and tp 515 v and were further degraded tp 499 in contact with carrier attached biomass hence the carrier attached microorganisms facilitated the catalysis of some of the observed oxidative reactions such as the alcohol oxidation β oxidation n dealkylation and the aromatic hydroxylation leading to a faster degradation of fxf and formation of tp 499 tp 353 tp 267 and tp 515 v respectively this is in agreement with some previous studies reporting a faster degradation of certain micropollutants in contact with carrier attached biomass compared to suspended biomass falås et al 2013 zupanc et al 2013 for example falås et al 2013 observed a considerably faster transformation of diclofenac and valsartan whose primary tps are formed by hydroxylation jewell et al 2016b and oxidative n dealkylation helbling et al 2010b respectively 3 2 transformation of sitagliptin stg in lab scale experiments 3 2 1 identification of transformation products similar to fxf the transformation of stg was also studied at an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 in lab scale degradation experiments with carriers and suspended sludge measurements with lc qtof ms revealed a decrease of the stg concentration by 98 within 5 d fig 4 as well as the formation of several tps in both cases in contrast to fxf removal of stg was as fast in contact with carriers as with suspended sludge in total the formation of 9 different tps was observed and for all tps chemical structures could be proposed moreover the structures of 5 tps tp 192 tp 449 tp 406 tp 176 tp 190 were unambiguously confirmed with available reference standards further tps tp 408 tp 435 tp 505 and tp 507 were identified via characteristic fragment ions in the following section it will be referred to part a and b of stg molecule as it is specified in fig 6 the overall transformation pathway with proposed chemical structures of the formed tps and details on the reaction mechanisms are shown in fig 6 all tps found in incubation experiments with carrier attached biomass were also formed in contact with suspended sludge only slightly differences in the intensity time courses were observed transformation reactions consisted of conjugation reactions e g n acetylation oxidations oxidative deamination alpha and beta oxidation and amide hydrolysis which are described in detail in this section high resolution analysis revealed tp 449 as one of the quantitatively most relevant tps as its peak area reached about 17 and 7 of the spiked stg peak area within 3 d of incubation in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge respectively fig 4 by detecting the exact mass of m z 450 1357 and the fragment ions m z 258 0739 c12h11f3no2 1 ppm and m z 60 0442 c2h6no 3 ppm representing part a of stg molecule with an acetyl moiety and the cleaved acetylated primary amine respectively tp 449 could be proposed as n acteyl stg the proposed structure was also confirmed by means of an authentic reference standard tp 449 is formed via acteylation of the primary amine n acetylation can be catalyzed by n acetyltransferase with acetyl coenzyme a as acetyl donor and typically involves weakly basic nh2 groups testa and kramer 2008 acetylated products of pharmaceuticals such as sulfadiazine propranolol sulfamethoxazole smx and p aminosalicylic acid noda et al 1995 vree et al 1995 weber 1973 are also very common as human metabolites n acetylation has already been observed for sulfamethoxazole primaquine and mexilatine in wastewater treatment processes or incubation studies with activated sludge gulde et al 2016 hermes et al 2018 after reaching its maximum tp 449 concentration stayed stable for the ongoing incubation suggesting not to be further transformed separate incubation experiments with tp 449 in contact with carrier attached biomass exp 4 1 and 4 2 support this assumption as no removal was observed over an incubation time of 5 d see si n acetylations can be reversible reactions as it has been shown for n acetyl smx which is deconjugated rather fast in contact with activated sludge achermann et al 2018a göbel et al 2005 that was however not observed for acetylated stg here the balance appeared to lie on the side of the conjugated form see incubation experiments with tp 449 as initial compound in the si further conjugation reactions detected within the degradation of stg were the n formylation tp 435 m z 436 1192 c17h16f6n5o2 2 ppm and n succinylation tp 507 m z 508 1419 c20h20f6n5o4 1 ppm characteristic fragment ions elucidating their chemical structures were m z 244 0609 c11h9f3no2 12 ppm for tp 435 and m z 316 0780 c14h13f3no4 3 ppm for tp 507 for details see si however based on the maximum peak areas tp 435 and tp 507 were only marginally formed 1 within the degradation of stg fig 4 moreover in contrast to the acetylated stg tp 449 tp 435 and tp 507 were further transformed the detection of tp 505 m z 506 1254 c20h18f6n5o4 1 ppm with a mass difference of 2 h compared to tp 507 indicated that tp 507 can be further transformed to tp 505 by oxidation of the succinyl to a fumaryl moiety n fumarylation has also been observed for ortho chlorophenylpiperazine n demethylpheniramine secondary amine and for mexiletine primary amine and was proposed to proceed either via direct n fumarylation or n succinylation with following oxidation gulde et al 2016 the oxidation dehydrogenation of succinate to fumarate is part of the citric acid cycle and is catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase michal and schomburg 2002 tp 192 appeared to be the quantitative most relevant tp as the peak area reached about 25 and 32 of the spiked stg peak area in lab scale experiments with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge respectively fig 4 based on the detected exact mass m z 193 0695 in positive ionization mode and fragment ions m z 138 0272 c3h3f3n3 1 ppm and m z 56 0859 c3h6n 14 ppm representing the trifluoromethylated triazole part and the remaining part of the piperazine ring respectively tp 192 was identified as 3 trifluoromethyl 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 1 2 4 triazolo 4 3 a pyrazine formed by amide hydrolysis fig 6 this could be confirmed by comparison with an authentic reference standard separate degradation experiments with tp 192 exp 4 1 and 4 2 spike 2 μg l 1 or 100 μg l 1 revealed no significant decrease in tp 192 concentration within an incubation time of 3 d see si due to the fact that the recovery of the spiked tp 192 concentration in the batch experiments was 99 after 15 h removal by sorption seems to be of minor importance as a consequence tp 192 appears to be a rather stable tp of stg which is not or only very slowly further transformed tp 190 was only detected via measurements with lc ms ms in smrm mode and not via lc qtof ms though the identification and quantification of tp 190 as 2 2 4 5 trifluorophenyl acetic acid was possible by means of an authentic reference standard it is likely that tp 190 was formed out of the remaining part a of stg molecule after the cleavage of tp 192 via amide hydrolysis reactions which are likely to form tp 190 might be the amide hydrolysis supposed intermediate product sip 233 not observed and an oxidative deamination sip 232 fig 6 followed by beta oxidation at the c8 atom the time courses of tp 190 in experiments spiked with elevated stg concentrations are shown in fig 5 tp 190 was only detected in experiments with suspended sludge reaching a maximum amount of 33 of stg initial molar concentration after 5 d of incubation however tp 190 was further transformed as its concentration decreased within the ongoing incubation tp 176 with an exact mass of m z 175 0011 m h and the proposed molecular formula c7h2f3o2 1 ppm was identified as 2 4 5 trifluorobenzoic acid characteristic fragment ions such as m z 131 0101 c6h2f3 10 ppm and m z 111 0051 c6hf2 1 ppm represent the cleavage of co2 and subsequent loss of hf respectively the structure of tp 176 was unambiguously confirmed with an authentic reference standard the increase of the proportion of tp 176 to 9 of the initial stg molar concentration parallel to the decrease of tp 190 between incubation day 5 and 16 in the experiment with suspended sludge fig 5 might be an indication that tp 176 is formed from tp 190 this could be explained by an alpha oxidation at the c7 atom as for example has also been observed for phenylacetic acid in pure culture studies mohamed et al 2002 in experiments with carriers tp 176 concentration increased to 9 of the initial stg molar concentration within 5 d which was faster compared to suspended sludge see fig 5a and b this could also be an explanation for tp 190 not being detected in experiments with carriers since it might be very fast further transformed to tp 176 after reaching a maximum concentration tp 176 decreased suggesting that this tp might also be further transformed fig 5b a degradation of two fold fluorinated benzoate has already been observed in pure culture studies with pseudomonas putida jt 102 neilson and allard 2002 a further degradation product was tp 406 due to its exact mass m z 407 0930 and detected fragment ion m z 215 0320 c10h6f3o2 3 ppm representing part a of the molecule a chemical structure with a keto moity instead of the primary amine could be proposed c16h13f6n4o2 2 ppm structural confirmation was conducted using an analytical standard 1 3 trifluoromethyl 6 8 dihydro 5h 1 2 4 triazolo 4 3 a pyrazin 7 yl 4 2 4 5 trifluorophenyl butane 1 3 dione as a reference formation of tp 406 can be attributed to an oxidative dealkylation which in case of a primary amine can also be described as a deamination a systematic study of gulde et al 2016 showed that oxidative dealkylation is a typical transformation reaction for amines in contact with activated sludge even though it was found that primary amines were less accessible than secondary and tertiary amines another tp observed was tp 408 with an exact mass of m z 409 1097 c16h15f6n4o2 1 ppm structural elucidation was conducted via the fragment ion m z 391 0986 c16h13f6n4o 1 ppm which was formed by the loss of water neutral loss of 18 due to the fact that in the ms2 data of stg a loss of nh3 neutral loss 17 was observed instead of a water cleavage tp 408 was proposed to be formed from tp 406 by the reduction of the keto group resulting in an alcohol moiety further fragment ions such as m z 193 0699 c6h8f3n4 1 ppm and m z 171 0416 c9h6f3 1 ppm supported this conclusion nevertheless similar to tp 406 tp 408 did not occur in a significant proportion as its peak area reached less than 1 of the initial stg peak area in contact with carriers and suspended sludge moreover the time course of tp 408 over the incubation time revealed that it is further transformed because its intensities are decreasing after 1 d fig 4 separate lab scale experiments with the reference standard of tp 406 and carrier attached biomass confirmed that except for the n conjugated tps all other identified stg tps tp 176 tp 190 tp 192 and tp 408 were also observed during the incubation of tp 406 see si section s5 4 as already mentioned the formation of tp 408 can be explained by the reduction of the keto group of tp 406 formation of tp 192 might be attributed to an amide cleavage and tp 190 by a following beta oxidation of the remaining carboxylated part a of tp 406 fig 6 a further alpha oxidation of tp 190 trifluorophenylacetic acid would lead to tp 176 trifluorobenzoic acid however since in batch experiments with stg the concentrations of tp 406 were steadily increasing but remained very low 1 of the initial peak area of stg until the end of the incubation period fig 4 when no further formation of tp 192 could be observed it was assumed that tp 406 is not a major intermediate in the transformation pathway of stg rather it is expected that the major part of tp 192 tp 190 and tp 176 is formed from stg via amide cleavage formation of tp 192 followed by a beta oxidation and oxidative deamination of the remaining part a leading to tp 190 which is further transformed to trifluorobenzoic acid tp 176 by an alpha oxidation fig 6 for many compounds it has been reported that hydrolysis of tertiary amide moieties occurs only after a primary dealkylation reaction leading to a secondary amide helbling et al 2010a however in this study a n dealkylation which would lead to an opening of the piperazine ring of part b of stg could not be observed quantification of the tps for which authentic reference standards were available revealed that these tps accounted for 35 and 39 of the removed stg at the end of incubation in contact with carriers and suspended sludge respectively taking molar concentrations of stg tp 406 tp 192 and tp 449 into account since the sum of the peak areas of the other identified tps accounted for less than 2 of the initial stg peak area it seems unlikely that the lack in the mass balance can be fully explained by these tps in the autoclaved control with carriers a recovery of about 30 of the spiked amount of stg at the first sampling time point after 15 min indicated a loss of stg by sorption processes this would be in accordance with the fact that at the experimental ph mainly between 7 and 8 the amino group of stg pka 8 8 chemicalize 2019 is mainly positively charged the positive charge has been shown to lead to a considerable enhanced sorption of micropollutants to activated sludge stevens garmon et al 2011 wick et al 2011a considering the recovery of stg in the autoclaved experiments and the total organic carbon toc a log koc of 4 1 l kg 1 could be estimated for the carrier attached biomass this is in the same range as the log koc of 4 1 l kg 1 determined for stg in sorption experiments with river sediment boulard et al 2019 submitted 3 2 2 transformation of stg at environmental concentrations in contact with carrier attached and suspended sludge biomass to investigate whether the results from experiments with elevated stg concentrations can be transferred to environmentally relevant concentrations stg was also incubated in lab scale degradation experiments with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge under biotic and abiotic conditions the latter only with carrier attached biomass using an initial spike level of 1 μg l 1 in biotic experiments exp 1 1 and 1 2 an exponential decrease of stg concentrations was observed stg was removed by 99 from the liquid phase within 5 d of incubation in contact with both carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge fig 7 as discussed above it can be assumed that the removal of stg was caused by both sorption and degradation processes therefore only apparent first order rate constants k of stg for its overall dissipation in biotic experiments were calculated according to equation 1 in contrast to fxf stg was removed slightly faster in contact with suspended sludge k of 1 27 0 07 l g d 1 compared to carrier attached biomass k of 0 85 0 04 l g d 1 the detected tps of stg were comparable with the results gained from experiments with elevated concentrations whereas only 3 tp 192 tp 449 tp 406 out of 9 tps could be observed also here tp 192 formed via amide hydrolysis appeared to be the quantitatively most relevant tp as its concentration increased to 55 and 73 of the initial stg concentration within 3 d of incubation in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge respectively fig 7 tp 406 formed via oxidative deamination and tp 449 n acetylation were found to be only of minor importance as similar to the results from the high spike experiments their concentrations reached 1 and 9 in contact with carrier attached biomass and 1 and 5 in contact with suspended sludge respectively of the spiked stg concentration further tps might not have been observed due to their concentrations below the detection limits a higher formation of tp 192 most likely by amide hydrolysis in contact with suspended sludge compared to attached biomass could indicate that in contrast to certain oxidative reactions hydrolytic enzymes might be facilitated in the suspended sludge however systematic studies with a larger set of micropollutants which are known to be initially transformed by hydrolytic reactions would be needed to confirm this hypothesis the gap in the mass balance observed at the end of the incubation period was around 40 and 30 in batches with carriers and suspended sludge respectively and thus lower compared to the high spike experiments as discussed above it is likely that at least part of this gap is caused by sorption moreover i other competition reactions leading to unknown tps which were not amenable to the applied chromatographic and mass spectrometric method ii uptake into the biomass or iii mineralization of stg and or tps cannot be excluded studies with radiolabeled stg would be an option to close the mass balance but this was out of the scope of this study 3 3 the occurrence of stg and fxf and their biological tps in full scale wwtps and pilot plants in order to confirm that the formation of tps identified in lab scale experiments can also be observed in pilot and full scale wastewater treatment monitoring campaigns were carried out three 24 h composite samples were gained from the wwtp lundåkra time proportional sampling consisting of a full scale activated sludge cas treatment followed by a polishing mbbr pilot reactor 1 m³ 6 h hrt and from wwtp margretelund flow proportional sampling equipped with four aerated and non aerated for predenitrification bod removal nitrification postdenitrification average hrt of 8 h mbbr compartments volume 306 m³ 1500 m³ connected in series for details see section 2 2 both located in sweden in addition four time proportional 72 h composite samples were collected from two pilot sbrs one cas and one hybrid mbbr both with 12 h hrt and 12 d srt run in parallel at the wwtp koblenz germany see section 2 2 and the si the influent concentrations of fxf were in a rather narrow range between 0 30 wwtp lundåkra and 0 35 μg l 1 wwtp margretelund see fig 8 this is consistent with other studies reporting german raw wastewater concentrations of 0 15 0 54 μg l 1 hermes et al 2018 the full scale mbbr at wwtp margretelund removed fxf by 41 13 compared to no considerable removal in the cas treatment 6 9 and the polishing mbbr pilot plant 7 1 at lundåkra wwtp negligible removal of fxf observed in wwtp lundåkra is in accordance with already reported removal between 9 and 36 in conventional wastewater treatment bourgin et al 2018 camacho muñoz et al 2019 golovko et al 2014 hermes et al 2018 kosonen and kronberg 2009 in the pilot reactors at wwtp koblenz fxf was removed by 31 and 42 in the cas and hybrid mbbr respectively consistent with the lab experiments tp 499 appeared to be the major tp formed as it accounted for 148 and 97 of the removed fxf concentration in the cas and hybrid mbbr system at wwtp koblenz respectively an exception was the full scale mbbr at wwtp margretelund where the concentration of tp 499 in the effluent could only explain about 25 of the removed fxf concentration in addition to tp 499 the formation of two further secondary tps tp 515 v and tp 485 could be confirmed for both the cas and hybrid mbbr system at wwtp koblenz fig 8 however since no reference standards were available tp 515 v and tp 485 could not be quantified based on the peak area these tps accounted for approximately 30 of the removed fxf peak area detected influent concentrations for stg were between 0 8 μg l 1 wwtp margretelund and 2 5 μg l 1 wwtp koblenz fig 9 at wwtp lundåkra stg was removed to a minor extent in the cas step 22 8 while there was no significant removal in the pilot polishing mbbr 3 5 a relatively low removal of 19 11 was also observed for the full scale mbbr at the wwtp margretelund in contrast stg was removed to a higher extent in the sbrs at the wwtp koblenz both in the cas system 46 4 and the hybrid mbbr 61 7 for stg only a removal of 40 in conventional wastewater treatment was reported so far hermes et al 2018 in total up to 8 out of 9 tps observed in lab scale experiments were also detected in the effluent samples of the different full and pilot scale plants surprisingly in addition to the 3 tps also detected in the low spike lab experiments tp 192 tp 406 and tp 449 the samples from the full and pilot scale reactors confirmed the presence of 5 more tps tp 408 tp 190 tp 176 tp 507 and tp 435 which were previously exclusively detected in the high spike lab experiments three tps tp 449 tp 192 and tp 408 were already present in the influent samples suggesting that these tps are either minor human metabolites or to some extent already formed in the sewer system however except for tp 408 which has been identified as a metabolite after incubation with rat hepatocytes khreit et al 2016 higher concentrations of tps were measured in the effluent samples confirming their formation during biological wastewater treatment consistent with lab scale experiments tp 192 appeared to be the quantitatively most relevant tp reaching maximum effluent concentrations of 0 46 μg l 1 and 0 62 μg l 1 in the effluents of the cas and hybrid mbbr system of the wwtp koblenz respectively fig 9 this accounted for approximately 70 of the removed molar stg concentration in both sbrs in total tps contributing to the mass balance tp 192 tp 449 tp 406 explained approximately 80 of the removed stg which is in good accordance with results gained from the incubation experiments for the swedish mbbrs only a rather small part of the removed stg could be attributed to the identified tps however this might be explained by the rather low removal efficiency for stg leading to high uncertainties when calculating mass balances 4 conclusion lab scale degradation experiments with the two pharmaceuticals commonly found in wastewater fxf and stg in contact with carrier attached biomass and suspended sludge as well as monitoring campaigns for the occurrence of the studied compounds and their biological tps at full and pilot scale plants resulted in the following conclusions consistent with previous reports that carrier attached biofilms facilitate the transformation of certain micropollutants fxf was transformed significantly faster in contact with carriers than in contact with suspended sludge from a hybrid mbbr the oxidative formation and transformation of the primary tp of fxf tp 499 was catalyzed much faster in experiments with carriers thus it might be hypothesized that especially oxidative reactions are favored in carrier attached biomass in contrast suspended biomass might be assumed to be more capable of catalyzing certain hydrolytic reactions like the amide hydrolysis of stg to tp 192 which was formed to higher amounts in experiments with suspended sludge however more transformation studies comprising a large set of micropollutants with various functional moieties as well as different carrier attached biofilms are needed to confirm a general specificity towards certain transformation reactions moreover molecular biological investigations such as metatranscriptomics might be promising tools to investigate whether this specificity is also reflected by distinct differences in the abundance of certain enzymes and or microorganisms monitoring campaigns at pilot and full scale plants confirmed results from lab experiments that the usage of carriers can improve the removal of fxf the fxf tp 499 as well as the stg tps 192 and 449 were found to be the dominant tps and should therefore be included in up coming monitoring and effect studies to further assess their occurrence and fate in the urban water cycle as well as their ecotoxicological relevance declaration of

18432,although the beneficial impacts of iron dosing to sewer on activated sludge unit s performance especially in relation to phosphate removal have been reported the extent of impacts on different sludge properties affecting the operation and performance of the activated sludge unit are not fully understood in this study we investigated the influences of iron salt dosing to sewer on both settleability and dewaterability of downstream activated sludge unit we also examined based on the comparative assessment of different key activated sludge properties possible underlying factors responsible for the changes in sludge settleability and dewaterability for this iron chloride was dosed to a sewer reactor of integrated laboratory sewer bioreactor system the activated sludge samples

sludges were 22 5 7 8 ml g p 0 05 and 7 8 1 2 p 0 05 respectively iron conditioned sludge showed lower contents of soluble extracellular polymeric substances eps fractions protein and polysaccharide contents and monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio but higher humification index as compared to the unconditioned sludge iron conditioned sludge exhibited marginal increment in mean particle size d v 50 and settleable particle size classes 100 400 μm but reduction in supracolloidal particle size classes 1 100 μm in terms of sludge rheology iron conditioned sludge exhibited relatively lower relative sludge network strength viscosity yield stress elastic viscous complex moduli g g g and damping factor tan δ but increased shear compliance j and shear strain with time the iron conditioned sludge therefore exhibited relatively weaker deformation resistance and sludge elasticity based on the foregoing results we posit the combined synergistic effect of favourable changes to the key sludge properties might be responsible for the observed improvement in settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer iron salts sequencing batch reactor activated sludge settleability dewaterability sludge properties 1 introduction iron salts used in sewers for sulfide control could have far reaching benefits in terms of phosphorus removal in bioreactors and even sulfide control in digester rebosura et al 2018 in an integrated operation of collection and treatment systems iron salts added to sewers controls sulfide through precipitation the precipitated iron which later undergoes chemical changes in the bioreactor and becomes available for phosphate precipitation also may interact with sludge affecting the activated sludge properties including settling and dewatering performances both settleability and dewaterability are the key parameters and improvement in these parameters could influence not only the bioreactor operation also overall wwtp operation and sludge management effluent quality of wastewater treatment plant wwtp is largely dependent on good settleability of activated sludge wilén et al 2010 likewise better sludge dewaterability reduces sludge volume and hence eases heavy burden of sludge management li et al 2016 dewatering of activated sludge would be particularly important in a case where activated sludge systems produce surplus sludge which has to be dewatered prior disposal brix 2017 park et al 2006 thus it entails the investigation of the changes in key activated sludge properties due to sewer dosed iron salt and subsequent impacts on settleability and dewaterability of activated sludge improvement in settleability of activated sludge due to sewer dosed iron chloride fecl3 had been reported rebosura et al 2018 however the impacts on other sludge properties affecting the settleability and the mechanism leading to such an improvement has not been fully understood similarly possible alteration to dewaterability of activated sludge is not yet clear and factors responsible for the alteration are also not clear when aiming to achieve multi stage beneficial uses of iron salt dosing in an integrated urban wastewater system clear understanding of the impacts of iron content on both settling and dewatering properties of activated sludge including the associated underlying possible mechanism can be significant in terms of wastewater treatment and sludge management however none of the studies till date have reported the unintended beneficial consequences in terms of both activated sludge settleability and dewaterability upon discharging the iron containing sewer effluents into a bioreactor developing an understanding of key parameters affecting sludge characteristics and their interactions with sludge settleability and dewaterability would help understanding the mechanism behind the changes in these properties and allow the examination of the impacts of iron dosing in a holistic manner different activated sludge properties particularly the content and composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps cations distribution pattern particle size distribution and rheological properties have been reported to impact sludge settleability and dewaterability dentel et al 2005 higgins and novak 1997b niu et al 2013 pham et al 2010 ratkovich et al 2013 sheng et al 2010 understanding of the changes in these particular properties due to iron salt dosing would allow quantitative evaluation of potential changes in sludge settleability and dewaterability based on this understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for the change in sludge settleability and dewaterability could be established significant role of eps in relation to bioflocculation settling and dewatering of activated sludge has been reported niu et al 2013 sheng and yu 2006 increased loosely bound soluble eps content is reported to enhance the sludge volume index svi values sheng et al 2010 whereas the reduced total eps content is associated with the improved sludge dewaterability chen et al 2001 in this context niu et al 2013 have reported changes in the soluble s eps loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps concentrations owing to strong affinity of fe3 ions towards eps further cations distribution in different eps fractions could also influence the activated sludge properties due to ability of cations in binding with the negatively charged biopolymers higgins and novak 1997a b specifically monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio of sludge flocs is reported to affect the sludge settling and dewatering properties higgins and novak 1997a b albeit the correlation between sludge eps content composition and m d cations ratio of eps fractions with sludge settleability and dewaterability has been understood the knowledge and the role of presence of iron specifically the iron carried over from the sewers in a precipitated form into the activated sludge unit on the settleability and dewaterability is very limited if available it is only for direct iron salt addition to the bioreactor oikonomidis et al 2010 hence this demands a better understanding in these aspects concerning influence of sewer dosed fecl3 particle size distribution psd also plays an important role in sludge settleability and dewaterability owing to its influence on sludge viscosity pham et al 2010 increased sludge particles flocs size will cause the reduction in surface shear stresses encountered during dewatering process consequently the specific cake resistance will be smaller herwijn 1996 direct dosing of iron salts to the activated sludge unit have been reported to influence the morphological characteristics of activated sludge li 2005 oikonomidis et al 2010 however impacts of sewer dosed fecl3 on morphology of activated sludge remains to be investigated sludge rheology deals with the description of the internal sludge molecular structure including prediction and quantification of sludge flowability dentel et al 2005 hence sludge rheology influences the hydrodynamic processes involved in sludge handling ratkovich et al 2013 which in turn may influence the sludge dewaterability this implies understanding of sludge rheology facilitates in assessment of sludge stabilization or dewaterability and also in selection of design parameters concerning sludge storage handling transportation lotito et al 1997 for instance sludge viscosity one of the key rheological properties is reported to impact oxygen mass transfer to flocculated biomass in an aeration tank hasar et al 2004 network strength of sludge and yield stress τ y are other important rheological parameters associated with sludge dewaterability örmeci and abu orf 2005 effective dewatering relies on the strength of sludge aggregates lower the value of sludge network strength smaller is the deformation resistance against the applied shear stress and vice versa reduced deformation resistance promotes the release of incorporated water within the sludge aggregates ormeci et al 2004 yen et al 2002 these rheological properties might be impacted by the long term exposure of iron due to its interaction with the sludge flocs comprehensive assessment of likely changes in sludge rheological properties under sewer dosed fecl3 is expected to provide an insight into the impacts on sludge dewaterability any alteration in the morphological physicochemical and rheological properties of activated sludge due to the presence of iron could therefore significantly influence both the sludge settling and dewatering properties however such alterations and resulting influences due to the iron salt dosing to sewer are not clearly understood this study was therefore conducted to i assess the impacts of fecl3 addition to a sewer location upstream of the activated sludge unit in both dewatering and settling performances of activated sludge and ii understand the impacts on other activated sludge properties and identify the possible mechanisms responsible for the changes in sludge dewaterability and settleability in order to achieve this a number of related properties of both iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges were examined and a comparison was made between the two sludge types with respect to these properties to develop the understanding of potential impacts on settleability and dewaterability 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of laboratory apparatus and sludge sources sludge samples were collected from an integrated laboratory system consisting of two separate lines one experimental and another a control line each system incorporated a number of reactors connected in series mimicking a rising main rm sewer a sequencing batch reactor sbr a gravity thickener and an anaerobic digester ad both experimental and control lines consist of two continuously stirred anaerobic sewer reactors connected in series each sewer reactors were made of acrylic polyvinyl chloride pvc sheeting volume 0 75 l internal diameter 0 08 m the sewer reactor was fed 10 l of domestic sewage per day via adopting four pumping events i e 2 5 l every 6 0 h characteristics of domestic sewage i e sewer influent composition are provided in table s1 supplementary material the sewer reactor of the experimental line was intermittently fed with fecl3 stock solution only during pumping events at a concentration of 10 mg fe l this dosing rate was chosen based on previous study ganigue et al 2011 stock solution was prepared using iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o of 97 assay sigma aldrich merck germany sewer effluent was pumped to a buffer tank prior to being fed to experimental sbr retention time for the buffer tank was 5 min mean dissolved sulfide concentration in sewer effluent of experimental line was 4 3 0 3 mg s l as compared to 8 2 0 3 mg s l in control line likewise the soluble fe aq concentration in sewer effluent of experimental line was 1 0 0 3 mg fe l which was 0 1 0 0 mg fe l in control line further information regarding the influent compositions of both experimental and control sbr reactors is provided in table s1 wastewater volume of 2 5 l was pumped to the sbr from the respective buffer tanks which accumulated the sewer effluents during the first 8 min of the anoxic phase each sbr reactors was operated with a cycle time of 6 h comprising of 2 h anoxic mixing 3 h aerobic mixing 45 min settling and 4 min decanting periods total working volume of each sbr reactors was 8 5 l which were made from acrylic pvc material height 0 7 m internal diameter 0 16 m the sbr was operated with solids retention time srt of 16 days with 0 125 l of activated sludge removed during the last 5 min of the aerobic phase during each cycle of operation the collected waste sludge was then pumped to the gravity sludge thickener prior being fed to ad reactor activated sludge samples sourced from both experimental sbr e and control sbr sbr c reactors were denoted as iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludge respectively the two integrated sewer sbr thickener ad systems were continuously operated for slightly more than 12 months culminating two major phases phase i baseline phase 130 240 days 4th month to 8th month and phase ii experimental phase i e post fecl3 dosing in sewer reactor 242 355 days 8th month to 12th month herein we were particularly focused on assessing the changes in key sludge properties concerning long term exposure of fe for the activated sludge system accordingly iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludge samples were sampled during the 3 4 months period after initiation of fecl3 dosing to sewer reactor requisite samples were sampled twice per week from respective sbr reactors further details of the integrated laboratory set up and the operation or monitoring of the system can be found in rebosura et al 2018 2 2 experimental procedures activated sludge samples denoted as activated sludges hereafter collected from both sbrs were used for the comparative analyses herein different physicochemical morphological and rheological properties of the activated sludge samples were investigated however each sample used for analyzing the physiochemical properties was not repeatedly used for analyzing the changes in sludge morphology nor rheology albeit the key activated sludge properties are expected to vary with the time after the start of in sewer fecl3 dosing especially during the initial days of dosing the study focused on the impacts during steady operation and hence the changes in activated sludge properties with the function of time was not investigated 2 3 analytical methods total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss total solids ts and sludge volume index svi were measured as outlined in standard methods apha 2005 sludge settleability was measured in terms of svi sludge dewaterability was measured as depicted in rebosura et al 2018 with a constant mixing intensity and centrifugation time i e 1757 g for 10 min also the lab scale modified centrifugal index method previously reported by higgins et al 2014 was used in evaluating the sludge dewaterability in terms of sludge cake solids content for both activated sludges the volume weighted particle size distribution psd was determined with a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 3000 malvern equipped with a wet sample dispersion unit hydro ev the instrument had a measurement accuracy of 0 6 based on measurement of monomodal latex standards here laser diffraction measurement was based on mie scattering model during the particle size analysis 400 ml of reverse osmosis ro water was used as the dispersant medium without applying ultrasound and maintaining laser obscuration in the range of 11 14 optical parameters used for the psd analysis were absorption coefficient 1 0 and refractive index 1 52 each sample was analyzed with 10 repeated measurements n 10 samples collected for particle size analysis were stored at 4 c prior to the analysis and were analyzed within 24 h of sampling further details of the dispersion conditions employed during sample analyses are provided in table s2 supplementary material change in sludge aggregate structure was characterized by calculating the fractal dimension d f values from the light scattering data as described by wilén et al 2003 and wu and he 2010 this calculation was based on a power law relationship between the total scattering intensity i of light by particles being analyzed and the magnitude of the scattering angle q as in eq 1 by plotting log i as a function of the log q d f was estimated from a fit of a negative linear slope wu and he 2010 a ratio of hydrodynamic radius r h to the radius of aggregate r a was then estimated using eq 2 gmachowski 1995 1996 similarly an aggregate structure factor s was estimated using eq 3 to characterize the compactness of aggregates floccules gmachowski 1996 1 i q q d f 2 r h r a 1 56 1 728 d f 2 2 0 228 3 s r h r a 2 the bound water content bwc of both activated sludges was determined using a q2000 differential scanning calorimetry dsc analyzer q2000 ta usa details of the method employed for bwc measurement are provided in supplementary material s1 besides secondary electron images sei of both iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges were also taken using scanning electron microscope sem to explore the changes in surface morphology the sem analysis was carried out at the centre for microscopy and microanalysis the university of queensland uq the surface morphology of the samples was examined by sem jeol jsm 6610 america equipped with a detector oxford 50mm2 x max sdd x ray that enabled imaging at high count rates with 125 ev energy resolutions prior to analysis the samples were dried in a vacuum oven semsa oven 718 at 60 c for 8 h and then carbon coated twice quorum q150t uk using the three heavy burst mode to obtain the carbon thickness of 30 40 nm 2 4 eps extraction and analysis 2 4 1 eps fraction extraction and analysis the heat extraction method used in previous studies li and yang 2007 morgan et al 1990 was used to extract different eps fractions from activated sludges obtained from both sbrs sbr e sbr c after a minor modification the only modification made was the use of different gravitational acceleration relative centrifugal force rcf value of 3267 times gravitational acceleration g was adopted herein for the benchtop beckman coulter allegra x 12 centrifuge the extracted eps was characterized in terms of three different eps fractions namely soluble s eps loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps all the extracted eps fractions from sludge samples were quantified in terms of total organic carbon toc content mg g vss the toc content was measured using a toc analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan cations concentrations and their relative distributions for each extracted eps fraction were evaluated in terms of monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio concentrations of major cations of interest k na mg2 ca2 al3 and fe3 in both mixed liquor activated sludge samples as well as the extracted eps fractions of each sludge sample were measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 7300dv waltham ma usa after the sample was digested with 70 nitric acid the m d ratio was calculated as the sum of the concentrations of monovalent cations sodium na and potassium k divided by the sum of the concentrations of divalent cations magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 with all the concentrations expressed as milliequivalents per liter meq l further details of the procedure of the estimation of m d can be found elsewhere higgins et al 2004 peeters 2002 peeters et al 2011 rus et al 2017 2 4 2 compositional analysis of eps fractions fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem spectral analysis focusing on the changes in fluorescing substances aromatic tyrosine protein like aromatic trypotophan protein like humic acid ha like soluble microbial product smp like and fulvic acid fa like was conducted to investigate changes in the organic composition of extracted eps fractions for this fluorescence measurements of different eps fractions were performed using a perkinelmer ls 55 luminescence spectrometer perkinelmer australia operated with the winlab software fluorescence intensity fi was recorded under the excitation wavelengths varying from 200 nm to 400 nm with 5 nm interval and the emission wavelengths varying between 280 nm and 500 nm with 0 5 nm interval generating a fluorescence excitation emission matrix f eem a 290 nm cut off was used to limit the second order diffraction rayleigh scattering to reduce the excitation and emission spectra noises excitation and emission scan slits were set at 7 nm while the scan speed was set at 1200 nm min and the photomultiplier voltage was set in automatic mode samples were equilibrated to ambient lab room temperature prior to analysis in order to minimize the temperature effect all the sludge samples were diluted 20 times with milli q water to avoid the inner filter effect absorption of photons either incident or emitted light by the sample by maintaining a 230 0 05 larsson et al 2007 fluorescence regional integration fri used to quantify spectra for different organic components observed in sludge eps fractions was based on the method of chen et al 2003 eps was also quantified by measuring the concentrations of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps in the extractant calibration curves employed for the quantitation of both pn and ps contents are given in fig s1 supplementary material the bulk concentration of ps was measured based on colorimetric anthrone method as outlined in le and stuckey 2016 after some modifications further details for ps quantification are presented in supplementary material s2 similarly pn contents in eps were measured using the protocol based on pierce bicinchoninic acid bca kit with bsa bovine serum albumin as the standard as outlined in keithley and kirisits 2018 although it would have given additional information especially in relation to the lysis of bacterial cells or eps disruption we did not attempt to quantify the nucleic acids concentrations in the extracted eps fractions herein 2 5 rheological tests rheological tests were carried out using a rheometer physica mcr102 modular compact rheometer antor paar australia equipped with a measuring cup and 14 mm diameter four blade vane prior to each measurement 50 ml sludge sample was transferred to the measuring cup in which the vane was immersed temperature was maintained at 25 0 01 c using a peltier control during the rheological tests 2 5 1 steady shear rheological tests steady shear tests were employed to assess the sludge flow behavior both load and time dependent flow behavior with particular focus on sludge viscosity thixotropy and the relationship between shear rate and shear stress i e rheogram the tests included controlled shear rate csr test hysteresis loop test and controlled shear stress css test under the csr test measurements were undertaken in steady flow mode to obtain apparent viscosity η a and rheogram of sludge by a increasing shear rate from 0 1 to 1000 s 1 in a logarithm manner b maintaining constant shear rate at 1000 s 1 in 30 s and c decreasing shear rate in a logarithm manner from 1000 to 0 1 s 1 rheograms of shear stress σ as a function of shear rate γ were recorded and analyzed for both sludge samples further shear viscosity η shear was measured at different constant shear rates 50 s 1 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 to evaluate the effect of shear rate on sludge shear viscosity the three shear rates were chosen considering the typical shear rate ranges encountered in a sludge handling process kotzé et al 2015 hysteresis loop tests were performed for analyzing the thixotropic behavior of sludge and evaluating the degree of thixotropy these tests encompass four major steps i stress history was minimized by pre shearing sludge at 5 s 1 for 2 min ii shear rate was linearly increased to the maximum shear rate in 2 min iii sludge sample was sheared at the maximum shear rate for 1 min iv shear rate was linearly decreased to 0 s 1 in 2 min the parameter hysteresis loop area hla obtained by hysteresis loop tests was used for determining the degree of thixotropy of sludges mori et al 2006 yuan and wang 2013 the controlled shear stress css test was employed for yield stress τ y determination in the css test shear stress was increased in a stepwise manner and the strain deformation response was determined as a function of the imposed shear stress value the strain shear stress curve thus obtained was used to determine τ y using the tangent crossover method wang et al 2011 2 5 2 estimation of relative sludge network strength torque rheology measurement described elsewhere örmeci and abu orf 2005 ormeci et al 2004 was employed for further rheological characterization area under a torque time rheogram at a given time in torque rheology referred as totalized torque ttq was used to estimate the relative network strength of activated sludges as previously outlined in ormeci et al 2004 2 5 3 dynamic shear rheological tests different dynamic mechanical or oscillatory tests were undertaken for both activated sludges for the dynamic measurement strain sweep or strain amplitude sweep sas tests were undertaken to investigate the effects of the amplitude of oscillation on viscoelastic properties these tests were carried out at 25 0 01 c and with angular frequency of 5 rads 1 and shear strain range of 0 01 1000 likewise frequency sweep fs test was performed under the oscillating shear strain of 0 5 with an angular frequency range of 0 1 100 rad s 1 and at 25 0 01 c to investigate the effect of frequency of oscillation on viscoelastic properties further the creep test was performed by applying constant shear stress of 1 0 pa and monitoring the corresponding compliance for 5 min creep test was carried out to probe the time dependent nature of changes in sludge under the applied constant stress under creep test fixed shear stress was applied to sludge and the resultant shear strain was monitored for the pre designated time period after the pre designated time period the applied stress was removed and strain was monitored thereafter 2 6 statistical analysis mean values associated standard deviation sd and standard error of mean sem were calculated for a number of data sets student s t test non parametric with welch s correction and 95 confidence interval ci95 was applied to determine whether the difference between the observed mean values of both activated sludges sbr e and sbr c pertinent to different properties are statistically significant or not which was judged based on the p values with p 0 05 indicating statistically significant differences and opposite for p 0 05 all statistical tests were undertaken using graphpad prism software version 8 1 0 graphpad software san diego usa 3 results 3 1 variation in sludge settleability and dewaterability settleability of both iron conditioned sbr e and unconditioned sbr c activated sludges was evaluated in terms of svi the total iron fe t concentrations in experimental and control sbr were 228 8 22 0 mg fe l and 20 1 5 2 mg fe l respectively we observed the svi value of iron conditioned sludge as 47 4 4 7 ml g n 5 whereas that of unconditioned sludge was 69 9 6 2 ml g n 5 mean difference in svi values between both activated sludges was statistically significant p 0 05 a similar comparison was made for dewaterability of the two activated sludges measured in terms of cake solids content and the results are shown in fig 1 a clearly the iron conditioned activated sludge exhibited much improved dewaterability by 37 9 7 3 mean difference in cake solids content between the two activated sludges was also statistically significant 7 8 1 2 p 0 05 to investigate the variability in cake solids content in both sludges under varying mixing intensity rpm and centrifugation time t a new lab scale modified centrifugal method mci higgins et al 2014 was employed the mci values thus obtained were used to evaluate the dewaterability of both sludges as a function of mixing intensity rpm centrifugation time t and combination of both gt we found that the maximum solids cake concentration achievable by the centrifugation method under varying mixing intensity rpm centrifugation time t or combination of both gt was higher for iron conditioned activated sludge sbr e table s3 supplementary material these results suggest a synergy between indirect fecl3 dosing and improved sludge settleability and dewaterability this could possibly be attributed to the underlying favourable changes in key activated sludge properties i e physicochemical morphological and rheological owing to iron fe conditioning in order to develop an understanding of the possible changes in these sludge properties leading to the improved settleability and dewaterability and identify the associated mechanism a comparative assessment in relation to physicochemical morphological and rheological characteristics was conducted for both sludges this is discussed in the following sections 3 2 changes in content and composition in eps fractions fig 1b shows the differences in the concentration of different eps fractions in both sludges concentrations of all the eps fractions s eps lb eps and tb eps were higher in unconditioned sludges sbr c than the iron conditioned ones sbr e measured mean concentrations of s eps lb eps and tb eps in iron conditioned activated sludge mean sem n 5 were 2 8 0 3 9 3 4 6 and 17 0 4 8 mg toc g vss respectively likewise measured mean concentrations of s eps lb eps and tb eps in unconditioned activated sludge mean sem n 5 were 16 2 6 1 23 3 9 2 and 28 3 8 8 mg toc g vss respectively the mean difference in terms of s eps concentrations between unconditioned and iron conditioned activated sludge was statistically significant p 0 05 unlike this was not the case with both lb eps p 0 05 and tb eps concentrations p 0 05 measured mean concentrations of total eps content in iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludge mean sem n 5 were 29 1 1 1 and 67 7 17 3 mg toc g vss respectively indicating statistically significant mean differences of 38 6 17 3 mg toc g vss p 0 05 between the sludge samples f eem depicts the spectral information in relation to chemical compositions of eps matrices in sludge flocs the fri parameters employed for the quantification of f eem are shown in table s4 f eem spectra of eps fractions of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludge samples are shown in fig s2 supplementary material which illustrated changes in the fluorescence intensities fi of eps fluorophores by sewer dosed fecl3 the fi corresponding to different fluorophores of eps fractions of iron conditioned activated sludge clearly showed marked changes table s5 we found that fi values of both aromatic protein tyrosine and tyrosine like substances in different eps fractions was weak in iron conditioned activated sludges than the unconditioned sludges likewise fi values of both fa like and ha like substances was relatively higher in iron conditioned activated sludges than the unconditioned ones these suffices the changes in organic composition of eps fractions between the activated sludges further highlighting decreased protein like substances and increased humics in iron conditioned activated sludge this is significant because the decrease in protein fraction and the increase in humic substances in eps fractions both influence sludge dewaterability yu et al 2010 semi quantitative f eem analyses indicate possible reduction in protein pn content in iron conditioned activated sludges table s5 the pn content of eps is directly proportional to fi values henderson et al 2009 for further confirmation both soluble proteins pn and polysaccharides ps contents of both activated sludges were quantified using colorimetric techniques fig 1c and d clearly the iron conditioned activated sludges showed lower soluble pn and ps contents than unconditioned sludges average soluble pn contents mg bsa g vs in s eps lb eps and tb eps fractions of the iron conditioned sludge were lower by 46 7 46 3 and 41 1 respectively similarly average soluble ps contents mg glucose g vs in s eps lb eps and tb eps fractions of the iron conditioned activated sludge were lower by 41 3 44 7 and 29 3 respectively reduction in pn and ps contents in iron conditioned sludge can positively influence sludge dewaterability considering the high water holding capacity by pn fractions in sludge cetin and erdincler 2004 sponza 2002 3 3 changes in cations distribution in eps fig 2 a shows the changes in monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio of both iron conditioned sbr e and unconditioned sbr c activated sludges this m d cations ratio was calculated based on the concentrations of monovalent k na and divalent mg2 ca2 cations iron conditioned sludges showed decreased m d ratios in lb eps and tb eps fractions including mixed liquor figuratively almost all monovalent k concentrations in iron conditioned 1 4 meq l n 2 and unconditioned 1 5 meq l n 2 activated sludges were only observed in the extracted three eps fractions s eps tb eps lb eps of sludge but not in pellet fraction for divalent cations mg2 ca2 1 3 meq l of the total mg2 concentration 3 4 meq l n 2 was concentrated in the pellet fractions of iron conditioned sludge while rest were found to be distributed in other extracted eps fractions however only 0 5 meq l of the total mg2 concentration 2 4 meq l n 2 was concentrated in the pellet fractions of unconditioned sludge on average 3 8 meq l and 0 9 meq l of the total ca2 concentrations in iron conditioned 5 7 meq l n 2 and unconditioned 2 7 meq l n 2 sludges were present in their pellet fraction respectively relatively we observed the higher abundance of divalent cations concentrations in pellet fraction of iron conditioned sludge in compared to unconditioned sludge but this was not case in distribution of monovalent cations on contrary concentrations of trivalent cations al3 fe3 were primarily concentrated in pellet fraction but were negligible in other eps fractions figuratively 87 7 of 0 6 meq l n 2 and 78 0 of 0 4 meq l n 2 of total al3 concentrations were concentrated in pellet fractions of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges respectively akin 99 6 of 10 7 meq l n 2 and 98 6 of 0 2 meq l n 2 of total fe3 concentrations were concentrated in pellet fractions of iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges respectively these analyses suggest divalent and trivalent cations remained firmly bound within the sludge flocs while monovalent cations were freely distributed at the outer parts of both activated sludge flocs table s6 this is further elucidated by modified conceptual representation depicting changes in activated sludge matrix due to changing cations distribution fig s3 we found concentrations of divalent cations considered herein in all eps fractions were relatively higher in iron conditioned sludges table s6 these divalent trivalent cations firmly associated within sludge flocs actually promote the sludge flocs strength and stability li et al 2012 expectedly we observed higher inorganic solid fractions in iron conditioned sludges than unconditioned ones table s7 such increment in the sludge inorganic fractions can actually contribute in the enhancement of sludge settleability peeters 2010 3 4 changes in particle size distribution of activated sludge and bound water content fig 2b compares the psd curve for both the iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges the presented psd curve of each sludge correspond to the average of six different samples sampled at different time from respective sbrs albeit each set of samples i e sample sbr e1 and sbr c1 were taken in conjunction with each other table 1 the psd curve of both sludges were monomodal in nature however size distribution in iron conditioned sludges was relatively more left skewed suggesting the formation of larger sized particles this is consistent with the mean particle size d v 50 measurements table 1 the d v 50 mean sem n 6 values were 116 0 6 7 μm and 102 0 2 1 μm for iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges respectively however differences between means in d v 50 between the sludges were not statistically significant p 0 05 this is further evidenced by the sei images obtained at different magnifications fig s4 surface morphology of iron conditioned activated sludge exhibited the aggregated structure unlike in unconditioned sludge the comparative psd analyses were also undertaken by estimating the volume density of particles in different size classes fig s5 volume density n 6 of supracolloidal 0 100 μm and settleable particles 100 400 μm were 47 4 1 3 and 52 6 1 3 in unconditioned sludge respectively likewise these figures were 40 7 2 9 and 58 9 2 7 in iron conditioned sludge respectively fig s5 figuratively mean differences n 6 in both supracolloidal and settleable particles size classes between the sludges were not statistically significant p 0 05 the observed reduction in supracolloidal particles while increment in settleable particles can be beneficial for activated sludge dewaterability and settleability yin et al 2004 table 2 shows the variation in the degree of compactness of both sludges as reflected by fractal dimension d f values the d f values of iron conditioned activated sludge were relatively smaller than that of unconditioned sludge in aggregate mean d f values of the iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 1 91 0 004 n 6 and 1 93 0 006 n 6 respectively and the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 however in majority of the analyzed samples d f values of iron conditioned sludge were smaller than unconditioned sludge the high d f value means compact dense sludge flocs or compact structure jin et al 2004 this is further supported by the reduced values of aggregate structure factor s and the ratio of constituent cluster radii r h r a in iron conditioned activated sludge than unconditioned sludge table 2 the variation in r h r a values in both sludges actually correspond with the values of dv 50 presented in table 1 reduction in r h r a value implies an increment in a radius of aggregates or flocs which suggests loose sludge flocs in iron conditioned sludge as previously indicated by the d f values fig s6 supplementary material shows the dsc thermograms of both activated sludges obtained using freezing heating method this suggests the presence of more bound water in unconditioned activated sludge than iron conditioned sludge in terms of dry solids ds we found bwc of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 12 29 g g ds n 2 and 17 96 g g ds n 2 respectively table s8 3 5 changes in rheological properties steady shear tests showed some variations in load and time dependent rheological properties among the sludges fig 3 a shows variations in calculated relative network strength values of both sludges the average relative network strength values of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludge were 851 5 39 7 j kg dry solids and 1061 62 2 j kg dry solids respectively with a mean difference of 209 3 73 8 nm sec n 3 which was statistically significant p 0 05 the calculation of relative sludge network strength was based on the totalized torque ttq values given in fig s7a supplementary material the iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges showed the ttq values of 23 3 0 4 nm sec n 3 and 24 5 0 7 nm sec n 3 respectively the illustrative procedure employed herein for the determination of ttq and respective relative sludge network strength for the sbr e sample as an example which was based on torque rheology can be found in table s9 supplementary material fig 3b d shows variations in sludge shear viscosity η shear as a function of shear rates 50 s 1 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 for both sludge samples clearly η shear value of iron conditioned sludge sbr e was lower than that of unconditioned sludge sbr c the average η shear values mean sem of iron conditioned sludge at shear rates 50 s 1 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 were 23 6 0 2 16 1 0 3 and 24 3 0 1 mpa s respectively likewise average η shear values mean sem for unconditioned sludges at the same shear rates were 58 0 0 2 32 0 0 1 and 31 6 0 2 mpa s respectively figs s7b c and figs s7d e supplementary material show the changes in sludge thixotropy structural breakdown regeneration of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges respectively based on csr test results for this comparisons were done between the shear stress σ in ascending path up flow curve and descending path down flow curve we did not observe any hysteretic decline in shear stress values however there was a reduction in apparent viscosity η a of iron conditioned sludges fig s7f which further supported the observed variations in η shear fig 3b d in particular previous shear stress history had little or no influence on the flow behaviour of both sludges shear stresses of ascending and descending paths were almost identical in low shear rate range 300 s 1 wherein with the further increment in shear rate shear stress increased in ascending paths than in descending paths at the same shear rate however both sludges depicted a decline in shear stress along with release of shear rate in the descending path indicating thixotropic properties of sludges to corroborate this observed change in the degree of thixotropy hysteresis loop tests were undertaken fig s8 presents the changes in relation to thixotropy analysis and hysteresis loop area hla values which reflect the sludge thixotropy the mean hla values in iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 38 3 pa s 1 and 176 3 pa s 1 respectively fig s9 presents the css test results depicting the observed changes in yield stress τ y values each strain stress curve fig s9 exhibits a critical shear stress also referred as τ y wang et al 2011 calculated mean τ y values of iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges n 2 were 0 7 pa and 1 3 pa respectively the variations observed in viscoelastic rheological properties between iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges are shown in fig 4 effect of amplitude of oscillation on rheology of both activated sludges was evaluated by sas test and is illustrated in fig 4a c clearly sas test results depict the differences observed in different elastic viscous complex moduli g g g among the activated sludges fig 4a c as observed two moduli depict g g in both iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges fig 4a and b suggest the existence of solid like properties elastic characteristics likewise both g and g values are lower in iron conditioned sludges than unconditioned sludges fig 4a and b also g values are comparatively higher for unconditioned sludges fig 4c viscoelastic properties of both sludges depicting the effect of frequency of oscillation were further analyzed by fs tests fig 4d and e the fs tests were carried out using an oscillating shear strain of 10 an assessment of variation of both stiffness and damping of activated sludge was made and these are reported as modulus and tan δ respectively both activated sludges also exhibited g g under fs tests fig 4d and e suggesting the dominance of elastic properties within the range of oscillatory frequency studied herein likewise both g and g values are lower in iron conditioned sludge than unconditioned sludge fig 4d and e mean tan δ values for iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 0 21 and 0 25 respectively showing a decreasing trend of damping factor tan δ in iron conditioned sludge fig s10a fig 4f shows the creep response of both activated sludges elucidating the variations observed in creep compliance j pa 1 with time likewise fig s10b depicts a comparatively higher growth in shear strain within the observed time frame of creep test in iron conditioned sludges as compared to unconditioned sludges both j and shear strain values for iron conditioned sludges were found to be higher notably the recovery regime after stoppage of applied stress was not observed in both the sludges implying the occurrence of irreversible deformation fig 4f 4 discussions sewer dosed fecl3 and subsequent iron availability in bioreactor and resulting underlying interactions with activated sludge has been found to impact a number of key activated sludge properties this viewpoint was evidenced by a schematic representation illustrated in fig 5 depicting the underlying contributing factors behind improved settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned activated sludge in terms of changes in physicochemical sludge properties we observed a reduction in s eps content fig 1b reduced pn and ps contents fig 1c and d and increased humification index as reflected by increased ha like and fa like substances of iron conditioned sludge a greater s eps content increases interstitial or bound water content in sludge flocs which may inhibit the inter cellular contacts in sludge biomass chen et al 2001 sheng et al 2010 and also increases the sludge viscosity li and yang 2007 opposite to this reduced s eps would positively impact both the sludge settleability and dewaterability considering high water holding capacity of pn fractions in sludge cetin and erdincler 2004 sponza 2002 the reduced pn and ps contents in iron conditioned sludge are likely to positively influence the sludge dewaterability in addition increased humification index of iron conditioned sludge table s5 is also likely to contribute in improved dewaterability as previously suggested yu et al 2010 notably previous studies have only focussed on the influence of pn and ps in the sludge eps matrices in relation to sludge dewaterability overlooking the roles of ha like and fa like substances unlike here fig 5 cations distribution in the sludge matrix particularly decreased m d cations ratio in iron conditioned sludge fig 2a positively influence the settleability and dewaterability fig 5 higher m d ratio implies excess monovalent cations concentrations which can displace the divalent cations enmeshed within the sludge floc matrix via ion exchange mechanism destabilizing the sludge flocs stability this in turn would deteriorate the sludge flocs structure and hence settling and dewatering properties higgins and novak 1997b however upon treatment with trivalent cations such as fe3 ions the bridging monovalent or divalent cations present in sludge flocs may undergo exchange with trivalent cations further strengthening the flocs stability as explained in the conceptual ion exchange mechanism fig s3 this is due to higher binding strength of trivalent cations with activated sludge flocs than that of monovalent or divalent cations li et al 2012 which is attributed to higher charge valence of trivalent cations park et al 2006 results depicting monovalent and divalent cations concentrations table s6 also showed trivalent cations fe3 al3 firmly bound within the activated sludge flocs promoting sludge flocs strength and stability relatively more trivalent cations fe3 al3 were concentrated in pellet fractions of iron conditioned sludge than the unconditioned sludge besides iron conditioned sludge also exhibited higher sludge inorganic fractions table s7 which would result in heavier sludge flocs peeters 2010 facilitating the better settleability fig 5 further particle size distribution is also considered as another important factor influencing sludge dewaterability pham et al 2010 and settleability li and stenstrom 2018 however differences observed in d v 50 or psd among the different particle size classes between the two sludges fig 2b fig s5 table 1 were not statistically significant p 0 05 we observed only a marginal increase in both d v 50 i e 13 8 and settleable particles 100 μm but decrease in supracolloidal particles 1 100 μm in the iron conditioned sludges notably psd curve for iron conditioned activated sludges was slightly left skewed fig 2b suggesting possible aggregation of smaller flocs into larger ones such aggregation phenomenon can be attributed to flocculating ability of fe3 ions resultant of sewer dosed fecl3 similarly increase in settleable size fractions albeit marginal possibly may have contributed to improved settleability of iron conditioned activated sludge fig 5 as evidenced by reduced svi values see section 3 1 besides decrease in supracolloidal particles and corresponding increase in settleable particles can also be beneficial for sludge dewaterability this can be summed up with two major reasons firstly increased supracolloidal particle size fractions is reported to hinder the sludge filterability i e specific resistance to filtration yin et al 2004 secondly presence of predominant large particles flocs fig 2b fig s5 table 1 can consequently ease bound water release higher composition of small particles enhances the surface area of sludge flocs and hence increases bound water quantity as bound water is directly linked with sludge particles surface bougrier et al 2006 this was supported by relatively lower bound water content in iron conditioned sludge fig s6 table s8 additionally marginal reduction in d f s and r h r a table 2 in iron conditioned sludge could also have positively impacted the activated sludge settleability and dewaterability fig 5 sludge flocs characterised by more compact structure high d f value may lead to the expansion of particle suspension surfaces creating spatial structures consequently this might increase the water content in sludge which in turn may deteriorate sludge settling properties kuśnierz and wiercik 2016 regarding the influence of sludge floc structure on sludge dewaterability turchiuli and fargues 2004 reported that bound water content in sludge decreased with the d f value i e less compact flocs lower d f values contained more water but less bound water resulting in better sludge dewaterability kopp and dichtl 2001 such changes in physicochemical and morphological properties due to long term iron exposure are also reflected by the changes in rheological properties these encompass weakening of relative sludge network strength fig 3a and reduced viscosity fig 3b d fig s7f thixotropy based on hla values fig s8 and τ y fig s9 we observed reduction in relative sludge network strength which implies lower resistance of sludge against the applied shear stress also iron conditioned sludge being less thixotropic as reflected by reduced hla values suggests existence of relatively weak colloidal forces among the sludge particles these results are an indicative of the greater ability of iron conditioned sludge to release most of its incorporated water while withstanding the applied shear such ease in releasing of water implies improved sludge dewaterability fig 5 as previously suggested abu orf mohammad and örmeci 2005 ormeci et al 2004 besides increased viscosity of sludge is associated with an increased svi values tixier et al 2003 and decrease in sludge viscosity results in improved sludge flowability liu et al 2016a 2016b the observed reduction in viscosity further supported by reduction in τ y values therefore indicates possible improvements in both flowability and settleability lower svi of iron conditioned sludge the reducedτ y value also implies a reduction in sludge viscosity because all three bound water viscosity and τ y of activated sludge are strongly inter related as previously documented by forster 2002 the reduced τ y value of iron conditioned sludge can be attributed to improved flocculation of sludge particles by fe3 ions forster 2002 observed a reduction of τ y in iron dosed activated sludge sourced from full scale aeration tanks where direct addition of fecl2 was adopted the results of this study also suggest that the iron entering an aeration tank as a precipitate have got similar properties akin the iron dosed directly to the aeration tank as far as changes in activated sludge properties are concerned and subsequent positive influence on sludge settleability and dewaterability fig 5 the changes in time and load dependent rheological properties observed in iron conditioned sludge are further complemented by the reduction in elastic viscous complex moduli g g g fig 4a e and damping factor tan δ fig s10a but increased shear compliance j fig 4f and shear strain fig s10b with time decrease in g and g values of iron conditioned sludge implies possible weakening of sludge structure or reduction in the sludge elasticity solid like behavior while reduction in g fig 4c means the weaker deformation resistance of sludge against the applied external shear bobade et al 2017 feng et al 2014a 2014b likewise reduction in tan δ value suggests that iron conditioned sludge exhibits the weaker solid like or elastic properties liu et al 2016b and in consequence the proportion of energy dissipation to energy storage on applying external shear mezger 2006 would be reduced subsequently resulting improved sludge flowability wang et al 2017 such improvement in flowability of iron conditioned sludge is also likely due to existence of weak colloidal forces and sludge network strength feng et al 2014a as supported by reduced hla values observed herein interestingly these results are also in line with the trend of creep compliance j values fig 4f which were higher for iron conditioned sludge increment in creep compliance values attributes to the reduced stiffness or deformation resistance against the applied shear as previously depicted by reduced g modulus such reduced deformation resistance could possibly be the reason behind the relatively higher growth in shear strain of iron conditioned sludge in compared to unconditioned sludge fig s10b in nutshell these foregoing results implicates weakened sludge elasticity or solid like properties lower sludge network strength and internal deformation resistance of the iron conditioned sludge while opposite was the case for unconditioned sludge the foregoing results confirmed the interplay existing amongst the different key properties of iron conditioned activated sludge and their changes due to iron availability the combined synergistic effect of such phenomenon is likely responsible for improvement in settleability and dewaterability as outlined in fig 5 5 conclusion this study investigated the impact of sewer dosed fecl3 on settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned activated sludge and also shed lights on mechanistic overview of different possible causative factors behind the observed changes in settleability and dewaterability the main conclusions are sewer dosed fecl3 showed improvement in both settleability and dewaterability of activated sludge there have been no negative impacts in physicochemical morphological and rheological properties due to iron dosing instead iron conditioned sludge exhibited a number of favourable changes in several key sludge properties including contents of s eps fractions pn and ps m d cations ratio ha and fa like substances and also changes in psd relative sludge network strength viscosity yield stress moduli tan δ shear compliance j and shear strain examination of underlying possible mechanism for improved settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned activated sludge was attempted based on foregoing results we can posit that the combined synergistic effect of favourable changes observed in key sludge properties could be underlying contributing factor responsible for such improvement the

18432,although the beneficial impacts of iron dosing to sewer on activated sludge unit s performance especially in relation to phosphate removal have been reported the extent of impacts on different sludge properties affecting the operation and performance of the activated sludge unit are not fully understood in this study we investigated the influences of iron salt dosing to sewer on both settleability and dewaterability of downstream activated sludge unit we also examined based on the comparative assessment of different key activated sludge properties possible underlying factors responsible for the changes in sludge settleability and dewaterability for this iron chloride was dosed to a sewer reactor of integrated laboratory sewer bioreactor system the activated sludge samples were obtained from two separate reactors an experimental sequencing batch reactor sbr e downstream of sewer reactor receiving iron dosing and a control sbr sbr c downstream of a sewer reactor without any iron dosing iron conditioned sludge showed improved settleability and dewaterability over the unconditioned activated sludge mean differences in settleability and dewaterability between two sludges were 22 5 7 8 ml g p 0 05 and 7 8 1 2 p 0 05 respectively iron conditioned sludge showed lower contents of soluble extracellular polymeric substances eps fractions protein and polysaccharide contents and monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio but higher humification index as compared to the unconditioned sludge iron conditioned sludge exhibited marginal increment in mean particle size d v 50 and settleable particle size classes 100 400 μm but reduction in supracolloidal particle size classes 1 100 μm in terms of sludge rheology iron conditioned sludge exhibited relatively lower relative sludge network strength viscosity yield stress elastic viscous complex moduli g g g and damping factor tan δ but increased shear compliance j and shear strain with time the iron conditioned sludge therefore exhibited relatively weaker deformation resistance and sludge elasticity based on the foregoing results we posit the combined synergistic effect of favourable changes to the key sludge properties might be responsible for the observed improvement in settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer iron salts sequencing batch reactor activated sludge settleability dewaterability sludge properties 1 introduction iron salts used in sewers for sulfide control could have far reaching benefits in terms of phosphorus removal in bioreactors and even sulfide control in digester rebosura et al 2018 in an integrated operation of collection and treatment systems iron salts added to sewers controls sulfide through precipitation the precipitated iron which later undergoes chemical changes in the bioreactor and becomes available for phosphate precipitation also may interact with sludge affecting the activated sludge properties including settling and dewatering performances both settleability and dewaterability are the key parameters and improvement in these parameters could influence not only the bioreactor operation also overall wwtp operation and sludge management effluent quality of wastewater treatment plant wwtp is largely dependent on good settleability of activated sludge wilén et al 2010 likewise better sludge dewaterability reduces sludge volume and hence eases heavy burden of sludge management li et al 2016 dewatering of activated sludge would be particularly important in a case where activated sludge systems produce surplus sludge which has to be dewatered prior disposal brix 2017 park et al 2006 thus it entails the investigation of the changes in key activated sludge properties due to sewer dosed iron salt and subsequent impacts on settleability and dewaterability of activated sludge improvement in settleability of activated sludge due to sewer dosed iron chloride fecl3 had been reported rebosura et al 2018 however the impacts on other sludge properties affecting the settleability and the mechanism leading to such an improvement has not been fully understood similarly possible alteration to dewaterability of activated sludge is not yet clear and factors responsible for the alteration are also not clear when aiming to achieve multi stage beneficial uses of iron salt dosing in an integrated urban wastewater system clear understanding of the impacts of iron content on both settling and dewatering properties of activated sludge including the associated underlying possible mechanism can be significant in terms of wastewater treatment and sludge management however none of the studies till date have reported the unintended beneficial consequences in terms of both activated sludge settleability and dewaterability upon discharging the iron containing sewer effluents into a bioreactor developing an understanding of key parameters affecting sludge characteristics and their interactions with sludge settleability and dewaterability would help understanding the mechanism behind the changes in these properties and allow the examination of the impacts of iron dosing in a holistic manner different activated sludge properties particularly the content and composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps cations distribution pattern particle size distribution and rheological properties have been reported to impact sludge settleability and dewaterability dentel et al 2005 higgins and novak 1997b niu et al 2013 pham et al 2010 ratkovich et al 2013 sheng et al 2010 understanding of the changes in these particular properties due to iron salt dosing would allow quantitative evaluation of potential changes in sludge settleability and dewaterability based on this understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for the change in sludge settleability and dewaterability could be established significant role of eps in relation to bioflocculation settling and dewatering of activated sludge has been reported niu et al 2013 sheng and yu 2006 increased loosely bound soluble eps content is reported to enhance the sludge volume index svi values sheng et al 2010 whereas the reduced total eps content is associated with the improved sludge dewaterability chen et al 2001 in this context niu et al 2013 have reported changes in the soluble s eps loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps concentrations owing to strong affinity of fe3 ions towards eps further cations distribution in different eps fractions could also influence the activated sludge properties due to ability of cations in binding with the negatively charged biopolymers higgins and novak 1997a b specifically monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio of sludge flocs is reported to affect the sludge settling and dewatering properties higgins and novak 1997a b albeit the correlation between sludge eps content composition and m d cations ratio of eps fractions with sludge settleability and dewaterability has been understood the knowledge and the role of presence of iron specifically the iron carried over from the sewers in a precipitated form into the activated sludge unit on the settleability and dewaterability is very limited if available it is only for direct iron salt addition to the bioreactor oikonomidis et al 2010 hence this demands a better understanding in these aspects concerning influence of sewer dosed fecl3 particle size distribution psd also plays an important role in sludge settleability and dewaterability owing to its influence on sludge viscosity pham et al 2010 increased sludge particles flocs size will cause the reduction in surface shear stresses encountered during dewatering process consequently the specific cake resistance will be smaller herwijn 1996 direct dosing of iron salts to the activated sludge unit have been reported to influence the morphological characteristics of activated sludge li 2005 oikonomidis et al 2010 however impacts of sewer dosed fecl3 on morphology of activated sludge remains to be investigated sludge rheology deals with the description of the internal sludge molecular structure including prediction and quantification of sludge flowability dentel et al 2005 hence sludge rheology influences the hydrodynamic processes involved in sludge handling ratkovich et al 2013 which in turn may influence the sludge dewaterability this implies understanding of sludge rheology facilitates in assessment of sludge stabilization or dewaterability and also in selection of design parameters concerning sludge storage handling transportation lotito et al 1997 for instance sludge viscosity one of the key rheological properties is reported to impact oxygen mass transfer to flocculated biomass in an aeration tank hasar et al 2004 network strength of sludge and yield stress τ y are other important rheological parameters associated with sludge dewaterability örmeci and abu orf 2005 effective dewatering relies on the strength of sludge aggregates lower the value of sludge network strength smaller is the deformation resistance against the applied shear stress and vice versa reduced deformation resistance promotes the release of incorporated water within the sludge aggregates ormeci et al 2004 yen et al 2002 these rheological properties might be impacted by the long term exposure of iron due to its interaction with the sludge flocs comprehensive assessment of likely changes in sludge rheological properties under sewer dosed fecl3 is expected to provide an insight into the impacts on sludge dewaterability any alteration in the morphological physicochemical and rheological properties of activated sludge due to the presence of iron could therefore significantly influence both the sludge settling and dewatering properties however such alterations and resulting influences due to the iron salt dosing to sewer are not clearly understood this study was therefore conducted to i assess the impacts of fecl3 addition to a sewer location upstream of the activated sludge unit in both dewatering and settling performances of activated sludge and ii understand the impacts on other activated sludge properties and identify the possible mechanisms responsible for the changes in sludge dewaterability and settleability in order to achieve this a number of related properties of both iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges were examined and a comparison was made between the two sludge types with respect to these properties to develop the understanding of potential impacts on settleability and dewaterability 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of laboratory apparatus and sludge sources sludge samples were collected from an integrated laboratory system consisting of two separate lines one experimental and another a control line each system incorporated a number of reactors connected in series mimicking a rising main rm sewer a sequencing batch reactor sbr a gravity thickener and an anaerobic digester ad both experimental and control lines consist of two continuously stirred anaerobic sewer reactors connected in series each sewer reactors were made of acrylic polyvinyl chloride pvc sheeting volume 0 75 l internal diameter 0 08 m the sewer reactor was fed 10 l of domestic sewage per day via adopting four pumping events i

with fecl3 stock solution only during pumping events at a concentration of 10 mg fe l this dosing rate was chosen based on previous study ganigue et al 2011 stock solution was prepared using iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o of 97 assay sigma aldrich merck germany sewer effluent was pumped to a buffer tank prior to being fed to experimental sbr retention time for the buffer tank was 5 min mean dissolved sulfide concentration in sewer effluent of experimental line was 4 3 0 3 mg s l as compared to 8 2 0 3 mg s l in control line likewise the soluble fe aq concentration in sewer effluent of experimental line was 1 0 0 3 mg fe l which was 0 1 0 0 mg fe l in control line further information regarding the influent compositions of both experimental and control sbr reactors is provided in table s1 wastewater volume of 2 5 l was pumped to the sbr from the respective buffer tanks which accumulated the sewer effluents during the first 8 min of the anoxic phase each sbr reactors was operated with a cycle time of 6 h comprising of 2 h anoxic mixing 3 h aerobic mixing 45 min settling and 4 min decanting periods total working volume of each sbr reactors was 8 5 l which were made from acrylic pvc material height 0 7 m internal diameter 0 16 m the sbr was operated with solids retention time srt of 16 days with 0 125 l of activated sludge removed during the last 5 min of the aerobic phase during each cycle of operation the collected waste sludge was then pumped to the gravity sludge thickener prior being fed to ad reactor activated sludge samples sourced from both experimental sbr e and control sbr sbr c reactors were denoted as iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludge respectively the two integrated sewer sbr thickener ad systems were continuously operated for slightly more than 12 months culminating two major phases phase i baseline phase 130 240 days 4th month to 8th month and phase ii experimental phase i e post fecl3 dosing in sewer reactor 242 355 days 8th month to 12th month herein we were particularly focused on assessing the changes in key sludge properties concerning long term exposure of fe for the activated sludge system accordingly iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludge samples were sampled during the 3 4 months period after initiation of fecl3 dosing to sewer reactor requisite samples were sampled twice per week from respective sbr reactors further details of the integrated laboratory set up and the operation or monitoring of the system can be found in rebosura et al 2018 2 2 experimental procedures activated sludge samples denoted as activated sludges hereafter collected from both sbrs were used for the comparative analyses herein different physicochemical morphological and rheological properties of the activated sludge samples were investigated however each sample used for analyzing the physiochemical properties was not repeatedly used for analyzing the changes in sludge morphology nor rheology albeit the key activated sludge properties are expected to vary with the time after the start of in sewer fecl3 dosing especially during the initial days of dosing the study focused on the impacts during steady operation and hence the changes in activated sludge properties with the function of time was not investigated 2 3 analytical methods total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss total solids ts and sludge volume index svi were measured as outlined in standard methods apha 2005 sludge settleability was measured in terms of svi sludge dewaterability was measured as depicted in rebosura et al 2018 with a constant mixing intensity and centrifugation time i e 1757 g for 10 min also the lab scale modified centrifugal index method previously reported by higgins et al 2014 was used in evaluating the sludge dewaterability in terms of sludge cake solids content for both activated sludges the volume weighted particle size distribution psd was determined with a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 3000 malvern equipped with a wet sample dispersion unit hydro ev the instrument had a measurement accuracy of 0 6 based on measurement of monomodal latex standards here laser diffraction measurement was based on mie scattering model during the particle size analysis 400 ml of reverse osmosis ro water was used as the dispersant medium without applying ultrasound and maintaining laser obscuration in the range of 11 14 optical parameters used for the psd analysis were absorption coefficient 1 0 and refractive index 1 52 each sample was analyzed with 10 repeated measurements n 10 samples collected for particle size analysis were stored at 4 c prior to the analysis and were analyzed within 24 h of sampling further details of the dispersion conditions employed during sample analyses are provided in table s2 supplementary material change in sludge aggregate structure was characterized by calculating the fractal dimension d f values from the light scattering data as described by wilén et al 2003 and wu and he 2010 this calculation was based on a power law relationship between the total scattering intensity i of light by particles being analyzed and the magnitude of the scattering angle q as in eq 1 by plotting log i as a function of the log q d f was estimated from a fit of a negative linear slope wu and he 2010 a ratio of hydrodynamic radius r h to the radius of aggregate r a was then estimated using eq 2 gmachowski 1995 1996 similarly an aggregate structure factor s was estimated using eq 3 to characterize

previous studies li and yang 2007 morgan et al 1990 was used to extract different eps fractions from activated sludges obtained from both sbrs sbr e sbr c after a minor modification the only modification made was the use of different gravitational acceleration relative centrifugal force rcf value of 3267 times gravitational acceleration g was adopted herein for the benchtop beckman coulter allegra x 12 centrifuge the extracted eps was characterized in terms of three different eps fractions namely soluble s eps loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps all the extracted eps fractions from sludge samples were quantified in terms of total organic carbon toc content mg g vss the toc content was measured using a toc analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan cations concentrations and their relative distributions for each extracted eps fraction were evaluated in terms of monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio concentrations of major cations of interest k na mg2 ca2 al3 and

perkinelmer optima 7300dv waltham ma usa after the sample was digested with 70 nitric acid the m d ratio was calculated as the sum of the concentrations of monovalent cations sodium na and potassium k divided by the sum of the concentrations of divalent cations magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 with all the concentrations expressed as milliequivalents per liter meq l further details of the procedure of

the second order diffraction rayleigh scattering to reduce the excitation and emission spectra noises excitation and emission scan slits were set at 7 nm while the scan speed was set at 1200 nm min and the photomultiplier voltage was set in automatic mode samples were equilibrated to ambient lab room temperature prior to analysis in order to minimize the temperature effect all the sludge samples were diluted 20 times with milli q water to avoid the inner filter effect absorption of photons either incident or emitted light by the sample by maintaining a 230 0 05 larsson et al 2007 fluorescence regional integration fri used to quantify spectra for different organic components observed in sludge eps fractions was based on the method of chen et al 2003 eps was also quantified by measuring the concentrations of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps in the extractant calibration curves employed for the quantitation of both pn and ps contents are given in fig s1 supplementary material the bulk concentration of ps was measured based on colorimetric anthrone method as outlined in le and stuckey 2016 after some modifications further details for ps quantification are presented in supplementary material s2 similarly pn contents in eps were measured using the protocol based on pierce bicinchoninic acid bca kit with bsa bovine serum albumin as the standard as outlined in keithley and kirisits 2018 although it would have given additional information especially in relation to the lysis of bacterial cells or eps disruption we did not attempt to quantify the nucleic acids concentrations in the extracted eps fractions herein 2 5 rheological tests rheological tests were carried out using a rheometer physica mcr102 modular compact rheometer antor paar australia equipped with a measuring cup and 14 mm diameter four blade vane prior to each measurement 50 ml sludge sample was transferred to the measuring cup in which the vane was immersed temperature was maintained at 25 0 01 c using a peltier control during the rheological tests 2 5 1 steady shear rheological tests steady shear tests were employed to assess the sludge flow behavior both load and time dependent flow behavior with particular focus on sludge viscosity thixotropy and the relationship between shear rate and shear stress i e rheogram the tests included controlled shear rate csr test hysteresis loop test and controlled shear stress css test under the csr test measurements were undertaken in steady flow mode to obtain apparent viscosity η a and rheogram of sludge by a increasing shear rate from 0 1 to 1000 s 1 in a logarithm manner b maintaining constant shear rate at 1000 s 1 in 30 s and c decreasing shear rate in a logarithm manner from 1000 to 0 1 s 1 rheograms of shear stress σ as a function of shear rate γ were recorded and analyzed for both sludge samples further shear viscosity η shear was measured at different constant shear rates 50 s 1 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 to evaluate the effect of shear rate on sludge shear viscosity the three shear rates were chosen considering the typical shear rate ranges encountered in a sludge handling process kotzé et al 2015 hysteresis loop tests were performed for analyzing the thixotropic behavior of sludge and evaluating the degree of thixotropy these tests encompass four major steps i stress history was minimized by pre shearing sludge at 5 s 1 for 2 min ii shear rate was linearly increased to the maximum shear rate in 2 min iii sludge sample was sheared at the maximum shear rate for 1 min iv shear rate was linearly decreased to 0 s 1 in 2 min the parameter hysteresis loop area hla obtained by hysteresis loop tests was used for determining the degree of thixotropy of sludges mori et al 2006 yuan and wang 2013 the controlled shear stress css test was employed for yield stress τ y determination in the css test shear stress was increased in a stepwise manner and the strain deformation response was determined as a function of the imposed shear stress value the strain shear stress curve thus obtained was used to determine τ y using the tangent crossover method wang et al 2011 2 5 2 estimation of relative sludge network strength torque rheology measurement described elsewhere örmeci and abu orf 2005 ormeci et al 2004 was employed for further rheological characterization area under a torque time rheogram at a given time in torque rheology referred as totalized torque ttq was used to estimate the relative network strength of activated sludges as previously outlined in ormeci et al 2004 2 5 3 dynamic shear rheological tests different dynamic mechanical or oscillatory tests were undertaken for both activated sludges for the dynamic measurement strain sweep or strain amplitude sweep sas tests were undertaken to investigate the effects of the amplitude of oscillation on viscoelastic properties these tests were carried out at 25 0 01 c and with angular frequency of 5 rads 1 and shear strain range of 0 01 1000 likewise frequency sweep fs test was performed under the oscillating shear strain of 0 5 with an angular frequency range of 0 1 100 rad s 1 and at 25 0 01 c to investigate the effect of frequency of oscillation on viscoelastic properties further the creep test was performed by applying constant shear stress of 1 0 pa and monitoring the corresponding compliance for 5 min creep test was carried out to probe the time dependent nature of changes in sludge under the applied constant stress under creep test fixed shear stress was applied to sludge and the resultant shear strain was monitored for the pre designated time period after the pre designated time period the applied stress was removed and strain was monitored thereafter 2 6 statistical analysis mean values associated standard deviation sd and standard error of mean sem were calculated for a number of data sets student s t test non parametric with welch s correction and 95 confidence interval ci95 was applied to determine whether the difference between the observed mean values of both activated sludges sbr e and sbr c pertinent to different properties are statistically significant or not which was judged based on the p values with p 0 05 indicating statistically significant differences and opposite for p 0 05 all statistical tests were undertaken using graphpad prism software version 8 1 0 graphpad software san diego usa 3 results 3 1 variation in sludge settleability and dewaterability settleability of both iron conditioned sbr e and unconditioned sbr c activated sludges was evaluated in terms of svi the total iron fe t concentrations in experimental and control sbr were 228 8 22 0 mg fe l and 20 1 5 2 mg fe l respectively we observed the svi value of iron conditioned sludge as 47 4 4 7 ml g n 5 whereas that of unconditioned sludge was 69 9 6 2 ml g n 5 mean difference in svi values between both activated sludges was statistically significant p 0 05 a similar comparison was made for dewaterability of the two activated sludges measured in terms of cake solids content and the results are shown in fig 1 a clearly the iron conditioned activated sludge exhibited much improved dewaterability by 37 9 7 3 mean difference in cake solids content between the two activated sludges was also statistically significant 7 8 1 2 p 0 05 to investigate the variability in cake solids content in both sludges under varying mixing intensity rpm and centrifugation time t a new lab scale modified centrifugal method mci higgins et al 2014 was employed the mci values thus obtained were used to evaluate the dewaterability of both sludges as a function of mixing intensity rpm centrifugation time t and combination of both gt we found that the maximum solids cake concentration achievable by the centrifugation method under varying mixing intensity rpm centrifugation time t or combination of both gt was higher for iron conditioned activated sludge sbr e table s3 supplementary material these results suggest a synergy between indirect fecl3 dosing and improved sludge settleability and dewaterability this could possibly be attributed to the underlying favourable changes in key activated sludge properties i e physicochemical morphological and rheological owing to iron fe conditioning in order to develop an understanding of the possible changes in these sludge properties leading to the improved settleability and dewaterability and identify the associated mechanism a comparative assessment in relation to physicochemical morphological and rheological characteristics was conducted for both sludges this is discussed in the following sections 3 2 changes in content and composition in eps fractions fig 1b shows the differences in the concentration of different eps fractions in both sludges concentrations of all the eps fractions s eps lb eps and tb eps were higher in unconditioned sludges sbr c than the iron conditioned ones sbr e measured mean concentrations of s eps lb eps and tb eps in iron conditioned activated sludge mean sem n 5 were 2 8 0 3 9 3 4 6 and 17 0 4 8 mg toc g vss respectively likewise measured mean concentrations of s eps lb eps and tb eps in unconditioned activated sludge mean sem n 5 were 16 2 6 1 23 3 9 2 and 28 3 8 8 mg toc g vss respectively the mean difference in terms of s eps concentrations between unconditioned and iron conditioned activated sludge was statistically significant p 0 05 unlike this was not the case with both lb eps p 0 05 and tb eps concentrations p 0 05 measured mean concentrations of total eps content in iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludge mean sem n 5 were 29 1 1 1 and 67 7 17 3 mg toc g vss respectively indicating statistically significant mean differences of 38 6 17 3 mg toc g vss p 0 05 between the sludge samples f eem depicts the spectral information in relation to chemical compositions of eps matrices in sludge flocs the fri parameters employed for the quantification of f eem are shown in table s4 f eem spectra of eps fractions of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludge samples are shown in fig s2 supplementary material which illustrated changes in the fluorescence intensities fi of eps fluorophores by sewer dosed fecl3 the fi corresponding to different fluorophores of eps fractions of iron conditioned activated sludge clearly showed marked changes table s5 we found that fi values of both aromatic protein tyrosine and tyrosine like substances in different eps fractions was weak in iron conditioned activated sludges than the unconditioned sludges likewise fi values of both fa like and ha like substances was relatively higher in iron conditioned activated sludges than the unconditioned ones these suffices the changes in organic composition of eps fractions between the activated sludges further highlighting decreased protein like substances and increased humics in iron conditioned activated sludge this is significant because the decrease in protein fraction and the increase in humic substances in eps fractions both influence sludge dewaterability yu et al 2010 semi quantitative f eem analyses indicate possible reduction in protein pn content in iron conditioned activated sludges table s5 the pn content of eps is directly proportional to fi values henderson et al 2009 for further confirmation both soluble proteins pn and polysaccharides ps contents of both activated sludges were quantified using colorimetric techniques fig 1c and d clearly the iron conditioned activated sludges showed lower soluble pn and ps contents than unconditioned sludges average soluble pn contents mg bsa g vs in s eps lb eps and tb eps fractions of the iron conditioned sludge were lower by 46 7 46 3 and 41 1 respectively similarly average soluble ps contents mg glucose g vs in s eps lb eps and tb eps fractions of the iron conditioned activated sludge were lower by 41 3 44 7 and 29 3 respectively reduction in pn and ps contents in iron conditioned sludge can positively influence sludge dewaterability considering the high water holding capacity by pn fractions in sludge cetin and erdincler 2004 sponza 2002 3 3 changes in cations distribution in eps fig 2 a shows the changes in monovalent to divalent m d cations ratio of both iron conditioned sbr e and unconditioned sbr c activated sludges this m d cations ratio was calculated based on the concentrations of monovalent k na and divalent mg2 ca2 cations iron conditioned sludges showed decreased m d ratios in lb eps and tb eps fractions including mixed liquor figuratively almost all monovalent k concentrations in iron conditioned 1 4 meq l n 2 and unconditioned 1 5 meq l n 2 activated sludges were only observed in the extracted three eps fractions s eps tb eps lb eps of sludge but not in pellet fraction for divalent cations mg2 ca2 1 3 meq l of the total mg2 concentration 3 4 meq l n 2 was concentrated in the pellet fractions of iron conditioned sludge while rest were found to be distributed in other extracted eps fractions however only 0 5 meq l of the total mg2 concentration 2 4 meq l n 2 was concentrated in the pellet fractions of unconditioned sludge on average 3 8 meq l and 0 9 meq l of the total ca2 concentrations in iron conditioned 5 7 meq l n 2 and unconditioned 2 7 meq l n 2 sludges were present in their pellet fraction respectively relatively we observed the higher abundance of divalent cations concentrations in pellet fraction of iron conditioned sludge in compared to unconditioned sludge but this was not case in distribution of monovalent cations on contrary concentrations of trivalent cations al3 fe3 were primarily concentrated in pellet fraction but were negligible in other eps fractions figuratively 87 7 of 0 6 meq l n 2 and 78 0 of 0 4 meq l n 2 of total al3 concentrations were concentrated in pellet fractions of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges respectively akin 99 6 of 10 7 meq l n 2 and 98 6 of 0 2 meq l n 2 of total fe3 concentrations were concentrated in pellet fractions of iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges respectively these analyses suggest divalent and trivalent cations remained firmly bound within the sludge flocs while monovalent cations were freely distributed at the outer parts of both activated sludge flocs table s6 this is further elucidated by modified conceptual representation depicting changes in activated sludge matrix due to changing cations distribution fig s3 we found concentrations of divalent cations considered herein in all eps fractions were relatively higher in iron conditioned sludges table s6 these divalent trivalent cations firmly associated within sludge flocs actually promote the sludge flocs strength and stability li et al 2012 expectedly we observed higher inorganic solid fractions in iron conditioned sludges than unconditioned ones table s7 such increment in the sludge inorganic fractions can actually contribute in the enhancement of sludge settleability peeters 2010 3 4 changes in particle size distribution of activated sludge and bound water content fig 2b compares the psd curve for both the iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges the presented psd curve of each sludge correspond to the average of six different samples sampled at different time from respective sbrs albeit each set of samples i e sample sbr e1 and sbr c1 were taken in conjunction with each other table 1 the psd curve of both sludges were monomodal in nature however size distribution in iron conditioned sludges was relatively more left skewed suggesting the formation of larger sized particles this is consistent with the mean particle size d v 50 measurements table 1 the d v 50 mean sem n 6 values were 116 0 6 7 μm and 102 0 2 1 μm for iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges respectively however differences between means in d v 50 between the sludges were not statistically significant p 0 05 this is further evidenced by the sei images obtained at different magnifications fig s4 surface morphology of iron conditioned activated sludge exhibited the aggregated structure unlike in unconditioned sludge the comparative psd analyses were also undertaken by estimating the volume density of particles in different size classes fig s5 volume density n 6 of supracolloidal 0 100 μm and settleable particles 100 400 μm were 47 4 1 3 and 52 6 1 3 in unconditioned sludge respectively likewise these figures were 40 7 2 9 and 58 9 2 7 in iron conditioned sludge respectively fig s5 figuratively mean differences n 6 in both supracolloidal and settleable particles size classes between the sludges were not statistically significant p 0 05 the observed reduction in supracolloidal particles while increment in settleable particles can be beneficial for activated sludge dewaterability and settleability yin et al 2004 table 2 shows the variation in the degree of compactness of both sludges as reflected by fractal dimension d f values the d f values of iron conditioned activated sludge were relatively smaller than that of unconditioned sludge in aggregate mean d f values of the iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 1 91 0 004 n 6 and 1 93 0 006 n 6 respectively and the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 however in majority of the analyzed samples d f values of iron conditioned sludge were smaller than unconditioned sludge the high d f value means compact dense sludge flocs or compact structure jin et al 2004 this is further supported by the reduced values of aggregate structure factor s and the ratio of constituent cluster radii r h r a in iron conditioned activated sludge than unconditioned sludge table 2 the variation in r h r a values in both sludges actually correspond with the values of dv 50 presented in table 1 reduction in r h r a value implies an increment in a radius of aggregates or flocs which suggests loose sludge flocs in iron conditioned sludge as previously indicated by the d f values fig s6 supplementary material shows the dsc thermograms of both activated sludges obtained using freezing heating method this suggests the presence of more bound water in unconditioned activated sludge than iron conditioned sludge in terms of dry solids ds we found bwc of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 12 29 g g ds n 2 and 17 96 g g ds n 2 respectively table s8 3 5 changes in rheological properties steady shear tests showed some variations in load and time dependent rheological properties among the sludges fig 3 a shows variations in calculated relative network strength values of both sludges the average relative network strength values of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludge were 851 5 39 7 j kg dry solids and 1061 62 2 j kg dry solids respectively with a mean difference of 209 3 73 8 nm sec n 3 which was statistically significant p 0 05 the calculation of relative sludge network strength was based on the totalized torque ttq values given in fig s7a supplementary material the iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges showed the ttq values of 23 3 0 4 nm sec n 3 and 24 5 0 7 nm sec n 3 respectively the illustrative procedure employed herein for the determination of ttq and respective relative sludge network strength for the sbr e sample as an example which was based on torque rheology can be found in table s9 supplementary material fig 3b d shows variations in sludge shear viscosity η shear as a function of shear rates 50 s 1 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 for both sludge samples clearly η shear value of iron conditioned sludge sbr e was lower than that of unconditioned sludge sbr c the average η shear values mean sem of iron conditioned sludge at shear rates 50 s 1 100 s 1 and 250 s 1 were 23 6 0 2 16 1 0 3 and 24 3 0 1 mpa s respectively likewise average η shear values mean sem for unconditioned sludges at the same shear rates were 58 0 0 2 32 0 0 1 and 31 6 0 2 mpa s respectively figs s7b c and figs s7d e supplementary material show the changes in sludge thixotropy structural breakdown regeneration of iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges respectively based on csr test results for this comparisons were done between the shear stress σ in ascending path up flow curve and descending path down flow curve we did not observe any hysteretic decline in shear stress values however there was a reduction in apparent viscosity η a of iron conditioned sludges fig s7f which further supported the observed variations in η shear fig 3b d in particular previous shear stress history had little or no influence on the flow behaviour of both sludges shear stresses of ascending and descending paths were almost identical in low shear rate range 300 s 1 wherein with the further increment in shear rate shear stress increased in ascending paths than in descending paths at the same shear rate however both sludges depicted a decline in shear stress along with release of shear rate in the descending path indicating thixotropic properties of sludges to corroborate this observed change in the degree of thixotropy hysteresis loop tests were undertaken fig s8 presents the changes in relation to thixotropy analysis and hysteresis loop area hla values which reflect the sludge thixotropy the mean hla values in iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 38 3 pa s 1 and 176 3 pa s 1 respectively fig s9 presents the css test results depicting the observed changes in yield stress τ y values each strain stress curve fig s9 exhibits a critical shear stress also referred as τ y wang et al 2011 calculated mean τ y values of iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges n 2 were 0 7 pa and 1 3 pa respectively the variations observed in viscoelastic rheological properties between iron conditioned and unconditioned activated sludges are shown in fig 4 effect of amplitude of oscillation on rheology of both activated sludges was evaluated by sas test and is illustrated in fig 4a c clearly sas test results depict the differences observed in different elastic viscous complex moduli g g g among the activated sludges fig 4a c as observed two moduli depict g g in both iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges fig 4a and b suggest the existence of solid like properties elastic characteristics likewise both g and g values are lower in iron conditioned sludges than unconditioned sludges fig 4a and b also g values are comparatively higher for unconditioned sludges fig 4c viscoelastic properties of both sludges depicting the effect of frequency of oscillation were further analyzed by fs tests fig 4d and e the fs tests were carried out using an oscillating shear strain of 10 an assessment of variation of both stiffness and damping of activated sludge was made and these are reported as modulus and tan δ respectively both activated sludges also exhibited g g under fs tests fig 4d and e suggesting the dominance of elastic properties within the range of oscillatory frequency studied herein likewise both g and g values are lower in iron conditioned sludge than unconditioned sludge fig 4d and e mean tan δ values for iron conditioned and unconditioned sludges were 0 21 and 0 25 respectively showing a decreasing trend of damping factor tan δ in iron conditioned sludge fig s10a fig 4f shows the creep response of both activated sludges elucidating the variations observed in creep compliance j pa 1 with time likewise fig s10b depicts a comparatively higher growth in shear strain within the observed time frame of creep test in iron conditioned sludges as compared to unconditioned sludges both j and shear strain values for iron conditioned sludges were found to be higher notably the recovery regime after stoppage of applied stress was not observed in both the sludges implying the occurrence of irreversible deformation fig 4f 4 discussions sewer dosed fecl3 and subsequent iron availability in bioreactor and resulting underlying interactions with activated sludge has been found to impact a number of key activated sludge properties this viewpoint was evidenced by a schematic representation illustrated in fig 5 depicting the underlying contributing factors behind improved settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned activated sludge in terms of changes in physicochemical sludge properties we observed a reduction in s eps content fig 1b reduced pn and ps contents fig 1c and d and increased humification index as reflected by increased ha like and fa like substances of iron conditioned sludge a greater s eps content increases interstitial or bound water content in sludge flocs which may inhibit the inter cellular contacts in sludge biomass chen et al 2001 sheng et al 2010 and also increases the sludge viscosity li and yang 2007 opposite to this reduced s eps would positively impact both the sludge settleability and dewaterability considering high water holding capacity of pn fractions in sludge cetin and erdincler 2004 sponza 2002 the reduced pn and ps contents in iron conditioned sludge are likely to positively influence the sludge dewaterability in addition increased humification index of iron conditioned sludge table s5 is also likely to contribute in improved dewaterability as previously suggested yu et al 2010 notably previous studies have only focussed on the influence of pn and ps in the sludge eps matrices in relation to sludge dewaterability overlooking the roles of ha like and fa like substances unlike here fig 5 cations distribution in the sludge matrix particularly decreased m d cations ratio in iron conditioned sludge fig 2a positively influence the settleability and dewaterability fig 5 higher m d ratio implies excess monovalent cations concentrations which can displace the divalent cations enmeshed within the sludge floc matrix via ion exchange mechanism destabilizing the sludge flocs stability this in turn would deteriorate the sludge flocs structure and hence settling and dewatering properties higgins and novak 1997b however upon treatment with trivalent cations such as fe3 ions the bridging monovalent or divalent cations present in sludge flocs may undergo exchange with trivalent cations further strengthening the flocs stability as explained in the conceptual ion exchange mechanism fig s3 this is due to higher binding strength of trivalent cations with activated sludge flocs than that of monovalent or divalent cations li et al 2012 which is attributed to higher charge valence of trivalent cations park et al 2006 results depicting monovalent and divalent cations concentrations table s6 also showed trivalent cations fe3 al3 firmly bound within the activated sludge flocs promoting sludge flocs strength and stability relatively more trivalent cations fe3 al3 were concentrated in pellet fractions of iron conditioned sludge than the unconditioned sludge besides iron conditioned sludge also exhibited higher sludge inorganic fractions table s7 which would result in heavier sludge flocs peeters 2010 facilitating the better settleability fig 5 further particle size distribution is also considered as another important factor influencing sludge dewaterability pham et al 2010 and settleability li and stenstrom 2018 however differences observed in d v 50 or psd among the different particle size classes between the two sludges fig 2b fig s5 table 1 were not statistically significant p 0 05 we observed only a marginal increase in both d v 50 i e 13 8 and settleable particles 100 μm but decrease in supracolloidal particles 1 100 μm in the iron conditioned sludges notably psd curve for iron conditioned activated sludges was slightly left skewed fig 2b suggesting possible aggregation of smaller flocs into larger ones such aggregation phenomenon can be attributed to flocculating ability of fe3 ions resultant of sewer dosed fecl3 similarly increase in settleable size fractions albeit marginal possibly may have contributed to improved settleability of iron conditioned activated sludge fig 5 as evidenced by reduced svi values see section 3 1 besides decrease in supracolloidal particles and corresponding increase in settleable particles can also be beneficial for sludge dewaterability this can be summed up with two major reasons firstly increased supracolloidal particle size fractions is reported to hinder the sludge filterability i e specific resistance to filtration yin et al 2004 secondly presence of predominant large particles flocs fig 2b fig s5 table 1 can consequently ease bound water release higher composition of small particles enhances the surface area of sludge flocs and hence increases bound water quantity as bound water is directly linked with sludge particles surface bougrier et al 2006 this was supported by relatively lower bound water content in iron conditioned sludge fig s6 table s8 additionally marginal reduction in d f s and r h r a table 2 in iron conditioned sludge could also have positively impacted the activated sludge settleability and dewaterability fig 5 sludge flocs characterised by more compact structure high d f value may lead to the expansion of particle suspension surfaces creating spatial structures consequently this might increase the water content in sludge which in turn may deteriorate sludge settling properties kuśnierz and wiercik 2016 regarding the influence of sludge floc structure on sludge dewaterability turchiuli and fargues 2004 reported that bound water content in sludge decreased with the d f value i e less compact flocs lower d f values contained more water but less bound water resulting in better sludge dewaterability kopp and dichtl 2001 such changes in physicochemical and morphological properties due to long term iron exposure are also reflected by the changes in rheological properties these encompass weakening of relative sludge network strength fig 3a and reduced viscosity fig 3b d fig s7f thixotropy based on hla values fig s8 and τ y fig s9 we observed reduction in relative sludge network strength which implies lower resistance of sludge against the applied shear stress also iron conditioned sludge being less thixotropic as reflected by reduced hla values suggests existence of relatively weak colloidal forces among the sludge particles these results are an indicative of the greater ability of iron conditioned sludge to release most of its incorporated water while withstanding the applied shear such ease in releasing of water implies improved sludge dewaterability fig 5 as previously suggested abu orf mohammad and örmeci 2005 ormeci et al 2004 besides increased viscosity of sludge is associated with an increased svi values tixier et al 2003 and decrease in sludge viscosity results in improved sludge flowability liu et al 2016a 2016b the observed reduction in viscosity further supported by reduction in τ y values therefore indicates possible improvements in both flowability and settleability lower svi of iron conditioned sludge the reducedτ y value also implies a reduction in sludge viscosity because all three bound water viscosity and τ y of activated sludge are strongly inter related as previously documented by forster 2002 the reduced τ y value of iron conditioned sludge can be attributed to improved flocculation of sludge particles by fe3 ions forster 2002 observed a reduction of τ y in iron dosed activated sludge sourced from full scale aeration tanks where direct addition of fecl2 was adopted the results of this study also suggest that the iron entering an aeration tank as a precipitate have got similar properties akin the iron dosed directly to the aeration tank as far as changes in activated sludge properties are concerned and subsequent positive influence on sludge settleability and dewaterability fig 5 the changes in time and load dependent rheological properties observed in iron conditioned sludge are further complemented by the reduction in elastic viscous complex moduli g g g fig 4a e and damping factor tan δ fig s10a but increased shear compliance j fig 4f and shear strain fig s10b with time decrease in g and g values of iron conditioned sludge implies possible weakening of sludge structure or reduction in the sludge elasticity solid like behavior while reduction in g fig 4c means the weaker deformation resistance of sludge against the applied external shear bobade et al 2017 feng et al 2014a 2014b likewise reduction in tan δ value suggests that iron conditioned sludge exhibits the weaker solid like or elastic properties liu et al 2016b and in consequence the proportion of energy dissipation to energy storage on applying external shear mezger 2006 would be reduced subsequently resulting improved sludge flowability wang et al 2017 such improvement in flowability of iron conditioned sludge is also likely due to existence of weak colloidal forces and sludge network strength feng et al 2014a as supported by reduced hla values observed herein interestingly these results are also in line with the trend of creep compliance j values fig 4f which were higher for iron conditioned sludge increment in creep compliance values attributes to the reduced stiffness or deformation resistance against the applied shear as previously depicted by reduced g modulus such reduced deformation resistance could possibly be the reason behind the relatively higher growth in shear strain of iron conditioned sludge in compared to unconditioned sludge fig s10b in nutshell these foregoing results implicates weakened sludge elasticity or solid like properties lower sludge network strength and internal deformation resistance of the iron conditioned sludge while opposite was the case for unconditioned sludge the foregoing results confirmed the interplay existing amongst the different key properties of iron conditioned activated sludge and their changes due to iron availability the combined synergistic effect of such phenomenon is likely responsible for improvement in settleability and dewaterability as outlined in fig 5 5 conclusion this study investigated the impact of sewer dosed fecl3 on settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned activated sludge and also shed lights on mechanistic overview of different possible causative factors behind the observed changes in settleability and dewaterability the main conclusions are sewer dosed fecl3 showed improvement in both settleability and dewaterability of activated sludge there have been no negative impacts in physicochemical morphological and rheological properties due to iron dosing instead iron conditioned sludge exhibited a number of favourable changes in several key sludge properties including contents of s eps fractions pn and ps m d cations ratio ha and fa like substances and also changes in psd relative sludge network strength viscosity yield stress moduli tan δ shear compliance j and shear strain examination of underlying possible mechanism for improved settleability and dewaterability of iron conditioned activated sludge was attempted based on foregoing results we can posit that the combined synergistic effect of favourable changes observed in key sludge properties could be underlying contributing factor responsible for such improvement the

walls have a wide range of benefits such as energy savings coma et al 2017 acoustic isolation azkorra et al 2015 cooling collins et al 2017 and liveability increase wang et al 2014 the vertical position of the green walls makes them more versatile systems which could be placed on most existing and new structures medl et al 2017 additionally green walls are considered to have high aesthetic value as they are visually more accessible and pleasing perini and rosasco 2013 however all green wall systems are considered expensive to build and maintain perini and rosasco 2013 one of the most significant reason that prevents the widespread use of green wall systems is their high water requirement manso and castro gomes 2014 green wall water demand can reach up to 20 l m2 of potable water per day in more dry arid environments such as australia and california usa department of environment and primary industries 2014 this is a significant problem considering increasing water scarcity issue in these regions on the other hand green wall water requirements can be highly variable in different climates with some reported values as low as 1 l m2 per day in cooler climates riley 2017 this variability creates the challenge as there are no clear recommendations on how efficiently to irrigate these systems to minimise maintenance costs and preserve all their benefits additionally inappropriate green wall irrigation schemes overwatering or underwatering are one of the leading causes of system failure and death of plants rayner et al 2010 surprisingly current scientific literature contains little information on water needs of green walls while green roofs have been extensively studied beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 to assess green wall water uptake we mainly rely on non peer reviewed reports published by green wall manufacturers treebox 2016 vertology ltd 2014 a rare study that has explored this topic was done by urrestarazu et al 2017 they examined the effect of seasonal change on green wall water uptake across two mixed plant species finding that in that spanish region water needs varied from 1 5 l m2 in winter to 5 1 l m2 in summer optimisation of irrigation scheme was the aim of another study conducted by pérez urrestarazu et al 2014 both studies were done on a very small number of plant species combining different plants in a single system preventing plant association with water uptake additionally impacts of climate conditions temperature humidity seasons etc have not been examined understanding of green wall water needs is also crucial for the assessment of their cooling properties which is a major benefit of these systems malys et al 2016 if plant evapotranspiration et is known modelling of cooling impact could be performed this was shown in a study conducted by malys et al 2014 where hydrothermal model was used to assess cooling effect of a green wall system while this study measured water uptake of the whole green wall unit by weighing the system during watering water consumption results were only used as an input to the model and not presented in the manuscript additionally it is not clear which plant species were used for the green wall design and individual water uptake of each plant was not assessed to answer the high potable water requirements of green wall systems recently a new approach has been proposed that completely negates the need for potable water irrigation of green wall systems by redesigning green walls into greywater treatment technology riley 2017 prodanovic et al 2019 nevertheless even with water treatment systems it is still important to understand water losses due to plant uptake and evaporation from the system as it will directly impact the volume of treated greywater available for reuse at the bottom of the green wall the higher the water loss the lower available volumes for reuse green walls designed as greywater treatment systems operate in unique conditions of overwatering in order to create extra treated water for reuse prodanovic et al 2017 2019 which can be harmful for various plants in green wall environment riley 2017 therefore an appropriate selection of plants is needed as well as the understanding of their water uptake in order to create proper water balance for green wall systems tuttolomondo et al 2015 it was found that a part of plant water uptake and evaporation will depend on water distribution in the media pérez urrestarazu et al 2014 jørgensen et al 2018 with coco coir suggested as a medium that offers the best conditions for plant access to water and development jørgensen et al 2018 this is significant because if water is not properly distributed throughout the media new irrigation water might create preferential pathways through the system and affect water uptake results not providing a clear perspective on plant requirements while it is known that seasonal variations are significant for plant activity and their water needs wang et al 2017 researchers have pointed that some plants might be more affected by fluctuations in air temperature and relative humidity rull et al 2016 hence it is crucial to understand the behaviour of green wall systems in varied temperature and humidity conditions across different growing seasons additionally to create accurate future estimates of water consumptions of different plant species water uptake processes need to be understood analysing separately evaporation and plant uptake processes as well as their dependence on varied climate conditions this is especially significant in temperate and arid regions australia western usa southern europe where green walls can achieve the most benefits current scientific literature still lacks knowledge in this area for both traditional and greywater treating green wall systems riley 2017 it can be concluded that there has been very limited research into water uptake by conventional green walls and no research on the water uptake of greywater treating green walls that operate under constant overwatering conditions this study aims to fill this research gap by looking into water requirements of five plant species in a large scale laboratory based green wall experiment monitored throughout the two most extreme seasons in australia summer and winter highest and lowest water uptake the results collected in this experiment were used to answer following research questions what is the daily water retention capacity across different plant species during summer and winter conditions of temperate oceanic climate what is the plant uptake and water retention capacity of multi level green wall systems which level retains the most water and why what is the relationship between the water uptake and local temperature and humidity conditions of different plant species during summer and winter conditions what are the proportions of evaporation and transpiration throughout all tested conditions since the methodology for water balance data collection is varied in the literature the secondary aim of this work was to explore the differences between two monitoring methods for water uptake to ascertain which method is more applicable for use in specifically targeted studies the paper also provides practical recommendations on irrigation regimes plant choice and data collection 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 green wall setup this study was conducted at the monash university clayton campus which is located in the semi urban part of melbourne australia for the green wall elements commercially available gro wall 4 modular green wall system atlantis australia was used with every pot occupied by a single plant fig 1 the system was attached to custom built support wall three vertical pots dimensions of each pot 200 mm width x 200 mm depth x 150 mm height containing the same plant species created a single test configuration see figs 1 and 2 this was done to test the effect of multi level green wall design on water retention and plant uptake based on the recommendation by pérez urrestarazu et al 2014 and prodanovic et al 2019 for achieving irrigation uniformity uniform wetting and appropriate water treatment standards six dripper irrigation system was used equally distributed over the area of the pot delivering 8 l h of water into every top pot of each configuration after dosing the top pot gravity driven water would trickle through multiple holes at the bottom of the pots into subsequent levels middle and bottom levels finally being collected after at the bottom level fig 2 an experiment used two green wall systems 2 5 m high and 2 5 m apart to prevent shading each with two experimental rows of configurations figs 1 and 2 to simulate natural conditions green walls were set up in the specially constructed open air greenhouse no side walls with a clear impermeable roof preventing rainfall but retaining local wind speeds inside the greenhouse both green walls had west facing orientation temperature conditions more challenging and consistent across seasons and full natural sunshine throughout the day no significant external shading with recorded greenhouse temperature variation of up to 44 c in summer and down to 2 c in winter this temperature variation is typical for temperate oceanic climates following the köppen climate classification which are dominant in melbourne australia but can also be found in southern and western europe west coast of usa and northern parts of south america since this study aimed to retain complex natural bio chemical interactions which are climate specific the results of this work are only applicable to similar climates the mix of perlite and coco coir with a ratio 1 2 was used to fill the pots approximately 6 l as previous green wall studies found it effective for greywater treatment while having low clogging risk prodanovic et al 2017 2018 additionally coco coir was found to be effective media for proper moisture distribution in green wall systems jørgensen et al 2018 which affects water retention and plant uptake to test how different plant species influence water requirements of the green wall five different plants were used listed in table 1 selection was based upon current green wall plant species used in australia department of environment and primary industries 2014 with special criteria concerning nutrient uptake capability salt tolerance over and under watering sensitivity growth rate and growth characteristics prodanovic et al 2019 these criteria were used to find plants resilient to a range of suboptimal conditions which exist in greywater treating green walls prodanovic et al 2019 plants were sourced from a local nursery at a similar developmental stage young tube stock plants around 8 cm tall ready for planting in ground carefully removed from original soil and planted in experimental green wall the first water balance tests were conducted ten months after initial planting to allow plant growth and establishment within the green wall environment a non vegetated configuration was included to examine the effect of evaporation as well as to be a comparison point for water uptake of different plant species to avoid the inherent variability in laboratory vegetated studies each configuration had five physical replicates except for the unvegetated configuration which had four replicates due to lower variability fig 2 totalling 29 tested system configurations replicates were randomly positioned on the green wall structure to negate the effect of preferential positioning on the wall 2 2 experimental procedure the experiment was performed from august 2016 until february 2018 fig 3 green wall was watered dosed monday to friday i e five times per week while it was left to dry during weekends saturday and sunday during each dosing day 4 l of water was passed through each configuration over 30 min inflow rate of 8 l h dosing volume was determined based on the previously published methodology prodanovic et al 2019 considering water reuse aspect of these green walls the highest plant water demand previously reported by the literature for australian conditions of 2 l day 15 l m2 per day department of environment and primary industries 2014 scaled to this experiment was doubled to 4 l day equivalent to 30 l m2 to create excess flow for reuse from august 2016 until august 2017 the experimental green wall system was dosed using synthetic light greywater mix fig 3 this mix was prepared using recipe developed by diaper et al 2008 and modified by fowdar et al 2017 designed to mimic bathtub shower and hand basin effluent similar recipes have been previously used for testing green wall and living wall systems under greywater inflows prodanovic et al 2018 2019 barron et al 2019 since greywater can result in green wall media clogging accumulation of particles and closing of media pores thus changing water distribution inside media and affecting plant water uptake rigorous infiltration tests have been conducted exfiltration hydrographs have been measured with 2 min resolution after initial system establishment in november 2016 and on the mature system in july 2017 8 months apart it was found that after initial media saturation period first 10 min from the start of dosing with dosing rate of 8 0 2 l h average exfiltration was 8 3 0 3 and 8 1 0 4 l h for november and july respectively showing that hydraulic properties of the green wall have not changed significantly during this time since no clogging was observed in a system during the first year of operation and plants were healthy achieving expected growth upon visual qualitative inspection it was concluded that greywater pollutants had no significant effect on properties of the system and the source of water did not play a major role in green wall water retention and plant requirements due to this and to further simulate real green wall operational conditions from august 2017 until february 2018 green walls have been dosed only with potable water fig 3 while same irrigation volumes were kept 4 l per configuration per day switching from greywater to potable water is expected to occur in regular operational life of such system and by conducting previously described exfiltration tests we assured that no new experimental uncertainties are introduced and that switch wouldn t significantly impact water uptake to estimate the effect of low temperatures occurring in late autumn and winter jointly labelled as winter due to similar temperature and humidity conditions on green wall water retention and uptake twelve water balance measurements were conducted over three consecutive weeks in may 2017 and six additional measurements were performed in july 2017 covering a range of average daily temperatures from 9 3 to 16 5 c this period is also naturally low growth season for selected ornamental plants to assess the effect of high summer temperatures on green wall water retention and uptake eight water balance measurements were conducted in december 2017 with additional four measurements in january 2018 covering a range of average daily temperatures from 20 to 30 c these winter and summer measurements assured a good spread of plant water uptake measurements across most temperature and humidity conditions plant activity was estimated qualitatively through observation of growth and plant health signs of dead leaves or flowers and by assessing water uptake patterns furthermore review of the literature was conducted on each plant and it s growing habits this was done as a non destructive method since for more detailed plant evaluation systems would have to be disturbed which would change experimental conditions and increase uncertainty of measurement results water balance was measured using two different methods during each measurement day at approximately the same time of the day both methods assumed no significant evapotranspiration during the short dosing period 30 min the weight method was performed by weighing each individual green wall pot before and after daily water dosing by subtracting these values within a single day volume of water retained within a green wall after dosing can be determined assuming water density ρwater 1 g cm3 wafter wbefore vretained at the same time analysing two consecutive days approximately 24 h shows a daily water uptake of the green wall design between two dosing events wday1 after wday2 before vuptake the volume method consisted of collecting a two representative inflow volume samples using separate six dripper system connected on a main irrigation line and outflow volume samples from each configuration separately fig 2 during each dosing event by subtracting inflow and outflow volumes an estimate of water retained within a system can be made vin vout vretained pointing to daily water consumption rate of different designs vegetated and non vegetated for each configuration that had less than six drippers working inflow volume was scaled down to reflect appropriate number of working drippers assuming uniform flow rate for each dripper in a rare case where less than four drippers were working the data point was discarded due to possible artefact of inflow downscaling air temperature and relative humidity measurements for this period were collected using two calibrated continuous loggers 6 min measurements averaged across the hour positioned within the greenhouse due to technical equipment malfunction some relative humidity data points during the summer period had to be collected from nearby weather station operated by melbourne s bureau of meteorology 2 3 data analysis data collected throughout experimental period using two methods were used to calculate green wall water retention during a single dosing and green wall water consumption between two dosing events simple calculation for each method outlined in section 2 2 due to high uncertainty in the volume method data collected using this method were only used for the methods comparison for all other analyses more accurate weight method data were used data results were collected as litres l of water per three sampling pots of the green wall for better presentation of the results where applicable results have been transformed into litres per 1 m2 area of the green wall l m2 based on the gro wall 4 system design 21 5 green wall pots correspond to 1 m2 of green wall to assess the average daily water retention across different designs and green wall levels 13 winter and 7 summer measuring events were averaged since these measurements were conducted under different temperature and relative humidity conditions error bars only show potential minimum and maximum water retention for specific design and season hence error bars are not used when comparison between different designs are made and these comparisons are described only based on average values monday measuring events were discarded from this analysis due to incomparably higher water retention caused by two dry weekend days to calculate the water loss the pots were weighed after water dosing on the first day and before water dosing on the following day subtracting these values to obtain daily water uptake of a configuration this was done across 11 winter and 8 summer events with all replicates showed on a graph average daily air temperature and relative humidity data for these events were calculated as the average value of data collected from 12 a m on the first day until 12 a m on the following day simple linear regression was used to assess the trends between designs water uptake and temperature and humidity changes based on the data collected in this study estimations of annual water uptake per m2 of the green wall for each plant were made along with monthly plant water uptakes plant water uptake and transpiration process was estimated by comparing water uptake of vegetated pots against non vegetated replicates which are assumed to contain only soil evaporation component the calculation was based on mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures reported for melbourne australia from 2014 to 2017 plant uptake was calculated using linear regression equations r2 0 75 for all plants produced from collected water uptake and temperature data during two tested seasons minimum water requirements were based on evaporation loss from non vegetated design univariate analysis of variance was used to test the differences in water uptake of designs across different temperature and relative humidity data points the relationships between these factors were further explored using pairwise comparison of estimated marginal means with no confidence interval adjustments non parametric mann kendall test was used to understand the correlations between water uptake and temperature and relative humidity conditions significance for all statistical tests was accepted at 0 05 however actual significance values were also calculated ibm spss statistics 25 software was used for all statistical analysis data points collected on mondays were used to compare the differences between two measurement methods weight and volume methods this was done to increase the accuracy of both methods by removing the artefacts of previous dosing days additionally as monday data represents three days of water consumption higher water retention values are used to better illustrate the differences between two measuring methods univariate analysis of variance was used to test the differences between the two methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 water retention during single dosing event the overall results point to high variability of water uptake of selected green wall designs across two tested seasons winter and summer these differences are highlighted in fig 4 which illustrates daily water retention of each design during summer no significant difference was observed between water retention of non vegetated and o japonicus designs p 0 08 across all temperature conditions surprisingly o japonicus designs even had marginally lower water needs suggesting that plants might have been receiving part of their water needs from the surrounding humid environment on the other hand c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium had significantly greater water retention than both non vegetated and o japonicus designs with c appressa having the greatest retention on average 4 3 l m2 and l muscari the lowest on average 3 l m2 the difference in water retention between these plants and non vegetated design suggests that during summer evaporation of the water from the media accounted for 35 50 of the overall water loss volume of water evaporated between two dosing events and retained after irrigation while the rest was likely contributed to plant transpiration and uptake during the winter period similar but less distinct patterns were observed fig 4 while c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium still had the average water retention higher than non vegetated and o japonicus designs only c appressa and n obliterata had significantly greater results across most temperature and relative humidity measurements p 0 05 data presented in section 3 2 this suggests that during the colder weather in winter months plants tend to lower their activity and water needs going into a state of temporary dormancy rohde and bhalerao 2007 during winter it is likely that evaporation from the media accounted for 42 83 of the overall water loss depending on a plant while l muscari had lower average water retention during summer than m parvifolium this was not the case during winter where its water needs where marginally greater this suggests that plant seasonal activity the difference in activity of various plants across the seasons might be another significant factor when determining plant water needs wang et al 2017 it should be noted that high water retention plants c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium had observably greater shoot and likely root mass compared to o japonicus requiring more water to sustain and grow faster gillooly et al 2001 this hypothesis is further strengthened by nutrient uptake rates of these plants seen in prodanovic et al 2019 where c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium have significantly greater nitrogen and phosphorus uptake compared to o japonicus and non vegetated designs hence there is a positive correlation between plant water requirements and nutrient uptake rates which was also suggested by read et al 2008 in stormwater biofilters another important design factor is how much water is being taken up by each level of the three level green wall fig 5 illustrates the average daily water retention of each of the three green wall levels fig 2 across different designs and seasons the both summer and winter results show twofold greater water retention in the top pots on average 56 of total water uptake of the whole configuration compared to the middle pots 27 of total water uptake for c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium while the bottom level retained the least volume of dosed water 18 of total water uptake this is similar to what is seen in the literature for traditional potable water green walls urrestarazu et al 2017 even though some variation in the water retention between these plants can be seen at the top level all bottom levels retained similar volume on the other hand water retention did not significantly vary across different levels for non vegetated and o japonicus designs for both summer and winter conditions showing lower retention volumes in winter but similar water distribution across different green wall levels these results suggest that there is no difference in media drying and the percentage of water lost on evaporation across three levels of the green wall while plant activity transpiration was the likely reason for high water uptake and subsequent water retention after dosing at the top levels accounting for 64 75 of the overall water needs the data suggests that evaporation was dominant process for the lowest bottom levels 67 86 it is possible that top level plants more sun exposure used water for their increased metabolic activity photosynthesis resulting in their more substantial growth and development compared to the lower levels verdaguer et al 2018 additionally due to their direct sun exposure it is likely that these plants had amplified water transpiration through their more developed above ground structures shoots and leaves finally as these systems have been grown in nutrient rich environment dosing with high nutrient light greywater distribution of nutrients throughout all three levels likely played an important role in plant development and metabolic processes since most nutrients were dissolved in water elazab et al 2016 while these results provide good insight into the overall performance and water uptake of the system across different seasons significant variations exist within each season to understand what drives the variability of measurements within a single design the correlations with outside factors such as air temperature and relative humidity need to be assessed 3 2 factors influencing water uptake in green wall systems 3 2 1 correlation between water uptake and temperature fig 6 shows the relationship between temperature and daily water uptake between two dosing events of different plants compared to non vegetated control design similar to what was seen in section 3 1 o japonicus and non vegetated designs are following similar patterns p 0 05 across most temperatures showing no significant change of water uptake across winter temperatures from 9 3 to 16 5 c in summer both designs show increase water uptake with the rise in temperature from 20 to 30 c this suggest that evaporation is the dominant water loss process for both o japonicus and non vegetated designs c appressa designs showed similar water uptake rates to non vegetated design during winter from 9 3 to 11 4 c p 0 08 above that range the increase of air temperature correlated with the increase in water uptake p 0 001 suggesting that c appressa plant activity transpiration and uptake was starting to become dominant process from 11 4 to 16 5 c it is likely that metabolic processes of c appressa affecting plant development and growth where able to stay active even at lower winter temperatures glaister et al 2017 during summer c appressa consumed significantly more water than non vegetated design p 0 001 however both designs had similar water uptake trend fig 6 this suggests that while the plant activity is a dominant factor water needs of the c appressa plant do not rise with the increase in temperature but rather water evaporation from the media increases similar was observed for l muscari and m parvifolium in summer where both planted designs are following non vegetated system s trend however during winter water uptake of l muscari and m parvifolium shows only marginal dependency on temperature uptake is statistically higher only in four measurement points suggesting that most of the water is being lost to evaporation as reported in section 3 1 this suggests that these plants tend to become more dormant during winter rohde and bhalerao 2007 in winter conditions n obliterata showed less prominent increase of water uptake above temperatures of 11 4 c p 0 001 compared to c appressa suggesting lower plant activity fig 6 nevertheless during summer n obliterata showed higher water uptake trend compared to non vegetated design which was not observed for other tested plants suggesting that the increase in temperature is causing the rise in water needs of the plant it is not clear whether this is due to the increased transpiration through high leaf area or if metabolic processes were amplified due to higher temperatures additionally while on average n obliterata showed lower water needs compared to c appressa fig 4 its increased plant activity resulted in higher water demands at temperatures above 27 c observing the fit of the data with corresponding linear functions reported in r2 values fig 6 it is likely that temperature is one of the major factors influencing water requirements of green wall systems however some evident outliers are present throughout all designs which suggest that other factors are impacting these values 3 2 2 correlation between water uptake and humidity the effect of air humidity on water uptake of green walls was evaluated in fig 7 the results show no correlation between relative humidity and water uptake within non vegetated design for both summer and winter period p 0 38 it is likely that media alone does not absorb water humidity from the air or that increased relative humidity does not enhance this process if it occurs at some base level however winter data for vegetated designs point to negative correlation between these parameters with the increase in relative humidity there is a decrease in water uptake while this is marginally seen in o japonicus results p 0 05 this trend is dominant in other tested plant species fig 7 and supplementary material this suggests that in winter plants tend to satisfy a part of their water needs by taking up water from surrounding humid air dekker et al 2016 the highest water requirement plants c appressa and n obliterata exhibited the greatest correlation with relative humidity p 0 001 proposing that in winter these plants actively use air humidity as a source of water for their metabolic processes it is also possible that due to their high leaf surface area they can interact more with their surroundings vesala et al 2017 however this interaction is not a dominant factor as l muscari has similarly high leaf surface area but less pronounced trend with humidity during summer even though similar relative humidity values were observed there appears to be no significant correlation between water uptake and humidity levels across most plant species while not statistically significant due to high variation in measurements only n obliterata showed the decrease in water uptake with the increase in humidity during summer these results coupled with the temperature correlation fig 6 suggest high activity of the n obliterata in summer period interacting with its surroundings using both above ground leaves and below ground roots plant structures schwerbrock and leuschner 2016 this activity is less pronounced or not present in other tested vegetated designs due to the looser data fit to linear trend functions in this analysis depicted with r2 values and outlier data in fig 7 it is evident that air humidity might not be the main factor that explains water requirements of a green wall system nevertheless data suggests that relative humidity might be one of the important factors and should be likely considered as a critical parameter when creating a more advanced water needs model in the future 3 3 comparison of two measuring methods weight vs volume method during winter measuring inflow and outflow volumes of different designs fig 8 volume method seem to consistently point to greater green wall water retention compared to weight measurements of the system before and after dosing fig 8 weight method due to high data variability of this method the overestimation is not as significant for non vegetated o japonicus p 0 17 and c appressa designs p 0 04 while average values reported for n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium using volume method are threefold greater then values for weight method considered more accurate p 0 001 the likely reason for high discrepancy between measurement methods might be the high uncertainty of the volume method consisting of the error caused by estimation of inflow volume for each individual replicate additional sources of error might be clogging of the inflow drippers when using greywater possible errors caused by water spills and drips outside sampling containers potential unregistered changes in dosing conditions and possible rough human errors in conducting the measurements the human error might have been also present in weight method however due to lower number of variables in this experiment it was less likely to occur it is also possible that volume method is less accurate in lower water retention ranges due to the accumulation of errors additionally volume method falsely suggested that n obliterata and l muscari exhibited greater water retention compared to c appressa which is an artefact of methods uncertainty on the other hand during summer both methods seem to provide similar results with some fluctuations across all designs p 0 05 for all designs except c appressa where p 0 043 fig 8 while the uncertainty in volume method is still high it appears to give a more accurate water retention estimates when water requirements of the designs are greater it is possible that the use of potable water in summer conditions has reduced some of the uncertainty in the volume method by creating more consistent and uniform inflow conditions likely not present in the winter the results suggest that both weight and volume methods can be viable during warmer summer period 3 4 practical recommendations based on collected data maximum and minimum annual water uptake was calculated for all plants using linear regression between plant water uptake and temperature fig 6 and presented in table 2 it is shown that c appressa and n obliterata would be the most significant water consumers with maximum annual water demands of 913 and 912 l m2 respectively on the other hand o japonicus has the lowest maximum annual demand with 377 l m2 this points to significant differences between plant species and the importance of understanding plant water requirements prior to building a green wall system these annual water uptake calculations can help inform the design of these systems by comparing known greywater production volumes and size of the system with selected plants water demand table 2 also gives a range of monthly water uptakes of different plant species this helps to further estimate greywater needs for a month in concern especially if drying periods are planned monthly water uptake range of highest and lowest annual uptake plants c appressa and o japonicus are also presented in fig 9 to illustrate monthly water uptake change and the difference between two plant species depending on a size growing habit seasonal activity tested plant species showed different water requirements pointing to the importance of understanding local conditions as well as the plant characteristics before designing system of appropriate size if oversized green wall with high water demand plants is built on a limited and insufficient greywater production building it is likely that plants in the green wall will struggle due to the lack of water and there might not be any treated effluent for subsequent reuse additionally if irrigation water is a constraining factor not enough of greywater production some plants with expected high pollutant removal performance but also high water demands like c appressa might not be applicable the required reuse volume might need to be balanced with the effluent quality the results of this study also pointed at the benefit of selective plant placement on different green wall levels suggesting that higher uptake plants should be used on top levels while lower water requirement plants could be more useful on lower levels this will assure better utilisation of plants reduce overall water requirements of the system and assure a variety of species in the green wall making them aesthetically more pleasing furthermore the results showed the importance of understanding local air temperature and relative humidity conditions of the area where green wall is to be built as these factors have high influence on different plant species and their specific water needs when it comes to water retention measurement methods both weight and volume method have their uses weight method is recommended if higher precision data is required while the volume method is appropriate if only estimate of water retention is needed additionally the use of volume method might not be advisable for the estimation of the highest and lowest water retention design or plant as it might provide a false conclusion affected by the methods uncertainty while easier to conduct volume method might give less reliable results due to dripper clogging occurring under high suspended solids concentration in greywater 4 conclusions this study explored water retention and uptake of five different plant species used in a greywater treating green wall environment the results showed high impact of seasonal change on water uptake of all plant species where summer uptake was three to four times higher than winter uptake depending on the design while plant uptake and transpiration were dominant forms of water loss in summer during winter evaporation of water from the media is a primary process examination of water retention within a three level green wall system highlighted that most water is being lost at the top levels due to increased plant activity in these pots while significantly lower up to four times water loss at the bottom level has been contributed to evaporation temperature changes within different seasons pointed to high plant activity and reactiveness to different temperatures in winter months of the c appressa plant however same was not observed for summer period where only significant evaporation increase with the increase in temperature is observed similar winter trend to a lesser degree was detected for n obliterata while during summer this planted design showed rise in plant water needs with temperature increase these findings suggest that plant seasonality and growth cycles play a major role in determining their water requirements across the year the changes in relative humidity across the seasons had no effect water uptake of non vegetated design suggesting that media alone cannot absorb water from the air however with the increase in humidity during winter plant water uptake from the irrigation lowered pointing to the ability of the plants to absorb moisture from the air this effect was more dominant in higher metabolic rate plants c appressa n obliterata and l muscari however similar trend in summer was only observed for n obliterata while air temperature and relative humidity for some designs are major factors when assessing green wall water needs based on the fit values with corresponding linear functions r2 it is suggested that there are other factors which influence water uptake after analysing two water balance measuring methods weight and volume methods it can be concluded that while both are useable in most scenarios the selection of appropriate measuring method will depend on required precision of data set with weight method giving more precise measurements while volume method is adequate for water retention estimates even though this paper focussed on water requirements of greywater treating green walls acquired results can be transferred to traditional green wall systems with potable water usage due to climate variations in different regions monitoring should be assured for any newly constructed system furthermore retaining natural complex bio chemical interactions which are climate specific was one of the aims of the methodology and since the work was conducted under natural temperature and humidity regimes of temperate oceanic climate these results cannot be directly transferred to other climates hence further work is needed to test green wall system s water needs in cold and tropical climates finally the results of this work will help to guide future creation of robust green wall water requirements model

18433,green walls are becoming a popular infrastructure choice in densely built urban environments due to their multiple benefits however high and vastly variable water requirements of these systems are preventing their further widespread only a small number of studies have investigated water needs of green walls even though this can help to design more optimal systems with increased benefits additionally the knowledge on interactions between plant uptake and climate conditions temperature and humidity is lacking the aim of this study was to understand daily water requirements of five plant species c appressa n obliterata l muscari m parvifolium and o japonicus used in greywater treating green walls across different seasons temperature and humidity conditions of temperate oceanic climate common in parts of australia us and europe the results showed that during summer dominant water uptake processes were plant uptake and transpiration resulting in three to four times higher water needs than during winter when evaporation is a major effect top levels of the multi level green wall exhibited significantly higher plant activity compared to bottom levels showing four times greater water uptake temperature and humidity changes during winter caused the change in water uptake of plants pointing to different growing and activity patterns of tested plants during summer only n obliterata showed temperature and humidity dependence annual plant water uptake and other practical recommendations are given based on the results even though this study focused on water requirements of greywater treating green walls its findings can also inform traditional green wall designs graphical abstract image 1 keywords watering irrigation temperate climate seasonal variation temperature humidity 1 introduction rapid population growth and urbanisation have caused severe densification of our cities due to the lack of horizontal surfaces in heavily urbanised areas traditional greening solutions such as trees parks and wetlands are starting to be replaced by space saving green infrastructures like green roofs and green walls while both green roofs and green walls have a wide range of benefits such as energy savings coma et al 2017 acoustic isolation azkorra et al 2015 cooling collins et al 2017 and liveability increase wang et al 2014 the vertical position of the green walls makes them more versatile systems which could be placed on most existing and new structures medl et al 2017 additionally green walls are considered to have high aesthetic value as they are visually more accessible and pleasing perini and rosasco 2013 however all green wall systems are considered expensive to build and maintain perini and rosasco 2013 one of the most significant reason that prevents the widespread use of green wall systems is their high water requirement manso and castro gomes 2014 green wall water demand can reach up to 20 l m2 of potable water per day in more dry arid environments such as australia and california usa department of environment and primary industries 2014 this is a significant problem considering increasing water scarcity issue in these regions on the other hand green wall water requirements can be highly variable in different climates with some reported values as low as 1 l m2 per day in cooler climates riley 2017 this variability creates the challenge as there are no clear recommendations on how efficiently to irrigate these systems to minimise maintenance costs and preserve all their benefits additionally inappropriate green wall irrigation schemes overwatering or underwatering are one of the leading causes of system failure and death of plants rayner et al 2010 surprisingly current scientific literature contains little information on water needs of green walls while green roofs have been extensively studied beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 to assess green wall water uptake we mainly rely on non peer reviewed reports published by green wall manufacturers treebox 2016 vertology ltd 2014 a rare study that has explored this topic was done by urrestarazu et al 2017 they examined the effect of seasonal change on green wall water uptake across two mixed plant species finding that in that spanish region water needs varied from 1 5 l m2 in winter to 5 1 l m2 in summer optimisation of irrigation scheme was the aim of another study conducted by pérez urrestarazu et al 2014 both studies were done on a very small number of plant species combining different plants in a single system preventing plant association with water uptake additionally impacts of climate conditions temperature humidity seasons etc have not been examined understanding of green wall water needs is also crucial for the assessment of their cooling properties which is a major benefit of these systems malys et al 2016 if plant evapotranspiration et is known modelling of cooling impact could be performed this was shown in a study conducted by malys et al 2014 where hydrothermal model was used to assess cooling effect of a green wall system while this study measured water uptake of the whole green wall unit by weighing the system during watering water consumption results were only used as an input to the model and not presented in the manuscript additionally it is not clear which plant species were used for the green wall design and individual water uptake of each plant was not assessed to answer the high potable water requirements of green wall systems recently a new approach has been proposed that completely negates the need for potable water irrigation of green wall systems by redesigning green walls into greywater treatment technology riley 2017 prodanovic et al 2019 nevertheless even with water treatment systems it is still important to understand water losses due to plant uptake and evaporation from the system as it will directly impact the volume of treated greywater available for reuse at the bottom of the green wall the higher the water loss the lower available volumes for reuse green walls designed as greywater treatment systems operate in unique conditions of overwatering in order to create extra treated water for reuse prodanovic et al 2017 2019 which can be harmful for various plants in green wall environment riley 2017 therefore an appropriate selection of plants is needed as well as the understanding of their water uptake in order to create proper water balance for green wall systems tuttolomondo et al 2015 it was found that a part of plant water uptake and evaporation will depend on water distribution in the media pérez urrestarazu et al 2014 jørgensen et al 2018 with coco coir suggested as a medium that offers the best conditions for plant access to water and development jørgensen et al 2018 this is significant because if water is not properly distributed throughout the media new irrigation water might create preferential pathways through the system and affect water uptake results not providing a clear perspective on plant requirements while it is known that seasonal variations are significant for plant activity and their water needs wang et al 2017 researchers have pointed that some plants might be more affected by fluctuations in air temperature and relative humidity rull et al 2016 hence it is crucial to understand the behaviour of green wall systems in varied temperature and humidity conditions across different growing seasons additionally to create accurate future estimates of water consumptions of different plant species water uptake processes need to be understood analysing separately evaporation and plant uptake processes as well as their dependence on varied climate conditions this is especially significant in temperate and arid regions australia western usa southern europe where green walls can achieve the most benefits current scientific literature still lacks knowledge in this area for both traditional and greywater treating green wall systems riley 2017 it can be concluded that there has been very limited research into water uptake by conventional green walls and no research on the water uptake of greywater treating green walls that operate under constant overwatering conditions this study aims to fill this research gap by looking into water requirements of five plant species in a large scale laboratory based green wall experiment monitored throughout the two most extreme seasons in australia summer and winter highest and lowest water uptake the results collected in this experiment were used to answer following research questions what is the daily water retention capacity across different plant species during summer and winter conditions of temperate oceanic climate what is the plant uptake and water retention capacity of multi level green wall systems which level retains the most water and why what is the relationship between the water uptake and local temperature and humidity conditions of different plant species during summer and winter conditions what are the proportions of evaporation and transpiration throughout all tested conditions since the methodology for water balance data collection is varied in the literature the secondary aim of this work was to explore the differences between two monitoring methods for water uptake to ascertain which method is more applicable for use in specifically targeted studies the paper also provides practical recommendations on irrigation regimes plant choice and data collection 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design 2 1 1 green wall setup this study was conducted at the monash university clayton campus which is located in the semi urban part of melbourne australia for the green wall elements commercially available gro wall 4 modular green wall system atlantis australia was used with every pot occupied by a single plant fig 1 the system was attached to custom built support wall three vertical pots dimensions of each pot 200 mm width x 200 mm depth x 150 mm height containing the same plant species created a single test configuration see figs 1 and 2 this was done to test the effect of multi level green wall design on water retention and plant uptake based on the recommendation by pérez urrestarazu et al 2014 and prodanovic et al 2019 for achieving irrigation uniformity uniform wetting and appropriate water treatment standards six dripper irrigation system was used equally distributed over the area of the pot delivering 8 l h of water into every top pot of each configuration after dosing the top pot gravity driven water would trickle through multiple holes at the bottom of the pots into subsequent levels middle and bottom levels finally being collected after at the bottom level fig 2 an experiment used two green wall systems 2 5 m high and 2 5 m apart to prevent shading each with two experimental rows of configurations figs 1 and 2 to simulate natural conditions green walls were set up in the specially constructed open air greenhouse no side walls with a clear impermeable roof preventing rainfall but retaining local wind speeds inside the greenhouse both green walls had west facing orientation temperature conditions more challenging and consistent across seasons and full natural sunshine throughout the day no significant external shading with recorded greenhouse temperature variation of up to 44 c in summer and down to 2 c in winter this temperature variation is typical for temperate oceanic climates following the köppen climate classification which are dominant in melbourne australia but can also be found in southern and western europe west coast of usa and northern parts of south america since this study aimed to retain complex natural bio chemical interactions which are climate specific the results of this work are only applicable to similar climates the mix of perlite and coco coir with a ratio 1 2 was used to fill the pots approximately 6 l as previous green wall studies found it effective for greywater treatment while having low clogging risk prodanovic et al 2017 2018 additionally coco coir was found to be effective media for proper moisture distribution in green wall systems jørgensen et al 2018 which affects water retention and plant uptake to test how different plant species influence water requirements of the green wall five different plants were used listed in table 1 selection was based upon current green wall plant species used in australia department of environment and primary industries 2014 with special criteria concerning nutrient uptake capability salt tolerance over and under watering sensitivity growth rate and growth characteristics prodanovic et al 2019 these criteria were used to find plants resilient to a range of suboptimal conditions which exist in greywater treating green walls prodanovic et al 2019 plants were sourced from a local nursery at a similar developmental stage young tube stock plants around 8 cm tall ready for planting in ground carefully removed from original soil and planted in experimental green wall the first water balance tests were conducted ten months after initial planting to allow plant growth and establishment within the green wall environment a non vegetated configuration was included to examine the effect of evaporation as well as to be a comparison point for water uptake of different plant species to avoid the inherent variability in laboratory vegetated studies each configuration had five physical replicates except for the unvegetated configuration which had four replicates due to lower variability fig 2 totalling 29 tested system configurations replicates were randomly positioned on the green wall structure to negate the effect of preferential positioning on the wall 2 2 experimental procedure the experiment was performed from august 2016 until february 2018 fig 3 green wall was watered dosed monday to friday i e five times per week while it was left to dry during weekends saturday and sunday during each dosing day 4 l of water was passed through each configuration over 30 min inflow rate of 8 l h dosing volume was determined based on the previously published methodology prodanovic et al 2019 considering water reuse aspect of these green walls the highest plant water demand previously reported by the literature for australian conditions of 2 l day 15 l m2 per day department of environment and primary industries 2014 scaled to this experiment was doubled to 4 l day equivalent to 30 l m2 to create excess flow for reuse from august 2016 until august 2017 the experimental green wall system was dosed using synthetic light greywater mix fig 3 this mix was prepared using recipe developed by diaper et al 2008 and modified by fowdar et al 2017 designed to mimic bathtub shower and hand basin effluent similar recipes have been previously used for testing green wall and living wall systems under greywater inflows prodanovic et al 2018 2019 barron et al 2019 since greywater can result in green wall media clogging accumulation of particles and closing of media pores thus changing water distribution inside media and affecting plant water uptake rigorous infiltration tests have been conducted exfiltration hydrographs have been measured with 2 min resolution after initial system establishment in november 2016 and on the mature system in july 2017 8 months apart it was found that after initial media saturation period first 10 min from the start of dosing with dosing rate of 8 0 2 l h average exfiltration was 8 3 0 3 and 8 1 0 4 l h for november and july respectively showing that hydraulic properties of the green wall have not changed significantly during this time since no clogging was observed in a system during the first year of operation and plants were healthy achieving expected growth upon visual qualitative inspection it was concluded that greywater pollutants had no significant effect on properties of the system and the source of water did not play a major role in green wall water retention and plant requirements due to this and to further simulate real green wall operational conditions from august 2017 until february 2018 green walls have been dosed only with potable water fig 3 while same irrigation volumes were kept 4 l per configuration per day switching from greywater to potable water is expected to occur in regular operational life of such system and by conducting previously described exfiltration tests we assured that no new experimental uncertainties are introduced and that switch wouldn t significantly impact water uptake to estimate the effect of low temperatures occurring in late autumn and winter jointly labelled as winter due to similar temperature and humidity conditions on green wall water retention and uptake twelve water balance measurements were conducted over three consecutive weeks in may 2017 and six additional measurements were performed in july 2017 covering a range of average daily temperatures from 9 3 to 16 5 c this period is also naturally low growth season for selected ornamental plants to assess the effect of high summer temperatures on green wall water retention and uptake eight water balance measurements were conducted in december 2017 with additional four measurements in january 2018 covering a range of average daily temperatures from 20 to 30 c these winter and summer measurements assured a good spread of plant water uptake measurements across most temperature and humidity conditions plant activity was estimated qualitatively through observation of growth and plant health signs of dead leaves or flowers and by assessing water uptake patterns furthermore review of the literature was conducted on each plant and it s growing habits this was done as a non destructive method since for more detailed plant evaluation systems would have to be disturbed which would change experimental conditions and increase uncertainty of measurement results water balance was measured using two different methods during each measurement day at approximately the same time of the day both methods assumed no significant evapotranspiration during the short dosing period 30 min the weight method was performed by weighing each individual green wall pot before and after daily water dosing by subtracting these values within a single day volume of water retained within a green wall after dosing can be determined assuming water density ρwater 1 g cm3 wafter wbefore vretained at the same time analysing two consecutive days approximately 24 h shows a daily water uptake of the green wall design between two dosing events wday1 after wday2 before vuptake the volume method consisted of collecting a two representative inflow volume samples using separate six dripper system connected on a main irrigation line and outflow volume samples from each configuration separately fig 2 during each dosing event by subtracting inflow and outflow volumes an estimate of water retained within a system can be made vin vout vretained pointing to daily water consumption rate of different designs vegetated and non vegetated for each configuration that had less than six drippers working inflow volume was scaled down to reflect appropriate number of working drippers assuming uniform flow rate for each dripper in a rare case where less than four drippers were working the data point was discarded due to possible artefact of inflow downscaling air temperature and relative humidity measurements for this period were collected using two calibrated continuous loggers 6 min measurements averaged across the hour positioned within the greenhouse due to technical equipment malfunction some relative humidity data points during the summer period had to be collected from nearby weather station operated by melbourne s bureau of meteorology 2 3 data analysis data collected throughout experimental period using two methods were used to calculate green wall water retention during a single dosing and green wall water consumption between two dosing events simple calculation for each method outlined in section 2 2 due to high uncertainty in the volume method data collected using this method were only used for the methods comparison for all other analyses more accurate weight method data were used data results were collected as litres l of water per three sampling pots of the green wall for better presentation of the results where applicable results have been transformed into litres per 1 m2 area of the green wall l m2 based on the gro wall 4 system design 21 5 green wall pots correspond to 1 m2 of green wall to assess the average daily water retention across different designs and green wall levels 13 winter and 7 summer measuring events were averaged since these measurements were conducted under different temperature and relative humidity conditions error bars only show potential minimum and maximum water retention for specific design and season hence error bars are not used when comparison between different designs are made and these comparisons are described only based on average values monday measuring events were discarded from this analysis due to incomparably higher water retention caused by two dry weekend days to calculate the water loss the pots were weighed after water dosing on the first day and before water dosing on the following day subtracting these values to obtain daily water uptake of a configuration this was done across 11 winter and 8 summer events with all replicates showed on a graph average daily air temperature and relative humidity data for these events were calculated as the average value of data collected from 12 a m on the first day until 12 a m on the following day simple linear regression was used to assess the trends between designs water uptake and temperature and humidity changes based on the data collected in this study estimations of annual water uptake per m2 of the green wall for each plant were made along with monthly plant water uptakes plant water uptake and transpiration process was estimated by comparing water uptake of vegetated pots against non vegetated replicates which are assumed to contain only soil evaporation component the calculation was based on mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures reported for melbourne australia from 2014 to 2017 plant uptake was calculated using linear regression equations r2 0 75 for all plants produced from collected water uptake and temperature data during two tested seasons minimum water requirements were based on evaporation loss from non vegetated design univariate analysis of variance was used to test the differences in water uptake of designs across different temperature and relative humidity data points the relationships between these factors were further explored using pairwise comparison of estimated marginal means with no confidence interval adjustments non parametric mann kendall test was used to understand the correlations between water uptake and temperature and relative humidity conditions significance for all statistical tests was accepted at 0 05 however actual significance values were also calculated ibm spss statistics 25 software was used for all statistical analysis data points collected on mondays were used to compare the differences between two measurement methods weight and volume methods this was done to increase the accuracy of both methods by removing the artefacts of previous dosing days additionally as monday data represents three days of water consumption higher water retention values are used to better illustrate the differences between two measuring methods univariate analysis of variance was used to test the differences between the two methods 3 results and discussion 3 1 water retention during single dosing event the overall results point to high variability of water uptake of selected green wall designs across two tested seasons winter and summer these differences are highlighted in fig 4 which illustrates daily water retention of each design during summer no significant difference was observed between water retention of non vegetated and o japonicus designs p 0 08 across all temperature conditions surprisingly o japonicus designs even had marginally lower water needs suggesting that plants might have been receiving part of their water needs from the surrounding humid environment on the other hand c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium had significantly greater water retention than both non vegetated and o japonicus designs with c appressa having the greatest retention on average 4 3 l m2 and l muscari the lowest on average 3 l m2 the difference in water retention between these plants and non vegetated design suggests that during summer evaporation of the water from the media accounted for 35 50 of the overall water loss volume of water evaporated between two dosing events and retained after irrigation while the rest was likely contributed to plant transpiration and uptake during the winter period similar but less distinct patterns were observed fig 4 while c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium still had the average water retention higher than non vegetated and o japonicus designs only c appressa and n obliterata had significantly greater results across most temperature and relative humidity measurements p 0 05 data presented in section 3 2 this suggests that during the colder weather in winter months plants tend to lower their activity and water needs going into a state of temporary dormancy rohde and bhalerao 2007 during winter it is likely that evaporation from the media accounted for 42 83 of the overall water loss depending on a plant while l muscari had lower average water retention during summer than m parvifolium this was not the case during winter where its water needs where marginally greater this suggests that plant seasonal activity the difference in activity of various plants across the seasons might be another significant factor when determining plant water needs wang et al 2017 it should be noted that high water retention plants c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium had observably greater shoot and likely root mass compared to o japonicus requiring more water to sustain and grow faster gillooly et al 2001 this hypothesis is further strengthened by nutrient uptake rates of these plants seen in prodanovic et al 2019 where c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium have significantly greater nitrogen and phosphorus uptake compared to o japonicus and non vegetated designs hence there is a positive correlation between plant water requirements and nutrient uptake rates which was also suggested by read et al 2008 in stormwater biofilters another important design factor is how much water is being taken up by each level of the three level green wall fig 5 illustrates the average daily water retention of each of the three green wall levels fig 2 across different designs and seasons the both summer and winter results show twofold greater water retention in the top pots on average 56 of total water uptake of the whole configuration compared to the middle pots 27 of total water uptake for c appressa n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium while the bottom level retained the least volume of dosed water 18 of total water uptake this is similar to what is seen in the literature for traditional potable water green walls urrestarazu et al 2017 even though some variation in the water retention between these plants can be seen at the top level all bottom levels retained similar volume on the other hand water retention did not significantly vary across different levels for non vegetated and o japonicus designs for both summer and winter conditions showing lower retention volumes in winter but similar water distribution across different green wall levels these results suggest that there is no difference in media drying and the percentage of water lost on evaporation across three levels of the green wall while plant activity transpiration was the likely reason for high water uptake and subsequent water retention after dosing at the top levels accounting for 64 75 of the overall water needs the data suggests that evaporation was dominant process for the lowest bottom levels 67 86 it is possible that top level plants more sun exposure used water for their increased metabolic activity photosynthesis resulting in their more substantial growth and development compared to the lower levels verdaguer et al 2018 additionally due to their direct sun exposure it is likely that these plants had amplified water transpiration through their more developed above ground structures shoots and leaves finally as these systems have been grown in nutrient rich environment dosing with high nutrient light greywater distribution of nutrients throughout all three levels likely played an important role in plant development and metabolic processes since most nutrients were dissolved in water elazab et al 2016 while these results provide good insight into the overall performance and water uptake of the system across different seasons significant variations exist within each season to understand what drives the variability of measurements within a single design the correlations with outside factors such as air temperature and relative humidity need to be assessed 3 2 factors influencing water uptake in green wall systems 3 2 1 correlation between water uptake and temperature fig 6 shows the relationship between temperature and daily water uptake between two dosing events of different plants compared to non vegetated control design similar to what was seen in section 3 1 o japonicus and non vegetated designs are following similar patterns p 0 05 across most temperatures showing no significant change of water uptake across winter temperatures from 9 3 to 16 5 c in summer both designs show increase water uptake with the rise in temperature from 20 to 30 c this suggest that evaporation is the dominant water loss process for both o japonicus and non vegetated designs c appressa designs showed similar water uptake rates to non vegetated design during winter from 9 3 to 11 4 c p 0 08 above that range the increase of air temperature correlated with the increase in water uptake p 0 001 suggesting that c appressa plant activity transpiration and uptake was starting to become dominant process from 11 4 to 16 5 c it is likely that metabolic processes of c appressa affecting plant development and growth where able to stay active even at lower winter temperatures glaister et al 2017 during summer c appressa consumed significantly more water than non vegetated design p 0 001 however both designs had similar water uptake trend fig 6 this suggests that while the plant activity is a dominant factor water needs of the c appressa plant do not rise with the increase in temperature but rather water evaporation from the media increases similar was observed for l muscari and m parvifolium in summer where both planted designs are following non vegetated system s trend however during winter water uptake of l muscari and m parvifolium shows only marginal dependency on temperature uptake is statistically higher only in four measurement points suggesting that most of the water is being lost to evaporation as reported in section 3 1 this suggests that these plants tend to become more dormant during winter rohde and bhalerao 2007 in winter conditions n obliterata showed less prominent increase of water uptake above temperatures of 11 4 c p 0 001 compared to c appressa suggesting lower plant activity fig 6 nevertheless during summer n obliterata showed higher water uptake trend compared to non vegetated design which was not observed for other tested plants suggesting that the increase in temperature is causing the rise in water needs of the plant it is not clear whether this is due to the increased transpiration through high leaf area or if metabolic processes were amplified due to higher temperatures additionally while on average n obliterata showed lower water needs compared to c appressa fig 4 its increased plant activity resulted in higher water demands at temperatures above 27 c observing the fit of the data with corresponding linear functions reported in r2 values fig 6 it is likely that temperature is one of the major factors influencing water requirements of green wall systems however some evident outliers are present throughout all designs which suggest that other factors are impacting these values 3 2 2 correlation between water uptake and humidity the effect of air humidity on water uptake of green walls was evaluated in fig 7 the results show no correlation between relative humidity and water uptake within non vegetated design for both summer and winter period p 0 38 it is likely that media alone does not absorb water humidity from the air or that increased relative humidity does not enhance this process if it occurs at some base level however winter data for vegetated designs point to negative correlation between these parameters with the increase in relative humidity there is a decrease in water uptake while this is marginally seen in o japonicus results p 0 05 this trend is dominant in other tested plant species fig 7 and supplementary material this suggests that in winter plants tend to satisfy a part of their water needs by taking up water from surrounding humid air dekker et al 2016 the highest water requirement plants c appressa and n obliterata exhibited the greatest correlation with relative humidity p 0 001 proposing that in winter these plants actively use air humidity as a source of water for their metabolic processes it is also possible that due to their high leaf surface area they can interact more with their surroundings vesala et al 2017 however this interaction is not a dominant factor as l muscari has similarly high leaf surface area but less pronounced trend with humidity during summer even though similar relative humidity values were observed there appears to be no significant correlation between water uptake and humidity levels across most plant species while not statistically significant due to high variation in measurements only n obliterata showed the decrease in water uptake with the increase in humidity during summer these results coupled with the temperature correlation fig 6 suggest high activity of the n obliterata in summer period interacting with its surroundings using both above ground leaves and below ground roots plant structures schwerbrock and leuschner 2016 this activity is less pronounced or not present in other tested vegetated designs due to the looser data fit to linear trend functions in this analysis depicted with r2 values and outlier data in fig 7 it is evident that air humidity might not be the main factor that explains water requirements of a green wall system nevertheless data suggests that relative humidity might be one of the important factors and should be likely considered as a critical parameter when creating a more advanced water needs model in the future 3 3 comparison of two measuring methods weight vs volume method during winter measuring inflow and outflow volumes of different designs fig 8 volume method seem to consistently point to greater green wall water retention compared to weight measurements of the system before and after dosing fig 8 weight method due to high data variability of this method the overestimation is not as significant for non vegetated o japonicus p 0 17 and c appressa designs p 0 04 while average values reported for n obliterata l muscari and m parvifolium using volume method are threefold greater then values for weight method considered more accurate p 0 001 the likely reason for high discrepancy between measurement methods might be the high uncertainty of the volume method consisting of the error caused by estimation of inflow volume for each individual replicate additional sources of error might be clogging of the inflow drippers when using greywater possible errors caused by water spills and drips outside sampling containers potential unregistered changes in dosing conditions and possible rough human errors in conducting the measurements the human error might have been also present in weight method however due to lower number of variables in this experiment it was less likely to occur it is also possible that volume method is less accurate in lower water retention ranges due to the accumulation of errors additionally volume method falsely suggested that n obliterata and l muscari exhibited greater water retention compared to c appressa which is an artefact of methods uncertainty on the other hand during summer both methods seem to provide similar results with some fluctuations across all designs p 0 05 for all designs except c appressa where p 0 043 fig 8 while the uncertainty in volume method is still high it appears to give a more accurate water retention estimates when water requirements of the designs are greater it is possible that the use of potable water in summer conditions has reduced some of the uncertainty in the volume method by creating more consistent and uniform inflow conditions likely not present in the winter the results suggest that both weight and volume methods can be viable during warmer summer period 3 4 practical recommendations based on collected data maximum and minimum annual water uptake was calculated for all plants using linear regression between plant water uptake and temperature fig 6 and presented in table 2 it is shown that c appressa and n obliterata would be the most significant water consumers with maximum annual water demands of 913 and 912 l m2 respectively on the other hand o japonicus has the lowest maximum annual demand with 377 l m2 this points to significant differences between plant species and the importance of understanding plant water requirements prior to building a green wall system these annual water uptake calculations can help inform the design of these systems by comparing known greywater production volumes and size of the system with selected plants water demand table 2 also gives a range of monthly water uptakes of different plant species this helps to further estimate greywater needs for a month in concern especially if drying periods are planned monthly water uptake range of highest and lowest annual uptake plants c appressa and o japonicus are also presented in fig 9 to illustrate monthly water uptake change and the difference between two plant species depending on a size growing habit seasonal activity tested plant species showed different water requirements pointing to the importance of understanding local conditions as well as the plant characteristics before designing system of appropriate size if oversized green wall with high water demand plants is built on a limited and insufficient greywater production building it is likely that plants in the green wall will struggle due to the lack of water and there might not be any treated effluent for subsequent reuse additionally if irrigation water is a constraining factor not enough of greywater production some plants with expected high pollutant removal performance but also high water demands like c appressa might not be applicable the required reuse volume might need to be balanced with the effluent quality the results of this study also pointed at the benefit of selective plant placement on different green wall levels suggesting that higher uptake plants should be used on top levels while lower water requirement plants could be more useful on lower levels this will assure better utilisation of plants reduce overall water requirements of the system and assure a variety of species in the green wall making them aesthetically more pleasing furthermore the results showed the importance of understanding local air temperature and relative humidity conditions of the area where green wall is to be built as these factors have high influence on different plant species and their specific water needs when it comes to water retention measurement methods both weight and volume method have their uses weight method is recommended if higher precision data is required while the volume method is appropriate if only estimate of water retention is needed additionally the use of volume method might not be advisable for the estimation of the highest and lowest water retention design or plant as it might provide a false conclusion affected by the methods uncertainty while easier to conduct volume method might give less reliable results due to dripper clogging occurring under high suspended solids concentration in greywater 4 conclusions this study explored water retention and uptake of five different plant species used in a greywater treating green wall environment the results showed high impact of seasonal change on water uptake of all plant species where summer uptake was three to four times higher than winter uptake depending on the design while plant uptake and transpiration were dominant forms of water loss in summer during winter evaporation of water from the media is a primary process examination of water retention within a three level green wall system highlighted that most water is being lost at the top levels due to increased plant activity in these pots while significantly lower up to four times water loss at the bottom level has been contributed to evaporation temperature changes within different seasons pointed to high plant activity and reactiveness to different temperatures in winter months of the c appressa plant however same was not observed for summer period where only significant evaporation increase with the increase in temperature is observed similar winter trend to a lesser degree was detected for n obliterata while during summer this planted design showed rise in plant water needs with temperature increase these findings suggest that plant seasonality and growth cycles play a major role in determining their water requirements across the year the changes in relative humidity across the seasons had no effect water uptake of non vegetated design suggesting that media alone cannot absorb water from the air however with the increase in humidity during winter plant water uptake from the irrigation lowered pointing to the ability of the plants to absorb moisture from the air this effect was more dominant in higher metabolic rate plants c appressa n obliterata and l muscari however similar trend in summer was only observed for n obliterata while air temperature and relative humidity for some designs are major factors when assessing green wall water needs based on the fit values with corresponding linear functions r2 it is suggested that there are other factors which influence water uptake after analysing two water balance measuring methods weight and volume methods it can be concluded that while both are useable in most scenarios the selection of appropriate measuring method will depend on required precision of data set with weight method giving more precise measurements while volume method is adequate for water retention estimates even though this paper focussed on water requirements of greywater treating green walls acquired results can be transferred to traditional green wall systems with potable water usage due to climate variations in different regions monitoring should be assured for any newly constructed system furthermore retaining natural complex bio chemical interactions which are climate specific was one of the aims of the methodology and since the work was conducted under natural temperature and humidity regimes of temperate oceanic climate these results cannot be directly transferred to other climates hence further work is needed to test green wall system s water needs in cold and tropical climates finally the results of this work will help to guide future creation of robust green wall water requirements model

18434,unpredictable dewatering performance is a barrier to the effective management and treatment of faecal sludge while mechanisms of dewatering in sludges from wastewater treatment are well understood it is not clear how dewatering of faecal sludge fits into the framework of existing knowledge we evaluate physical chemical parameters including eps and cations and demographic source environmental microbial community and technical factors residence time as possible predictors of dewatering performance in faecal sludge and make comparisons to the existing conceptual model for wastewater sludge faecal sludge from public toilets took longer to dewater than sludge from other sources and had turbid supernatant after settling slow dewatering and turbid supernatant corresponded to high eps and monovalent cation concentrations conductivity and ph but cake solids after dewatering was not correlated with eps or other factors faecal sludges with higher eps appeared less stabilised than those with lower eps potentially a result of inhibition of biological degradation due to high urine concentrations however distinct microbial community compositions were also observed in samples with higher and lower eps concentrations higher eps faecal sludge was comparable in dewatering behaviour and eps content to anaerobically digested and primary wastewater sludges however lower eps faecal sludges had different dewatering behaviour than wastewater sludges and may be governed by different mechanisms graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal sludge eps cst stabilization public toilet 1 introduction one third of the world s population relies on onsite sanitation facilities like pit latrines and septic tanks and in low income countries less than 10 of urban areas are served by sewers world health organization and unicef 2017 peal et al 2014 the majority of cities in low income countries do not have adequate faecal sludge management with faecal sludge defined as what accumulates in onsite sanitation systems strande et al 2014 in low income countries the majority of faecal sludge is discharged untreated into the urban environment placing a huge burden on public and environmental health blackett et al 2014 cairncross and feachem 2019 efficient treatment and management systems are needed to safely manage these quantities of faecal sludge however unreliable solid liquid separation is a major bottleneck gold et al 2016 cofie et al 2006 knowledge is needed to be able to predict and improve dewatering performance of faecal sludge prior to implementation of management solutions such as decentralized transfer stations and to increase the capacity of existing faecal sludge treatment plants fstps gold et al 2016 strande et al 2018 solutions for improved dewatering performance are desperately needed to increase access to improved sanitation and make progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs relatively little research has been conducted on faecal sludge treatment processes as non sewered sanitation has only recently been acknowledged as a long term sustainable solution usepa 2005 strande et al 2018 strande et al 2014 in contrast centralized treatment processes such as activated sludge treatment have been researched for over one hundred years stensel and makinia 2014 many expectations about mechanisms governing dewatering of faecal sludge have in the past been derived from centralized wastewater treatment gold et al 2018a however faecal sludges are quite different from wastewater sludges for example faecal sludge can be comprised of any range of fresh excreta to products of anaerobic digestion from storage in containment and can include soil sand and municipal solid waste van eekert et al 2019 strande et al 2014 in contrast primary sludge is relatively fresh not stabilised easily settleable solids from raw wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2014 and activated sludge is mainly composed of bacterial cells and metabolic products generated during aerobic secondary treatment nielsen et al 2004 the metabolic products include high concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances eps that are produced during biological growth bala subramanian et al 2010 eps presents challenges for dewatering as it is highly charged and binds water forster 1983 flemming et al 1996 eps has the secondary effect of reducing turbidity as these charged polymer chains can also bridge particles together and form flocs when present in sufficiently high fractions mikkelsen and keiding 2002 christensen et al 2015 in wastewater sludges solution properties that influence particle surface charge and eps bridging like ph and dissolved salts play an important role in determining floc integrity and dewatering performance neyens et al 2004 the current state of knowledge for understanding dewatering behaviour in primary activated and anaerobically digested ad wastewater sludges is that floc formation and disintegration are the major mechanisms governing supernatant turbidity resistance to filtration and dewatering time christensen et al 2015 jørgensen et al 2017 novak et al 2003 degree of flocculation is generally highest in activated sludge with high fractions of eps in the total suspended solids and low ph and monovalent cation concentrations christensen et al 2015 increasing monovalent cation concentrations can lead to floc disintegration via disruption of divalent cation bridges and increasing ph makes eps and sludge surfaces more electronegative generating electrostatic repulsion within flocs christensen et al 2015 floc disintegration releases organic matter including eps into bulk solution as a result soluble and loosely bound eps concentrations have been correlated to slow dewatering yu et al 2008 lei et al 2007 novak et al 2003 in sludges with high eps fractions like activated sludges eps binds water in the flocs through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds making it difficult to achieve high cake solids after dewatering neyens et al 2004 as eps in activated sludge is degraded e g via anaerobic digestion or thermal chemical hydrolysis floc strength generally weakens increasing turbidity and dewatering time novak et al 2003 however destruction of eps reduces bound water allowing higher cake solids to be achieved mikkelsen and keiding 2002 neyens et al 2004 as a result eps fraction in the suspended solids remains the best predictor of how much water can be removed during dewatering along the entire range of wastewater sludges produced from different digestion regimes skinner et al 2015 therefore an emphasis in wastewater sludge treatment processes has been identifying conditions where sludge flocculates well during secondary treatment followed by steps to reduce water binding eps concentrations in the sludge e g anaerobic digestion skinner et al 2015 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 christensen et al 2015 neyens et al 2004 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 efforts to transfer technologies such as conditioners and mechanical dewatering from wastewater to faecal sludge have been largely unsuccessful due to highly variable and erratic performance moto et al 2018 heinss et al 1999 whitesell 2016 taylor 2016 ziebell et al 2016 this is because faecal sludge has a wide range of stabilization can be much more concentrated 0 5 20 ts and is up to two orders of magnitude more variable in all characteristics gold et al 2018a faecal sludge is highly variable due to differences in individual patterns of usage e g flush toilet grey water addition the wide range of containment technologies e g lined or unlined and emptying frequencies e g from days to years strande et al 2014 in addition faecal sludge is collected individually batch wise from onsite containments e g households public toilets or commercial enterprises and transported to treatment whereas wastewater is relatively more homogenized during transport in a sewer strande et al 2014 usepa 1984 as a result of higher influent variability faecal sludge dewatering performance is more variable compared to wastewater primary activated and ad sludges gold et al 2018a solid liquid separation technologies are currently primarily limited to settling thickening tanks and drying beds which have relatively large footprints and can take up to weeks or months to dewater faecal sludge to 60 ts strande et al 2014 empirical and qualitative field observations indicate that public toilet sludge takes longer to settle and dewater than faecal sludge from households and has higher effluent turbidity cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 it has been suggested that this is due to differing degrees of stabilization i e the extent of biodegradation of organic material although it is not yet clear how stabilization is linked to dewatering performance in faecal sludge however it has also been observed that type of containment i e pit latrine or septic tank is a stronger predictor of physical chemical characteristics than source i e household or public toilet strande et al 2018 relationships between surface charge and conductivity to dewatering time have been observed in faecal sludge gold et al 2018a these relationships could also be influenced by eps concentrations although characterization of eps in faecal sludge has not been reported in the literature the objective of this research was to evaluate how dewatering of faecal sludge fits into the state of knowledge of wastewater sludges based on eps and physical chemical properties and to evaluate whether demographic e g source environmental e g microbial community and technical factors e g residence time contributing to variability of faecal sludge can be used as predictors of dewatering performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 25 faecal sludge samples were collected 20 from dakar senegal and 5 from dar es salaam tanzania a variety of typical faecal sludge sources was represented including 7 households 6 schools 5 public toilets 3 offices 2 restaurants and 2 houses of worship containments in need of emptying were pre selected for sampling specific vacuum trucks were arranged to empty only the containment at the selected site to avoid sampling a mixture of sludge from different containments members of our team accompanied the trucks during emptying transport and discharge at the fstp 4 l composite samples were then collected during discharge from each vacuum truck 1 l at the start of discharge 2 l in the middle and 1 l near the end following the sampling protocol outlined in bassan et al 2013 following collection samples were immediately stored in a cooler with ice before being transported to the laboratory for analyses samples were stored for maximum 1 week at 4 c between collection and analysis with the exception of 3 weeks maximum storage time before total solids quantification microbial community samples were preserved with rnalater and stored at 20 c before analysis questionnaires were administered to the person responsible for the containment system and to the vacuum truck operators questions about the containment type construction and age toilet flush type and use patterns number of users per day additional inputs to the containment e g greywater solid waste and emptying frequency were collected the time since last emptied was used to estimate the residence time of the faecal sludge in containment in dakar all containments included in the sampling campaign were identified as septic tanks multi chambered tanks lined with concrete or brick but designed without effluent outflow in response to local regulations in dakar all respondents reported using pour flush and or flush toilets and practicing anal cleansing with water only the two restaurants reported toilet paper as a secondary anal cleansing option containments have no or limited liquid drainage and most systems required emptying every several weeks to several months schools were the exception emptied less than once per year in dar es salaam containment type was varied two pit latrines one cesspit one septic tank and one septic tank effluent storage pond a full account of questionnaire questions and responses are available in si 2 2 sample analysis 2 2 1 physical chemical characteristics samples were characterized for total and volatile solids ts and vs total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss electrical conductivity ec and ph according to the standard methods apha 2005 concentration mg l of soluble mono and divalent cations na k and mg2 and ca2 was determined using icp oes of the filtered supernatant 0 45 μm after centrifugation at 3 345 g for 10 min park et al 2006b prior to analysis samples were acidified using 65 nitric acid monovalent divalent m d cation ratio was calculated based on the measured ion concentrations as na k mg2 ca2 2 2 2 extracellular polymeric substances eps polymeric substances were extracted from faecal sludge samples by sonicating 40 ml at 30 w 0 75 w ml in an ice bath for 2 2 min with a 30 s rest period using a bandelin sonopuls hd3100 with an m76 probe based on the procedure described by d abzac et al 2010 ras et al 2008 sonication intensity and duration was optimized to maximize polymeric substance extraction and minimize cell lysis to avoid extraction and characterization of intercellular material lysis was monitored at various sonication settings using soluble atp measurements promega bactiter glo assays luminometer hammes et al 2010 samples were filtered 0 45 μm and diluted with nanopure water 18 2 mω cm milli q prior to analysis the extracted polymeric substances can be compared to what is termed soluble and loosely bound eps in most wastewater sludge and biofilm studies comte et al 2006 lin et al 2014 eps concentration and fractionation were determined using size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond following the procedures outlined in stewart et al 2013 huber et al 2011 jacquin et al 2017 compounds were separated according to their size into five fractions with a size exclusion column 250 20 mm toyopearl tsk hw 50s chromatograms were achieved using a phosphate buffer as eluent with a flux of 1 ml min interpretation of the fractions was done using customized fiffikus software huber et al 2011 the column had a separation range of 100 da to 20 kda according to the supplier tosoh bioscience calibration with polysaccharides and proteins of different sizes showed that the separation range for polysaccharides was from 0 1 to 18 kda while for proteins the separation ranged from 0 5 to 80 kda stewart et al 2013 assuming that nitrogen comprises 19 of the molecular weight of proteins torabizadeh 2011 the carbon nitrogen ratios indicated that the biopolymeric fraction of organic carbon was essentially entirely composed of proteins following the analysis procedure of jacquin et al 2017 eps was fractionated into protein like substances biopolymer peak and humic like substances humic acids and building blocks peaks total eps was reported as the sum of protein like and humic like substances data was adjusted from mg c l to mg protein l and mg humic acid l using the following conversions 0 53 g c g protein rouwenhorst et al 1991 and 0 54 g c g humic acid allard 2006 in order to allow for comparison with eps data from wastewater sludges lc ocd ond was selected over more common colorimetric assays for the characterization of eps due to the well documented interferences that can be caused by the presence of likely to occur environmental compounds including urea uric acid and humic acid which are expected to appear in different concentrations in different faecal sludge samples le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 2 2 3 microbial community analysis dna extraction amplification reading data cleaning and analysis with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing targeting bacterial and archaeal variable region v4 was conducted by dnasense aps aalborg denmark dna extraction and library preparation yielded between 15672 and 39905 reads after quality control and bioinformatic processing relative abundance values were not adjusted by total cell count or extracted dna concentration as the variability in these values was lower than variability in solid liquid separation performance and minimization of false positive correlations was desired over the suppression of false negatives similarities of samples at the community level were visualized using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of bray curtis dissimilarity bray and curtis 1957 using the shinyapps io data analysis toolkit provided by dnasense operational taxonomic units otus not present in more than 0 1 relative abundance in any sample were removed from the dataset prior to analysis phyla and genera most responsible for differences were identified using differential abundance analysis between groups using the shinyapps io data analysis toolkit provided by dnasense prior to analysis taxa not present in higher than 1 relative abundance in any sample were removed from the dataset differential abundance analysis was performed using a significance threshold of 0 01 2 2 4 solid liquid separation performance supernatant turbidity after extended settling 3 weeks in refrigerated 50 ml centrifuge tubes was evaluated in order to compare performance amongst the different sludges images of supernatant were taken using a standardized setup with reference colours to ensure comparability of individual photographs supernatant turbidity of individual samples was then ranked as clear cloudy or turbid based on visual assessment of the photographs photographs and turbidity rankings are included in the si compressibility of the settled sludge was monitored by calculating the sludge volume index svi ml g after 30 min of settling in imhoff cones in accordance with standard methods for activated sludge and biological suspensions apha 2005 these results are not included in the text but all results can be found in the si dewatering time the time it takes for free water to filter through the sludge and filter paper was measured using capillary suction time cst s according to standard methods apha 2005 a triton 319 multi cst apparatus with 18 mm funnel was used cst values were normalized based on ts in the sample sl gts in order to compare results across samples with different solids concentrations peng et al 2011 apha 2005 dewatered cake solids was defined as the total dry solids in the dewatered sludge cake after centrifugation 30 ml faecal sludge samples were centrifuged in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 3 345 g for 10 min after centrifugation supernatant was decanted and dry solids ds in the cake measured using standard methods apha 2005 dry cake solids after centrifugation is a laboratory measurement to predict dewatering performance at scale kopp and dichtl 1998 gold et al 2018a measurement replicates for parameters were performed according to recommended quality assurance and quality control qa qc measures stipulated in standard methods apha 2005 reported values are averages of measurement replicates and error bars in figures represent the standard deviation of the replicates statistical analysis and regressions were performed using the statsmodel 0 9 0 module in python seabold and perktold 2010 plots were produced using matplotlib 3 0

individually as open circles 3 results 3 1 characterization results of faecal sludge characterization are reported grouped by source and compared with existing literature values in table 1 the physical chemical characteristics in the current study are similar to reported values for faecal sludge from other studies ts was on the lower end of published values however in the current study the samples were mainly from septic tanks that are analogous to cesspits with no overflow pipe with pour flush or cistern flush toilets and a community that uses water for anal cleansing based on our review values for eps and cations in faecal sludge have not previously been reported in the literature in the current study the total eps fraction in faecal sludge was an order of magnitude lower than reported values for activated sludge and 5 7 times lower than primary and mesophilic ad sludge the faecal sludge from public toilets was an exception containing comparable amounts of eps to primary and ad wastewater sludges humic like substances contributed substantially to the total eps in faecal sludge making up a larger fraction of total eps 0 56 0 76 compared to in wastewater sludge 0 32 0 48 soluble cation concentrations in faecal sludge were comparable to reported values in activated and ad sludge although k from public toilets was higher greater differences were observed for eps and cation concentrations by source than for more conventionally measured parameters ts tss vss vs fraction public toilet sludge had notably higher eps k ca2 and lower concentrations of mg2 compared to other sources higher salt concentrations could be due to different user behaviours at public toilets for example users are potentially more likely to defecate at home than during the day at marketplace public toilets and men less likely to urinate in the open in a crowded marketplace than in discrete places where it is more acceptable this would mean a higher fraction of urine enters containment resulting in a higher ratio of urine to faeces and correspondingly higher cation concentrations eps is known to be broken down during anaerobic digestion of primary wastewater sludge miron et al 2000 hence it is logical that eps would also be reduced during onsite storage of faecal sludge in facultative or anaerobic conditions philip et al 1993 nwaneri et al 2008 couderc et al 2008 resulting in faecal sludge containing lower fractions of eps than activated sludge and being more comparable to primary or ad sludge comparable amounts of eps in the faecal sludge from public toilets and reported values for primary sludge also suggest that faecal sludge from public toilets is less stabilised than other sources indicating that very little degradation of organic material is occurring prior to collection this was corroborated by field observations during sample collection as samples from public toilets were light brown in colour and highly odorous also all of the faecal sludge samples were liquid and unconsolidated none appeared to have flocs based on these results source of faecal sludge appears to be a predictor of cations and eps concentration most likely due to the differing management practices 3 2 solid liquid separation performance results of metrics of solid liquid separation performance by source of faecal sludge are presented in fig 1 one third of the faecal sludge had turbid supernatant after prolonged settling the public toilet sludge all had turbid supernatant while the supernatant turbidity from schools and households had widely variable turbidity from clear to turbid the other sources had lower variability but there were also fewer samples in these categories turbidity was assessed using a qualitative method but has relevance for treatment performance in addition all of the faecal sludge demonstrated compact settling as measured by svi presented in si faecal sludge from public toilets took longer to dewater indicated by higher cst values compared to other sources there was not a notable difference in dewatered cake solids between sources while faecal sludge coming from public toilets was a predictor of high turbidity and long dewatering times it was not a predictor of final cake solids after dewatering in comparison to the research detailed in strande et al 2018 public toilets and other sites had the same type of containment the differences in dewatering performance between public toilet and other sources is likely related to physical chemical and or biological differences between the sludges based on demographic environmental and technical factors that can affect faecal sludge qualities it is important to note that public toilet should not be assumed to be a universal predictor of dewatering behaviour factors such as containment technology usage patterns and emptying frequency will most likely be more relevant strande et al 2018 the most appropriate predictors will potentially vary by location as well as accepted definitions of the terms public toilet and septic tank 3 2 1 settling the influence of physical chemical parameters and eps on settling performance in terms of supernatant turbidity after prolonged settling is presented in fig 2 turbid supernatant corresponded to higher eps concentrations higher ec ph k na and ca2 and lower mg2 concentrations whereas clear and cloudy supernatant had higher mg2 concentrations and lower eps ec ph k na ca2 and m d cation ratios it is likely based on the relationships illustrated in fig 2 that eps along with other soluble and colloidal organic matter is contributing to turbidity 3 2 2 dewatering time eps was further fractionated into humic like and protein like compounds to evaluate whether these fractions were associated with dewatering time and turbidity in faecal sludge slower dewatering i e higher cst corresponded to higher turbidity fig 3 a and higher concentrations of eps fig 3d and specifically humic like substances fig 3b high concentrations of soluble or easily extractable polymers contribute to clogging of filters and pores within the sludge cake resulting in slower dewatering this is a primary contributor to poor filtration performance for activated and anaerobically digested wastewater sludges yu et al 2010 lei et al 2007 novak et al 2003 as noticed previously with field observations cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 level of stabilization appears to be a good predictor of dewatering time for faecal sludge it is interesting to note that public toilet sludges which appeared to be the least stabilised contained the highest concentrations of humic like substances it is possible that more stabilised faecal sludge may dewater faster because it has lower concentrations of soluble and suspended eps to clog filters and pores as depicted in fig 4 dewatering time cst increased with increasing ec ph k na and ca2 decreasing mg2 and was not clearly associated with m d ratio similar to the patterns observed for supernatant turbidity based on the linear relationship observed between eps and dewatering time fig 3 it would be logical that the observed correspondence between electrochemical solution properties and dewatering time are due to their underlying relationships with soluble and colloidal eps for example samples with high ec exhibited high eps concentrations and thus took longer to dewater the difference in the relationships between the divalent cations ca2 and mg2 and cst is unexpected and could be an indicator of a species specific interaction driving coagulation or of struvite precipitation which has been shown to occur in wastewaters with high concentrations of urine udert et al 2003 we hypothesize that high eps concentrations are observed in the faecal sludge samples with high ec ph and cation concentrations due to a combination of environmental and microbiological factors affecting degradation of organic material and electrochemical factors affecting particle surface charge and coagulation properties 3 2 3 dewatered cake solids illustrated in fig 5 dewatered cake solids were generally higher in faecal sludge with lower vss fraction although the correlation was not strong there does not appear to be a linear relationship between eps mass fraction and how much water can be removed from the sludge cake although these parameters have been shown to correlate strongly with cake solids in wastewater sludges skinner et al 2015 cetin and erdincler 2004 we hypothesize that eps and vss were not as strong predictors of dewatering behaviour due to the influence of large inorganic particles e g sand that may be present in faecal sludge 3 3 microbial community microbial community composition was evaluated to determine whether it could be a predictor of dewatering performance this was selected as microbial community has been linked to properties such as eps concentration and stabilization bala subramanian et al 2010 marcus et al 2013 illustrated in fig 6 the top three most abundant phyla represented in the faecal sludge samples were firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes results are in alignment with other reported studies for example these phyla were the most prevalent in faecal sludge sampled from pit latrines in tanzania and vietnam torondel et al 2016 pour flush pits in south africa byrne et al 2017 and model septic tanks marcus et al 2013 full microbial community dataset is available in si a correlation was not observed between the relative abundance of specific otus and the metrics of dewatering performance however by grouping faecal sludge samples into categories based on their dewatering performance we could identify genera that were most responsible for community wide differences using differential abundance analysis grouping and full results in si with respect to supernatant turbidity after settling samples with clear supernatant had significantly higher abundance of the phylum proteobacteria and turbid samples had higher abundance of euryarchaeota the genera or most specific level most responsible for the differences in microbial community between the samples were the gammaproteobacteria pseudomonas aeromondales and tolumonas and the bacteroidetes porphyromonadaceae bacteroides and macellibacteroides which were present in higher relative abundance in clear samples turbid samples had higher relative abundance of the firmicutes family xi and ruminococcaceae when faecal sludge samples were separated by their dewatering time grouped into categories based on cst the phylum proteobacteria were present in higher abundance in fast dewatering cst 2 3 sl gts sludges compared to those that dewatered slowly cst 6 1 sl gts at the genus level fast dewatering samples had higher abundance of the gammaproteobacteria tolumonas and slow dewatering samples had higher amounts of the euryarchaeota candidatus methanogranum sludge cake solids following dewatering was also associated with microbial communities at the phylum and genus level sludges with low cake solids 11 9 ds had higher relative abundance of proteobacteria than sludges with high cake solids 17 3 ds specifically sludges with low cake solids had more of the betaproteobacteria rhodocyclaceae the presence of different populations of microorganisms associated with metrics of dewatering performance could indicate the importance of microbiological processes in faecal sludge dewatering behaviour 4 discussion it is valuable to compare the dewatering behaviour of faecal sludge to that of primary activated and ad sludges from wastewater treatment to determine what knowledge can be transferred to faecal sludge and what cannot an overview of the current state of knowledge of the dewatering performance of wastewater sludges based on eps monovalent cations and ph was presented in the introduction this information can also be summarized in a conceptual model as presented in fig 7 the dewatering behaviour of faecal sludges analysed in this study shaded in light grey are partially outside of the accepted conceptual model for wastewater sludges shaded in dark grey activated sludges with high eps fractions bottom right form flocs which reduces supernatant turbidity and promotes faster dewatering but also binds water resulting in low cake solids flocculation can be disrupted by high monovalent cation concentrations or ph top right or by reducing eps fraction in the sludge top centre christensen et al 2015 liu and fang 2003 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 higher eps faecal sludges had similar eps fractions to primary or ad wastewater sludges top centre see table 1 occurred at high conductivity and ph and exhibited high turbidity and slow dewatering similar to digested sludges at high ph or high monovalent cation concentrations where flocculation is inhibited christensen et al 2015 faecal sludges with lower eps bottom left have lower fractions of eps than wastewater sludges lower eps faecal sludges exhibited low turbidity fast dewatering and high cake solids and had low conductivity monovalent cation concentrations and ph lower eps faecal sludges had different dewatering behaviour than wastewater sludges and may be governed by different mechanisms faecal sludges have been observed to become less difficult to dewater as they are stabilised cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 which is consistent with observations in this study if we consider higher eps faecal sludges to be fresher and less degraded and lower eps sludges to be more stabilised this distinguishes higher eps faecal sludges from primary wastewater sludges which have large particle size and low conductivity and have been found to dewater more quickly and thoroughly than stabilised wastewater sludges tchobanoglous et al 2014 gold et al 2018a eps appears to play a different role in faecal sludge dewatering performance than in activated sludge at least partly because it is present in lower amounts in this study dewatering time and turbidity correlated with the concentration of extractable eps but not with the eps fraction in the solids this indicates that within the range of eps content observed in faecal sludges higher eps fractions do not promote flocculation as they have been shown to do in activated sludges christensen et al 2015 this fits with our observation that m d cation ratio does not correspond to differences in dewatering time and turbidity while higher concentrations of monovalent cations cause increased turbidity and poor filtration in activated sludges this is because increasing the m d cation ratio contributes to the destruction of divalent cation bridges between eps and sludge particles christensen et al 2015 sobeck and higgins 2002 jørgensen et al 2017 observed that interactions between polyvalent cations and eps are only relevant for floc formation when there are high enough fractions of extractable eps in the sludge 100 mg gtss considering that the median eps fraction extracted from public toilet sludge was only 70 mg gtss it is possible that the eps content even in unstabilised faecal sludges may be too low to promote floc formation eps concentrations instead of contributing to flocculation were strongly positively correlated with dewatering time and turbidity this suggests that eps in faecal sludge may be more accurately described as colloidal and suspended organic matter that contributes to filter blinding and turbidity as opposed to polymeric glue that binds flocs together however if we consider faecal sludge as a suspension of particles without long polymer chains we would expect that ec ph and cations which influence surface charge in accordance with dlvo theory mikkelsen and keiding 2002 would be related to coagulation of colloidal particles and reduction of turbidity if this were the case however we would expect to see the opposite trend with respect to ec cations and turbidity higher concentrations of cations should shield particle surface charge reducing the electrostatic barrier for particles to agglomerate instead of correlating with an increase in turbidity and dewatering time one possible unifying explanation of the results is that solution properties ec ph cations are directly related to the concentration of eps in faecal sludges because they are related to stabilization processes high concentrations of eps could be present in sludges with high ph and ec because those conditions are less favourable for biological degradation of eps during storage in onsite containment while none of the measured cations are present at concentrations inhibitory to anaerobic digestion parkin and owen 1986 it is likely that other substances present in high quantities in urine or faeces e g ammonia could reach concentrations high enough to inhibit anaerobic bacteria and decomposition meaning that it would take longer to degrade eps and other organic material this would also fit with our previous observation about usage behaviour in public toilets high fractions of urine have been shown to lead to extremely high ammonia concentrations well above the inhibitory limit englund et al submitted heinss and strauss 1999 rose et al 2015 measured cation concentrations should correlate with ammonia concentrations if they are indeed due to high urine concentration this idea is supported by information on emptying frequency and uses per day collected at the toilet sites with questionnaires si public toilets reported similar emptying frequencies and uses per day to offices and toilets of large households so the effective residence times in containment are comparable the lower levels of stabilization in public toilet faecal sludge even over long residence times would be logical if sludge in public toilets is undergoing inhibition due to ammonia toxicity although ammonia was not quantified in this study gold et al 2018 observed that nh4 concentrations correlated strongly with longer dewatering times in faecal sludge from septic tanks and lined pit latrines ammonia toxicity could also explain the correlation between k and eps turbidity and dewatering time k is released into the bulk as a microbial stress response to toxic compounds and k efflux has been observed as a toxicity response in activated wastewater sludge bott and love 2002 henriques and love 2007 the idea that there is a biological component tying together dewatering behaviour and physical chemical conditions in containment is supported by microbial community data depicted in fig 8 there is a notable difference between the microbial communities in samples with the highest upper 25 and lowest lower 25 concentrations of eps based on bray curtis distance and nmds clustering samples with high eps concentrations appear to form a cluster indicating that their microbial communities may be more similar to each other than the other categories it is not clear whether specific populations of microorganisms are themselves contributing to differences in eps concentration or whether their abundance is determined by environmental factors that also influence stabilization or degradation kinetics like cation concentrations although eps and its microbial degradation appear to play an important role in filtration of faecal sludge these do not appear to be as important for determining the amount of moisture remaining in the sludge cake following dewatering illustrated in fig 9 the light grey shaded area depicts the trend observed for faecal sludge in gold et al 2018 the dark grey shaded area depicts the trend observed for wastewater sludges in skinner et al 2015 and data points for this study are included for comparison dewatered cake solids do not increase with decreasing vss fraction in contrast to the observed behaviour in wastewater sludges skinner et al 2015 however observations do fit within the existing behaviour of faecal sludges from septic tanks and lined pit latrines gold et al 2018a the expected relationship between vss fraction and cake solids does not hold for faecal sludge even though it remains consistent through a range of wastewater sludges generated through a variety of different treatment processes the explanation for this likely lies with the heterogeneity of the solids fraction in faecal sludges the relationship between vss and dewatered cake solids is strong in wastewater sludges because the vss fraction is representative of the eps fraction skinner et al 2015 variable quantities of sand soil and other inorganic materials can be introduced into faecal sludge during daily toilet use or during emptying seck et al 2015 because of this even if there is quite a high concentration of volatile organic material the vss tss fraction would still be low in addition we could not detect a correlation between eps concentration or fractionation and dewatered cake solids in faecal sludge it is probable that at the eps fractions present in faecal sludge other factors such as soil content may play a more important role in determining the solids fraction of dewatered faecal sludge 5 conclusions based on the observations in this study the key conclusions are eps is important for faecal sludge dewatering performance observed in this study higher concentrations of soluble and colloidal eps are likely to contribute to clogging of sand drying beds filters and other dewatering technologies however eps fractions mg gtss do not measurably contribute to flocculation or cake moisture content as is observed in activated and anaerobically digested wastewater sludge the observed relationships between ec ph supernatant turbidity and dewatering time could be further developed and applied in online monitoring of faecal sludge this would be relatively quick and inexpensive to implement and could predict dewaterability at treatment plants or be used for dosing of conditioners for enhanced dewatering for planning of community to city wide faecal sludge management including the design of transfer stations and treatment plants relationships between demographic factors e g source and physical chemical characteristics of faecal sludge could provide a relatively low cost way to help pre determine or predict dewatering performance faecal sludges behave differently than wastewater sludges there will not be one reference sludge that is appropriate to serve as a proxy for faecal sludge based on the vast differences in redox conditions biomass nutrients salts ions stabilization particle size eps undigested plant fibers etc hence this emerging research topic needs to be approached in different ways and cannot be solved with just a direct transfer of wastewater knowledge looking to other fields of dewatering for

18434,unpredictable dewatering performance is a barrier to the effective management and treatment of faecal sludge while mechanisms of dewatering in sludges from wastewater treatment are well understood it is not clear how dewatering of faecal sludge fits into the framework of existing knowledge we evaluate physical chemical parameters including eps and cations and demographic source environmental microbial community and technical factors residence time as possible predictors of dewatering performance in faecal sludge and make comparisons to the existing conceptual model for wastewater sludge faecal sludge from public toilets took longer to dewater than sludge from other sources and had turbid supernatant after settling slow dewatering and turbid supernatant corresponded to high eps and monovalent cation concentrations conductivity and ph but cake solids after dewatering was not correlated with eps or other factors faecal sludges with higher eps appeared less stabilised than those with lower eps potentially a result of inhibition of biological degradation due to high urine concentrations however distinct microbial community compositions were also observed in samples with higher and lower eps concentrations higher eps faecal sludge was comparable in dewatering behaviour and eps content to anaerobically digested and primary wastewater sludges however lower eps faecal sludges had different dewatering behaviour than wastewater sludges and may be governed by different mechanisms graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal sludge eps cst stabilization public toilet 1 introduction one third of the world s population relies on onsite sanitation facilities like pit latrines and septic tanks and in low income countries less than 10 of urban areas are served by sewers world health organization and unicef 2017 peal et al 2014 the majority of cities in low income countries do not have adequate faecal sludge management with faecal sludge defined as what accumulates in onsite sanitation systems strande et al 2014 in low income countries the majority of faecal sludge is discharged untreated into the urban environment placing a huge burden on public and environmental health blackett et al 2014 cairncross and feachem 2019 efficient treatment and management systems are needed to safely manage these quantities of faecal sludge however unreliable solid liquid separation is a major bottleneck gold et al 2016 cofie et al 2006 knowledge is needed to be able to predict and improve dewatering performance of faecal sludge prior to implementation of management solutions such as decentralized transfer stations and to increase the capacity of existing faecal sludge treatment plants fstps gold et al 2016 strande et al 2018 solutions for improved dewatering performance are desperately needed to increase access to improved sanitation and make progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs relatively little research has been conducted on faecal sludge treatment processes as non sewered sanitation has only recently been acknowledged as a long term sustainable solution usepa 2005 strande et al 2018 strande et al 2014 in contrast centralized treatment processes such as activated sludge treatment have been researched for over one hundred years stensel and makinia 2014 many expectations about mechanisms governing dewatering of faecal sludge have in the past been derived from centralized wastewater treatment gold et al 2018a however faecal sludges are quite different from wastewater sludges for example faecal sludge can be comprised of any range of fresh excreta to products of anaerobic digestion from storage in containment and can include soil sand and municipal solid waste van eekert et al 2019 strande et al 2014 in contrast primary sludge is relatively fresh not stabilised easily settleable solids from raw wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2014 and activated sludge is mainly composed of bacterial cells and metabolic products generated during aerobic secondary treatment nielsen et al 2004 the metabolic products include high concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances eps that are produced during biological growth bala subramanian et al 2010 eps presents challenges for dewatering as it is highly charged and binds water forster 1983 flemming et al 1996 eps has the secondary effect of reducing turbidity as these charged polymer chains can also bridge particles together and form flocs when present in sufficiently high fractions mikkelsen and keiding 2002 christensen et al 2015 in wastewater sludges solution properties that influence particle surface charge and eps bridging like ph and dissolved salts play an important role in determining floc integrity and dewatering performance neyens et al 2004 the current state of knowledge for understanding dewatering behaviour in primary activated and anaerobically digested ad wastewater sludges is that floc formation and disintegration are the major mechanisms governing supernatant turbidity resistance to filtration and dewatering time christensen et al 2015 jørgensen et al 2017 novak et al 2003 degree of flocculation is generally highest in activated sludge with high fractions of eps in the total suspended solids and low ph and monovalent cation concentrations christensen et al 2015 increasing monovalent cation concentrations can lead to floc disintegration via disruption of divalent cation bridges and increasing ph makes eps and sludge surfaces more electronegative generating electrostatic repulsion within flocs christensen et al 2015 floc disintegration releases organic matter including eps into bulk solution as a result soluble and loosely bound eps concentrations have been correlated to slow dewatering yu et al 2008 lei et al 2007 novak et al 2003 in sludges with high eps fractions like activated sludges eps binds water in the flocs through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds making it difficult to achieve high cake solids after dewatering neyens et al 2004 as eps in activated sludge is degraded e g via anaerobic digestion or thermal chemical hydrolysis floc strength generally weakens increasing turbidity and dewatering time novak et al 2003 however destruction of eps reduces bound water allowing higher cake solids to be achieved mikkelsen and keiding 2002 neyens et al 2004 as a result eps fraction in the suspended solids remains the best predictor of how much water can be removed during dewatering along the entire range of wastewater sludges produced from different digestion regimes skinner et al 2015 therefore an emphasis in wastewater sludge treatment processes has been identifying conditions where sludge flocculates well during secondary treatment followed by steps to reduce water binding eps concentrations in the sludge e g anaerobic digestion skinner et al 2015 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 christensen et al 2015 neyens et al 2004 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 efforts to transfer technologies such as conditioners and mechanical dewatering from wastewater to faecal sludge have been largely unsuccessful due to highly variable and erratic performance moto et al 2018 heinss et al 1999 whitesell 2016 taylor 2016 ziebell et al 2016 this is because faecal sludge has a wide range of stabilization can be much more concentrated 0 5 20 ts and is up to two orders of magnitude more variable in all characteristics gold et al 2018a faecal sludge is highly variable due to differences in individual patterns of usage e g flush toilet grey water addition the wide range of containment technologies e g lined or unlined and emptying frequencies e g from days to years strande et al 2014 in addition faecal sludge is collected individually batch wise from onsite containments e g households public toilets or commercial enterprises and transported to treatment whereas wastewater is relatively more homogenized during transport in a sewer strande et al 2014 usepa 1984 as a result of higher influent variability faecal sludge dewatering performance is more variable compared to wastewater primary activated and ad sludges gold et al 2018a solid liquid separation technologies are currently primarily limited to settling thickening tanks and drying beds which have relatively large footprints and can take up to weeks or months to dewater faecal sludge to 60 ts strande et al 2014 empirical and qualitative field observations indicate that public toilet sludge takes longer to settle and dewater than faecal sludge from households and has higher effluent turbidity cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 it has been suggested that this is due to differing degrees of stabilization i e the extent of biodegradation of organic material although it is not yet clear how stabilization is linked to dewatering performance in faecal sludge however it has also been observed that type of containment i e pit latrine or septic tank is a stronger predictor of physical chemical characteristics than source i e household or public toilet strande et al 2018 relationships between surface charge and conductivity to dewatering time have been observed in faecal sludge gold et al 2018a these relationships could also be influenced by eps concentrations although characterization of eps in faecal sludge has not been reported in the literature the objective of this research was to evaluate how dewatering of faecal sludge fits into the state of knowledge of wastewater sludges based on eps and physical chemical properties and to evaluate whether demographic e g source environmental e g microbial community and technical factors e g residence time contributing to variability of faecal sludge can be used as predictors of dewatering performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 25 faecal sludge samples were collected 20 from dakar senegal and 5 from dar es salaam tanzania a variety of typical faecal sludge sources was represented including 7 households 6 schools 5 public toilets 3 offices 2 restaurants and 2 houses of worship containments in need of emptying were pre selected for sampling specific vacuum trucks were arranged to empty only the containment at the selected site to avoid sampling a mixture of sludge from different containments members of our team accompanied the trucks during emptying transport and discharge at the fstp 4 l composite samples were then collected during discharge from each vacuum truck 1 l at the start of discharge 2 l in the middle and 1 l near the end following the sampling protocol outlined in bassan et al 2013 following collection samples were immediately stored in a cooler with ice before being transported to the laboratory for analyses samples were stored for maximum 1 week at 4 c between collection and analysis with the exception of 3 weeks maximum storage time before total solids quantification microbial community samples were preserved with rnalater and stored at 20 c before analysis questionnaires were administered to the person responsible for the containment system and to the vacuum truck operators questions about the containment type construction and age toilet flush type and use patterns number of users per day additional inputs to the containment e g greywater solid waste and emptying frequency were collected the time since last emptied was used to estimate the residence time of the faecal sludge in containment in dakar all containments included in the sampling campaign were identified as septic tanks multi chambered tanks lined with concrete or brick but designed without effluent outflow in response to local regulations in dakar all respondents reported using pour flush and or flush toilets and practicing anal cleansing with water only the two restaurants reported toilet paper as a secondary anal cleansing option containments have no or limited liquid drainage and most systems required emptying every several weeks to several months schools were the exception emptied less than once per year in dar es salaam containment type was varied two pit latrines one cesspit one septic tank and one septic tank effluent storage pond a full account of questionnaire questions and responses are available in si 2 2 sample analysis 2 2 1 physical chemical characteristics samples were characterized for total and volatile solids ts and vs total and volatile suspended solids tss and vss electrical conductivity ec and ph according to the standard methods apha 2005 concentration mg l of soluble mono and divalent cations na k and mg2 and ca2 was determined using icp oes of the filtered supernatant 0 45 μm after centrifugation at 3 345 g for 10 min park et al 2006b prior to analysis samples were acidified using 65 nitric acid monovalent divalent m d cation ratio was calculated based on the measured ion concentrations as na k mg2 ca2 2 2 2 extracellular polymeric substances eps polymeric substances were extracted from faecal sludge samples by sonicating 40 ml at 30 w 0 75 w ml in an ice bath for 2 2 min with a 30 s rest period using a bandelin sonopuls hd3100 with an m76 probe based on the procedure described by d abzac et al 2010 ras et al 2008 sonication intensity and duration was optimized to maximize polymeric substance extraction and minimize cell lysis to avoid extraction and characterization of intercellular material lysis was monitored at various sonication settings using soluble atp measurements promega bactiter glo assays luminometer hammes et al 2010 samples were filtered 0 45 μm and diluted with nanopure water 18 2 mω cm milli q prior to analysis the extracted polymeric substances can be compared to what is termed soluble and loosely bound eps in most wastewater sludge and biofilm studies comte et al 2006 lin et al 2014 eps concentration and fractionation were determined using size exclusion chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond following the procedures outlined in stewart et al 2013 huber et al 2011 jacquin et al 2017 compounds were separated according to their size into five fractions with a size exclusion column 250 20 mm toyopearl tsk hw 50s chromatograms were achieved using a phosphate buffer as eluent with a flux of 1 ml min interpretation of the fractions was done using customized fiffikus software huber et al 2011 the column had a separation range of 100 da to 20 kda according to the supplier tosoh bioscience calibration with polysaccharides and proteins of different sizes showed that the separation range for polysaccharides was from 0 1 to 18 kda while for proteins the separation ranged from 0 5 to 80 kda stewart et al 2013 assuming that nitrogen comprises 19 of the molecular weight of proteins torabizadeh 2011 the carbon nitrogen ratios indicated that the biopolymeric fraction of organic carbon was essentially entirely composed of proteins following the analysis procedure of jacquin et al 2017 eps was fractionated into protein like substances biopolymer peak and humic like substances humic acids and building blocks peaks total eps was reported as the sum of protein like and humic like substances data was adjusted from mg c l to mg protein l and mg humic acid l using the following conversions 0 53 g c g protein rouwenhorst et al 1991 and 0 54 g c g humic acid allard 2006 in order to allow for comparison with eps data from wastewater sludges lc ocd ond was selected over more common colorimetric assays for the characterization of eps due to the well documented interferences that can be caused by the presence of likely to occur environmental compounds including urea uric acid and humic acid which are expected to appear in different concentrations in different faecal sludge samples le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 2 2 3 microbial community analysis dna extraction amplification reading data cleaning and analysis with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing targeting bacterial and archaeal variable region v4 was conducted by dnasense aps aalborg denmark dna extraction and library preparation yielded between 15672 and 39905 reads after quality control and bioinformatic processing relative abundance values were not adjusted by total cell count or extracted dna concentration as the variability in these values was lower than variability in solid liquid separation performance and minimization of false positive correlations was desired over the suppression of false negatives similarities of samples at the community level were visualized using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of bray curtis dissimilarity bray and curtis 1957 using the shinyapps io data analysis toolkit provided by dnasense operational taxonomic units otus not present in more than 0 1 relative abundance in any sample were removed from the dataset prior to analysis phyla and genera most responsible for differences were identified using differential abundance analysis between groups using the shinyapps io data analysis toolkit provided by dnasense prior to analysis taxa not present in higher than 1 relative abundance in any sample were removed from the dataset differential abundance analysis was performed using a significance threshold of 0 01 2 2 4 solid liquid separation performance supernatant turbidity after extended settling 3 weeks in refrigerated 50 ml centrifuge tubes was evaluated in order to compare performance amongst the different sludges images of supernatant were taken using a standardized setup with reference colours to ensure comparability of individual photographs supernatant turbidity of individual samples was then ranked as clear cloudy or turbid based on visual assessment of the photographs photographs and turbidity rankings are included in the si compressibility of the settled sludge was monitored by calculating the sludge volume index svi ml g after 30 min of settling in imhoff cones in accordance with standard methods for activated sludge and biological suspensions apha 2005 these results are not included in the text but all results can be found in the si dewatering time the time it takes for free water to filter through the sludge and filter paper was measured using capillary suction time cst s according to standard methods apha 2005 a triton 319 multi cst apparatus with 18 mm funnel was used cst values were normalized based on ts in the sample sl gts in order to compare results across samples with different solids concentrations peng et al 2011 apha 2005 dewatered cake solids was defined as the total dry solids in the dewatered sludge cake after centrifugation 30 ml faecal sludge samples were centrifuged in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 3 345 g for 10 min after centrifugation supernatant was decanted and dry solids ds in the cake measured using standard methods apha 2005 dry cake solids after centrifugation is a laboratory measurement to predict dewatering performance at scale kopp and dichtl 1998 gold et al 2018a measurement replicates for parameters were performed according to recommended quality assurance and quality control qa qc measures stipulated in standard methods apha 2005 reported values are averages of measurement replicates and error bars in figures represent the standard deviation of the replicates statistical analysis and regressions were performed using the statsmodel 0 9 0 module in python seabold and perktold 2010 plots were produced using matplotlib 3 0

individually as open circles 3 results 3 1 characterization results of faecal sludge characterization are reported grouped by source and compared with existing literature values in table 1 the physical chemical characteristics in the current study are similar to reported values for faecal sludge from other studies ts was on the lower end of published values however in the current study the samples were mainly from septic tanks that are analogous to cesspits with no overflow pipe with pour flush or cistern flush toilets and a community that uses water for anal cleansing based on our review values for eps and cations in faecal sludge have not previously been reported in the literature in the current study the total eps fraction in faecal sludge was an order of magnitude lower than reported values for activated sludge and 5 7 times lower than primary and mesophilic ad sludge the faecal sludge from public toilets was an exception containing comparable amounts of eps to primary and ad wastewater sludges humic like substances contributed substantially to the total eps in faecal sludge making up a larger fraction of total eps 0 56 0 76 compared to in wastewater sludge 0 32 0 48 soluble cation concentrations in faecal sludge were comparable to reported values in activated and ad sludge although k from public toilets was higher greater differences were observed for eps and cation concentrations by source than for more conventionally measured parameters ts tss vss vs fraction public toilet sludge had notably higher eps k ca2 and lower concentrations of mg2 compared to other sources higher salt concentrations could be due to different user behaviours at public toilets for example users are potentially more likely to defecate at home than during the day at marketplace public toilets and men less likely to urinate in the open in a crowded marketplace than in discrete places where it is more acceptable this would mean a higher fraction of urine enters containment resulting in a higher ratio of urine to faeces and correspondingly higher cation concentrations eps is known to be broken down during anaerobic digestion of primary wastewater sludge miron et al 2000 hence it is logical that eps would also be reduced during onsite storage of faecal sludge in facultative or anaerobic conditions philip et al 1993 nwaneri et al 2008 couderc et al 2008 resulting in faecal sludge containing lower fractions of eps than activated sludge and being more comparable to primary or ad sludge comparable amounts of eps in the faecal sludge from public toilets and reported values for primary sludge also suggest that faecal sludge from public toilets is less stabilised than other sources indicating that very little degradation of organic material is occurring prior to collection this was corroborated by field observations during sample collection as samples from public toilets were light brown in colour and highly odorous also all of the faecal sludge samples were liquid and unconsolidated none appeared to have flocs based on these results source of faecal sludge appears to be a predictor of cations and eps concentration most likely due to the differing management practices 3 2 solid liquid separation performance results of metrics of solid liquid separation performance by source of faecal sludge are presented in fig 1 one third of the faecal sludge had turbid supernatant after prolonged settling the public toilet sludge all had turbid supernatant while the supernatant turbidity from schools and households had widely variable turbidity from clear to turbid the other sources had lower variability but there were also fewer samples in these categories turbidity was assessed using a qualitative method but has relevance for treatment performance in addition all of the faecal sludge demonstrated compact settling as measured by svi presented in si faecal sludge from public toilets took longer to dewater indicated by higher cst values compared to other sources there was not a notable difference in dewatered cake solids between sources while faecal sludge coming from public toilets was a predictor of high turbidity and long dewatering times it was not a predictor of final cake solids after dewatering in comparison to the research detailed in strande et al 2018 public toilets and other sites had the same type of containment the differences in dewatering performance between public toilet and other sources is likely related to physical chemical and or biological differences between the sludges based on demographic environmental and technical factors that can affect faecal sludge qualities it is important to note that public toilet should not be assumed to be a universal predictor of dewatering behaviour factors such as containment technology usage patterns and emptying frequency will most likely be more relevant strande et al 2018 the most appropriate predictors will potentially vary by location as well as accepted definitions of the terms public toilet and septic tank 3 2 1 settling the influence of physical chemical parameters and eps on settling performance in terms of supernatant turbidity after prolonged settling is presented in fig 2 turbid supernatant corresponded to higher eps concentrations higher ec ph k na and ca2 and lower mg2 concentrations whereas clear and cloudy supernatant had higher mg2 concentrations and lower eps ec ph k na ca2 and m d cation ratios it is likely based on the relationships illustrated in fig 2 that eps along with other soluble and colloidal organic matter is contributing to turbidity 3 2 2 dewatering time eps was further fractionated into humic like and protein like compounds to evaluate whether these fractions were associated with dewatering time and turbidity in faecal sludge slower dewatering i e higher cst corresponded to higher turbidity fig 3 a and higher concentrations of eps fig 3d and specifically humic like substances fig 3b high concentrations of soluble or easily extractable polymers contribute to clogging of filters and pores within the sludge cake resulting in slower dewatering this is a primary contributor to poor filtration performance for activated and anaerobically digested wastewater sludges yu et al 2010 lei et al 2007 novak et al 2003 as noticed previously with field observations cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 level of stabilization appears to be a good predictor of dewatering time for faecal sludge it is interesting to note that public toilet sludges which appeared to be the least stabilised contained the highest concentrations of humic like substances it is possible that more stabilised faecal sludge may dewater faster because it has lower concentrations of soluble and suspended eps to clog filters and pores as depicted in fig 4 dewatering time cst increased with increasing ec ph k na and ca2 decreasing mg2 and was not clearly associated with m d ratio similar to the patterns observed for supernatant turbidity based on the linear relationship observed between eps and dewatering time fig 3 it would be logical that the observed correspondence between electrochemical solution properties and dewatering time are due to their underlying relationships with soluble and colloidal eps for example samples with high ec exhibited high eps concentrations and thus took longer to dewater the difference in the relationships between the divalent cations ca2 and mg2 and cst is unexpected and could be an indicator of a species specific interaction driving coagulation or of struvite precipitation which has been shown to occur in wastewaters with high concentrations of urine udert et al 2003 we hypothesize that high eps concentrations are observed in the faecal sludge samples with high ec ph and cation concentrations due to a combination of environmental and microbiological factors affecting degradation of organic material and electrochemical factors affecting particle surface charge and coagulation properties 3 2 3 dewatered cake solids illustrated in fig 5 dewatered cake solids were generally higher in faecal sludge with lower vss fraction although the correlation was not strong there does not appear to be a linear relationship between eps mass fraction and how much water can be removed from the sludge cake although these parameters have been shown to correlate strongly with cake solids in wastewater sludges skinner et al 2015 cetin and erdincler 2004 we hypothesize that eps and vss were not as strong predictors of dewatering behaviour due to the influence of large inorganic particles e g sand that may be present in faecal sludge 3 3 microbial community microbial community composition was evaluated to determine whether it could be a predictor of dewatering performance this was selected as microbial community has been linked to properties such as eps concentration and stabilization bala subramanian et al 2010 marcus et al 2013 illustrated in fig 6 the top three most abundant phyla represented in the faecal sludge samples were firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes results are in alignment with other reported studies for example these phyla were the most prevalent in faecal sludge sampled from pit latrines in tanzania and vietnam torondel et al 2016 pour flush pits in south africa byrne et al 2017 and model septic tanks marcus et al 2013 full microbial community dataset is available in si a correlation was not observed between the relative abundance of specific otus and the metrics of dewatering performance however by grouping faecal sludge samples into categories based on their dewatering performance we could identify genera that were most responsible for community wide differences using differential abundance analysis grouping and full results in si with respect to supernatant turbidity after settling samples with clear supernatant had significantly higher abundance of the phylum proteobacteria and turbid samples had higher abundance of euryarchaeota the genera or most specific level most responsible for the differences in microbial community between the samples were the gammaproteobacteria pseudomonas aeromondales and tolumonas and the bacteroidetes porphyromonadaceae bacteroides and macellibacteroides which were present in higher relative abundance in clear samples turbid samples had higher relative abundance of the firmicutes family xi and ruminococcaceae when faecal sludge samples were separated by their dewatering time grouped into categories based on cst the phylum proteobacteria were present in higher abundance in fast dewatering cst 2 3 sl gts sludges compared to those that dewatered slowly cst 6 1 sl gts at the genus level fast dewatering samples had higher abundance of the gammaproteobacteria tolumonas and slow dewatering samples had higher amounts of the euryarchaeota candidatus methanogranum sludge cake solids following dewatering was also associated with microbial communities at the phylum and genus level sludges with low cake solids 11 9 ds had higher relative abundance of proteobacteria than sludges with high cake solids 17 3 ds specifically sludges with low cake solids had more of the betaproteobacteria rhodocyclaceae the presence of different populations of microorganisms associated with metrics of dewatering performance could indicate the importance of microbiological processes in faecal sludge dewatering behaviour 4 discussion it is valuable to compare the dewatering behaviour of faecal sludge to that of primary activated and ad sludges from wastewater treatment to determine what knowledge can be transferred to faecal sludge and what cannot an overview of the current state of knowledge of the dewatering performance of wastewater sludges based on eps monovalent cations and ph was presented in the introduction this information can also be summarized in a conceptual model as presented in fig 7 the dewatering behaviour of faecal sludges analysed in this study shaded in light grey are partially outside of the accepted conceptual model for wastewater sludges shaded in dark grey activated sludges with high eps fractions bottom right form flocs which reduces supernatant turbidity and promotes faster dewatering but also binds water resulting in low cake solids flocculation can be disrupted by high monovalent cation concentrations or ph top right or by reducing eps fraction in the sludge top centre christensen et al 2015 liu and fang 2003 mikkelsen and keiding 2002 higher eps faecal sludges had similar eps fractions to primary or ad wastewater sludges top centre see table 1 occurred at high conductivity and ph and exhibited high turbidity and slow dewatering similar to digested sludges at high ph or high monovalent cation concentrations where flocculation is inhibited christensen et al 2015 faecal sludges with lower eps bottom left have lower fractions of eps than wastewater sludges lower eps faecal sludges exhibited low turbidity fast dewatering and high cake solids and had low conductivity monovalent cation concentrations and ph lower eps faecal sludges had different dewatering behaviour than wastewater sludges and may be governed by different mechanisms faecal sludges have been observed to become less difficult to dewater as they are stabilised cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 which is consistent with observations in this study if we consider higher eps faecal sludges to be fresher and less degraded and lower eps sludges to be more stabilised this distinguishes higher eps faecal sludges from primary wastewater sludges which have large particle size and low conductivity and have been found to dewater more quickly and thoroughly than stabilised wastewater sludges tchobanoglous et al 2014 gold et al 2018a eps appears to play a different role in faecal sludge dewatering performance than in activated sludge at least partly because it is present in lower amounts in this study dewatering time and turbidity correlated with the concentration of extractable eps but not with the eps fraction in the solids this indicates that within the range of eps content observed in faecal sludges higher eps fractions do not promote flocculation as they have been shown to do in activated sludges christensen et al 2015 this fits with our observation that m d cation ratio does not correspond to differences in dewatering time and turbidity while higher concentrations of monovalent cations cause increased turbidity and poor filtration in activated sludges this is because increasing the m d cation ratio contributes to the destruction of divalent cation bridges between eps and sludge particles christensen et al 2015 sobeck and higgins 2002 jørgensen et al 2017 observed that interactions between polyvalent cations and eps are only relevant for floc formation when there are high enough fractions of extractable eps in the sludge 100 mg gtss considering that the median eps fraction extracted from public toilet sludge was only 70 mg gtss it is possible that the eps content even in unstabilised faecal sludges may be too low to promote floc formation eps concentrations instead of contributing to flocculation were strongly positively correlated with dewatering time and turbidity this suggests that eps in faecal sludge may be more accurately described as colloidal and suspended organic matter that contributes to filter blinding and turbidity as opposed to polymeric glue that binds flocs together however if we consider faecal sludge as a suspension of particles without long polymer chains we would expect that ec ph and cations which influence surface charge in accordance with dlvo theory mikkelsen and keiding 2002 would be related to coagulation of colloidal particles and reduction of turbidity if this were the case however we would expect to see the opposite trend with respect to ec cations and turbidity higher concentrations of cations should shield particle surface charge reducing the electrostatic barrier for particles to agglomerate instead of correlating with an increase in turbidity and dewatering time one possible unifying explanation of the results is that solution properties ec ph cations are directly related to the concentration of eps in faecal sludges because they are related to stabilization processes high concentrations of eps could be present in sludges with high ph and ec because those conditions are less favourable for biological degradation of eps during storage in onsite containment while none of the measured cations are present at concentrations inhibitory to anaerobic digestion parkin and owen 1986 it is likely that other substances present in high quantities in urine or faeces e g ammonia could reach concentrations high enough to inhibit anaerobic bacteria and decomposition meaning that it would take longer to degrade eps and other organic material this would also fit with our previous observation about usage behaviour in public toilets high fractions of urine have been shown to lead to extremely high ammonia concentrations well above the inhibitory limit englund et al submitted heinss and strauss 1999 rose et al 2015 measured cation concentrations should correlate with ammonia concentrations if they are indeed due to high urine concentration this idea is supported by information on emptying frequency and uses per day collected at the toilet sites with questionnaires si public toilets reported similar emptying frequencies and uses per day to offices and toilets of large households so the effective residence times in containment are comparable the lower levels of stabilization in public toilet faecal sludge even over long residence times would be logical if sludge in public toilets is undergoing inhibition due to ammonia toxicity although ammonia was not quantified in this study gold et al 2018 observed that nh4 concentrations correlated strongly with longer dewatering times in faecal sludge from septic tanks and lined pit latrines ammonia toxicity could also explain the correlation between k and eps turbidity and dewatering time k is released into the bulk as a microbial stress response to toxic compounds and k efflux has been observed as a toxicity response in activated wastewater sludge bott and love 2002 henriques and love 2007 the idea that there is a biological component tying together dewatering behaviour and physical chemical conditions in containment is supported by microbial community data depicted in fig 8 there is a notable difference between the microbial communities in samples with the highest upper 25 and lowest lower 25 concentrations of eps based on bray curtis distance and nmds clustering samples with high eps concentrations appear to form a cluster indicating that their microbial communities may be more similar to each other than the other categories it is not clear whether specific populations of microorganisms are themselves contributing to differences in eps concentration or whether their abundance is determined by environmental factors that also influence stabilization or degradation kinetics like cation concentrations although eps and its microbial degradation appear to play an important role in filtration of faecal sludge these do not appear to be as important for determining the amount of moisture remaining in the sludge cake following dewatering illustrated in fig 9 the light grey shaded area depicts the trend observed for faecal sludge in gold et al 2018 the dark grey shaded area depicts the trend observed for wastewater sludges in skinner et al 2015 and data points for this study are included for comparison dewatered cake solids do not increase with decreasing vss fraction in contrast to the observed behaviour in wastewater sludges skinner et al 2015 however observations do fit within the existing behaviour of faecal sludges from septic tanks and lined pit latrines gold et al 2018a the expected relationship between vss fraction and cake solids does not hold for faecal sludge even though it remains consistent through a range of wastewater sludges generated through a variety of different treatment processes the explanation for this likely lies with the heterogeneity of the solids fraction in faecal sludges the relationship between vss and dewatered cake solids is strong in wastewater sludges because the vss fraction is representative of the eps fraction skinner et al 2015 variable quantities of sand soil and other inorganic materials can be introduced into faecal sludge during daily toilet use or during emptying seck et al 2015 because of this even if there is quite a high concentration of volatile organic material the vss tss fraction would still be low in addition we could not detect a correlation between eps concentration or fractionation and dewatered cake solids in faecal sludge it is probable that at the eps fractions present in faecal sludge other factors such as soil content may play a more important role in determining the solids fraction of dewatered faecal sludge 5 conclusions based on the observations in this study the key conclusions are eps is important for faecal sludge dewatering performance observed in this study higher concentrations of soluble and colloidal eps are likely to contribute to clogging of sand drying beds filters and other dewatering technologies however eps fractions mg gtss do not measurably contribute to flocculation or cake moisture content as is observed in activated and anaerobically digested wastewater sludge the observed relationships between ec ph supernatant turbidity and dewatering time could be further developed and applied in online monitoring of faecal sludge this would be relatively quick and inexpensive to implement and could predict dewaterability at treatment plants or be used for dosing of conditioners for enhanced dewatering for planning of community to city wide faecal sludge management including the design of transfer stations and treatment plants relationships between demographic factors e g source and physical chemical characteristics of faecal sludge could provide a relatively low cost way to help pre determine or predict dewatering performance faecal sludges behave differently than wastewater sludges there will not be one reference sludge that is appropriate to serve as a proxy for faecal sludge based on the vast differences in redox conditions biomass nutrients salts ions stabilization particle size eps undigested plant fibers etc hence this emerging research topic needs to be approached in different ways and cannot be solved with just a direct transfer of wastewater knowledge looking to other fields of dewatering for
