1710,wetland evapotranspiration et which involves the land atmosphere exchange of energy and water is dynamic and affects the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources however due to the variability and complexity of wetlands accurate estimation of patch scale et and its spatial variability remain insufficiently characterized to overcome this challenge an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology was developed by combining the three temperature 3t model which is robust to estimate transpiration and its spatial variability with uav based thermal infrared remote sensing and penman equation which is commonly used to estimate open water evaporation the combined approach was verified using the bowen ratio system over a subalpine wetland the results show that the proposed method is simple and applicable for estimating wetland et and its spatial variability with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 93 mean absolute percentage error mape of 7 90 root mean squared error rmse of 0 05 mm h 1 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 93 it depicts a large spatial variability in wetland et with respect to surface vegetation characteristics water regimes meteorological factors and larger transpiration rates than open water evaporation with its limited inputs and no calibration requirements the proposed method is concluded to be simple and to easily reveal the high temporal and spatial resolution characteristics of patch scale et and its components keywords subalpine wetland evapotranspiration unmanned aerial vehicle high spatial and temporal resolution jiuzhaigou valley data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wetlands are ubiquitous ecosystems worldwide with open water and wetland vegetation features and periodic variation in the type and density of vegetation cover and water levels abtew and melesse 2012 they can provide an important range of environmental social and economic services and their function is intimately tied to the water and energy exchanges across the wetland atmosphere boundary goodwin 2017 klammler et al 2020 lafleur 2008 wang et al 2022 despite the importance of wetland evapotranspiration et to local energy and water budgets there is a lack of consensus on evaporation rates from wetlands abtew and melesse 2012 mohamed et al 2012 as a major component of the hydrologic cycle there is a requirement for reasonably accurate estimates of evaporation from wetland water bodies transpiration from wetland vegetation and evapotranspiration from wetland patches numerous approaches have been applied to wetlands of different types and climate regimes abtew and melesse 2012 lafluer 2008 mohamed et al 2012 for example the lysimeter was designed for long term wetland monitoring and calibrated et models using high resolution meteorological data measured at the same site fahle and dietrich 2014 in addition micrometeorological approaches such as the bowen ratio energy balance method blanken 2014 gavil√°n and berengena 2007 todd et al 2000 yan et al 2020 and the eddy covariance method guo et al 2021 simpson et al 2019 wu and shukla 2014 has been widely used to measure wetland et in addition several models based on site specific meteorological measurements have been applied to estimate wetland et such as penman mohamed et al 2006 swain and decker 2010 penman monteith anda et al 2015 gassmann et al 2019 the shuttleworth wallace herbst and kappen 1999 wessel and rouse 1994 and priestley taylor models assouline et al 2016 clulow et al 2012 sun and song 2008 these ground based approaches allow simple instrumentation and provide robust results but they are primarily driven by atmospheric conditions near the land surface and are inevitably limited in their spatial coverage which cannot reflect site heterogeneity of the type and density of vegetation cover and water levels wang and dickinson 2012 satellite remote sensing of land surface characteristics offers a partial solution by coupling with ground observations and has been used to estimate terrestrial et for decades however any remote sensing based assessment of ecological responses remains uncertain in the absence of good correlations with ground data ma and zhang 2022 meir and woodward 2010 and multispectral satellite observations of land surface et over heterogeneous wetland patches remain challenged by the coarse spatial temporal resolution hwang and choi 2013 schmugge et al 2002 high resolution thermal infrared thermometry tir has become a relatively novel technology for the accurate measurement of patch scale surface temperature and et alves and pereira 2000 cardenas et al 2008 hwang et al 2020 maes and steppe 2012 owing to their high flexibility low operational cost real time imaging and high spatial resolution cm level tir sensors and cameras have been extensively used in combination with uav for local scale agricultural and hydrological studies chiabrando et al 2013 das et al 2021 tucci et al 2019 surface temperature measurements using uav based tir have proven reliable colomina and molina 2014 naughton and mcdonald 2019 song and park 2020 notably the spatial resolution of uav based tir is high enough to reflect the site heterogeneity of mixed land covers such as ponds or vegetation patches das et al 2021 hwang et al 2020 tucci et al 2019 which is important for understanding the spatial variability in pond evaporation and vegetation transpiration of various wetland plant communities that are lumped using the traditional approaches an accurate estimation of wetland et and its components would provide a direct way to evaluate the effect of vegetation patches over wetlands on open water evaporation which has been the subject of a long debate and does not reach a consensus abtew and melesse 2012 lafluer 2008 mohamed et al 2012 despite these potential applications few studies have been published on the use of tir or uav based tir devices to estimate water evaporation and vegetation transpiration hwang et al 2020 maes and steppe 2012 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 develop an effective approach for estimating et and its components over wetland patches based on uav based tir images with a high spatial and temporal resolution 2 reveal the spatial variability of wetland et with respect to surface vegetation characteristics and meteorological conditions and 3 explore the role of vegetation on wetland et by comparing transpiration and evaporation under the same microclimatic conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study site a horizontal flow wetland at nuorilang lakes 33 09 71 n 103 54 38 e 2365 m a s l fig 1 of jiuzhaigou valley jzg was selected as the study site located in china jzg falls within a transition zone between the sichuan basin and the eastern edge of the tibet plateau and is considered a prototypical subalpine valley marked by a highland temperate monsoon climate data from the nearest meteorological station songpan show a mean annual temperature of 7 3 c and a mean annual precipitation of 762 mm hao et al 2009 the lowest and highest average temperatures occur in january and july at 3 7 c and 16 8 c respectively the wetland consists of many small islands scattered by travertine dams in steep zones with diffuse boundaries florsheim et al 2013 the water flows between these islands and the water table ranges from less than 5 cm in april to approximately 15 cm above the soil in august the submerged islands are dominated by equisetum species equisetum fluvitalie equisetum arvense the dominant plant above the water surface is salix linearistipularis with sporadic pinus tabuliformis betula utilis abies fabri sorbaria arborea and carex obscura yan et al 2020 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 bowen ratio system and micrometeorological data the bowen ratio system was set up over the canopy of the wetland area the measurements included air temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed wind direction net radiation and ground heat flux all data were sampled every 5 s and 10 minute averages were recorded using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa from july 2013 to the present detailed information about the height at which the measurements were taken and the sensors is provided in yan et al 2020 2 2 2 observations via uav based tir the tir images of the wetland were obtained every hour with a uav tir camera prosc workswell praha czech republic fig 2 c which was carried on a hexa rotor dji m600 pro drone m600 dji inc shenzhen guangdong province china fig 2 a b the tir images were taken every 2 s at a flying height of 120 m and the cruise time was approximately 12 min excluding the takeoff and landing time the observation was primarily scheduled from 9 00 to 17 00 beijing standard time bst on june 23 25 2020 and july 18 23 2021 to minimize the effects of cloudy and rainy conditions the last two observations on june 23 were conducted at 16 30 and 17 30 and the last observation on june 24 was at 16 00 detailed information regarding the tir camera and drone is presented in table 1 in this study thermal infrared images were stitched using pix4d software pix4d s a prilly switzerland based on gps information fig 3 illustrates an example of the temperature measured using the tir the area of this map is approximately 13 ha and the spatial resolution is 16 cm table 1 in addition the temperatures of the reference leave with no transpiration were measured by the tir camera as the drone hovers approximately 10 m above the green paper dry green paper 210 mm 297 mm was used as the reference leaf to avoid the error caused by the color and roughness the color of the green paper was as close as possible to that of the actual leaf color with a smooth surface the dry green paper was placed about 20 cm from the vegetation canopy 30 min before each measurement to provide similar circumstances to the leave in the canopy 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 bowen ratio energy balance method wetland et mm s 1 was measured using the bowen ratio energy balance method which was calculated using the following equations 1 et r n g l 1 Œ≤ where r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 l is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 and Œ≤ is the bowen ratio which is a function of vertical temperature and humidity gradients bowen 1926 2 Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ¥ t Œ¥ e where Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 Œ¥ t and Œ¥ e are the temperature and vapor pressure gradients measured between the two heights respectively details of the data processing are provided in yan et al 2020 2 3 2 the three temperature model and penman equation wetland et includes transpiration from vegetation patches and evaporation from the open water surface calculated using the three temperature model 3t and penman equation respectively fig 4 the 3t was proposed by qiu 1996 and was developed to estimate et and its components on heterogeneous surfaces at multi scales qiu et al 1998 2006 tian et al 2013 2014 wang et al 2016 xiong et al 2015 2019 yan and qiu 2016 although it has been developed to partition terrestrial et into vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation the assumption of reference dry surface of the 3t model with no evaporation does not hold for the water surface making it improper to estimate evaporation from water surface therefore the 3t model is chose to estimate transpiration from vegetation and penman equation to estimate evaporation from open water the transpiration rate of the vegetation e t c mm s 1 can be estimated as follows 3 e t c 1 l r n c r n c p t c t a t cp t a where r n c and r n c p are the net radiation of the vegetation and the reference leaf surface w m 2 respectively t a is the air temperature measured at the bowen ratio system t c is the vegetation canopy temperature c and t cp is the temperature of the imitation leaf surface c which is assumed to be the reference dry canopy without transpiration more details about the 3t model are provided by yan and qiu 2016 the net radiation of vegetation and the reference leaf surface were estimated based on solar radiation and the temperatures of the vegetation canopy and imitation leaf surface extracted from the thermal infrared images according to jensen et al 1990 and weiss 1982 the imitation leaf was made from green paper by selecting a paper having nearly the same color as the plant leaves and cutting the paper into shapes similar to those of the plant leaves the green paper leaf was then installed in the upper part of the canopy to place them under conditions similar to the plant leaves the other component of wetland et that is evaporation rate from open water e t w mm s 1 was estimated using the penman equation penman 1948 which computes potential evapotranspiration open water evaporation or evaporation from wetlands with emergent vegetation mohamed et al 2006 shuttleworth 1993 souch et al 1998 valiantzas 2006 the equation is as follows 4 e t w 1 l Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 6 43 1 0 536 u e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ where u is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturated vapor pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa the difference between e s and e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd finally wetland et was estimated using a weighted method based on the modelling of transpiration and evaporation rates which is given as follows 5 et 1 f e t c f e t w where f is the open water ratio which is estimated based on the visible image of the wetland according to the fetch of bowen ratio system as reported by stannard et al 2004 the fetch to height ratios range from 34 to 49 for the bowen ratio measurements in a small wetland and the fetch induced errors were small 1 90 0 59 in this study the weighted wetland et was calculated for an area with a radius of 70 m fetch to height ratio of 35 around the bowen ratio system the open water ratio was then determined 20 2 3 3 priestley taylor and penman monteith equation the priestley and taylor equation pt was developed to calculate evaporation from water or well watered short vegetation with minimal advection priestley and taylor 1972 6 et 1 l Œ± Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g where Œ± is the priestley taylor coefficient often referred to a constant of 1 26 and Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 the penman monteith equation pm has also been applied to compute wetland et by including aerodynamic and surface resistance monteith 1965 7 et 1 l Œ¥ r n g c p œÅ a e s e a r a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 r s r a where r a is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 and r s is the surface resistance s m 1 according to allen et al 1998 aerodynamic resistance controls the movement of water vapor from the plant surface under neutral stability conditions and is defined as follows 8 r a ln z m d z om ln z h d z oh k 2 u where z m is the height of the wind instrument m d is the zero plane displacement height m z om is the roughness length governing momentum transfer m z h is the height of the humidity instrument m z oh is the roughness length governing heat and vapor transfer m and k is the van karman constant 0 41 in this study the penman monteith equation is tested using an r s of zero which is recommended for conditions when standing water is present souch et al 1998 drexler et al 2004 subsequently r s of 25 s m 1 reported during the growing season for cattails abtew and obeysekera 1995 was tested for our site 2 4 methods for model evaluation in this study the mean absolute percentage error mape root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to evaluate model performance 9 mape 1 n i 1 n e t obs i e t est i e t obs i 100 10 rmse 1 n i n e t est i e t obs i 2 11 nse 1 i n e t est i e t obs i 2 i n e t obs i e t obs 2 where n is the sample size e t est i is the model estimated value at sample i e t obs i is the observed value at sample i and e t obs is the mean observed value the value of nse is from negative infinity to 1 an nse close to 1 indicates that the model is reliable and an nse far less than 0 shows that the model is unreliable 3 results 3 1 characteristics of meteorological conditions on the observation days the observed meteorological values from the bowen ratio system were used to demonstrate the weather conditions on observation days fig 5 it was a cloudy and rainy day on june 23 resulting in wet vegetation surfaces and a lower vpd throughout the day on clear days the net radiation increases noticeably in the morning and reaches a peak higher than 750 w m 2 around 14 00 the daytime average rn over the study period was mostly great than 600 w m 2 vpd shows a diurnal variation similar to rn with a peaking time lag of 1 2 h on most of the clear days it fluctuated from approximately 0 kpa in the morning to more than 2 5 kpa around 15 00 these are typical weather conditions in the mid growth period and can represent the general weather conditions in such a subalpine valley which are characterized by high radiation and large diurnal vpd variation 3 2 validation of the combination method of the 3t model and penman model estimations of wetland et from the combined approach of the 3t model and penman equation were compared with results from the bowen ratio energy balance method to evaluate its accuracy over a complex wetland the combination model displayed good agreement with the in situ measurements fig 6 both the trends and values of the measured and estimated et are similar to each other especially on clear days the linear regression analysis between the estimated et from the combination model and the measured et from the bowen ratio system shows that the scatters are distributed close to the 1 1 line with the coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 62 to 0 99 the intercepts of the regression lines from 0 05 to 0 11 are not significantly different from zero at the probability of 0 05 the regression slopes vary from 0 77 to 1 15 which are approximately unity on typical days during these clear days the mean absolute percentage error mape was relatively lower than 9 07 the root mean squared error rmse is less than 0 05 mm h 1 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse approaches the unity fig 7 depicts the overall performance of the proposed method on all observation days and clear days it shows that although some of the et values on the cloudy and rainy day deviate from the 1 1 line the scatters are evenly distributed on both sides of the no difference line with r2 of 0 93 and 0 97 slopes of 0 99 and 1 03 and intercepts of 0 02 and 0 01 for all observation and clear days respectively the mape and rmse between the estimated and measured wetland ets are 7 90 and 0 05 mm h 1 4 60 and 0 03 mm h 1 for all observation and clear days respectively the corresponding nse is 0 93 and 0 97 this consistency between the estimates and measurements indicates that the combination of the 3t and penman model is an accurate and applicable method for estimating wetland evapotranspiration with uav tir systems especially on clear days 3 3 spatial distribution of wetland et briefly uav tir remote sensing obtains the overall temperature data and its distribution with high temporal hourly and spatial resolution decimeters approximately 16 cm in this study the surface temperature of the wetland had a large spatial heterogeneity fig 3 at 12 00 june 25 2020 the surface temperature ranges from 3 0 c to 59 4 c over a sampling line across the wetland fig 8 the water surface is characterized by temperatures lower than 10 c whereas the surface temperatures of wetland vegetation fluctuate noticeably this high temperature variability acquired by uav tir remote sensing enables an effective reflection of the spatial distribution of wetland et as shown in fig 9 a and b the et rate shows a high spatial variability at 12 00 june 25 2020 which ranges from 0 01 to 1 47 mm h 1 and averages to 0 79 mm h 1 as the water evaporation estimated using the penman equation is assumed to have the same value 0 67 mm h 1 large fluctuations in fig 9 c occur on the vegetation surfaces in addition the vegetation transpiration rates varied across different locations in the wetland fig 10 higher transpiration rates generally occur in the center of the wetland sample line 2 due to favorable aerodynamic conditions and ample water supply fig 10 a and c higher transpiration rates are also shown on the outlet of the lake sample lines 6 and 4 in fig 10 b and d 4 discussion 4 1 model comparisons wetland et refers to all forms of water transfer from the wetland surface to the atmosphere and includes open water evaporation and plant transpiration owing to the limitations of site specific measurements and the coarse spatial temporal resolution of satellite remote sensing over complex wetlands the variability in open water evaporation and vegetation transpiration of various wetland plant communities are lumped hwang et al 2020 to overcome this challenge an uav based tir with a high spatial resolution cm level was employed with the 3t model to estimate the transpiration rate of wetland vegetation patches the total wetland et was then obtained as the weighted sum of vegetation transpiration and open water evaporation calculated using the penman model and validated by the results from the bowen ratio system there is a good correlation r2 0 62 mape 31 33 rmse 0 12 mm h 1 and nse 0 55 for a rainy day r2 0 97 mape 4 60 rmse 0 03 mm h 1 and nse 0 97 for clear days between the estimated and the measured et fig 7 these results show that the combination of the 3t and penman models is a reasonable and applicable method for estimating et from wetlands with various ponds and vegetation patches model accuracy was clearly improved during clear days figs 6 7 which can be attributed to the recommended applicable conditions of the thermal sensors and the theory of the 3t model as thermal sensors are sensitive to atmospheric particles smoke haze cloud etc and climatic factors air temperature humidity das et al 2021 thermal images are suggested to be acquired around midday or under sunny cloud free weather conditions pinter et al 1990 m√∂ller et al 2007 bhandari 2016 additionally in the development of the 3t model it is assumed that the reference canopy is considered part of the vegetation canopy and that they are under the same meteorological conditions qiu 1996 yan and qiu 2016 however the vegetation canopy becomes wet after rainfall whereas the imitation leaf remains dry both of these factors contribute to the poor performance of the proposed method on the cloudy and rainy days the reliability of three commonly used methods the priestley taylor penman and penman monteith equation over wetlands has also been tested during rainy fig 11 and clear days fig 12 the priestley taylor equation is probably the simplest method that requires a minimum number of meteorological observations and has been widely used to estimate wetland et souch et al 1996 1998 burba et al 1999 bidlake 2000 jacobs et al 2002 mao et al 2002 sun and song 2008 lenters et al 2011 hwang et al 2020 however many of the experimental values of the priestley taylor coefficient Œ± show a departure of 1 26 for example the Œ± value at our site is 0 95 for the rainy day and 0 76 for clear days this discrepancy has been reported to be caused by soil moisture conditions jacobs et al 2002 lenters et al 2011 and the biophysical characteristics of the surface surface resistance de bruin 1983 monteith 1995 burba et al 1999 yan et al 2020 therefore the priestley taylor equation requires site specific calibration before it can be successfully used to estimate of wetland et souch et al 1996 bidlake 2000 drexler et al 2004 brown et al 2010 the penman equation for open water has also been used for wetland et estimation and by including aerodynamic resistance the performance is improved marginally over the purely energy driven pt model with the suggested value of Œ± 1 26 fig 12 a and b however wetland et on clear days remains over predicted which is consistent with the reported results lafleur 1990 souch et al 1998 jacobs et al 2002 sun and song 2008 because the penman equation does not consider the effect of wetland vegetation it is used to estimate the evaporation rate from open water in our study and the penman monteith equation is used to estimate wetland et for further comparison as shown in fig 12 c the inclusion of the surface resistance considerably improves the performance with mape changing from 36 77 to 21 66 rmse changing from 0 21 to 0 13 mm h 1 and nse changing from 0 30 to 0 53 this improvement was most notable in periods with peak et rates these results suggest that surface resistance although very small is sufficient to reduce evapotranspiration rates at times of maximum energy availability and improve modelling performance souch et al 1998 burba et al 1999 bidlake 2000 jacobs et al 2002 however a potential difficulty with the penman monteith equation is the parameterization of heterogeneous vegetation and soil moisture conditions mohamed et al 2012 in summary as the model becomes more complicated its application would be of limited use due to large surface variability and lack of information on aerodynamic and surface resistances over the wetland in contrast the necessary input parameters for the proposed method are net radiation soil heat flux temperatures humidity and wind speed with no need for surface resistance or canopy characteristics therefore with its limited inputs and no calibration requirements the proposed method appears to be simple and applicable for separately estimating open water evaporation and wetland vegetation transpiration and high spatial and temporal resolution estimation of wetland et 4 2 model uncertainty numerous models are available for estimating wetland et and their uncertainty is directly related to differences in model structures and parameterization schemes jacobs et al 2002 drexler et al 2004 mohamed et al 2012 as shown figs 10 and 11 different model performances exist among the et values estimated from different models the same model with different parameterization schemes because the penman equation is commonly used for evaporation from open water based on site meteorological observations the uncertainty of the proposed combination approach depends on the input of the 3t model that is net radiation r n air temperature t a canopy surface temperature t c and reference canopy surface temperature t cp first every single uav observation lasted approximately 12 min and the mereological data were recorded every 10 min hence the inputs of the proposed method include instantaneous surface temperatures t c and t cp average net radiation and air temperature for the same period of each uav observation these observations at different time scales may lead to bias under non stationary conditions allen et al 1989 hupet and vanclooster 2001 as noted by das et al 2021 thermal sensors are sensitive to atmospheric particles smoke haze cloud and climatic factors air temperature humidity which may result in instantaneous surface temperatures under a temporary cloud shade lower than the average values for the observation period hwang et al 2020 second the three temperature terms in equation 3 described as the plant transpiration transfer coefficient are critical for estimating et and directly determining the model performance xiong and qiu 2011 as described in section 2 2 the measurement accuracy is 2 c for t c and t cp and 0 2 c for t a sensitivity analysis beven 1979 based on the data in figs 6 7 shows that an error of 2 c in t c or t cp will lead to a difference of approximately 0 08 mm h 1 between the et estimates and an error of 0 2 c in t a will lead to a difference of approximately 0 008 mm h 1 these results emphasize the importance of the accuracy of the tir measurements in addition both the canopy and reference canopy must be kept dry as the temperature differences between t c and t cp are caused by canopy transpiration otherwise such that the canopy is wetted by rainfall but the reference canopy is kept dry the transpiration rates calculated by the 3t model would lead to large uncertainty fig 7 a therefore to alleviate the influence of surface temperature uncertainty on et estimates from the 3t model the use of a new tir with higher accuracy or conducting tir measurements on clear days when the canopy surface is dry are suggested while during the rainy days as the combining method could lead to large uncertainty the constant reference evaporative fraction method may be suggested which assumes a constant ratio of the daily et to reference et allen et al 2007 third the methodology used to obtain the temperature of the reference dry vegetation canopy is crucial for applying the 3t model for ground or uav based measurements with a high resolution tir t cp can be directly measured from the imitation leaf qiu et al 2006 to alleviate the differences in albedo between the canopy and the reference canopy a dry color paper printed from colored plant leaves was used as the imitation leaf zhang et al 2020 despite the good performance of the imitation leaf in this study it would absorb water from the atmosphere with high humidity which requires further attention 4 3 the spatial variability of wetland et wetland et generally has high spatial resolution because wetland patches vary greatly with respect to surface vegetation characteristics water regimes and meteorological factors brown et al 2010 lafleur 2008 mykleby et al 2016 oberg and melesss 2006 however the patch scale variability in wetland et has not been well explored because of the limitation of coarse spatial temporal resolution of land surface characteristics hwang et al 2020 to overcome this challenge an advanced uav technology that combines the use of the 3t model penman equation and uav based tir was developed and applied to understand the spatial variability of evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration from small wetland patches decimeter scale at a high temporal resolution hourly scale we found a large variation in vegetation transpiration rates ranging from 0 to 1 47 mm h 1 fig 10 this large variation can be attributed to the different microclimatic conditions and plant communities for example there are generally higher transpiration rates in the center of the valley sample line 2 due to favorable aerodynamic conditions and ample water supply fig 10 a and 10c higher transpiration rates were also found in the outlet of the lake fig 10 b and 10d where the dominant plant species are primarily shrubs e g salix linearistipularis while they are emergent macrophytes such as e fluvitalie e arvense at the inlet of the lake peng 2008 in addition as the travertine dam generally forms in the downstream portion of relatively deep lakes the outlet is flatter with shallower and slower water flow florsheim et al 2013 since the population of the dominant pant species and their species richness vary along gradients of water depth peng 2008 whitehead et al 1990 and wetlands experience seasonal or permanent flooding at different water depths complications of the spatial distribution of wetland et arise because of spatial variation due to microtopography variations in standing water level and water advection lafleur 2008 the proposed method is easy to replicate and therefore shows particular promise for characterizing variability in patch scale et due to spatial heterogeneity it is also worth mentioning that the proposed method which can separately estimate open water evaporation and vegetation transpiration provides a new way to compare wetland et and open water evaporation under the same conditions which is under debate lafleur 2008 mohamed et al 2012 s√°nchez carrillo et al 2004 in this study despite a large variation in vegetation transpiration rates fig 9 they are larger than the open water evaporation 0 67 mm h 1 the presence of wetland vegetation leads to larger et than open water evaporation under the same climatic conditions in jzg the wetland has experienced a notable persistent encroachment of tree and shrub species urgenson et al 2014 and the vegetation is expanding under the strict protection of the local administration this vegetation expansion appears to have caused an increase in the wetland et with a non significant increase in annual precipitation yan et al 2017 this alternation is likely to decrease the surface water availability defined as precipitation minus evapotranspiration and affect the local water landscape e g waterfall small color lakes these results have significant implications for total water consumption and water allocation to wetlands in local water and landscape management 5 conclusions this study proposes a simple and applicable method for estimating wetland et with a high spatial resolution by combining the 3t model uav tir remote sensing and the penman equation the results presented a good agreement with the measured et by the bowen ratio system with r2 of 0 93 mape of 7 90 rmse of 0 05 mm h 1 and nse of 0 93 during the entire study period and r2 of 0 97 mape of 4 60 rmse of 0 03 mm h 1 and nse of 0 97 during clear days compared with the priestley taylor equation penman equation and penman monteith equation the proposed method provides a better performance and enables a simple way to investigate the spatial variability of wetland et which ranges from 0 01 to 1 47 mm h 1 at 12 00 june 25 2020 the proposed method can separately estimate transpiration from wetland patches and evaporation from open water which can be used to quantify the effect of vegetation change on wetland et in jzg the existence of wetland vegetation led to an increase in et and a reduction of surface water availability for the local water landscape with its limited inputs and no calibration requirements the proposed method is concluded to be simple and to easily reveal the high temporal and spatial resolution characteristics of wetland et and its components therefore the proposed method has the potential for a wide range of

1710,wetland evapotranspiration et which involves the land atmosphere exchange of energy and water is dynamic and affects the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources however due to the variability and complexity of wetlands accurate estimation of patch scale et and its spatial variability remain insufficiently characterized to overcome this challenge an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology was developed by combining the three temperature 3t model which is robust to estimate transpiration and its spatial variability with uav based thermal infrared remote sensing and penman equation which is commonly used to estimate open water evaporation the combined approach was verified using the bowen ratio system over a subalpine wetland the results show that the proposed method is simple and applicable for estimating wetland et and its spatial variability with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 93 mean absolute percentage error mape of 7 90 root mean squared error rmse of 0 05 mm h 1 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 93 it depicts a large spatial variability in wetland et with respect to surface vegetation characteristics water regimes meteorological factors and larger transpiration rates than open water evaporation with its limited inputs and no calibration requirements the proposed method is concluded to be simple and to easily reveal the high

jiuzhaigou valley data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wetlands are ubiquitous ecosystems worldwide with open water and wetland vegetation features and periodic variation in the type and density of vegetation cover and water levels abtew and melesse 2012 they can provide an important range of environmental social and economic services and their function is intimately tied to the water and energy exchanges across the wetland atmosphere boundary goodwin 2017 klammler et al 2020 lafleur 2008 wang et al 2022 despite the importance of wetland evapotranspiration et to local energy and water budgets there is a lack of consensus on evaporation rates from wetlands abtew and melesse 2012 mohamed et al 2012 as a major component of the hydrologic cycle there is a requirement for reasonably accurate estimates of evaporation from wetland water bodies transpiration from wetland vegetation and evapotranspiration from wetland patches numerous approaches have been applied to wetlands of different types and climate regimes abtew and melesse 2012 lafluer 2008 mohamed et al 2012 for example the lysimeter was designed for long term wetland monitoring and calibrated et models using high resolution meteorological data measured at the same site fahle and dietrich 2014 in addition micrometeorological approaches such as the bowen ratio energy balance method blanken 2014 gavil√°n and berengena 2007 todd et al 2000 yan et al 2020 and the eddy covariance method guo et al 2021 simpson et al 2019 wu and shukla 2014 has been widely used to measure wetland et in addition several models based on site specific meteorological measurements have been applied to estimate wetland et such as penman mohamed et al 2006 swain and decker 2010 penman monteith anda et al 2015 gassmann et al 2019 the shuttleworth wallace herbst and kappen 1999 wessel and rouse 1994 and priestley taylor models assouline et al 2016 clulow et al 2012 sun and song 2008 these ground based approaches allow simple instrumentation and provide robust results but they are primarily driven by atmospheric conditions near the land surface and are inevitably limited in their spatial coverage which cannot reflect site heterogeneity of the type and density of vegetation cover and water levels wang and dickinson 2012 satellite remote sensing of land surface characteristics offers a partial solution by coupling with ground observations and has been used to estimate terrestrial et for decades however any remote sensing based assessment of ecological responses remains uncertain in the absence of good correlations with ground data ma and zhang 2022 meir and woodward 2010 and multispectral satellite observations of land surface et over heterogeneous wetland patches remain challenged by the coarse spatial temporal resolution hwang and choi 2013 schmugge et al 2002 high resolution thermal infrared thermometry tir has become a relatively novel technology for the accurate measurement of patch scale surface temperature and et alves and pereira 2000 cardenas et al 2008 hwang et al 2020 maes and steppe 2012 owing to their high flexibility low operational cost real time imaging and high spatial resolution cm level tir sensors and cameras have been extensively used in combination with uav for local scale agricultural and hydrological studies chiabrando et al 2013 das et al 2021 tucci et al 2019 surface temperature measurements using uav based tir have proven reliable colomina and molina 2014 naughton and mcdonald 2019 song and park 2020 notably the spatial resolution of uav based tir is high enough to reflect the site heterogeneity of mixed land covers such as ponds or vegetation patches das et al 2021 hwang et al 2020 tucci et al 2019 which is important for understanding the spatial variability in pond evaporation and vegetation transpiration of various wetland plant communities that are lumped using the traditional approaches an accurate estimation of wetland et and its components would provide a direct way to evaluate the effect of vegetation patches over wetlands on open water evaporation which has been the subject of a long debate and does not reach a consensus abtew and melesse 2012 lafluer 2008 mohamed et al 2012 despite these potential applications few studies have been published on the use of tir or uav based tir devices to estimate water evaporation and vegetation transpiration hwang et al 2020 maes and steppe 2012 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 develop an effective approach for estimating et and its components over wetland patches based on uav based tir images with a high spatial and temporal resolution 2 reveal the spatial variability of wetland et with respect to surface vegetation characteristics and meteorological conditions and 3 explore the role of vegetation on wetland et by comparing transpiration and evaporation under the same microclimatic conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study site a horizontal flow wetland at nuorilang lakes 33 09 71 n 103 54 38 e 2365 m a s l fig 1 of jiuzhaigou valley jzg was selected as the study site located in china jzg falls within a transition zone between the sichuan basin and the eastern edge of the tibet plateau and is considered a prototypical subalpine valley marked by a highland temperate monsoon climate data from the nearest meteorological station songpan show a mean annual temperature of 7 3 c and a mean annual precipitation of 762 mm hao et al 2009 the lowest and highest average temperatures occur in january and july at 3 7 c and 16 8 c respectively the wetland consists of many small islands scattered by travertine dams in steep zones with diffuse boundaries florsheim et al 2013 the water flows between these islands and the water table ranges from less than 5 cm in april to approximately 15 cm above the soil in august the submerged islands are dominated by equisetum species equisetum fluvitalie equisetum arvense the dominant plant above the water surface is salix linearistipularis with sporadic pinus tabuliformis betula utilis abies fabri sorbaria arborea and carex obscura yan et al 2020 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 bowen ratio system and micrometeorological data the bowen ratio system was set up over the canopy of the wetland area the measurements included air temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed wind direction net radiation and ground heat flux all data were sampled every 5 s and 10 minute averages were recorded using a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa from july 2013 to the present detailed information about the height at which the measurements were taken and the sensors is provided in yan et al 2020 2 2 2 observations via uav based tir the tir images of the wetland were obtained every hour with a uav tir camera prosc workswell praha czech republic fig 2 c which was carried on a hexa rotor dji m600 pro drone m600 dji inc shenzhen guangdong province china fig 2 a b the tir images were taken every 2 s at a flying height of 120 m and the cruise time was approximately 12 min excluding the takeoff and landing time the observation was primarily scheduled from 9 00 to 17 00 beijing standard time bst on june 23 25 2020 and july 18 23 2021 to minimize the effects of cloudy and rainy conditions the last two observations on june 23 were conducted at 16 30 and 17 30 and the last observation on june 24 was at 16 00 detailed information regarding the tir camera and drone is presented in table 1 in this study thermal infrared images were stitched using pix4d software pix4d s a prilly switzerland based on gps information fig 3 illustrates an example of the temperature measured using the tir the area of this map is approximately 13 ha and the spatial resolution is 16 cm table 1 in addition the temperatures of the reference leave with no transpiration were measured by the tir camera as the drone hovers approximately 10 m above the green paper dry green paper 210 mm 297 mm was used as the reference leaf to avoid the error caused by the color and roughness the color of the green paper was as close as possible to that of the actual leaf color with a smooth surface the dry green paper was placed about 20 cm from the vegetation canopy 30 min before each measurement to provide similar circumstances to the leave in the canopy 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 bowen ratio energy balance method wetland et mm s 1 was measured using the bowen ratio energy balance method which was calculated using the following equations 1 et r n g l 1 Œ≤ where r n is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 l is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 and Œ≤ is the bowen ratio which is a function of vertical temperature and humidity gradients bowen 1926 2 Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ¥ t Œ¥ e where Œ≥ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 Œ¥ t and Œ¥ e are the temperature and vapor pressure gradients measured between the two heights respectively details of the data processing are provided in yan et al 2020 2 3 2 the three temperature model and penman equation wetland et includes transpiration from vegetation patches and evaporation from the open water surface calculated using the three temperature model 3t and penman equation respectively fig 4 the 3t was proposed by qiu 1996 and was developed to estimate et and its components on heterogeneous surfaces at multi scales qiu et al 1998 2006 tian et al 2013 2014 wang et al 2016 xiong et al 2015 2019 yan and qiu 2016 although it has been developed to partition terrestrial et into vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation the assumption of reference dry surface of the 3t model with no evaporation does not hold for the water surface making it improper to estimate evaporation from water surface therefore the 3t model is chose to estimate transpiration from vegetation and penman equation to estimate evaporation from open water the transpiration rate of the vegetation e t c mm s 1 can be estimated as follows 3 e t c 1 l r n c r n c p t c t a t cp t a where r n c and r n c p are the net radiation of the vegetation and the reference leaf surface w m 2 respectively t a is the air temperature measured at the bowen ratio system t c is the vegetation canopy temperature c and t cp is the temperature of the imitation leaf surface c which is assumed to be the reference dry canopy without transpiration more details about the 3t model are provided by yan and qiu 2016 the net radiation of vegetation and the reference leaf surface were estimated based on solar radiation and the temperatures of the vegetation canopy and imitation leaf surface extracted from the thermal infrared images according to jensen et al 1990 and weiss 1982 the imitation leaf was made from green paper by selecting a paper having nearly the same color as the plant leaves and cutting the paper into shapes similar to those of the plant leaves the green paper leaf was then installed in the upper part of the canopy to place them under conditions similar to the plant leaves the other component of wetland et that is evaporation rate from open water e t w mm s 1 was estimated using the penman equation penman 1948 which computes potential evapotranspiration open water evaporation or evaporation from wetlands with emergent vegetation mohamed et al 2006 shuttleworth 1993 souch et al 1998 valiantzas 2006 the equation is as follows 4 e t w 1 l Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 6 43 1 0 536 u e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ where u is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturated vapor pressure kpa and e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa the difference between e s and e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd finally wetland et was estimated using a weighted method based on the modelling of transpiration and evaporation rates which is given as follows 5 et 1 f e t c f e t w where f is the open water ratio which is estimated based on the visible image of the wetland according to the fetch of bowen ratio system as reported by stannard et al 2004 the fetch to height ratios range from 34 to 49 for the bowen ratio measurements in a small wetland and the fetch induced errors were small 1 90 0 59 in this study the weighted wetland et was calculated for an area with a radius of 70 m fetch to height ratio of 35 around the bowen ratio system the open water ratio was then determined 20 2 3 3 priestley taylor and penman monteith equation the priestley and taylor equation pt was developed to calculate evaporation from water or well watered short vegetation with minimal advection priestley and taylor 1972 6 et 1 l Œ± Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g where Œ± is the priestley taylor coefficient often referred to a constant of 1 26 and Œ¥ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 the penman monteith equation pm has also been applied to compute wetland et by including aerodynamic and surface resistance monteith 1965 7 et 1 l Œ¥ r n g c p œÅ a e s e a r a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 r s r a where r a is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 and r s is the surface resistance s m 1 according to allen et al 1998 aerodynamic resistance controls the movement of water vapor from the plant surface under neutral stability conditions and is defined as follows 8 r a ln z m d z om ln z h d z oh k 2 u where z m is the height of the wind instrument m d is the zero plane displacement height m z om is the roughness length governing momentum transfer m z h is the height of the humidity instrument m z oh is the roughness length governing heat and vapor transfer m and k is the van karman constant 0 41 in this study the penman monteith equation is tested using an r s of zero which is recommended for conditions when standing water is present souch et al 1998 drexler et al 2004 subsequently r s of 25 s m 1 reported during the growing season for cattails abtew and obeysekera 1995 was tested for our site 2 4 methods for model evaluation in this study the mean absolute percentage error mape root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to evaluate model performance 9 mape 1 n i 1 n e t obs i e t est i e t obs i 100 10 rmse 1 n i n e t est i e t obs i 2 11 nse 1 i n e t est i e t obs i 2 i n e t obs i e t obs 2 where n is the sample size e t est i is the model estimated value at sample i e t obs i is the observed value at sample i and e t obs is the mean observed value the value of nse is from negative infinity to 1 an nse close to 1 indicates that the model is reliable and an nse far less than 0 shows that the model is unreliable 3 results 3 1 characteristics of meteorological conditions on the observation days the observed meteorological values from the bowen ratio system were used to demonstrate the weather conditions on observation days fig 5 it was a cloudy and rainy day on june 23 resulting in wet vegetation surfaces and a lower vpd throughout the day on clear days the net radiation increases noticeably in the morning and reaches a peak higher than 750 w m 2 around 14 00 the daytime average rn over the study period was mostly great than 600 w m 2 vpd shows a diurnal variation similar to rn with a peaking time lag of 1 2 h on most of the clear days it fluctuated from approximately 0 kpa in the morning to more than 2 5 kpa around 15 00 these are typical weather conditions in the mid growth period and can represent the general weather conditions in such a subalpine valley which are characterized by high radiation and large diurnal vpd variation 3 2 validation of the combination method of the 3t model and penman model estimations of wetland et from the combined approach of the 3t model and penman equation were compared with results from the bowen ratio energy balance method to evaluate its accuracy over a complex wetland the combination model displayed good agreement with the in situ measurements fig 6 both the trends and values of the measured and estimated et are similar to each other especially on clear days the linear regression analysis between the estimated et from the combination model and the measured et from the bowen ratio system shows that the scatters are distributed close to the 1 1 line with the coefficient of determination r2 ranging from 0 62 to 0 99 the intercepts of the regression lines from 0 05 to 0 11 are not significantly different from zero at the probability of 0 05 the regression slopes vary from 0 77 to 1 15 which are approximately unity on typical days during these clear days the mean absolute percentage error mape was relatively lower than 9 07 the root mean squared error rmse is less than 0 05 mm h 1 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse approaches the unity fig 7 depicts the overall performance of the proposed method on all observation days and clear days it shows that although some of the et values on the cloudy and rainy day deviate from the 1 1 line the scatters are evenly distributed on both sides of the no difference line with r2 of 0 93 and 0 97 slopes of 0 99 and 1 03 and intercepts of 0 02 and 0 01 for all observation and clear days respectively the mape and rmse between the estimated and measured wetland ets are 7 90 and 0 05 mm h 1 4 60 and 0 03 mm h 1 for all observation and clear days respectively the corresponding nse is 0 93 and 0 97 this consistency between the estimates and measurements indicates that the combination of the 3t and penman model is an accurate and applicable method for estimating wetland evapotranspiration with uav tir systems especially on clear days 3 3 spatial distribution of wetland et briefly uav tir remote sensing obtains the overall temperature data and its distribution with high temporal hourly and spatial resolution decimeters approximately 16 cm in this study the surface temperature of the wetland had a large spatial heterogeneity fig 3 at 12 00 june 25 2020 the surface temperature ranges from 3 0 c to 59 4 c over a sampling line across the wetland fig 8 the water surface is characterized by temperatures lower than 10 c whereas the surface temperatures of wetland vegetation fluctuate noticeably this high temperature variability acquired by uav tir remote sensing enables an effective reflection of the spatial distribution of wetland et as shown in fig 9 a and b the et rate shows a high spatial variability at 12 00 june 25 2020 which ranges from 0 01 to 1 47 mm h 1 and averages to 0 79 mm h 1 as the water evaporation estimated using the penman equation is assumed to have the same value 0 67 mm h 1 large fluctuations in fig 9 c occur on the vegetation surfaces in addition the vegetation transpiration rates varied across different locations in the wetland fig 10 higher transpiration rates generally occur in the center of the wetland sample line 2 due to favorable aerodynamic conditions and ample water supply fig 10 a and c higher transpiration rates are also shown on the outlet of the lake sample lines 6 and 4 in fig 10 b and d 4 discussion 4 1 model comparisons wetland et refers to all forms of water transfer from the wetland surface to the atmosphere and includes open water evaporation and plant transpiration owing to the limitations of site specific measurements and the coarse spatial temporal resolution of satellite remote sensing over complex wetlands the variability in open water evaporation and vegetation transpiration of various wetland plant communities are lumped hwang et al 2020 to overcome this challenge an uav based tir with a high spatial resolution cm level was employed with the 3t model to estimate the transpiration rate of wetland vegetation patches the total wetland et was then obtained as the weighted sum of vegetation transpiration and open water evaporation calculated using the penman model and validated by the results from the bowen ratio system there is a good correlation r2 0 62 mape 31 33 rmse 0 12 mm h 1 and nse 0 55 for a rainy day r2 0 97 mape 4 60 rmse 0 03 mm h 1 and nse 0 97 for clear days between the estimated and the measured et fig 7 these results show that the combination of the 3t and penman models is a reasonable and applicable method for estimating et from wetlands with various ponds and vegetation patches model accuracy was clearly improved during clear days figs 6 7 which can be attributed to the recommended applicable conditions of the thermal sensors and the theory of the 3t model as thermal sensors are sensitive to atmospheric particles smoke haze cloud etc and climatic factors air temperature humidity das et al 2021 thermal images are suggested to be acquired around midday or under sunny cloud free weather conditions pinter et al 1990 m√∂ller et al 2007 bhandari 2016 additionally in the development of the 3t model it is assumed that the reference canopy is considered part of the vegetation canopy and that they are under the same meteorological conditions qiu 1996 yan and qiu 2016 however the vegetation canopy becomes wet after rainfall whereas the imitation leaf remains dry both of these factors contribute to the poor performance of the proposed method on the cloudy and rainy days the reliability of three commonly used methods the priestley taylor penman and penman monteith equation over wetlands has also been tested during rainy fig 11 and clear days fig 12 the priestley taylor equation is probably the simplest method that requires a minimum number of meteorological observations and has been widely used to estimate wetland et souch et al 1996 1998 burba et al 1999 bidlake 2000 jacobs et al 2002 mao et al 2002 sun and song 2008 lenters et al 2011 hwang et al 2020 however many of the experimental values of the priestley taylor coefficient Œ± show a departure of 1 26 for example the Œ± value at our site is 0 95 for the rainy day and 0 76 for clear days this discrepancy has been reported to be caused by soil moisture conditions jacobs et al 2002 lenters et al 2011 and the biophysical characteristics of the surface surface resistance de bruin 1983 monteith 1995 burba et al 1999 yan et al 2020 therefore the priestley taylor equation requires site specific calibration before it can be successfully used to estimate of wetland et souch et al 1996 bidlake 2000 drexler et al 2004 brown et al 2010 the penman equation for open water has also been used for wetland et estimation and by including aerodynamic resistance the performance is improved marginally over the purely energy driven pt model with the suggested value of Œ± 1 26 fig 12 a and b however wetland et on clear days remains over predicted which is consistent with the reported results lafleur 1990 souch et al 1998 jacobs et al 2002 sun and song 2008 because the penman equation does not consider the effect of wetland vegetation it is used to estimate the evaporation rate from open water in our study and the penman monteith equation is used to estimate wetland et for further comparison as shown in fig 12 c the inclusion of the surface resistance considerably improves the performance with mape changing from 36 77 to 21 66 rmse changing from 0 21 to 0 13 mm h 1 and nse changing from 0 30 to 0 53 this improvement was most notable in periods with peak et rates these results suggest that surface resistance although very small is sufficient to reduce evapotranspiration rates at times of maximum energy availability and improve modelling performance souch et al 1998 burba et al 1999 bidlake 2000 jacobs et al 2002 however a potential difficulty with the penman monteith equation is the parameterization of heterogeneous vegetation and soil moisture conditions mohamed et al 2012 in summary as the model becomes more complicated its application would be of limited use due to large surface variability and lack of information on aerodynamic and surface resistances over the wetland in contrast the necessary input parameters for the proposed method are net radiation soil heat flux temperatures humidity and wind speed with no need for surface resistance or canopy characteristics therefore with its limited inputs and no calibration requirements the proposed method appears to be simple and applicable for separately estimating open water evaporation and wetland vegetation transpiration and high spatial and temporal resolution estimation of wetland et 4 2 model uncertainty numerous models are available for estimating wetland et and their uncertainty is directly related to differences in model structures and parameterization schemes jacobs et al 2002 drexler et al 2004 mohamed et al 2012 as shown figs 10 and 11 different model performances exist among the et values estimated from different models the same model with different parameterization schemes because the penman equation is commonly used for evaporation from open water based on site meteorological observations the uncertainty of the proposed combination approach depends on the input of the 3t model that is net radiation r n air temperature t a canopy surface temperature t c and reference canopy surface temperature t cp first every single uav observation lasted approximately 12 min and the mereological data were recorded every 10 min hence the inputs of the proposed method include instantaneous surface temperatures t c and t cp average net radiation and air temperature for the same period of each uav observation these observations at different time scales may lead to bias under non stationary conditions allen et al 1989 hupet and vanclooster 2001 as noted by das et al 2021 thermal sensors are sensitive to atmospheric particles smoke haze cloud and climatic factors air temperature humidity which may result in instantaneous surface temperatures under a temporary cloud shade lower than the average values for the observation period hwang et al 2020 second the three temperature terms in equation 3 described as the plant transpiration transfer coefficient are critical for estimating et and directly determining the model performance xiong and qiu 2011 as described in section 2 2 the measurement accuracy is 2 c for t c and t cp and 0 2 c for t a sensitivity analysis beven 1979 based on the data in figs 6 7 shows that an error of 2 c in t c or t cp will lead to a difference of approximately 0 08 mm h 1 between the et estimates and an error of 0 2 c in t a will lead to a difference of approximately 0 008 mm h 1 these results emphasize the importance of the accuracy of the tir measurements in addition both the canopy and reference canopy must be kept dry as the temperature differences between t c and t cp are caused by canopy transpiration otherwise such that the canopy is wetted by rainfall but the reference canopy is kept dry the transpiration rates calculated by the 3t model would lead to large uncertainty fig 7 a therefore to alleviate the influence of surface temperature uncertainty on et estimates from the 3t model the use of a new tir with higher accuracy or conducting tir measurements on clear days when the canopy surface is dry are suggested while during the rainy days as the combining method could lead to large uncertainty the constant reference evaporative fraction method may be suggested which assumes a constant ratio of the daily et to reference et allen et al 2007 third the methodology used to obtain the temperature of the reference dry vegetation canopy is crucial for applying the 3t model for ground or uav based measurements with a high resolution tir t cp can be directly measured from the imitation leaf qiu et al 2006 to alleviate the differences in albedo between the canopy and the reference canopy a dry color paper printed from colored plant leaves was used as the imitation leaf zhang et al 2020 despite the good performance of the imitation leaf in this study it would absorb water from the atmosphere with high humidity which requires further attention 4 3 the spatial variability of wetland et wetland et generally has high spatial resolution because wetland patches vary greatly with respect to surface vegetation characteristics water regimes and meteorological factors brown et al 2010 lafleur 2008 mykleby et al 2016 oberg and melesss 2006 however the patch scale variability in wetland et has not been well explored because of the limitation of coarse spatial temporal resolution of land surface characteristics hwang et al 2020 to overcome this challenge an advanced uav technology that combines the use of the 3t model penman equation and uav based tir was developed and applied to understand the spatial variability of evaporation transpiration and evapotranspiration from small wetland patches decimeter scale at a high temporal resolution hourly scale we found a large variation in vegetation transpiration rates ranging from 0 to 1 47 mm h 1 fig 10 this large variation can be attributed to the different microclimatic conditions and plant communities for example there are generally higher transpiration rates in the center of the valley sample line 2 due to favorable aerodynamic conditions and ample water supply fig 10 a and 10c higher transpiration rates were also found in the outlet of the lake fig 10 b and 10d where the dominant plant species are primarily shrubs e g salix linearistipularis while they are emergent macrophytes such as e fluvitalie e arvense at the inlet of the lake peng 2008 in addition as the travertine dam generally forms in the downstream portion of relatively deep lakes the outlet is flatter with shallower and slower water flow florsheim et al 2013 since the population of the dominant pant species and their species richness vary along gradients of water depth peng 2008 whitehead et al 1990 and wetlands experience seasonal or permanent flooding at different water depths complications of the spatial distribution of wetland et arise because of spatial variation due to microtopography variations in standing water level and water advection lafleur 2008 the proposed method is easy to replicate and therefore shows particular promise for characterizing variability in patch scale et due to spatial heterogeneity it is also worth mentioning that the proposed method which can separately estimate open water evaporation and vegetation transpiration provides a new way to compare wetland et and open water evaporation under the same conditions which is under debate lafleur 2008 mohamed et al 2012 s√°nchez carrillo et al 2004 in this study despite a large variation in vegetation transpiration rates fig 9 they are larger than the open water evaporation 0 67 mm h 1 the presence of wetland vegetation leads to larger et than open water evaporation under the same climatic conditions in jzg the wetland has experienced a notable persistent encroachment of tree and shrub species urgenson et al 2014 and the vegetation is expanding under the strict protection of the local administration this vegetation expansion appears to have caused an increase in the wetland et with a non significant increase in annual precipitation yan et al 2017 this alternation is likely to decrease the surface water availability defined as precipitation minus evapotranspiration and affect the local water landscape e g waterfall small color lakes these results have significant implications for total water consumption and water allocation to wetlands in local water and landscape management 5 conclusions this study proposes a simple and applicable method for estimating wetland et with a high spatial resolution by combining the 3t model uav tir remote sensing and the penman equation the results presented a good agreement with the measured et by the bowen ratio system with r2 of 0 93 mape of 7 90 rmse of 0 05 mm h 1 and nse of 0 93 during the entire study period and r2 of 0 97 mape of 4 60 rmse of 0 03 mm h 1 and nse of 0 97 during clear days compared with the priestley taylor equation penman equation and penman monteith equation the proposed method provides a better performance and enables a simple way to investigate the spatial variability of wetland et which ranges from 0 01 to 1 47 mm h 1 at 12 00 june 25 2020 the proposed method can separately estimate transpiration from wetland patches and evaporation from open water which can be used to quantify the effect of vegetation change on wetland et in jzg the existence of wetland vegetation led to an increase in et and a reduction of surface water availability for the local water landscape with its limited inputs and no calibration requirements the proposed method is concluded to be simple and to easily reveal the high temporal and spatial resolution characteristics of wetland et and its components therefore the proposed method has the potential for a wide range of

1711,extreme climate events may have a substantial impact on water conservation in the black soil region of china this study integrated a dynamic co2 input method and an alternative freeze thaw cycle function into soil and water assessment tool swat to create a swat black soil region swat bsr model the swat bsr model was used to simulate extreme climate events in the liao river basin lrb 220 000 km2 and an r script was developed to extract days in which extreme climate events occurred along with corresponding hydrological variables extreme climate events included extreme heat cold precipitation and drought events across seven zones in the lrb subsequently we explored the changes in single and integrated extreme climate events during the historical period 1971 2000 and future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios the results indicated that almost each hydrological variable was reduced under extreme cold and drought events compared to the normal conditions in the historical period canopy interception and percolation were decreased under extreme heat in the future periods while extreme cold was opposite with a pronounced negative impact on reference evapotranspiration and soil evaporation in contrast each hydrological variable under extreme precipitation increased relative to the normal conditions while hydrological variables were largely negatively affected under extreme drought in addition the integrated extreme climate index increased over time with more pronounced changes under the ssp5 8 5 scenario than those of ssp2 4 5 scenario hydrological variables were most at risk in the dryland zones as compared to partially irrigated and irrigated zones these findings indicated that more attention should be given to the impacts of extreme climate events on water losses from both historical and future perspectives it is also necessary to develop mitigation strategies for water conservation in the lrb based on the extreme climate events projected to occur in different zones and periods in the future keywords extreme climate events future climate change cmip6 swat bsr hydrological cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently one of the most important issues in climate change studies is the occurrence of extreme events chen et al 2020 gimeno et al 2022 vogel et al 2019 extreme climate phenomena can be divided into two main categories those based simple climate statistics such as extreme high or low temperatures or heavy precipitation events that occur every year and more complex event driven extremes such as droughts floods or hurricanes that do not necessarily occur every year at a given location easterling et al 2000 the third report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc clearly defined extreme climate events as those having a probability of occurrence of 10 or less at a given time and place ipcc 2001 in the ipcc s latest sixth assessment report a separate section entitled extreme weather events in climate change was added highlighting the importance of extreme weather events as a threat to global warming as the predominate concern of climate change seneviratne et al 2021 study has found that escalating global warming and human induced climate change has caused an increase in the intensity and frequency of daily temperature extremes and also contributed to a widespread intensification of daily extreme precipitation stott et al 2016 in addition extreme climate events could have a significant impact on crop yield phenological changes in plants social infrastructure and security economic conditions and other factors bell et al 2018 easterling et al 2000 hasegawa et al 2021 karl et al 1996 developed a composite extreme climate index that was further modified by gleason et al 2008 by extending its time scale and spatial coverage with 71 of the corn harvest area in china experiencing at least one compound extreme climate event studying compound extreme events is important for grain system resilience under climate change li et al 2022a the risk of compound hydrological drought and heat extremes has also been recently studied in a semi arid basin of china feng et al 2022 they showed that the frequency of compound extreme events increased significantly over time and that the largest contributing factor was attributed to temperature however most studies have focused only on the spatial and temporal variabilities of a single or compound extreme event and the effects of extreme events on factors such as hydrological variables at the watershed scale are lacking therefore predicting and understanding the watershed scale hydrologic impacts from single and composite extreme climate events could be crucial for developing disaster prevention and mitigation strategies for regional extreme hydro climatic events bai et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 as the most widely used hydrologic model the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been calibrated and validated for ecological and hydrological simulations land use conversion and climate change scenarios around the world liu et al 2021 tian et al 2020 however there are relatively few studies using swat for assessing hydrological impacts induced by extreme climate events tan et al 2020 summarized 111 relevant research articles using swat for hydroclimatic extreme events since 1999 and found that they can be categorized as extreme flow assessment droughts and floods swat coupled with other models and swat improvement studies thus it is evident that more swat simulation studies that focus on extreme climate events are needed since the advent of coupled model intercomparison projects cmip general circulation models gcms have been commonly used to assess the effects of future climate change and as the input data to swat chen et al 2022 recently the ipcc released the cmip6 shared socioeconomic pathways ssps which takes into account land use scenarios and new emissions under new features of social development compared to the representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios of cmip5 cmip6 has higher spatial resolution improved physical parameters wider simulation range better simulation performance and more reasonable results li et al 2021a tokarska et al 2020 the continuous degradation of black soil due to intensive conventional agricultural practices and the incremental increase in the risk of climate extremes pose a great threat to china s soil water and food security the black soil region of northeast china is at high latitudes and is prone to regional extreme cold events in a changing climate chen et al 2019 the resulting hypothermal cold damage is one of the major agrometeorological hazards that can exacerbate water scarcity and impact the local hydrological cycle simultaneously most of northeast china is dominated by dryland corn which makes it highly vulnerable to extreme drought and heat events caused by global warming li et al 2022b the liao river basin lrb 220 000 km2 is one of the most important basins in northeast china which is the corn belt of china and it accounts for approximately one fifth of the country s annual grain production therefore it is essential to explore the impacts of future climate extremes on hydrology and water conservation in the black soil area of the lrb and identify any potential risks for early warning however the current watershed scale swat model has several shortcomings for such studies for example the prominent freeze thaw phenomenon often occurs in seasonal permafrost areas in northeastern china where both daily and annual temperature differences are large freeze thaw alternations are evident and frost is extremely common thereby an enhanced representation of freeze thaw cycle is needed in the swat model for representative simulations of the lrb and similar regions in addition increased atmospheric co2 concentration is one of the main causes of climate change while the default swat model is unable to simulate incremental increases of co2 concentration within a single simulation period therefore alternative algorithms for both dynamic co2 input and more representative freeze thaw cycle function were developed and incorporated into swat for simulations of the lrb qi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 it is highly essential to incorporate these physical processes into watershed scale model and develop process based model that are suitable for the black soil region swat black soil region swat bsr such an effort is critical to effectively study the impact of climate change and optimize management strategies in the northeastern black soil region further identification of climate extremes in model simulation results and their corresponding spatial and temporal distributions of hydrological variables are also significant which can help develop basin adaptation and regulation strategies in advance the main objectives of this study were to 1 select four representative indices of extreme high air temperature extreme low air temperature extreme precipitation and extreme drought in the lrb 2 evaluate the influences of single extreme climate events on the hydrological cycle for the historical period of 1971 2000 and 2041 2070 2071 2100 periods under the ssp2 4 5 ssp45 and ssp5 8 5 ssp85 scenarios and 3 assess the impacts of integrated extreme climate events in the lrb on water conservation by weighting the four representative extreme climate indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lrb 38 43 44 30 n 117 47 125 06 e is situated in northern china s black soil area covering roughly 220 000 km2 fig 1 the primary agricultural crop in this watershed is corn which is harvested once annually the climate is classified as north temperate continental monsoon the average annual rainfall of the watershed was approximately 482 mm in the late 20th century and the interannual variability and spatial variability of precipitation is large with a maximum difference of approximately 609 mm between years and approximately 438 mm among different zones the average annual air temperature in the watershed is approximately 4 9 c and gradually decreases from south to north with a spatial variability of approximately 0 8 c for each latitude the annual average monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures occur most frequently in july and january respectively with extreme high temperatures reaching 37 43 c and extreme low temperatures below 30 c which is a critical zone for extreme temperature events furthermore the lrb experiences long term losses of water and soil and is characterized by low vegetation cover and large areas of dryland farming which are more ecologically fragile and prone to degradation from extreme precipitation and drought events he et al 2021 2 2 descriptions of the swat bsr model and hru selection 2 2 1 swat bsr model swat is a physics based hydrological model with major modules including weather generator wxgen hydrology water quality and plant growth neitsch et al 2011 fundamental components of the hydrological cycle including actual evapotranspiration et surface runoff and percolation are simulated by hydrologic balance equations in swat arnold et al 1998 associated water balance equations and hydrological terms relevant to this study are descried in the supplementary materials the swat model used in this study was optimized and modified to include a co2 dynamic input method the co2 concentrations obtained from ipcc and a physically based freeze thaw cycle function to establish a regional adaptation system for the black soil area of the lrb hereafter referred to as the swat black soil region swat bsr model qi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 the algorithm flow chart for the swat bsr is shown in fig 2 with enhanced representation the improved model allows for more accurate simulations of future climate change scenarios and is more conducive to risk assessment and early warning of negative impacts under future extreme climate events in the lrb 2 2 2 model setup and selection of representative hrus in the lrb in our previous study zhang et al 2023 simulations of both et and corn yield were of satisfactory consistency using a calibrated swat model the pbias and r2 for the simulated actual evapotranspiration during the evaluation period were 12 9 to 14 8 and 0 50 0 88 across seven zones respectively the calibration results for the corn yields showed that the pbias and rmse during the calibration period were 14 1 to 11 0 and 0 73 mg ha 1 2 46 mg ha 1 respectively the parameter sensitivity analysis selected calibrated values as well as model performance statistics for the seven zones in the lrb are detailed in the supplementary materials tables s1 s2 and s3 a detailed description of complete model setup and calibration procedures can be found in zhang et al 2023 due to the large number of subbasins 127 and hydrologic response units hrus 4863 in the lrb the volume of all output data on a daily basis was considerable additionally the lrb was divided into 7 zones according to natural flow distributions during model setup and calibration zhang et al 2023 in this study 7 subbasins nearest to meteorological stations were selected in each of the seven zones and 7 hrus with the largest area of corn planting were chosen among the subbasins the identification numbers and specific locations of each subbasin and hru are displayed in table 1 and fig 1 2 3 cmip6 future climate data and scenario design the historical period of 1971 2000 and two thirty year projection periods of 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 were used as the study periods with 1966 1970 and 2036 2040 used for the model warm up periods respectively the data for 22 gcms of cmip6 in this study were obtained from the world climate research program wcrp https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 table s4 due to the low spatial and temporal resolutions of the raw gcms from wcrp a weather generator based statistical downscaling method was used to generate the daily dataset for the lrb liu and zuo 2012 fig 1 the swat bsr simulations derived from the 22 gcms of cmip6 in the lrb during the historical period were evaluated by comparing four weather factors including precipitation solar radiation maximum air temperature tmax and minimum air temperature tmin using taylor diagrams and calculating taylor s skill score table 2 and fig 3 the taylor diagram is an effective method for model evaluation and examination taylor 2001 it allows for graphical illustration of the correlation coefficients and standard deviations of multiple variables as well as the root mean square deviations of reference values elucidating the relevant information for multiple gcms thus reflecting the simulation ability of multiple gcms comprehensively and clearly the equations of the statistical indicators to be calculated in the taylor diagram were as follows 1 œÉ r 1 n i 1 n r i r 2 2 œÉ f 1 n i 1 n f i f 2 3 r 1 n i 1 n r i r f i f œÉ r œÉ f 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n r i r f i f 2 5 s 4 1 r 2 œÉ f œÉ r œÉ r œÉ f 2 1 r 0 2 where n is the number of samples r is the observed data size f is the gcms simulation data size r and f are the mean values of the observed and simulated variables respectively œÉ r and œÉ f are the standard deviations of the observed and simulated variables respectively r is the correlation coefficient rmse is the root mean square error which reflects the dispersion between the observed and simulated values r 0 is the skill indicator taking the value of 0 999 and s is taylor s skill score the larger its value the better the simulation ability of the gcms the gcms with better performance among them were selected to assess the hydrological cycle in the lrb in response to future extreme climate events 2 4 extreme climate index 2 4 1 extreme climate index selection as a unified standard for climate change related research the world meteorological organization wmo and the wcrp jointly established the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi during the climate change monitoring conference 1998 2001 to define a set of extreme climate indices for global or regional studies of extreme climate change among them there are 27 key indices including 11 extreme precipitation indices and 16 extreme temperature indices calculated from daily precipitation and air temperature data table s5 the climate extremes index was first introduced in united states u s by karl et al 1996 who summarized the multidimensional climate change of annual air temperature precipitation and drought in china ren et al 2010 further extended the extreme climate index eci by defining the integrated eci ieci which consisted of 7 individual extreme climate indices synthesized from high air temperature low air temperature flood drought typhoon dust storm and strong wind table 3 temperatures flood and drought were weighted more than the other extreme climate events considering the weighting of ieci and the similarity of definitions among various sources of extreme climate indices we selected the tx90p days with daily tmax 90 quantile tn10p days with daily tmin 10 quantile r95p days with daily precipitation 95 quantile and cdd maximum consecutive days with daily precipitation 1 mm indices which were commonly used and had greater weights guo et al 2022 li et al 2021b for the lrb tx90p tn10p r95p and cdd represent the possible extreme climate events of extreme heat extreme cold extreme precipitation and extreme drought respectively table 3 2 4 2 extreme climate index extraction in this study we developed an r script for batch extraction of weather and hydrological variables from swat output hru files the extracted database was first split into summer june july and august and winter december january and february segments for tx90p and tn10p comparisons next we identified the days in which extreme weather occurred according to the tx90p tn10p r95p and cdd indices and extracted the climate data and hydrological variables based on each eci separately fig 4 we then calculated the values of hydrological variables using a 30 year time period finally the simulated results of the selected gcms at each future 30 year time period for each type of eci were combined into a separate csv file for further data analysis and graphical presentation fig 4 we also calculated the changes in hydrologic variables under extreme climate conditions as compared to normal conditions normal conditions were defined as those associated with the long term period 30 years that included the occurrence of extreme and non extreme climate events because extreme heat events occurred mainly in summer and extreme cold events occurred mainly in winter the summer months under the normal conditions were selected for comparison with extreme heat events the winter months under the normal conditions were selected for comparison with extreme cold events the corresponding hydrological variables were also extracted accordingly 2 4 3 integrated extreme climate index calculation the lrb is located in northeastern china and is generally less affected by events such as typhoons but more prone to droughts floods heat waves and periods of frost furthermore the severity of these events cannot be equally weighted in this study area as each has a different degree of impact on the hydrological system in order to reasonably integrate the impacts under various extreme events in the lrb this study assigned different weights to each extreme event with 0 3 for precipitation and drought extreme events and 0 2 for extreme heat and cold events ren et al 2010 we also normalized the data using the min max normalization method which mapped the data uniformly into the 1 1 interval to compare the annual trends of integrated extreme climate events the ieci in this study was calculated on an annual scale given as 6 ieci i 1 4 Œ¥ i e i 0 2 t x 90 p 0 2 t n 10 p 0 3 r 95 p 0 3 c d d 7 e x x x max x min where Œ¥ is the weight of each eci e is the normalization value of each eci x is the value of each eci the larger the value of ieci the occurrence of extreme events becomes more frequent and intense 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme climate events during the historical period in the liao river basin during the historical period 1971 2000 extreme heat events increased average annual reference evapotranspiration eto et and crop transpiration remarkably in the seven zones of the lrb fig 5 with negative effects on water yield and surface runoff decreased approximately 54 9 and 83 5 respectively although extreme heat increased soil evaporation no definite effects on canopy interception were found furthermore percolation decreased under extreme heat events in general except for some dryland zones considering that the lrb was situated in the northeastern region and characterized by frigid winters the freeze thaw module was added to swat bsr to assess the hydrological processes more accurately qi et al 2019 extreme cold events reduced average annual surface runoff soil evaporation et and eto by approximately 100 0 87 7 85 2 and 57 3 respectively also water yield and percolation decreased under extreme cold except for the dry5 and dry7 fig 5 extreme precipitation events reduced eto but exacerbated et reducing eto by an average of 25 4 in the seven zones but increased et by approximately 29 1 fig 5 crop transpiration in the seven zones differed considerably under extreme precipitation but decreased generally by approximately 17 3 soil evaporation decreased noticeably with an overall average decrease of 44 5 in the lrb except for an increase of 11 3 in the irr1 canopy interception showed an obvious increase in extreme precipitation additionally extreme precipitation generally increased water yield surface runoff and notably it had a very pronounced increase in the part4 dry5 and dry7 and a notable increase in percolation in the dry5 and dry7 study found that found that precipitation was associated with a greater probability of cloudy skies resulting in less solar radiation and lower temperatures wang et al 2017 this might be the main reason for the decrease in eto under extreme precipitation in this study interestingly unlike the eto et increased overall this was likely due to the increase in water volume during extreme precipitation events and ineffective water loss and this was very relevant to the results of increased soil evaporation and canopy interception projected in this study lawrence et al 2007 in general extreme drought had a considerable negative impact on hydrological factors in almost all zones of the lrb fig 5 compared to the extreme heat cold and precipitation the negative effects of extreme drought events were more severe resulting in the mean value of each hydrologic variable being reduced by more than 55 in the lrb during the historical period the direct causes of extreme droughts were the reduced precipitation and elevated temperatures furthermore the weakening of the summer monsoon in the northern area of china might also be an important reason for the increased frequency of drought phenomena zhang and shen 2019 in summary all four types of extreme events had obvious effects on the hydrological variables during the historical period for the lrb warranting further investigation into the effects of extreme climate events on the hydrological variables under different scenarios of future climate change to develop awareness and precautionary measures for any potential environmental risks 3 2 assessment of the impacts of extreme climate events in the future periods on the liao river basin 3 2 1 evaluation and selection of cmip6 gcms based on the observed values of precipitation solar radiation tmax and tmin of meteorological stations and 22 gcms from 1971 to 2000 the skill score s values were calculated and taylor diagrams were plotted to select the most appropriate gcms table 2 and fig 3 for precipitation the taylor diagram and s values identified 11 gcms bccc cnr2 cnr1 fgoa gfd2 inm2 mir1 mir2 mpi1 mpi2 and ukes with poor performance and were excluded in addition 9 gcms bccc cnr1 cnr2 inm1 ipsl mpi1 mpi2 mtie and ukes were eliminated for the simulations of solar radiation furthermore the simulations of tmax excluded 10 gcms acc1 cnr1 cnr2 cnr3 ece1 gfd2 inm1 ipsl mir1 and ukes and 10 more gcms acc1 bccc cnr1 ece1 ece2 fgoa gfd2 inm1 inm2 and ipsl were excluded from the simulations for the tmin combining the number of gcms exclusions and average s value scores greater than 0 3 for the four meteorological factors acc2 can1 can2 giss and mtie had better performance in simulating all four climatic factors of precipitation solar radiation tmax and tmin therefore these five gcms were selected for further analysis 3 2 2 exploration of changes in various hydrological factors under future extreme climate events using swat bsr in general the future impact of extreme heat was consistent with the performance of the historical period future extreme heat events had a positive effect on both eto and et with an average increase of approximately 16 7 and 8 5 for ssp45 respectively and 15 0 and 5 5 for the ssp85 scenarios respectively fig 6 in addition both crop transpiration and soil evaporation showed an overall increasing trend but the simulated values of gcms for soil evaporation differed considerably additionally water yield and surface runoff fluctuated widely under extreme heat but had negative effects over multiple zones from 2071 to 2100 canopy interception and percolation also showed primarily negative effects under extreme heat events fig 6 madakumbura et al 2019 found that the hydrological cycle was significantly enhanced for future global warming of 2 c and that intensification under extreme climates maybe 10 times stronger than the average intensification baker et al 2018 also found that elevated co2 concentrations led to increased temperature extremes and that achieving global mean temperature targets using a definite limit on co2 concentration would reduce the risk of high variability under extreme climate scenarios as mentioned previously the swat bsr model was equipped with a freeze thaw cycle function to better assess the effects of extreme cold on the hydrological cycle notably we did not analyze crop transpiration and canopy interception under extreme cold events this is due to the fact that crop transpiration and canopy interception during the non crop growing season in winter were null in this study basin in contrast to the effect of extreme heat there was a distinct negative effect of extreme cold on eto and soil evaporation fig 7 soil evaporation decreased by 44 6 and 43 5 on average for the two ssp scenarios in 2041 2070 44 1 and 36 4 in 2071 2100 respectively the effect of extreme cold on water yield was uncertain but was primarily negatively correlated also surface runoff under extreme cold was variable and negatively influenced for part4 dry5 and dry7 it was notable that the simulated variation among gcms of surface runoff in the dry7 from 2071 to 2100 under the ssp85 scenario was large with a distribution ranging from 100 0 to 315 2 the percolation under extreme cold tended to vary widely in the irr1 from 2041 to 2070 under the ssp45 scenario with large variability and uncertainty under different scenarios overall the future impact of extreme cold was consistent with the performance of the historical period fig 7 interestingly extreme cold may have a greater effect on certain hydrological variables than extreme heat jakob and walland 2016 daytime cloud cover may have a suppressive effect on the rise in maximum temperature by affecting solar radiation dai et al 1999 in addition factors such as vegetation cover geographic location and urbanization may also have an impact on temperature extremes and associated water cycle javanroodi and nik 2020 lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the number of days with extreme precipitation in the future periods were markedly less than the number of days with temperature extremes table 5 the number of days of extreme precipitation in the future periods varied widely among the seven zones most likely due to the geographical locations of the zones which occurred slightly less in the west with lower amount of annual precipitation than in others and occurred most in the east for the dry5 and dry7 table 5 extreme precipitation events had an apparent positive effect on eto et soil evaporation canopy interception water yield surface runoff and percolation fig 8 furthermore extreme precipitation had a clear positive effect on crop transpiration in the irr2 and dry6 but decreased in most of the zones by up to approximately 84 7 the effect of extreme precipitation on eto and soil evaporation was opposite to that of the historical period and the effect on other hydrological factors was roughly the same as the historical period fig 8 this might be due to the greater saturated vapor pressure due to global warming under future climate change which could cause water to evaporate from soils plants and water bodies and simultaneously enhance the demand for et by plants thus making extreme precipitation events more prone to occur yi et al 2015 dong et al 2022 also found that anthropogenic greenhouse gases mainly co2 were the main contributor to extreme precipitation events in the asian monsoon region the number of days of extreme drought varied considerably among the seven zones in the future periods for the lrb being more frequent in the middle and west regions having partially irrigated and irrigated zones and less frequent in dryland zones especially for the dry5 and dry7 table 5 jiang et al 2022 considered that increased co2 concentration in vegetation physiological processes could mitigate future drought events as such our co2 dynamic input algorithm could more accurately assess the impact of extreme drought events compared to the normal conditions eto was reduced primarily under extreme drought events but there was an increase in eto due to large simulated variability in gcms in the irr1 and part4 for 2071 2100 under the ssp45 scenario and in the irr1 and dry7 for 2041 2070 under the ssp85 scenario fig 9 et was decreased under all future extreme drought events averaging reductions of approximately 89 8 and 81 4 for 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively under the ssp45 scenario and slightly less under the ssp85 scenario with reductions of approximately 73 5 and 78 2 respectively since both crop transpiration and canopy interception were close to zero during extreme drought the effect of soil evaporation was similar to that of et extreme drought presented greater adverse effects on water yield surface runoff and percolation fig 9 in general the impact of future extreme drought events on the lrb hydrological factors was analogous to the historical period mainly showing a negative impact 3 3 appraisal of the impact of integrated extreme climate index in the liao river basin in the future periods 3 3 1 trends of the integrated extreme climate index integrated extreme events have become more frequent in various regions of the globe seneviratne et al 2021 predicting the changes in integrated climate extremes played an important role in protecting the future development of the lrb and the potential adoption of adaptation strategies the days of iecis showed a similar pattern during the historical period and the future periods the integrated extreme climate risk was greatest in the irr1 and the risk was smaller in the dryland zones than in the partially irrigated and irrigated zones tables 4 and 5 on a temporal scale the results showed that the iecis showed an overall increasing trend over time under the ssp45 and ssp85 scenarios and the change was more pronounced in the ssp85 scenario than the ssp45 scenario the comparison between the two 30 year periods revealed the largest increasing trend for 2071 2100 indicating that the lrb would be more threatened by compound extreme events in the late future on the spatial scale there were some differences in the iecis of different zones but the general iecis showed similar trends for the lrb fig 10 this could be due to the greater association between extreme precipitation extreme drought and irrigation conditions the differences among zones demonstrated the high spatial and temporal variabilities of future climate change shrestha et al 2021 the overall low values of the iecis might be due to that the integrated index did not use a weighted average of the individual indices but instead was the result of summing the standardized values of the individual indices annually negative values can be generated also extreme heat cold and extreme precipitation drought were paired opposite extreme events that might offset contribution of each to the iecis values to some extent 3 3 2 impact of the integrated extreme climate index on the hydrological cycle after normalizing the percent change between the integrated extreme climate events and the normal conditions for each hydrological variable the values of the seven zones of the lrb ranged from approximately 0 4 to 0 5 fig 11 the larger value of the normalized index indicated higher impact of the integrated extreme climate events on the hydrological variables and greater risk of occurrence of extreme hydrological events according to the heat map it can be clearly observed that the indices for dry7 were larger so the integrated extreme climate had the most significant effect on dry7 in addition the integrated extreme climate had a greater impact on the water yield in the irr2 under the ssp45 2071 2100 scenario the integrated extreme climate also had a greater effect on water yield in the part3 under the ssp45 2041 2070 and the ssp85 scenarios under the ssp85 2071 2100 scenario the integrated extreme climate had a greater effect on the eto in the dry5 as a whole the values under the ssp85 scenario were larger than those under the ssp45 scenario indicating that the integrated extreme climate under the ssp85 scenario had a greater impact on hydrological variables in general the effects of integrated extreme climate were particularly severe in certain zones as reflected in heat maps therefore different strategies should be implemented in different zones we could investigate the possible reasons for the peak of the indices and formulate corresponding mitigation measures based on the spatial and temporal changes of the iecis under different scenarios in the future considering the large growth trend of the iecis under the ssp85 scenario the lrb should strictly implement climate policies and targets in the future and continuously enhance the attention to climate change monier and gao 2015 however hydrological variables were not only influenced by climate change but also by human activities land use changes and so forth liu et al 2019 shrestha et al 2021 moreover although the selection of ecis and the setting of weights in this study were supported by the literature they were ultimately subjective when calculating the effect of integrated extreme climate on hydrologic variables there is an offsetting effect between the impacts of different extreme climate events that may not fully reflect the effect of integrated extreme climate it is an important topic to study the effects of integrated extreme climate more representatively and accurately in the future additionally the spatial inconsistency with the field boundaries according to the definition of hru might lead to some uncertainties femeena et al 2022 modeling results exhibited a degree of uncertainty in representing the real world hence this study focused on the predicted patterns and relative change rather than the accuracy of the estimates for these reasons readers should use caution when interpreting our findings for decisions in their regions 4 conclusions assessing the impacts of extreme events on hydrology and water resources is essential for understanding the potential risks and developing effective mitigation measures in a changing climate in this study the swat bsr model equipped with a dynamic co2 input option and alternative freeze thaw cycle was used to simulate the changes in hydrological variables under extreme heat extreme cold extreme precipitation extreme drought events and integrated extreme climate events in the lrb the simulation results showed that during the historical period extreme heat events exacerbated the loss of water resources extreme cold events mainly negatively affected hydrological variables despite the decrease in eto et increased under extreme precipitation events along with significant increases in water yield and surface runoff in some regions may raise the risk of disasters such as floods waterlogging etc almost all hydrologic variables decreased under extreme drought events indicating that the negative effects of extreme drought events were more severe in the future periods hydrological variables such as eto and et were largely increased under extreme heat however these hydrological variables were negatively affected more obviously and to a greater extent under extreme cold than extreme heat events the effects on eto and soil evaporation under future extreme precipitation were different from those in the historical period the negative impact on et under extreme drought was stronger under the ssp45 scenario than ssp85 in the future periods and these extreme events had a severe impact on water losses in addition this study calculated iecis under the integration of four extreme events and explored their effects on the lrb hydrological variables the results suggested that iecis were largest in the irr1 and the increasing trend was more pronounced in the 2071 2100 and ssp85 scenario furthermore although iecis were lowest in the dry7 the hydrological variables were found to be more at risk in the dry7 suggesting the need for enhanced adaptation strategies in this zone therefore the study on extreme climate events on hydrological variables has important implications for water conservation in the black soil region of the lrb the early warning of the risk of extreme climate events could assist to form better recommendations and strategies for agricultural adaptation management under future climatic changes credit authorship contribution statement yingqi zhang conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original draft

1711,extreme climate events may have a substantial impact on water conservation in the black soil region of china this study integrated a dynamic co2 input method and an alternative freeze thaw cycle function into soil and water assessment tool swat to create a swat black soil region swat bsr model the swat bsr model was used to simulate extreme climate events in the liao river basin lrb 220 000 km2 and an r script was developed to extract days in which extreme climate events occurred along with corresponding hydrological variables extreme climate events included extreme heat cold precipitation and drought events across seven zones in the lrb subsequently we explored the changes in single and integrated extreme climate events during the historical period 1971 2000 and future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios the results indicated that almost each hydrological variable was reduced under extreme cold and drought events compared to the normal conditions in the historical period canopy interception and percolation were decreased under extreme heat in the future periods while extreme cold was opposite with a pronounced negative impact on reference evapotranspiration and soil evaporation in contrast each hydrological variable under extreme precipitation increased relative to the normal conditions while hydrological variables were largely negatively affected under extreme drought in addition the integrated extreme climate index increased over time with more pronounced changes under the ssp5 8 5 scenario than those of ssp2 4 5 scenario hydrological variables were most at risk in the dryland zones as compared to partially irrigated and irrigated zones these findings indicated that more attention should be given to the impacts of extreme climate events on water losses from both historical and future perspectives it is also necessary to develop mitigation strategies for water conservation in the lrb based on the extreme climate events projected to occur in different zones and periods in the future keywords extreme climate events future climate change cmip6 swat bsr hydrological cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently one of the most important issues in climate change studies is the occurrence of extreme events chen et al 2020 gimeno et al 2022 vogel et al 2019 extreme climate phenomena can be divided into two main categories those based simple climate statistics such as extreme high or low temperatures or heavy precipitation events that occur every year and more complex event driven extremes such as droughts floods or hurricanes that do not necessarily occur every year at a given location easterling et al 2000 the third report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc clearly defined extreme climate events as those having a probability of occurrence of 10 or less at a given time and place ipcc 2001 in the ipcc s latest sixth assessment report a separate section entitled extreme weather events in climate change was added highlighting the importance of extreme weather events as a threat to global warming as the predominate concern of climate change seneviratne et al 2021 study has found that escalating global warming and human induced climate change has caused an increase in the intensity and frequency of daily temperature extremes and also contributed to a widespread intensification of daily extreme precipitation stott et al 2016 in addition extreme climate events could have a significant impact on crop yield phenological changes in plants social infrastructure and security economic conditions and other factors bell et al 2018 easterling et al 2000 hasegawa et al 2021 karl et al 1996 developed a composite extreme climate index that was further modified by gleason et al 2008 by extending its time scale and spatial coverage with 71 of the corn harvest area in china experiencing at least one compound extreme climate event studying compound extreme events is important for grain system resilience under climate change li et al 2022a the risk of compound hydrological drought and heat extremes has also been recently studied in a semi arid basin of china feng et al 2022 they showed that the frequency of compound extreme events increased significantly over time and that the largest contributing factor was attributed to temperature however most studies have focused only on the spatial and temporal variabilities of a single or compound extreme event and the effects of extreme events on factors such as hydrological variables at the watershed scale are lacking therefore predicting and understanding the watershed scale hydrologic impacts from single and composite extreme climate events could be crucial for developing disaster prevention and mitigation strategies for regional extreme hydro climatic events bai et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 as the most widely used hydrologic model the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been calibrated and validated for ecological and hydrological simulations land use conversion and climate change scenarios around the world liu et al 2021 tian et al 2020 however there are relatively few studies using swat for assessing hydrological impacts induced by extreme climate events tan et al 2020 summarized 111 relevant research articles using swat for hydroclimatic extreme events since 1999 and found that they can be categorized as extreme flow assessment droughts and floods swat coupled with other models and swat improvement studies thus it is evident that more swat simulation studies that focus on extreme climate events are needed since the advent of coupled model intercomparison projects cmip general circulation models gcms have been commonly used to assess the effects of future climate change and as the input data to swat chen et al 2022 recently the ipcc released the cmip6 shared socioeconomic pathways ssps which takes into account land use scenarios and new emissions under new features of social development compared to the representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios of cmip5 cmip6 has higher spatial resolution improved physical parameters wider simulation range better simulation performance and more reasonable results li et al 2021a tokarska et al 2020 the continuous degradation of black soil due to intensive conventional agricultural practices and the incremental increase in the risk of climate extremes pose a great threat to china s soil water and food security the black soil region of northeast china is at high latitudes and is prone to regional extreme cold events in a changing climate chen et al 2019 the resulting hypothermal cold damage is one of the major agrometeorological hazards that can exacerbate water scarcity and impact the local hydrological cycle simultaneously most of northeast china is dominated by dryland corn which makes it highly vulnerable to extreme drought and heat events caused by global warming li et al 2022b the liao river basin lrb 220 000 km2 is one of the most important basins in northeast china which is the corn belt of china and it accounts for approximately one fifth of the country s annual grain production therefore it is essential to explore the impacts of future climate extremes on hydrology and water conservation in the black soil area of the lrb and identify any potential risks for early warning however the current watershed scale swat model has several shortcomings for such studies for example the prominent freeze thaw phenomenon often occurs in seasonal permafrost areas in northeastern china where both daily and annual temperature differences are large freeze thaw alternations are evident and frost is extremely common thereby an enhanced representation of freeze thaw cycle is needed in the swat model for representative simulations of the lrb and similar regions in addition increased atmospheric co2 concentration is one of the main causes of climate change while the default swat model is unable to simulate incremental increases of co2 concentration within a single simulation period therefore alternative algorithms for both dynamic co2 input and more representative freeze thaw cycle function were developed and incorporated into swat for simulations of the lrb qi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 it is highly essential to incorporate these physical processes into watershed scale model and develop process based model that are suitable for the black soil region swat black soil region swat bsr such an effort is critical to effectively study the impact of climate change and optimize management strategies in the northeastern black soil region further identification of climate extremes in model simulation results and their corresponding spatial and temporal distributions of hydrological variables are also significant which can help develop basin adaptation and regulation strategies in advance the main objectives of this study were to 1 select four representative indices of extreme high air temperature extreme low air temperature extreme precipitation and extreme drought in the lrb 2 evaluate the influences of single extreme climate events on the hydrological cycle for the historical period of 1971 2000 and 2041 2070 2071 2100 periods under the ssp2 4 5 ssp45 and ssp5 8 5 ssp85 scenarios and 3 assess the impacts of integrated extreme climate events in the lrb on water conservation by weighting the four representative extreme climate indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lrb 38 43 44 30 n 117 47 125 06 e is situated in northern china s black soil area covering roughly 220 000 km2 fig 1 the primary agricultural crop in this watershed is corn which is harvested once annually the climate is classified as north temperate continental monsoon the average annual rainfall of the watershed was approximately 482 mm in the late 20th century and the interannual variability and spatial variability of precipitation is large with a maximum difference of approximately 609 mm between years and approximately 438 mm among different zones the average annual air temperature in the watershed is approximately 4 9 c and gradually decreases from south to north with a spatial variability of approximately 0 8 c for each latitude the annual average monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures occur most frequently in july and january respectively with extreme high temperatures reaching 37 43 c and extreme low temperatures below 30 c which is a critical zone for extreme temperature events furthermore the lrb experiences long term losses of water and soil and is characterized by low vegetation cover and large areas of dryland farming which are more ecologically fragile and prone to degradation from extreme precipitation and drought events he et al 2021 2 2 descriptions of the swat bsr model and hru selection 2 2 1 swat bsr model swat is a physics based hydrological model with major modules including weather generator wxgen hydrology water quality and plant growth neitsch et al 2011 fundamental components of the hydrological cycle including actual evapotranspiration et surface runoff and percolation are simulated by hydrologic balance equations in swat arnold et al 1998 associated water balance equations and hydrological terms relevant to this study are descried in the supplementary materials the swat model used in this study was optimized and modified to include a co2 dynamic input method the co2 concentrations obtained from ipcc and a physically based freeze thaw cycle function to establish a regional adaptation system for the black soil area of the lrb hereafter referred to as the swat black soil region swat bsr model qi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 the algorithm flow chart for the swat bsr is shown in fig 2 with enhanced representation the improved model allows for more accurate simulations of future climate change scenarios and is more conducive to risk assessment and early warning of negative impacts under future extreme climate events in the lrb 2 2 2 model setup and selection of representative hrus in the lrb in our previous study zhang et al 2023 simulations of both et and corn yield were of satisfactory consistency using a calibrated swat model the pbias and r2 for the simulated actual evapotranspiration during the evaluation period were 12 9 to 14 8 and 0 50 0 88 across seven zones respectively the calibration results for the corn yields showed that the pbias and rmse during the calibration period were 14 1 to 11 0 and 0 73 mg ha 1 2 46 mg ha 1 respectively the parameter sensitivity analysis selected calibrated values as well as model performance statistics for the seven zones in the lrb are detailed in the supplementary materials tables s1 s2 and s3 a detailed description of complete model setup and calibration procedures can be found in zhang et al 2023 due to the large number of subbasins 127 and hydrologic response units hrus 4863 in the lrb the volume of all output data on a daily basis was considerable additionally the lrb was divided into 7 zones according to natural flow distributions during model setup and calibration zhang et al 2023 in this study 7 subbasins nearest to meteorological stations were selected in each of the seven zones and 7 hrus with the largest area of corn planting were chosen among the subbasins the identification numbers and specific locations of each subbasin and hru are displayed in table 1 and fig 1 2 3 cmip6 future climate data and scenario design the historical period of 1971 2000 and two thirty year projection periods of 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 were used as the study periods with 1966 1970 and 2036 2040 used for the model warm up periods respectively the data for 22 gcms of cmip6 in this study were obtained from the world climate research program wcrp https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 table s4 due to the low spatial and temporal resolutions of the raw gcms from wcrp a weather generator based statistical downscaling method was used to generate the daily dataset for the lrb liu and zuo 2012 fig 1 the swat bsr simulations derived from the 22 gcms of cmip6 in the lrb during the historical period were evaluated by comparing four weather factors including precipitation solar radiation maximum air temperature tmax and minimum air temperature tmin using taylor diagrams and calculating taylor s skill score table 2 and fig 3 the taylor diagram is an effective method for model evaluation and examination taylor 2001 it allows for graphical illustration of the correlation coefficients and standard deviations of multiple variables as well as the root mean square deviations of reference values elucidating the relevant information for multiple gcms thus reflecting the simulation ability of multiple gcms comprehensively and clearly the equations of the statistical indicators to be calculated in the taylor diagram were as follows 1 œÉ r 1 n i 1 n r i r 2 2 œÉ f 1 n i 1 n f i f 2 3 r 1 n i 1 n r i r f i f œÉ r œÉ f 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n r i r f i f 2 5 s 4 1 r 2 œÉ f œÉ r œÉ r œÉ f 2 1 r 0 2 where n is the number of samples r is the observed data size f is the gcms simulation data size r and f are the mean values of the observed and simulated variables respectively œÉ r and œÉ f are the standard deviations of the observed and simulated variables respectively r is the correlation coefficient rmse is the root mean square error which reflects the dispersion between the observed and simulated values r 0 is the skill indicator taking the value of 0 999 and s is taylor s skill score the larger its value the better the simulation ability of the gcms the gcms with better performance among them were selected to assess the hydrological cycle in the lrb in response to future extreme climate events 2 4 extreme climate index 2 4 1 extreme climate index selection as a unified standard for climate change related research the world meteorological organization wmo and the wcrp jointly established the expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi during the climate change monitoring conference 1998 2001 to define a set of extreme climate indices for global or regional studies of extreme climate change among them there are 27 key indices including 11 extreme precipitation indices and 16 extreme temperature indices calculated from daily precipitation and air temperature data table s5 the climate extremes index was first introduced in united states u s by karl et al 1996 who summarized the multidimensional climate change of annual air temperature precipitation and drought in china ren et al 2010 further extended the extreme climate index eci by defining the integrated eci ieci which consisted of 7 individual extreme climate indices synthesized from high air temperature low air temperature flood drought typhoon dust storm and strong wind table 3 temperatures flood and drought were weighted more than the other extreme climate events considering the weighting of ieci and the similarity of definitions among various sources of extreme climate indices we selected the tx90p days with daily tmax 90 quantile tn10p days with daily tmin 10 quantile r95p days with daily precipitation 95 quantile and cdd maximum consecutive days with daily precipitation 1 mm indices which were commonly used and had greater weights guo et al 2022 li et al 2021b for the lrb tx90p tn10p r95p and cdd represent the possible extreme climate events of extreme heat extreme cold extreme precipitation and extreme drought respectively table 3 2 4 2 extreme climate index extraction in this study we developed an r script for batch extraction of weather and hydrological variables from swat output hru files the extracted database was first split into summer june july and august and winter december january and february segments for tx90p and tn10p comparisons next we identified the days in which extreme weather occurred according to the tx90p tn10p r95p and cdd indices and extracted the climate data and hydrological variables based on each eci separately fig 4 we then calculated the values of hydrological variables using a 30 year time period finally the simulated results of the selected gcms at each future 30 year time period for each type of eci were combined into a separate csv file for further data analysis and graphical presentation fig 4 we also calculated the changes in hydrologic variables under extreme climate conditions as compared to normal conditions normal conditions were defined as those associated with the long term period 30 years that included the occurrence of extreme and non extreme climate events because extreme heat events occurred mainly in summer and extreme cold events occurred mainly in winter the summer months under the normal conditions were selected for comparison with extreme heat events the winter months under the normal conditions were selected for comparison with extreme cold events the corresponding hydrological variables were also extracted accordingly 2 4 3 integrated extreme climate index calculation the lrb is located in northeastern china and is generally less affected by events such as typhoons but more prone to droughts floods heat waves and periods of frost furthermore the severity of these events cannot be equally weighted in this study area as each has a different degree of impact on the hydrological system in order to reasonably integrate the impacts under various extreme events in the lrb this study assigned different weights to each extreme event with 0 3 for precipitation and drought extreme events and 0 2 for extreme heat and cold events ren et al 2010 we also normalized the data using the min max normalization method which mapped the data uniformly into the 1 1 interval to compare the annual trends of integrated extreme climate events the ieci in this study was calculated on an annual scale given as 6 ieci i 1 4 Œ¥ i e i 0 2 t x 90 p 0 2 t n 10 p 0 3 r 95 p 0 3 c d d 7 e x x x max x min where Œ¥ is the weight of each eci e is the normalization value of each eci x is the value of each eci the larger the value of ieci the occurrence of extreme events becomes more frequent and intense 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme climate events during the historical period in the liao river basin during the historical period 1971 2000 extreme heat events increased average annual reference evapotranspiration eto et and crop transpiration remarkably in the seven zones of the lrb fig 5 with negative effects on water yield and surface runoff decreased approximately 54 9 and 83 5 respectively although extreme heat increased soil evaporation no definite effects on canopy interception were found furthermore percolation decreased under extreme heat events in general except for some dryland zones considering that the lrb was situated in the northeastern region and characterized by frigid winters the freeze thaw module was added to swat bsr to assess the hydrological processes more accurately qi et al 2019 extreme cold events reduced average annual surface runoff soil evaporation et and eto by approximately 100 0 87 7 85 2 and 57 3 respectively also water yield and percolation decreased under extreme cold except for the dry5 and dry7 fig 5 extreme precipitation events reduced eto but exacerbated et reducing eto by an average of 25 4 in the seven zones but increased et by approximately 29 1 fig 5 crop transpiration in the seven zones differed considerably under extreme precipitation but decreased generally by approximately 17 3 soil evaporation decreased noticeably with an overall average decrease of 44 5 in the lrb except for an increase of 11 3 in the irr1 canopy interception showed an obvious increase in extreme precipitation additionally extreme precipitation generally increased water yield surface runoff and notably it had a very pronounced increase in the part4 dry5 and dry7 and a notable increase in percolation in the dry5 and dry7 study found that found that precipitation was associated with a greater probability of cloudy skies resulting in less solar radiation and lower temperatures wang et al 2017 this might be the main reason for the decrease in eto under extreme precipitation in this study interestingly unlike the eto et increased overall this was likely due to the increase in water volume during extreme precipitation events and ineffective water loss and this was very relevant to the results of increased soil evaporation and canopy interception projected in this study lawrence et al 2007 in general extreme drought had a considerable negative impact on hydrological factors in almost all zones of the lrb fig 5 compared to the extreme heat cold and precipitation the negative effects of extreme drought events were more severe resulting in the mean value of each hydrologic variable being reduced by more than 55 in the lrb during the historical period the direct causes of extreme droughts were the reduced precipitation and elevated temperatures furthermore the weakening of the summer monsoon in the northern area of china might also be an important reason for the increased frequency of drought phenomena zhang and shen 2019 in summary all four types of extreme events had obvious effects on the hydrological variables during the historical period for the lrb warranting further investigation into the effects of extreme climate events on the hydrological variables under different scenarios of future climate change to develop awareness and precautionary measures for any potential environmental risks 3 2 assessment of the impacts of extreme climate events in the future periods on the liao river basin 3 2 1 evaluation and selection of cmip6 gcms based on the observed values of precipitation solar radiation tmax and tmin of meteorological stations and 22 gcms from 1971 to 2000 the skill score s values were calculated and taylor diagrams were plotted to select the most appropriate gcms table 2 and fig 3 for precipitation the taylor diagram and s values identified 11 gcms bccc cnr2 cnr1 fgoa gfd2 inm2 mir1 mir2 mpi1 mpi2 and ukes with poor performance and were excluded in addition 9 gcms bccc cnr1 cnr2 inm1 ipsl mpi1 mpi2 mtie and ukes were eliminated for the simulations of solar radiation furthermore the simulations of tmax excluded 10 gcms acc1 cnr1 cnr2 cnr3 ece1 gfd2 inm1 ipsl mir1 and ukes and 10 more gcms acc1 bccc cnr1 ece1 ece2 fgoa gfd2 inm1 inm2 and ipsl were excluded from the simulations for the tmin combining the number of gcms exclusions and average s value scores greater than 0 3 for the four meteorological factors acc2 can1 can2 giss and mtie had better performance in simulating all four climatic factors of precipitation solar radiation tmax and tmin therefore these five gcms were selected for further analysis 3 2 2 exploration of changes in various hydrological factors under future extreme climate events using swat bsr in general the future impact of extreme heat was consistent with the performance of the historical period future extreme heat events had a positive effect on both eto and et with an average increase of approximately 16 7 and 8 5 for ssp45 respectively and 15 0 and 5 5 for the ssp85 scenarios respectively fig 6 in addition both crop transpiration and soil evaporation showed an overall increasing trend but the simulated values of gcms for soil evaporation differed considerably additionally water yield and surface runoff fluctuated widely under extreme heat but had negative effects over multiple zones from 2071 to 2100 canopy interception and percolation also showed primarily negative effects under extreme heat events fig 6 madakumbura et al 2019 found that the hydrological cycle was significantly enhanced for future global warming of 2 c and that intensification under extreme climates maybe 10 times stronger than the average intensification baker et al 2018 also found that elevated co2 concentrations led to increased temperature extremes and that achieving global mean temperature targets using a definite limit on co2 concentration would reduce the risk of high variability under extreme climate scenarios as mentioned previously the swat bsr model was equipped with a freeze thaw cycle function to better assess the effects of extreme cold on the hydrological cycle notably we did not analyze crop transpiration and canopy interception under extreme cold events this is due to the fact that crop transpiration and canopy interception during the non crop growing season in winter were null in this study basin in contrast to the effect of extreme heat there was a distinct negative effect of extreme cold on eto and soil evaporation fig 7 soil evaporation decreased by 44 6 and 43 5 on average for the two ssp scenarios in 2041 2070 44 1 and 36 4 in 2071 2100 respectively the effect of extreme cold on water yield was uncertain but was primarily negatively correlated also surface runoff under extreme cold was variable and negatively influenced for part4 dry5 and dry7 it was notable that the simulated variation among gcms of surface runoff in the dry7 from 2071 to 2100 under the ssp85 scenario was large with a distribution ranging from 100 0 to 315 2 the percolation under extreme cold tended to vary widely in the irr1 from 2041 to 2070 under the ssp45 scenario with large variability and uncertainty under different scenarios overall the future impact of extreme cold was consistent with the performance of the historical period fig 7 interestingly extreme cold may have a greater effect on certain hydrological variables than extreme heat jakob and walland 2016 daytime cloud cover may have a suppressive effect on the rise in maximum temperature by affecting solar radiation dai et al 1999 in addition factors such as vegetation cover geographic location and urbanization may also have an impact on temperature extremes and associated water cycle javanroodi and nik 2020 lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the number of days with extreme precipitation in the future periods were markedly less than the number of days with temperature extremes table 5 the number of days of extreme precipitation in the future periods varied widely among the seven zones most likely due to the geographical locations of the zones which occurred slightly less in the west with lower amount of annual precipitation than in others and occurred most in the east for the dry5 and dry7 table 5 extreme precipitation events had an apparent positive effect on eto et soil evaporation canopy interception water yield surface runoff and percolation fig 8 furthermore extreme precipitation had a clear positive effect on crop transpiration in the irr2 and dry6 but decreased in most of the zones by up to approximately 84 7 the effect of extreme precipitation on eto and soil evaporation was opposite to that of the historical period and the effect on other hydrological factors was roughly the same as the historical period fig 8 this might be due to the greater saturated vapor pressure due to global warming under future climate change which could cause water to evaporate from soils plants and water bodies and simultaneously enhance the demand for et by plants thus making extreme precipitation events more prone to occur yi et al 2015 dong et al 2022 also found that anthropogenic greenhouse gases mainly co2 were the main contributor to extreme precipitation events in the asian monsoon region the number of days of extreme drought varied considerably among the seven zones in the future periods for the lrb being more frequent in the middle and west regions having partially irrigated and irrigated zones and less frequent in dryland zones especially for the dry5 and dry7 table 5 jiang et al 2022 considered that increased co2 concentration in vegetation physiological processes could mitigate future drought events as such our co2 dynamic input algorithm could more accurately assess the impact of extreme drought events compared to the normal conditions eto was reduced primarily under extreme drought events but there was an increase in eto due to large simulated variability in gcms in the irr1 and part4 for 2071 2100 under the ssp45 scenario and in the irr1 and dry7 for 2041 2070 under the ssp85 scenario fig 9 et was decreased under all future extreme drought events averaging reductions of approximately 89 8 and 81 4 for 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively under the ssp45 scenario and slightly less under the ssp85 scenario with reductions of approximately 73 5 and 78 2 respectively since both crop transpiration and canopy interception were close to zero during extreme drought the effect of soil evaporation was similar to that of et extreme drought presented greater adverse effects on water yield surface runoff and percolation fig 9 in general the impact of future extreme drought events on the lrb hydrological factors was analogous to the historical period mainly showing a negative impact 3 3 appraisal of the impact of integrated extreme climate index in the liao river basin in the future periods 3 3 1 trends of the integrated extreme climate index integrated extreme events have become more frequent in various regions of the globe seneviratne et al 2021 predicting the changes in integrated climate extremes played an important role in protecting the future development of the lrb and the potential adoption of adaptation strategies the days of iecis showed a similar pattern during the historical period and the future periods the integrated extreme climate risk was greatest in the irr1 and the risk was smaller in the dryland zones than in the partially irrigated and irrigated zones tables 4 and 5 on a temporal scale the results showed that the iecis showed an overall increasing trend over time under the ssp45 and ssp85 scenarios and the change was more pronounced in the ssp85 scenario than the ssp45 scenario the comparison between the two 30 year periods revealed the largest increasing trend for 2071 2100 indicating that the lrb would be more threatened by compound extreme events in the late future on the spatial scale there were some differences in the iecis of different zones but the general iecis showed similar trends for the lrb fig 10 this could be due to the greater association between extreme precipitation extreme drought and irrigation conditions the differences among zones demonstrated the high spatial and temporal variabilities of future climate change shrestha et al 2021 the overall low values of the iecis might be due to that the integrated index did not use a weighted average of the individual indices but instead was the result of summing the standardized values of the individual indices annually negative values can be generated also extreme heat cold and extreme precipitation drought were paired opposite extreme events that might offset contribution of each to the iecis values to some extent 3 3 2 impact of the integrated extreme climate index on the hydrological cycle after normalizing the percent change between the integrated extreme climate events and the normal conditions for each hydrological variable the values of the seven zones of the lrb ranged from approximately 0 4 to 0 5 fig 11 the larger value of the normalized index indicated higher impact of the integrated extreme climate events on the hydrological variables and greater risk of occurrence of extreme hydrological events according to the heat map it can be clearly observed that the indices for dry7 were larger so the integrated extreme climate had the most significant effect on dry7 in addition the integrated extreme climate had a greater impact on the water yield in the irr2 under the ssp45 2071 2100 scenario the integrated extreme climate also had a greater effect on water yield in the part3 under the ssp45 2041 2070 and the ssp85 scenarios under the ssp85 2071 2100 scenario the integrated extreme climate had a greater effect on the eto in the dry5 as a whole the values under the ssp85 scenario were larger than those under the ssp45 scenario indicating that the integrated extreme climate under the ssp85 scenario had a greater impact on hydrological variables in general the effects of integrated extreme climate were particularly severe in certain zones as reflected in heat maps therefore different strategies should be implemented in different zones we could investigate the possible reasons for the peak of the indices and formulate corresponding mitigation measures based on the spatial and temporal changes of the iecis under different scenarios in the future considering the large growth trend of the iecis under the ssp85 scenario the lrb should strictly implement climate policies and targets in the future and continuously enhance the attention to climate change monier and gao 2015 however hydrological variables were not only influenced by climate change but also by human activities land use changes and so forth liu et al 2019 shrestha et al 2021 moreover although the selection of ecis and the setting of weights in this study were supported by the literature they were ultimately subjective when calculating the effect of integrated extreme climate on hydrologic variables there is an offsetting effect between the impacts of different extreme climate events that may not fully reflect the effect of integrated extreme climate it is an important topic to study the effects of integrated extreme climate more representatively and accurately in the future additionally the spatial inconsistency with the field boundaries according to the definition of hru might lead to some uncertainties femeena et al 2022 modeling results exhibited a degree of uncertainty in representing the real world hence this study focused on the predicted patterns and relative change rather than the accuracy of the estimates for these reasons readers should use caution when interpreting our findings for decisions in their regions 4 conclusions assessing the impacts of extreme events on hydrology and water resources is essential for understanding the potential risks and developing effective mitigation measures in a changing climate in this study the swat bsr model equipped with a dynamic co2 input option and alternative freeze thaw cycle was used to simulate the changes in hydrological variables under extreme heat extreme cold extreme precipitation extreme drought events and integrated extreme climate events in the lrb the simulation results showed that during the historical period extreme heat events exacerbated the loss of water resources extreme cold events mainly negatively affected hydrological variables despite the decrease in eto et increased under extreme precipitation events along with significant increases in water yield and surface runoff in some regions may raise the risk of disasters such as floods waterlogging etc almost all hydrologic variables decreased under extreme drought events indicating that the negative effects of extreme drought events were more severe in the future periods hydrological variables such as eto and et were largely increased under extreme heat however these hydrological variables were negatively affected more obviously and to a greater extent under extreme cold than extreme heat events the effects on eto and soil evaporation under future extreme precipitation were different from those in the historical period the negative impact on et under extreme drought was stronger under the ssp45 scenario than ssp85 in the future periods and these extreme events had a severe impact on water losses in addition this study calculated iecis under the integration of four extreme events and explored their effects on the lrb hydrological variables the results suggested that iecis were largest in the irr1 and the increasing trend was more pronounced in the 2071 2100 and ssp85 scenario furthermore although iecis were lowest in the dry7 the hydrological variables were found to be more at risk in the dry7 suggesting the need for enhanced adaptation strategies in this zone therefore the study on extreme climate events on hydrological variables has important implications for water conservation in the black soil region of the lrb the early warning of the risk of extreme climate events could assist to form better recommendations and strategies for agricultural adaptation management under future climatic changes credit authorship contribution statement yingqi zhang conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original draft

1712,different points in a field can be wetted with different natural or artificial rainfall amounts and intensities therefore a non uniform soil wetting could occur during short term monitoring of soil hydrodynamic parameters and its global effect on soil characterization is not easily predictable for an initially dry loam soil a sequence of three beerkan infiltration runs was performed at fixed sampling points in a period of two weeks immediately after the first beerkan run the soil was perturbed by adding an additional water volume differing with the sampling point by the amount of water 0 100 or 227 mm and the application methodology rainfall simulation another beerkan run as compared with the initial conditions the soil infiltration parameters mean initial and final infiltration rates constant of the horton s infiltration model decreased by 2 9 4 3 times after wetting a decrease of these parameters by 1 6 2 3 times remained detectable at the end of the sampling period even if the soil likely returned to wetness conditions close to the initial ones relative variability decreased too coefficients of variation 52 135 depending on the parameter for the initial runs and 36 95 for the final ones nevertheless a link was recognized between the infiltration parameters determined in the subsequent runs of the sequence the correlation was stronger when the initial runs were compared with the last runs coefficients of determination r 2 0 104 0 749 depending on the parameter r 0 at p 0 05 in all cases than with those performed immediately after the intermediate wetting r 2 varying from a non significant value of 0 059 to significant 0 196 0 211 values the hydrodynamic response of a disturbed soil appears overall related to that of the initially undisturbed soil even if the disturbing agent is not exactly the same over the sampled area performing other investigations by characterizing the antecedent soil conditions in more detail could help to improve interpretation and modelling of hydrological processes by a more realistic description of temporal variability of soil infiltration parameters keywords soil water infiltration soil disturbance beerkan infiltration runs hydrodynamic properties temporal variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil hydrodynamic properties can change also appreciably as a consequence of soil wetting and drying e g mapa et al 1986 das et al 2006 jabro 1996 the mechanisms by which wetting modifies the soil include slaking swelling weakening of interparticle bonds and breakdown by raindrop impact these mechanisms differ by the types of forces involved the soil properties influencing the mechanism the resulting fragments and the disaggregation intensity e g messing and jarvis 1990 le bissonnais 1996 soil recovery processes can occur after wetting lozano baez et al 2019 bagarello et al 2020 caltabellotta et al 2022 but a soil structure similarity between the pre wetting and post drying stages could not always occur since it depends on the type of soil alteration induced by wetting for example this similarity could be expected if soil shrinks after swelling due to the reversible nature of this process instead if wetting weakens interparticle bonds and water infiltration determines migration of detached soil particles then a dry soil after wetting will probably differ to some extent from the same dry soil before wetting therefore temporal variability of soil properties has to be determined even at short time intervals for example to properly parameterize physically based hydrological models reynolds et al 2000 assouline and mualem 2002 ndiaye et al 2005 an unexpected hydrological forcing such as a heavy and isolated rainstorm can occur during a short sampling period caltabellotta et al 2022 various points of the wetted area could receive different rainfall amounts and also in different manners since for example a rainfall event of given duration and intensity could not hit uniformly a soil surface due to the influence of several factors such as wind steepness plant canopy stones or patchy litter at the soil surface e g morbidelli et al 2015 demir et al 2022 the problem then arises of establishing how the soil hydrodynamic properties of an area of interest are overall influenced by this event little is known on the short term dynamics of the soil hydrodynamic properties when unexpected solicitations that is additional to the unavoidable ones when sampling the soil are non uniform over an area of interest assouline and mualem 2002 stated that the hydraulic properties of a disturbed soil layer are related to those of the initial soil from which it develops bagarello et al 2023 have recently suggested that different wetting induced soil alteration processes such as disturbance due to raindrop impact or weakening of interparticle bonds could have a similar effect on the measurable soil hydrodynamic parameters in other terms the hydrodynamic parameters of an altered soil depend more on the fact that the soil was altered than on the particular mechanism that caused alteration however this last suggestion was based on a comparison between the saturated hydraulic conductivity values obtained in different investigations and it was not supported by any experimental check it is not clear if a possible consequence of the suggestions by assouline and mualem 2002 and bagarello et al 2023 could be that a non uniform soil wetting does not preclude the possibility to recognize a link between the pre and post wetting soil hydrodynamic properties using fixed sampling points i e permanently established for repeatedly sampling the soil is particularly advisable to check the existence of this link since with non permanent sampling points soil spatial variability represents an additional source of variation of the results that could make their interpretation more uncertain bagarello and sgroi 2004 caltabellotta et al 2022 conversely with permanent sampling points it becomes potentially possible verify at the scale of the single sampling point the existence of a relationship between soil hydrodynamic parameters measured before and after a non uniform wetting the general objective of this investigation was to determine how the surface infiltration parameters of a loam soil supporting an orchard changed after wetting the soil with methods differing from point to point the specific objectives were to i establish how soil infiltration parameters changed soon after wetting ii verify if these parameters changed upon drying and iii test the effect of different rainfall intensities on the soil infiltration parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site the study was performed at the agricultural food and forest sciences department of the university of palermo italy in a no tilled and no trafficked citrus orchard with trees spaced 4 m 4 m apart coordinates 33s 355511e 4218990n the soil at the field site typic rhodoxeralf has a relatively high gravel content and it is mostly sandy loam or loam down to a depth of at least 0 30 m this investigation was performed in an area of approximately 200 m2 in which the soil had mainly a loam texture according to the usda classification system clay 15 4 silt 36 2 sand 48 4 and a soil organic carbon content equal to 3 1 the soil surface was gently leveled and smoothed by manual implements before sampling to remove leaves fallen fruits and small stones when present to sample a bare area the superficial herbaceous vegetation was cut with a knife when it was present while the roots remained in situ therefore the infiltration surface was as representative as possible of an undisturbed condition that was naturally flat and overall smooth 2 2 experiment small diameter d 0 08 m rings were inserted on the soil surface to a depth of 0 01 m for the beerkan infiltration runs lassabatere et al 2006 ring insertion was conducted manually or by gently using a rubber hammer and ensuring that the upper rim of the ring remained horizontal during insertion the experiment was performed in a two month period from 24 may to 29 july 2022 not less than three 3d three dimensional beerkan b infiltration runs were performed at each sampling point fig 1 in particular a first run b1 was carried out on the initially dry soil a water volume was applied 24 h later and the second run b2 was performed after further 24 h on the wet soil the third run b3 was carried out several days later when the soil water content returned apparently to values similar to those before the first beerkan run in particular the time interval between the b2 and b3 runs varied between 9 and 13 days depending on the sampling point with a mean of 11 days therefore the experiment aimed not to give b2 runs or to give b3 runs time to the soil to dry out considerably after a previous water application for each run 20 water volumes each of 57 ml were successively poured each in approximately 3 s on the confined infiltration surface by applying water at a small distance from the infiltration surface i e approximately at a height of 0 03 m therefore a total of 227 mm of water were applied with a beerkan run water energy was dissipated on the fingers of the hand in an attempt to minimize soil disturbance due to water application reynolds 2008 this precaution appeared effective since the soil surface generally looked smooth and levelled after the infiltration run for each water volume 1st 2nd 20th the infiltration time was measured from water application to disappearance of all water when the subsequent water volume was poured on the infiltration surface lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2021 different choices were made with reference to the intermediate water application between the b1 and b2 beerkan runs in a case code of the run sequence 3b fig 1 no additional water was applied between these two runs meaning that the b2 run was performed on a soil that was left to dry out for 48 h after the b1 run for the 4b sequence the intermediate water application consisted of an additional beerkan run identical to the other runs for the other sequences the intermediate water application consisted of applying 100 mm of water simulating a heavy rainfall event with the rainfall simulator by kamphorst 1987 agosta et al 2022 in particular water was applied with an intensity i 5 code 3bsp5 7 3bsp7 9 3bsp9 11 3bsp11 and 13 3bsp13 mm min the ring was not removed before completing all runs at a point each sequence was replicated eight times in randomly selected points of the experimental area therefore a total of 56 sequences and 168 beerkan runs plus the additional water applications were performed at the beginning of a working day for performing the b1 and b3 runs two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height by 0 05 m in diameter were collected in three different points of the area at the 0 to 0 05 m and 0 05 to 0 10 m depths these cores were used to determine the dry soil bulk density œÅ b and the antecedent gravimetric soil water content wi the means of the œÅ b and wi determinations were then associated with the beerkan runs performed on that day overall for a given sampling depth 21 soil cores were taken before the b1 runs and 21 before the b3 runs soil samples for determination of œÅ b and wi were collected outside the rings for both the b1 and b3 runs since the suggested protocol for a beerkan infiltration campaign established collection of undisturbed soil samples and infiltration experiments at different sampling points lassabatere et al 2006 however previous investigations performed in summer at the same field site demonstrated that after one or two subsequent beerkan runs the soil returned to the antecedent soil water content values in nearly four days due to the relatively coarse texture the high air temperatures and the lack of rainfall events bagarello et al 2020 therefore a nearly three times longer pause 11 days between the b2 and b3 runs was considered appropriate to assume that the measured wi values outside the rings were close to the antecedent soil water content at the infiltration sampling points due to the organization of the experiment œÅ b and wi were not determined for the b2 runs since there were not wetted points in addition to those sampled by the infiltration runs however it was sure that most b2 runs were performed on an initially wet to very wet soil since each sampling point received large amounts of water just before this run 227 mm two days before for the 3b sequence 227 mm two days before and other 227 mm the day before for the 4b sequence and 227 mm two days before and other 100 mm the day before for the 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 3bsp11 and 3bsp13 sequences 2 3 calculations and data analysis for each b1 b2 and b3 run the mean infiltration rate imed mm h was calculated by the ratio between cumulative infiltration i mm and total duration dtot h the empirical horton 1940 infiltration model was then fitted to the i vs time t h data for each run 1 i i f t i 0 i f k h 1 e k h t where i 0 mm h is the initial infiltration rate t 0 if mm h is the final infiltration rate and the constant kh 1 h determines the rate at which i 0 approaches if for given i 0 and if values the smaller kh the more gradual is transition from the initial to the final conditions iovino et al 2021 the quality of the fitting was evaluated by calculating the relative error er in accordance with lassabatere et al 2006 the model by horton was chosen since it describes in some detail the complete infiltration curve using only three parameters and also because it was found to give a good representation of the experimentally determined i t relationships in other investigations shukla et al 2003 iovino et al 2021 moreover fitting an empirical model such as the horton s one to 3d infiltration data for determining relevant infiltration parameters is a rather common procedure hussen and warrick 1993 ciollaro and lamaddalena 1998 iovino et al 2021 the rationale is that the fitted parameters can then be analyzed taking into account that they are expressive of a 3d process for example jacques et al 2002 obtained soil hydraulic conductivity from the steady state infiltration rate estimated by adapting a modified horton model to 3d infiltration data the two term infiltration model proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 was not applied for analyzing the beerkan experiments angulo jaramillo et al 2016 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 since it applies to an initially nearly dry soil and the b2 runs were intentionally performed on a wet soil preliminarily the distribution of the data was checked with the lilliefors 1967 test at p 0 05 considering both a normal no and a ln normal lno distribution the no distribution hypothesis was never rejected for the œÅ b and wi data at the two sampling depths 0 5 cm layer œÅ b 0 5 and wi 0 5 respectively 5 10 cm layer œÅ b 5 10 and wi 5 10 sample size n 21 for each dataset consequently the arithmetic mean and the associated coefficient of variation cv were used to summarize the data with reference to the three datasets b1 b2 and b3 runs n 56 for each dataset developed for each infiltration parameter imed i 0 if and kh the largely most common result was that of a better performance of the lno distribution hypothesis than the no distribution one table 1 therefore geometric means and the associated cvs lee et al 1985 were used to summarize the infiltration parameters to define the conditions under which the experiment was carried out the dependence of both œÅ b and wi on the sampling depth 0 5 cm 5 10 cm was initially tested by separately considering the data collected before the b1 runs and those obtained before the b3 runs then a comparison was established between the two sampling periods this last comparison was performed for the 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm layers but also by averaging the data collected at the two depths of a sampling point in order to obtain a representative value for the 0 10 cm layer œÅ b 0 10 and wi 0 10 respectively to test the effect of a non uniform soil wetting on its hydrodynamic response a comparison was initially performed for each infiltration parameter imed i 0 if kh between the means the cvs and the ranges of variation obtained with the b1 b2 and b3 runs then several regression analyses were carried out for each run of the sequence in particular the following relationships between the infiltration parameters were determined i fitted parameters of the infiltration model vs imed and ii relationships between the three parameters of the model the relationships between the results obtained in the three runs of the sequence were also determined for each infiltration parameter the 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 3bsp11 and 3bsp13 runs only differed by the established rainfall intensity therefore a comparison between the means obtained with these runs was performed to test the effect of rainfall intensity on each infiltration parameter this comparison was at first carried out for the b1 runs to verify if the 3bsp5 to 3bsp13 runs were performed at sampling points initially having a similar hydrodynamic behaviour it was then repeated for the b2 and b3 runs to possibly detect a rainfall intensity effect soon after rainfall and also afterwards for each type of sequence e g 3bsp5 runs and each infiltration parameter a comparison was also established between the results obtained in the three runs of the sequence a pairwise approach was applied to establish statistical comparisons between two datasets at a time in particular f and unpaired two tailed t tests were used when the two datasets were developed by sampling different locations of the field site paired two tailed t tests were applied when the two compared datasets were obtained at the same sampling points the untransformed data were used for œÅ b and wi whereas the ln transformed data were considered for imed i 0 if and kh regression analysis between two datasets was performed by considering the exponential linear logarithmic and power relationships and retaining the relationship having the highest coefficient of determination r 2 for further analysis a two tailed t test was also used to establish the statistical significance of a fitted regression line to the data glantz 2012 all statistical tests were carried out at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dry soil bulk density and antecedent soil water content for both sampling periods b1 and b3 runs the subsoil 5 10 cm was significantly less compacted than the upper layer 0 5 cm by a similar percentage for the two periods that is by 4 5 5 7 table 2 more compaction at the soil surface that is largely documented in different environments and situations is expected to play a significant role in shaping the rainfall infiltration relationship ramos et al 2000 assouline and mualem 2002 lassabatere et al 2010 therefore this field investigation had a correspondence with situations of practical interest the œÅ b 0 5 œÅ b 5 10 and œÅ b 0 10 values did not differ significantly between the two sampling periods suggesting a stable level of compaction of the soil outside the rings during the experimental campaign for both sampling periods the subsoil was significantly wetter than the upper layer by 63 in the first period and 85 in the second one but differences between the two layers did not exceed 0 035 g g table 2 the soil outside the rings was significantly drier before performing the b3 runs than the b1 ones in particular more differences between the two periods were observed for the upper layer than the subsoil since wi differed by 23 9 in the former case and 13 4 in the latter one in any case differences between the two sampling periods were not very appreciable since the means of wi 0 5 wi 5 10 and wi 0 10 varied in the rather narrow ranges of 0 040 0 053 0 075 0 086 and 0 058 0 070 g g respectively this investigation was performed at the same field site and in the same season of the year as the investigation by alagna et al 2018 since these authors performed their experiment during the months of june and july 2017 consequently there was a similarity between the wi values for the two investigations 0 07 g g in alagna et al 2018 0 06 0 07 g g in this investigation alagna et al 2018 also determined wi a day after pouring 25 l of water on a 0 5 m2 area in this case wi at the soil surface was equal to 0 18 g g this wi value was considered to likely be close to the wi value before the b2 runs of this investigation at least with reference to the 48 runs that were performed 24 h after applying water 3 2 variable wetting method fig 2 shows all empirical cumulative infiltration curves obtained with the b1 b2 and b3 runs for the different run sequences 3b 4b 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 3bsp11 3bsp13 in general the experimental i t curves obtained with the b1 runs were located on the left side of each graph denoting that these runs were the most rapid instead the position of the i t curves for the two subsequent runs appeared to vary with the run sequence in particular in the case of the 3bsp11 and 3bsp13 sequences the three beerkan experiments of the sequence b1 b2 and b3 occupied three different spaces on the i vs t plot with limited overlaps between runs differing by their order in the sequence the b2 runs were generally the slowest while the durations of the b3 runs were intermediate between those of the other two runs this behavior was also perceived for the other sequences performed with the rainfall simulator 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 and for the 4b sequence however in these last cases the distinction between the b2 and b3 runs appeared less clear since the two sets of curves overlapped more with reference to the 3b sequence the perception was that of a rather wide variability of infiltration rates for the b1 runs and a relatively limited influence of the order in the sequence since the second and the third run yielded cumulative infiltration curves that fell almost entirely in the space of the i vs t plot delimited by the curves describing the slowest and the fastest b1 runs however the data also suggested a generally faster infiltration process for the b2 runs than the b3 ones this preliminary qualitative check of the infiltration data signaled that the applied treatment none another beerkan run rainfall simulation with different intensities after the first run was not irrelevant with reference to the two subsequent runs in other terms the soil hydrodynamic response during the three run sequence was not the same regardless of the treatment but instead it varied depending on what happened between the b1 and b2 runs the fitting of the horton infiltration model to the data was satisfactory for all b1 b2 and b3 runs n 168 since er did not exceed 2 9 mean 1 3 cv 39 7 and lassabatere et al 2006 suggested that er 3 5 denotes an acceptable fitting of a cumulative infiltration model to the data for all soil infiltration parameters imed i 0 if and kh significantly different results were obtained between two runs of the sequence table 3 in particular the b2 runs signaled a slower infiltration process than the b1 runs since imed and if were 2 9 times smaller for the b2 runs than the b1 runs and i 0 and kh decreased by 4 2 4 3 times between these two runs the b3 runs yielded intermediate results as compared with the other two runs since depending on the parameter they were 1 6 2 3 times smaller than those obtained with the b1 runs and 1 7 2 3 times larger than the results obtained with the b2 runs for all runs if and imed were the less variable parameters cv 36 5 54 2 kh was the most variable one cv 95 3 176 6 and i 0 exhibited an intermediate variability cv 47 3 87 5 relative variability decreased from the b1 to the b3 runs this decrease was monotonic for imed i 0 and if but not for kh a similar trend was detected for the four considered parameters with reference to the ranges of variation in the subsequent runs table 3 in particular the b2 runs yielded smaller minimum and maximum values than the b1 runs in comparison with the b1 runs the b3 runs yielded a similar minimum value but also a smaller maximum value for three of the four parameters imed i 0 if this maximum value was larger than the maximum value obtained with the b2 runs for all runs the relationships with imed were strong for if 0 934 r 2 0 983 r 0 intermediate but significant for i 0 0 237 r 2 0 387 r 0 and rather weak and not always significant for kh 0 009 r 2 0 105 r 0 for the b1 runs and r 0 for the b2 and b3 runs table 4 with reference to the three fitted parameters of the infiltration model the correlation was rather strong for kh vs i 0 0 819 r 2 0 851 r 0 intermediate but significant for if vs i 0 0 282 r 2 0 512 r 0 and rather weak and not always significant for kh vs if 0 014 r 2 0 185 r 0 for the b1 and b2 runs and r 0 for the b3 runs all statistically significant relationships signaled that the dependent variable increased with an increase in the independent variable therefore this analysis suggested a general persistence of the information obtained with the different runs of the sequence since regardless of the run it was noticed that i imed explained if best of all and kh worst of all ii the kh constant was higher the higher the initial infiltration rate while it depended little or nothing on the final infiltration rate and iii the greater i0 the greater if with a single exception kh b2 vs b1 runs the relationships between the infiltration parameters obtained in the three runs of the sequence were statistically significant table 5 therefore there was a link between the hydrodynamic response of the sampled points during the experimental period since a point yielding for example a relatively high value of a parameter in a run of the sequence tended to also yield a relatively high value of that parameter in another run fig 3 this result was obtained notwithstanding that the b1 runs were carried out on an undisturbed soil while the b2 and b3 runs were performed after the soil was subjected to wetting and disturbance processes that varied with the sampling point 3 3 rainfall intensity effect for the b1 runs there was not any statistical difference between the infiltration parameters corresponding to the five applied rainfall intensities n 8 for each dataset table 6 therefore the data were usable to verify if there was any effect of rainfall intensity on the subsequently determined soil infiltration parameters this effect was not detected for the b2 runs since the five rainfall intensities yielded statistically similar values of all soil hydrodynamic parameters the same result was obtained with the b3 runs for i 0 and kh for both imed and if one of the ten tested differences was significant in particular higher values were obtained with the i 11 mm min treatment than the i 7 mm min one for imed and if the results varied according to the b1 b3 b2 sequence for all i values for i 0 the same result was obtained for i 9 11 and 13 mm min whereas the data varied according to the b1 b3 b2 sequence for i 5 and 7 mm min for kh differences between the three runs of the sequence varied with the rainfall intensity in particular b1 b2 b3 was obtained for i 5 mm min b1 b3 b2 for i 7 and 13 mm min b1 b3 b2 for i 9 mm min and b1 b3 b2 for i 11 mm min for all infiltration parameters and established intensities relative variability of the data was smaller for the b3 runs than the b1 runs with the b2 runs relative variability differed widely as compared with the other runs since it was the smallest e g if i 5 mm min intermediate imed i 7 mm min or the highest in some instances even substantially kh i 11 mm min depending on the parameter and the rainfall intensity therefore there was some sign that i influenced the soil hydrodynamic response since for example the b3 runs statistically signaled a recovery of the initial infiltration rates when the applied rainfall intensity was relatively small 7 mm min but not in the other cases however these signs were overall weak while those suggesting that rainfall intensity did not have any appreciable effect on the measured soil hydrodynamic parameters appeared stronger since they included for all infiltration parameters a near complete similarity i e with a minimum number of exceptions of the results obtained with both the b2 and b3 runs regardless of the applied rainfall intensities before performing these runs 4 discussion trying to explain difference between the three runs of the sequence it was preliminarily excluded any effect of spatial variability of soil hydrodynamic parameters mubarak et al 2010 or ring insertion disturbance bagarello and sgroi 2004 since the three runs of a sequence were performed at exactly the same point without removing the ring until the end of the run a 3d infiltration process is theoretically expected to be slower in wetter soil conditions alagna et al 2018 in particular the process is initially governed by soil sorptivity that decreases with an increase in soil water content touma et al 2007 final infiltration rates also decrease as the background soil water content is greater since more water in the soil at the beginning of the process implies smaller values of the matric flux potential reynolds and elrick 1990 moreover a pause between two water applications can result in a sharp decrease of the steady state infiltration rate in the next run as a consequence of air entrapment especially if the soil at the beginning of the experiment is dry c√≠slerov√° et al 1988 dohnal et al 2016 votrubova et al 2017 therefore changes in the soil water content during the three run sequence were likely one of the factors influencing the soil infiltration parameters in particular the slowdown of the infiltration process from the b1 to the b2 runs was consistent with an increase of the initial soil water content between these two runs and with the occurrence of air entrapment phenomena since the soil was dry before performing the b1 runs and very wet before most if not all the b2 runs still with reference to the soil water content another possible reason why the infiltration parameters decreased between the first two runs was that the wetter the soil the less the empty pore volume youngs et al 1995 and hence the larger the bulk soil volume sampled with a given water volume therefore the slowdown of the infiltration process between the b1 and b2 runs also appeared attributable to soil hydrodynamic parameters overall decreasing as the sampled soil volume increased bagarello and david 2020 a soil water content effect on the slowdown of infiltration from the b1 to the b3 runs cannot be ruled out without any doubt since it was not possible to measure wi of the previously wetted soil volumes before performing the last runs however it appeared rather unlikely that the b3 runs were slower than the b1 runs because the soil was wetter since the drying period before the b3 runs was rather long and the sampled soil is known to dry out very rapidly even after a significant wetting bagarello et al 2020 caltabellotta et al 2022 therefore it was more plausible to believe that the antecedent soil water conditions did not differ substantially between the b1 and b3 runs wetting an initially dry soil can promote deterioration of the porous medium possibly decreasing infiltration as a consequence of different processes that include slaking swelling mechanical breakdown progressive weakening of particle bonds and consequent mobilization of detached particles that could clog soil pores le bissonnais 1996 fohrer et al 1999 dikinya et al 2008 soil alteration can persist more or less long during the subsequent drying stage or a soil recovery process can start even soon after disturbance levy et al 1986 bagarello et al 2020 therefore some kind of soil alteration likely determined a slower infiltration process for the b3 runs than the b1 runs another sign that soil deteriorated during the sampling period was the decrease of the cv values of all infiltration parameters table 3 since ben hur et al 1987 reported that an altered soil should be expected to have a lower cv value of the infiltration parameters than the same non altered soil taking into account that the sampling for the b1 and b2 runs was a period of large water supplies at a single point from 454 to 681 mm depending on the sampling point it appeared plausible to conclude that infiltration decreased between these two runs since the soil water content increased but also because soil structure was altered there was some visible sign of such an alteration since rainfall simulation occasionally determined development of very small from a very few millimeters to nearly imperceptible craters at the points of raindrop impact but these signs disappeared after the b2 runs an effect of this soil structure deterioration remained perceivable from a hydrodynamic point of view with the b3 runs what remained a little unclear was what happened in the time period between the b2 and b3 runs as there were two possible alternatives i the soil dried out after the b2 runs but structure reorganization processes did not occur at least at a perceivable rate therefore infiltration was faster for the b3 runs than the b2 ones since the soil was drier before the last runs of the sequence ii both drying and soil structure recovery processes occurred during the time period between the b2 and b3 runs bagarello et al 2020 consequently infiltration was faster for the b3 runs than the b2 runs for a twofold reason that is drying and structure reorganization should this be the correct interpretation this reorganization was not completed by the end of the experiment since infiltration was slower for the b3 runs than the b1 ones particularly high values of the soil infiltration parameters were likely obtained when macropores had a large impact on flow whereas relatively low values were more expressive of matrix flow processes beven and germann 1982 kut√≠lek et al 2006 therefore a substantial alteration of the fragile macropores schwen et al 2011 jarvis et al 2013 kargas et al 2016 was likely responsible of the appreciably smaller maximum values of the soil infiltration parameters for the b2 runs than the b1 ones table 3 macroporosity tended to recover but its return to the initial conditions was not completed during the sampling period differences between the minimum values of soil infiltration parameters for the three runs suggested two interpretations the first interpretation was that in comparison with the b1 runs these minimum values were smaller for the b2 runs and similar for the b3 runs since the flow process followed exactly the theory being slower in wetter soil conditions alagna et al 2018 reynolds and elrick 1990 another interpretation not necessarily alternative to the previous one was that the soil matrix experienced some wetting induced alteration such as some swelling reducing the soil ability to transmit water bagarello and sgroi 2007 before the b2 runs and a shrinkage when the soil returned to water content values overall similar to those at the beginning of the experiment according to this explanation small pores apparently reorganized faster or were less affected by wetting than large pores as already suggested by caltabellotta et al 2022 not surprisingly the smallest r 2 values 0 059 0 211 between corresponding soil infiltration parameters were detected for the comparison between the b2 and b1 runs table 5 that is between a nearly undisturbed soil and a disturbed soil sampled immediately after disturbance even in this case however a kind of memory effect remained perceivable even if only weakly a similar i 0 and kh or an appreciably stronger imed if correlation was detected by comparing the b3 and b1 runs than the b2 and b1 runs this result suggested that the soil tended to recover its original structural arrangement during the drying period following the b2 runs morin and benyamini 1977 bagarello et al 2020 at the end of the sampling period b3 runs both i 0 and kh were better linked higher r 2 values with the corresponding values obtained soon after disturbance b2 runs than on the initially undisturbed soil b1 runs but the opposite result was obtained for imed and if table 5 however the fitted relationships for the latter two parameters appeared more convincing than those obtained for the former two parameters since these last relationships were influenced by a single data point fig 3 that was not excluded from the analysis since there was not any sign of a poorly conducted experiment despite this last uncertainty what appeared relevant was that the soil infiltration parameters obtained with the last run of the sequence b3 runs were more or less well correlated with those obtained both before b1 runs and after b2 runs variably disturbing the soil in other words a non uniform soil wetting did not preclude the possibility to recognize a link between the pre and post wetting soil hydrodynamic properties therefore the suggestions by assouline and mualem 2002 and bagarello et al 2023 can be read as indicative that different kinds of alteration can have a similar impact on soil changes in the sense that the infiltration parameters of the disturbed and undisturbed soil remain linked to each other the existence of a relationship between the infiltration parameters determined at two different times might have some practical interest for example differences between the b1 and b3 data were mainly explained by soil disturbance phenomena since antecedent soil water content effects were unlikely or small therefore relationships developed with these two datasets could be used to predict the local impact of soil disturbance using non disturbed soil data e g b3 vs b1 relationship or conversely to estimate non disturbed soil properties from disturbed soil data b1 vs b3 relationships according to the imed relationship of fig 3 a non disturbed point with imed 250 mm h will nearly maintain the same infiltration rate after disturbance 243 mm h disturbed non disturbed condition 0 97 while at a non disturbed location with imed 1000 mm h soil disturbance will have a larger effect since the expectation is to obtain a imed value of nearly 600 mm h disturbed non disturbed condition 0 60 using these relationships for predictive purposes requires that they are statistically significant and also strong according to this investigation the most favorable conditions to develop such a kind of predictive relationships occur when a nearly dry soil is sampled at different times and with reference to mean and final infiltration rates table 5 and fig 3 in other cases that is with a wet vs dry soil sampling and for other infiltration parameters such as the initial infiltration rate and the decay constant these relationships appear more uncertain even if they are significant due to a large data scattering and or to the presence of one or a few data points that strongly influence the results of the regression analysis the lack of any effect of the applied rainfall intensity on the soil hydrodynamic parameters determined after rainfall could appear puzzling since the expectation was to obtain slower infiltration rates with more intense rainfall events given that rainfall energy increases in this case wischmeier and smith 1978 and this circumstance could determine more alteration of the surface soil layer and hence less infiltration however soil changes due to rainfall impact depend on different factors assouline and mualem 1997 and rainfall kinetic energy does not always explains changes in soil physical properties zumr et al 2019 since raindrop impact can be both a formative and a disruptive agent in the process of seal development seginer and morin 1970 neave and rayburg 2007 in this investigation a fixed rainfall depth was applied with different intensities when rainfall intensity was relatively small mechanical impact effects were likely relatively limited but the soil was wetted for a relatively long time period wetting duration was shorter when high rainfall intensities were employed but in this case mechanical impact was likely more relevant in other words a possible explanation of the lack of a rainfall intensity effect on the soil infiltration parameters was that soil deterioration was similar for the different treatments since relatively small rainfall intensities determined less impact effects but there was more time for swelling interparticle weakening and migration of particles with large intensities impact effects were more appreciable whereas the other phenomena were less relevant this interpretation appears consistent with the suggestion by bagarello et al 2023 that different kinds of soil deterioration could have a similar effect on the measurable soil hydrodynamic parameters 5 conclusions infiltration parameters obtained by 3d beerkan runs changed during short term nearly two weeks wetting and drying cycles of an initially dry loam soil as compared with the initial conditions smaller values of the soil infiltration parameters should be expected soon after wetting but also when the soil returns to wetting conditions close to the antecedent ones relative variability of these parameters decreases too temporal changes of soil hydrodynamic parameters appear expressive of the combined effects of variations in the soil water content soil disturbance and perhaps soil recovery processes for a given rainfall depth changing intensities could not induce appreciable differences in soil infiltration parameters since a smaller intensity implies a longer wetting and hence more opportunities for swelling and interparticle bonds weakening whereas a more intense event is shorter but it has a stronger mechanical effect on the soil surface nevertheless even in such a general scenario a link can remain recognizable between the infiltration parameters determined in the subsequent runs of a sequence therefore a non uniform wetting of a field does not necessarily compromise the possibility to find a link between the characteristics of the disturbed soil and those of the same soil in an undisturbed condition it seems therefore that the soil is able to experience a kind of memory effect to our knowledge this is one of the first times that this result was obtained by submitting directly in the field different sampling points to different wetting treatments the results of this investigation reinforced the suggestion that the hydrodynamic response of a disturbed soil is related to that of the initial soil from which it develops and also that it depends more on the fact that the soil was altered by wetting than on the particular mechanism that caused alteration of course a single experiment is not enough to propose conclusions of general validity other tests should be performed at this aim in other soils and antecedent conditions other scenarios should also be considered and particularly those of uniform wetting treatments and absence of any additional wetting other than those performed for sampling experimental improvements could include independent determination of the soil water retention curve at different times to check pore size distribution and also a direct monitoring of soil water content at the infiltration sampling points together with measurements of bulk density of soil volumes having the same management and wetting drying history of the sampled soil for the infiltration measurements these additional investigations could help to better explain short term temporal variability of soil hydrodynamic properties in situations more similar to the real ones and hence to improve our ability to describe the soil for hydrological modelling purposes credit authorship contribution statement m agosta data curation investigation writing review

1712,different points in a field can be wetted with different natural or artificial rainfall amounts and intensities therefore a non uniform soil wetting could occur during short term monitoring of soil hydrodynamic parameters and its global effect on soil characterization is not easily predictable for an initially dry loam soil a sequence of three beerkan infiltration runs was performed at fixed sampling points in a period of two weeks immediately after the first beerkan run the soil was perturbed by adding an additional water volume differing with the sampling point by the amount of water 0 100 or 227 mm and the application methodology rainfall simulation another beerkan run as compared with the initial conditions the soil infiltration parameters mean initial and final infiltration rates constant of the horton s infiltration model decreased by 2 9 4 3 times after wetting a decrease of these parameters by 1 6 2 3 times remained detectable at the end of the sampling period even if the soil likely returned to wetness conditions close to the initial ones relative variability decreased too coefficients of variation 52 135 depending on the parameter for the initial runs and 36 95 for the final ones nevertheless a link was recognized between the infiltration parameters determined in the subsequent runs of the sequence the correlation was stronger when the initial runs were compared with the last runs coefficients of determination r 2 0 104 0 749 depending on the parameter r 0 at p 0 05 in all cases than with those performed immediately after the intermediate wetting r 2 varying from a non significant value of 0 059 to significant 0 196 0 211 values the hydrodynamic response of a disturbed soil appears overall related to that of the initially undisturbed soil even if the disturbing agent is not exactly the same over the sampled area performing other investigations by characterizing the antecedent soil conditions in more detail could help to improve interpretation and modelling of hydrological processes by a more realistic description of temporal variability of soil infiltration parameters keywords soil water infiltration soil disturbance beerkan infiltration runs hydrodynamic properties temporal variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface soil hydrodynamic properties can change also appreciably as a consequence of soil wetting and drying e g mapa et al 1986 das et al 2006 jabro 1996 the mechanisms by which wetting modifies the soil include slaking swelling weakening of interparticle bonds and breakdown by raindrop impact these mechanisms differ by the types of forces involved the soil properties influencing the mechanism the resulting fragments and the disaggregation intensity e g messing and jarvis 1990 le bissonnais 1996 soil recovery processes can occur after wetting lozano baez et al 2019 bagarello et al 2020 caltabellotta et al 2022 but a soil structure similarity between the pre wetting and post drying stages could not always occur since it depends on the type of soil alteration induced by wetting for example this similarity could be expected if soil shrinks after swelling due to the reversible nature of this process instead if wetting weakens interparticle bonds and water infiltration determines migration of detached soil particles then a dry soil after wetting will probably differ to some extent from the same dry soil before wetting therefore temporal variability of soil properties has to be determined even at short time intervals for example to properly parameterize physically based hydrological models reynolds et al 2000 assouline and mualem 2002 ndiaye et al 2005 an unexpected hydrological forcing such as a heavy and isolated rainstorm can occur during a short sampling period caltabellotta et al 2022 various points of the wetted area could receive different rainfall amounts and also in different manners since for example a rainfall event of given duration and intensity could not hit uniformly a soil surface due to the influence of several factors such as wind steepness plant canopy stones or patchy litter at the soil surface e g morbidelli et al 2015 demir et al 2022 the problem then arises of establishing how the soil hydrodynamic properties of an area of interest are overall influenced by this event little is known on the short term dynamics of the soil hydrodynamic properties when unexpected solicitations that is additional to the unavoidable ones when sampling the soil are non uniform over an area of interest assouline and mualem 2002 stated that the hydraulic properties of a disturbed soil layer are related to those of the initial soil from which it develops bagarello et al 2023 have recently suggested that different wetting induced soil alteration processes such as disturbance due to raindrop impact or weakening of interparticle bonds could have a similar effect on the measurable soil hydrodynamic parameters in other terms the hydrodynamic parameters of an altered soil depend more on the fact that the soil was altered than on the particular mechanism that caused alteration however this last suggestion was based on a comparison between the saturated hydraulic conductivity values obtained in different investigations and it was not supported by any experimental check it is not clear if a possible consequence of the suggestions by assouline and mualem 2002 and bagarello et al 2023 could be that a non uniform soil wetting does not preclude the possibility to recognize a link between the pre and post wetting soil hydrodynamic properties using fixed sampling points i e permanently established for repeatedly sampling the soil is particularly advisable to check the existence of this link since with non permanent sampling points soil spatial variability represents an additional source of variation of the results that could make their interpretation more uncertain bagarello and sgroi 2004 caltabellotta et al 2022 conversely with permanent sampling points it becomes potentially possible verify at the scale of the single sampling point the existence of a relationship between soil hydrodynamic parameters measured before and after a non uniform wetting the general objective of this investigation was to determine how the surface infiltration parameters of a loam soil supporting an orchard changed after wetting the soil with methods differing from point to point the specific objectives were to i establish how soil infiltration parameters changed soon after wetting ii verify if these parameters changed upon drying and iii test the effect of different rainfall intensities on the soil infiltration parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site the study was performed at the agricultural food and forest sciences department of the university of palermo italy in a no tilled and no trafficked citrus orchard with trees spaced 4 m 4 m apart coordinates 33s 355511e 4218990n the soil at the field site typic rhodoxeralf has a relatively high gravel content and it is mostly sandy loam or loam down to a depth of at least 0 30 m this investigation was performed in an area of approximately 200 m2 in which the soil had mainly a loam texture according to the usda classification system clay 15 4 silt 36 2 sand 48 4 and a soil organic carbon content equal to 3 1 the soil surface was gently leveled and smoothed by manual implements before sampling to remove leaves fallen fruits and small stones when present to sample a bare area the superficial herbaceous vegetation was cut with a knife when it was present while the roots remained in situ therefore the infiltration surface was as representative as possible of an undisturbed condition that was naturally flat and overall smooth 2 2 experiment small diameter d 0 08 m rings were inserted on the soil surface to a depth of 0 01 m for the beerkan infiltration runs lassabatere et al 2006 ring insertion was conducted manually or by gently using a rubber hammer and ensuring that the upper rim of the ring remained horizontal during insertion the experiment was performed in a two month period from 24 may to 29 july 2022 not less than three 3d three dimensional beerkan b infiltration runs were performed at each sampling point fig 1 in particular a first run b1 was carried out on the initially dry soil a water volume was applied 24 h later and the second run b2 was performed after further 24 h on the wet soil the third run b3 was carried out several days later when the soil water content returned apparently to values similar to those before the first beerkan run in particular the time interval between the b2 and b3 runs varied between 9 and 13 days depending on the sampling point with a mean of 11 days therefore the experiment aimed not to give b2 runs or to give b3 runs time to the soil to dry out considerably after a previous water application for each run 20 water volumes each of 57 ml were successively poured each in approximately 3 s on the confined infiltration surface by applying water at a small distance from the infiltration surface i e approximately at a height of 0 03 m therefore a total of 227 mm of water were applied with a beerkan run water energy was dissipated on the fingers of the hand in an attempt to minimize soil disturbance due to water application reynolds 2008 this precaution appeared effective since the soil surface generally looked smooth and levelled after the infiltration run for each water volume 1st 2nd 20th the infiltration time was measured from water application to disappearance of all water when the subsequent water volume was poured on the infiltration surface lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2021 different choices were made with reference to the intermediate water application between the b1 and b2 beerkan runs in a case code of the run sequence 3b fig 1 no additional water was applied between these two runs meaning that the b2 run was performed on a soil that was left to dry out for 48 h after the b1 run for the 4b sequence the intermediate water application consisted of an additional beerkan run identical to the other runs for the other sequences the intermediate water application consisted of applying 100 mm of water simulating a heavy rainfall event with the rainfall simulator by kamphorst 1987 agosta et al 2022 in particular water was applied with an intensity i 5 code 3bsp5 7 3bsp7 9 3bsp9 11 3bsp11 and 13 3bsp13 mm min the ring was not removed before completing all runs at a point each sequence was replicated eight times in randomly selected points of the experimental area therefore a total of 56 sequences and 168 beerkan runs plus the additional water applications were performed at the beginning of a working day for performing the b1 and b3 runs two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height by 0 05 m in diameter were collected in three different points of the area at the 0 to 0 05 m and 0 05 to 0 10 m depths these cores were used to determine the dry soil bulk density œÅ b and the antecedent gravimetric soil water content wi the means of the œÅ b and wi determinations were then associated with the beerkan runs performed on that day overall for a given sampling depth 21 soil cores were taken before the b1 runs and 21 before the b3 runs soil samples for determination of œÅ b and wi were collected outside the rings for both the b1 and b3 runs since the suggested protocol for a beerkan infiltration campaign established collection of undisturbed soil samples and infiltration experiments at different sampling points lassabatere et al 2006 however previous investigations performed in summer at the same field site demonstrated that after one or two subsequent beerkan runs the soil returned to the antecedent soil water content values in nearly four days due to the relatively coarse texture the high air temperatures and the lack of rainfall events bagarello et al 2020 therefore a nearly three times longer pause 11 days between the b2 and b3 runs was considered appropriate to assume that the measured wi values outside the rings were close to the antecedent soil water content at the infiltration sampling points due to the organization of the experiment œÅ b and wi were not determined for the b2 runs since there were not wetted points in addition to those sampled by the infiltration runs however it was sure that most b2 runs were performed on an initially wet to very wet soil since each sampling point received large amounts of water just before this run 227 mm two days before for the 3b sequence 227 mm two days before and other 227 mm the day before for the 4b sequence and 227 mm two days before and other 100 mm the day before for the 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 3bsp11 and 3bsp13 sequences 2 3 calculations and data analysis for each b1 b2 and b3 run the mean infiltration rate imed mm h was calculated by the ratio between cumulative infiltration i mm and total duration dtot h the empirical horton 1940 infiltration model was then fitted to the i vs time t h data for each run 1 i i f t i 0 i f k h 1 e k h t where i 0 mm h is the initial infiltration rate t 0 if mm h is the final infiltration rate and the constant kh 1 h determines the rate at which i 0 approaches if for given i 0 and if values the smaller kh the more gradual is transition from the initial to the final conditions iovino et al 2021 the quality of the fitting was evaluated by calculating the relative error er in accordance with lassabatere et al 2006 the model by horton was chosen since it describes in some detail the complete infiltration curve using only three parameters and also because it was found to give a good representation of the experimentally determined i t relationships in other investigations shukla et al 2003 iovino et al 2021 moreover fitting an empirical model such as the horton s one to 3d infiltration data for determining relevant infiltration parameters is a rather common procedure hussen and warrick 1993 ciollaro and lamaddalena 1998 iovino et al 2021 the rationale is that the fitted parameters can then be analyzed taking into account that they are expressive of a 3d process for example jacques et al 2002 obtained soil hydraulic conductivity from the steady state infiltration rate estimated by adapting a modified horton model to 3d infiltration data the two term infiltration model proposed by haverkamp et al 1994 was not applied for analyzing the beerkan experiments angulo jaramillo et al 2016 angulo jaramillo et al 2019 since it applies to an initially nearly dry soil and the b2 runs were intentionally performed on a wet soil preliminarily the distribution of the data was checked with the lilliefors 1967 test at p 0 05 considering both a normal no and a ln normal lno distribution the no distribution hypothesis was never rejected for the œÅ b and wi data at the two sampling depths 0 5 cm layer œÅ b 0 5 and wi 0 5 respectively 5 10 cm layer œÅ b 5 10 and wi 5 10 sample size n 21 for each dataset consequently the arithmetic mean and the associated coefficient of variation cv were used to summarize the data with reference to the three datasets b1 b2 and b3 runs n 56 for each dataset developed for each infiltration parameter imed i 0 if and kh the largely most common result was that of a better performance of the lno distribution hypothesis than the no distribution one table 1 therefore geometric means and the associated cvs lee et al 1985 were used to summarize the infiltration parameters to define the conditions under which the experiment was carried out the dependence of both œÅ b and wi on the sampling depth 0 5 cm 5 10 cm was initially tested by separately considering the data collected before the b1 runs and those obtained before the b3 runs then a comparison was established between the two sampling periods this last comparison was performed for the 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm layers but also by averaging the data collected at the two depths of a sampling point in order to obtain a representative value for the 0 10 cm layer œÅ b 0 10 and wi 0 10 respectively to test the effect of a non uniform soil wetting on its hydrodynamic response a comparison was initially performed for each infiltration parameter imed i 0 if kh between the means the cvs and the ranges of variation obtained with the b1 b2 and b3 runs then several regression analyses were carried out for each run of the sequence in particular the following relationships between the infiltration parameters were determined i fitted parameters of the infiltration model vs imed and ii relationships between the three parameters of the model the relationships between the results obtained in the three runs of the sequence were also determined for each infiltration parameter the 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 3bsp11 and 3bsp13 runs only differed by the established rainfall intensity therefore a comparison between the means obtained with these runs was performed to test the effect of rainfall intensity on each infiltration parameter this comparison was at first carried out for the b1 runs to verify if the 3bsp5 to 3bsp13 runs were performed at sampling points initially having a similar hydrodynamic behaviour it was then repeated for the b2 and b3 runs to possibly detect a rainfall intensity effect soon after rainfall and also afterwards for each type of sequence e g 3bsp5 runs and each infiltration parameter a comparison was also established between the results obtained in the three runs of the sequence a pairwise approach was applied to establish statistical comparisons between two datasets at a time in particular f and unpaired two tailed t tests were used when the two datasets were developed by sampling different locations of the field site paired two tailed t tests were applied when the two compared datasets were obtained at the same sampling points the untransformed data were used for œÅ b and wi whereas the ln transformed data were considered for imed i 0 if and kh regression analysis between two datasets was performed by considering the exponential linear logarithmic and power relationships and retaining the relationship having the highest coefficient of determination r 2 for further analysis a two tailed t test was also used to establish the statistical significance of a fitted regression line to the data glantz 2012 all statistical tests were carried out at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dry soil bulk density and antecedent soil water content for both sampling periods b1 and b3 runs the subsoil 5 10 cm was significantly less compacted than the upper layer 0 5 cm by a similar percentage for the two periods that is by 4 5 5 7 table 2 more compaction at the soil surface that is largely documented in different environments and situations is expected to play a significant role in shaping the rainfall infiltration relationship ramos et al 2000 assouline and mualem 2002 lassabatere et al 2010 therefore this field investigation had a correspondence with situations of practical interest the œÅ b 0 5 œÅ b 5 10 and œÅ b 0 10 values did not differ significantly between the two sampling periods suggesting a stable level of compaction of the soil outside the rings during the experimental campaign for both sampling periods the subsoil was significantly wetter than the upper layer by 63 in the first period and 85 in the second one but differences between the two layers did not exceed 0 035 g g table 2 the soil outside the rings was significantly drier before performing the b3 runs than the b1 ones in particular more differences between the two periods were observed for the upper layer than the subsoil since wi differed by 23 9 in the former case and 13 4 in the latter one in any case differences between the two sampling periods were not very appreciable since the means of wi 0 5 wi 5 10 and wi 0 10 varied in the rather narrow ranges of 0 040 0 053 0 075 0 086 and 0 058 0 070 g g respectively this investigation was performed at the same field site and in the same season of the year as the investigation by alagna et al 2018 since these authors performed their experiment during the months of june and july 2017 consequently there was a similarity between the wi values for the two investigations 0 07 g g in alagna et al 2018 0 06 0 07 g g in this investigation alagna et al 2018 also determined wi a day after pouring 25 l of water on a 0 5 m2 area in this case wi at the soil surface was equal to 0 18 g g this wi value was considered to likely be close to the wi value before the b2 runs of this investigation at least with reference to the 48 runs that were performed 24 h after applying water 3 2 variable wetting method fig 2 shows all empirical cumulative infiltration curves obtained with the b1 b2 and b3 runs for the different run sequences 3b 4b 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 3bsp11 3bsp13 in general the experimental i t curves obtained with the b1 runs were located on the left side of each graph denoting that these runs were the most rapid instead the position of the i t curves for the two subsequent runs appeared to vary with the run sequence in particular in the case of the 3bsp11 and 3bsp13 sequences the three beerkan experiments of the sequence b1 b2 and b3 occupied three different spaces on the i vs t plot with limited overlaps between runs differing by their order in the sequence the b2 runs were generally the slowest while the durations of the b3 runs were intermediate between those of the other two runs this behavior was also perceived for the other sequences performed with the rainfall simulator 3bsp5 3bsp7 3bsp9 and for the 4b sequence however in these last cases the distinction between the b2 and b3 runs appeared less clear since the two sets of curves overlapped more with reference to the 3b sequence the perception was that of a rather wide variability of infiltration rates for the b1 runs and a relatively limited influence of the order in the sequence since the second and the third run yielded cumulative infiltration curves that fell almost entirely in the space of the i vs t plot delimited by the curves describing the slowest and the fastest b1 runs however the data also suggested a generally faster infiltration process for the b2 runs than the b3 ones this preliminary qualitative check of the infiltration data signaled that the applied treatment none another beerkan run rainfall simulation with different intensities after the first run was not irrelevant with reference to the two subsequent runs in other terms the soil hydrodynamic response during the three run sequence was not the same regardless of the treatment but instead it varied depending on what happened between the b1 and b2 runs the fitting of the horton infiltration model to the data was satisfactory for all b1 b2 and b3 runs n 168 since er did not exceed 2 9 mean 1 3 cv 39 7 and lassabatere et al 2006 suggested that er 3 5 denotes an acceptable fitting of a cumulative infiltration model to the data for all soil infiltration parameters imed i 0 if and kh significantly different results were obtained between two runs of the sequence table 3 in particular the b2 runs signaled a slower infiltration process than the b1 runs since imed and if were 2 9 times smaller for the b2 runs than the b1 runs and i 0 and kh decreased by 4 2 4 3 times between these two runs the b3 runs yielded intermediate results as compared with the other two runs since depending on the parameter they were 1 6 2 3 times smaller than those obtained with the b1 runs and 1 7 2 3 times larger than the results obtained with the b2 runs for all runs if and imed were the less variable parameters cv 36 5 54 2 kh was the most variable one cv 95 3 176 6 and i 0 exhibited an intermediate variability cv 47 3 87 5 relative variability decreased from the b1 to the b3 runs this decrease was monotonic for imed i 0 and if but not for kh a similar trend was detected for the four considered parameters with reference to the ranges of variation in the subsequent runs table 3 in particular the b2 runs yielded smaller minimum and maximum values than the b1 runs in comparison with the b1 runs the b3 runs yielded a similar minimum value but also a smaller maximum value for three of the four parameters imed i 0 if this maximum value was larger than the maximum value obtained with the b2 runs for all runs the relationships with imed were strong for if 0 934 r 2 0 983 r 0 intermediate but significant for i 0 0 237 r 2 0 387 r 0 and rather weak and not always significant for kh 0 009 r 2 0 105 r 0 for the b1 runs and r 0 for the b2 and b3 runs table 4 with reference to the three fitted parameters of the infiltration model the correlation was rather strong for kh vs i 0 0 819 r 2 0 851 r 0 intermediate but significant for if vs i 0 0 282 r 2 0 512 r 0 and rather weak and not always significant for kh vs if 0 014 r 2 0 185 r 0 for the b1 and b2 runs and r 0 for the b3 runs all statistically significant relationships signaled that the dependent variable increased with an increase in the independent variable therefore this analysis suggested a general persistence of the information obtained with the different runs of the sequence since regardless of the run it was noticed that i imed explained if best of all and kh worst of all ii the kh constant was higher the higher the initial infiltration rate while it depended little or nothing on the final infiltration rate and iii the greater i0 the greater if with a single exception kh b2 vs b1 runs the relationships between the infiltration parameters obtained in the three runs of the sequence were statistically significant table 5 therefore there was a link between the hydrodynamic response of the sampled points during the experimental period since a point yielding for example a relatively high value of a parameter in a run of the sequence tended to also yield a relatively high value of that parameter in another run fig 3 this result was obtained notwithstanding that the b1 runs were carried out on an undisturbed soil while the b2 and b3 runs were performed after the soil was subjected to wetting and disturbance processes that varied with the sampling point 3 3 rainfall intensity effect for the b1 runs there was not any statistical difference between the infiltration parameters corresponding to the five applied rainfall intensities n 8 for each dataset table 6 therefore the data were usable to verify if there was any effect of rainfall intensity on the subsequently determined soil infiltration parameters this effect was not detected for the b2 runs since the five rainfall intensities yielded statistically similar values of all soil hydrodynamic parameters the same result was obtained with the b3 runs for i 0 and kh for both imed and if one of the ten tested differences was significant in particular higher values were obtained with the i 11 mm min treatment than the i 7 mm min one for imed and if the results varied according to the b1 b3 b2 sequence for all i values for i 0 the same result was obtained for i 9 11 and 13 mm min whereas the data varied according to the b1 b3 b2 sequence for i 5 and 7 mm min for kh differences between the three runs of the sequence varied with the rainfall intensity in particular b1 b2 b3 was obtained for i 5 mm min b1 b3 b2 for i 7 and 13 mm min b1 b3 b2 for i 9 mm min and b1 b3 b2 for i 11 mm min for all infiltration parameters and established intensities relative variability of the data was smaller for the b3 runs than the b1 runs with the b2 runs relative variability differed widely as compared with the other runs since it was the smallest e g if i 5 mm min intermediate imed i 7 mm min or the highest in some instances even substantially kh i 11 mm min depending on the parameter and the rainfall intensity therefore there was some sign that i influenced the soil hydrodynamic response since for example the b3 runs statistically signaled a recovery of the initial infiltration rates when the applied rainfall intensity was relatively small 7 mm min but not in the other cases however these signs were overall weak while those suggesting that rainfall intensity did not have any appreciable effect on the measured soil hydrodynamic parameters appeared stronger since they included for all infiltration parameters a near complete similarity i e with a minimum number of exceptions of the results obtained with both the b2 and b3 runs regardless of the applied rainfall intensities before performing these runs 4 discussion trying to explain difference between the three runs of the sequence it was preliminarily excluded any effect of spatial variability of soil hydrodynamic parameters mubarak et al 2010 or ring insertion disturbance bagarello and sgroi 2004 since the three runs of a sequence were performed at exactly the same point without removing the ring until the end of the run a 3d infiltration process is theoretically expected to be slower in wetter soil conditions alagna et al 2018 in particular the process is initially governed by soil sorptivity that decreases with an increase in soil water content touma et al 2007 final infiltration rates also decrease as the background soil water content is greater since more water in the soil at the beginning of the process implies smaller values of the matric flux potential reynolds and elrick 1990 moreover a pause between two water applications can result in a sharp decrease of the steady state infiltration rate in the next run as a consequence of air entrapment especially if the soil at the beginning of the experiment is dry c√≠slerov√° et al 1988 dohnal et al 2016 votrubova et al 2017 therefore changes in the soil water content during the three run sequence were likely one of the factors influencing the soil infiltration parameters in particular the slowdown of the infiltration process from the b1 to the b2 runs was consistent with an increase of the initial soil water content between these two runs and with the occurrence of air entrapment phenomena since the soil was dry before performing the b1 runs and very wet before most if not all the b2 runs still with reference to the soil water content another possible reason why the infiltration parameters decreased between the first two runs was that the wetter the soil the less the empty pore volume youngs et al 1995 and hence the larger the bulk soil volume sampled with a given water volume therefore the slowdown of the infiltration process between the b1 and b2 runs also appeared attributable to soil hydrodynamic parameters overall decreasing as the sampled soil volume increased bagarello and david 2020 a soil water content effect on the slowdown of infiltration from the b1 to the b3 runs cannot be ruled out without any doubt since it was not possible to measure wi of the previously wetted soil volumes before performing the last runs however it appeared rather unlikely that the b3 runs were slower than the b1 runs because the soil was wetter since the drying period before the b3 runs was rather long and the sampled soil is known to dry out very rapidly even after a significant wetting bagarello et al 2020 caltabellotta et al 2022 therefore it was more plausible to believe that the antecedent soil water conditions did not differ substantially between the b1 and b3 runs wetting an initially dry soil can promote deterioration of the porous medium possibly decreasing infiltration as a consequence of different processes that include slaking swelling mechanical breakdown progressive weakening of particle bonds and consequent mobilization of detached particles that could clog soil pores le bissonnais 1996 fohrer et al 1999 dikinya et al 2008 soil alteration can persist more or less long during the subsequent drying stage or a soil recovery process can start even soon after disturbance levy et al 1986 bagarello et al 2020 therefore some kind of soil alteration likely determined a slower infiltration process for the b3 runs than the b1 runs another sign that soil deteriorated during the sampling period was the decrease of the cv values of all infiltration parameters table 3 since ben hur et al 1987 reported that an altered soil should be expected to have a lower cv value of the infiltration parameters than the same non altered soil taking into account that the sampling for the b1 and b2 runs was a period of large water supplies at a single point from 454 to 681 mm depending on the sampling point it appeared plausible to conclude that infiltration decreased between these two runs since the soil water content increased but also because soil structure was altered there was some visible sign of such an alteration since rainfall simulation occasionally determined development of very small from a very few millimeters to nearly imperceptible craters at the points of raindrop impact but these signs disappeared after the b2 runs an effect of this soil structure deterioration remained perceivable from a hydrodynamic point of view with the b3 runs what remained a little unclear was what happened in the time period between the b2 and b3 runs as there were two possible alternatives i the soil dried out after the b2 runs but structure reorganization processes did not occur at least at a perceivable rate therefore infiltration was faster for the b3 runs than the b2 ones since the soil was drier before the last runs of the sequence ii both drying and soil structure recovery processes occurred during the time period between the b2 and b3 runs bagarello et al 2020 consequently infiltration was faster for the b3 runs than the b2 runs for a twofold reason that is drying and structure reorganization should this be the correct interpretation this reorganization was not completed by the end of the experiment since infiltration was slower for the b3 runs than the b1 ones particularly high values of the soil infiltration parameters were likely obtained when macropores had a large impact on flow whereas relatively low values were more expressive of matrix flow processes beven and germann 1982 kut√≠lek et al 2006 therefore a substantial alteration of the fragile macropores schwen et al 2011 jarvis et al 2013 kargas et al 2016 was likely responsible of the appreciably smaller maximum values of the soil infiltration parameters for the b2 runs than the b1 ones table 3 macroporosity tended to recover but its return to the initial conditions was not completed during the sampling period differences between the minimum values of soil infiltration parameters for the three runs suggested two interpretations the first interpretation was that in comparison with the b1 runs these minimum values were smaller for the b2 runs and similar for the b3 runs since the flow process followed exactly the theory being slower in wetter soil conditions alagna et al 2018 reynolds and elrick 1990 another interpretation not necessarily alternative to the previous one was that the soil matrix experienced some wetting induced alteration such as some swelling reducing the soil ability to transmit water bagarello and sgroi 2007 before the b2 runs and a shrinkage when the soil returned to water content values overall similar to those at the beginning of the experiment according to this explanation small pores apparently reorganized faster or were less affected by wetting than large pores as already suggested by caltabellotta et al 2022 not surprisingly the smallest r 2 values 0 059 0 211 between corresponding soil infiltration parameters were detected for the comparison between the b2 and b1 runs table 5 that is between a nearly undisturbed soil and a disturbed soil sampled immediately after disturbance even in this case however a kind of memory effect remained perceivable even if only weakly a similar i 0 and kh or an appreciably stronger imed if correlation was detected by comparing the b3 and b1 runs than the b2 and b1 runs this result suggested that the soil tended to recover its original structural arrangement during the drying period following the b2 runs morin and benyamini 1977 bagarello et al 2020 at the end of the sampling period b3 runs both i 0 and kh were better linked higher r 2 values with the corresponding values obtained soon after disturbance b2 runs than on the initially undisturbed soil b1 runs but the opposite result was obtained for imed and if table 5 however the fitted relationships for the latter two parameters appeared more convincing than those obtained for the former two parameters since these last relationships were influenced by a single data point fig 3 that was not excluded from the analysis since there was not any sign of a poorly conducted experiment despite this last uncertainty what appeared relevant was that the soil infiltration parameters obtained with the last run of the sequence b3 runs were more or less well correlated with those obtained both before b1 runs and after b2 runs variably disturbing the soil in other words a non uniform soil wetting did not preclude the possibility to recognize a link between the pre and post wetting soil hydrodynamic properties therefore the suggestions by assouline and mualem 2002 and bagarello et al 2023 can be read as indicative that different kinds of alteration can have a similar impact on soil changes in the sense that the infiltration parameters of the disturbed and undisturbed soil remain linked to each other the existence of a relationship between the infiltration parameters determined at two different times might have some practical interest for example differences between the b1 and b3 data were mainly explained by soil disturbance phenomena since antecedent soil water content effects were unlikely or small therefore relationships developed with these two datasets could be used to predict the local impact of soil disturbance using non disturbed soil data e g b3 vs b1 relationship or conversely to estimate non disturbed soil properties from disturbed soil data b1 vs b3 relationships according to the imed relationship of fig 3 a non disturbed point with imed 250 mm h will nearly maintain the same infiltration rate after disturbance 243 mm h disturbed non disturbed condition 0 97 while at a non disturbed location with imed 1000 mm h soil disturbance will have a larger effect since the expectation is to obtain a imed value of nearly 600 mm h disturbed non disturbed condition 0 60 using these relationships for predictive purposes requires that they are statistically significant and also strong according to this investigation the most favorable conditions to develop such a kind of predictive relationships occur when a nearly dry soil is sampled at different times and with reference to mean and final infiltration rates table 5 and fig 3 in other cases that is with a wet vs dry soil sampling and for other infiltration parameters such as the initial infiltration rate and the decay constant these relationships appear more uncertain even if they are significant due to a large data scattering and or to the presence of one or a few data points that strongly influence the results of the regression analysis the lack of any effect of the applied rainfall intensity on the soil hydrodynamic parameters determined after rainfall could appear puzzling since the expectation was to obtain slower infiltration rates with more intense rainfall events given that rainfall energy increases in this case wischmeier and smith 1978 and this circumstance could determine more alteration of the surface soil layer and hence less infiltration however soil changes due to rainfall impact depend on different factors assouline and mualem 1997 and rainfall kinetic energy does not always explains changes in soil physical properties zumr et al 2019 since raindrop impact can be both a formative and a disruptive agent in the process of seal development seginer and morin 1970 neave and rayburg 2007 in this investigation a fixed rainfall depth was applied with different intensities when rainfall intensity was relatively small mechanical impact effects were likely relatively limited but the soil was wetted for a relatively long time period wetting duration was shorter when high rainfall intensities were employed but in this case mechanical impact was likely more relevant in other words a possible explanation of the lack of a rainfall intensity effect on the soil infiltration parameters was that soil deterioration was similar for the different treatments since relatively small rainfall intensities determined less impact effects but there was more time for swelling interparticle weakening and migration of particles with large intensities impact effects were more appreciable whereas the other phenomena were less relevant this interpretation appears consistent with the suggestion by bagarello et al 2023 that different kinds of soil deterioration could have a similar effect on the measurable soil hydrodynamic parameters 5 conclusions infiltration parameters obtained by 3d beerkan runs changed during short term nearly two weeks wetting and drying cycles of an initially dry loam soil as compared with the initial conditions smaller values of the soil infiltration parameters should be expected soon after wetting but also when the soil returns to wetting conditions close to the antecedent ones relative variability of these parameters decreases too temporal changes of soil hydrodynamic parameters appear expressive of the combined effects of variations in the soil water content soil disturbance and perhaps soil recovery processes for a given rainfall depth changing intensities could not induce appreciable differences in soil infiltration parameters since a smaller intensity implies a longer wetting and hence more opportunities for swelling and interparticle bonds weakening whereas a more intense event is shorter but it has a stronger mechanical effect on the soil surface nevertheless even in such a general scenario a link can remain recognizable between the infiltration parameters determined in the subsequent runs of a sequence therefore a non uniform wetting of a field does not necessarily compromise the possibility to find a link between the characteristics of the disturbed soil and those of the same soil in an undisturbed condition it seems therefore that the soil is able to experience a kind of memory effect to our knowledge this is one of the first times that this result was obtained by submitting directly in the field different sampling points to different wetting treatments the results of this investigation reinforced the suggestion that the hydrodynamic response of a disturbed soil is related to that of the initial soil from which it develops and also that it depends more on the fact that the soil was altered by wetting than on the particular mechanism that caused alteration of course a single experiment is not enough to propose conclusions of general validity other tests should be performed at this aim in other soils and antecedent conditions other scenarios should also be considered and particularly those of uniform wetting treatments and absence of any additional wetting other than those performed for sampling experimental improvements could include independent determination of the soil water retention curve at different times to check pore size distribution and also a direct monitoring of soil water content at the infiltration sampling points together with measurements of bulk density of soil volumes having the same management and wetting drying history of the sampled soil for the infiltration measurements these additional investigations could help to better explain short term temporal variability of soil hydrodynamic properties in situations more similar to the real ones and hence to improve our ability to describe the soil for hydrological modelling purposes credit authorship contribution statement m agosta data curation investigation writing review

1713,numerical simulation of unsaturated soil hydrology relies on calibrated soil hydraulic parameters which are subject to uncertainty due to imperfect information during the inverse modelling this study investigates the effectiveness of reducing parameter uncertainty using the recently developed rosetta 3 pedotransfer function the glue method was employed for numerical modeling using the darcy richards equation under two strategies for sampling mualem van genuchten mvg parameters the first uses conventional random generation of mvg parameters glue random while the second adopts rosetta 3 to transfer soil particle composition to mvg parameter glue rosetta both approaches were used for inverse modeling of 9 typical soils each with a recommended parameter set defined as true values and associated soil moisture dynamics as observations the posterior parameters selected with both glue random and glue rosetta show an equifinality phenomenon glue random fails to provide well constrained posterior parameters to recover the pre defined true values and its posterior results of soil water characteristic curve swcc and soil hydraulic conductivity function hcf are poorly constrained in contrast glue rosetta significantly improves the accuracy of the inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameters and the ensemble of posterior swcc and hcf also encompasses the predefined true curves the results demonstrate the effectiveness of using rosetta 3 to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem which results in reliable estimation of soil hydraulic parameters and soil particle compositions moreover glue rosetta outperforms glue random in predicting soil moisture dynamics under different rainfall intensities overall it is recommended to integrate rosetta 3 with existing optimization tools to reduce the uncertainty of soil parameters and support more reliable modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology keywords soil hydraulic parameters equifinality phenomenon glue method rosetta pedotransfer function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction darcy richards equation is commonly used to describe soil moisture dynamics in various fields including unsaturated soil hydrology agriculture management geotechnical engineering and earth system modeling montzka et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhang and schaap 2019 however natural soils have significant variations in particle composition and pore structure resulting in distinct hydraulic properties or et al 2000 the accuracy and reliability of unsaturated soil hydrology simulations heavily rely on the appropriate parametrization of soil hydraulic properties cho 2014 liu and wang 2021 xu et al 2022 soil water characteristic curve swcc and soil hydraulic function hcf are used to describe the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils which are related to storage and transport characteristics rudiyanto et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 existing models of swcc and hcf differ in their conceptualization and mathematical formulations for example swcc in the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 and the campbell model campbell 1985 includes one parameter to express air entry pressure or capillary rise under near saturated conditions in contrast the swcc proposed by van genuchten van genuchten 1980 excludes the air entry pressure and established a continuous relation between pore water pressure and soil moisture content from residual to saturated water content the van genuchten model is widely used due to its continuous swcc which better characterizes the water storage behavior in natural soils and provides a rather robust numerical scheme for the darcy richards equation ippisch et al 2006 luo et al 2019 soil hydraulic properties can be determined through experimental approach durner and iden 2011 gallage et al 2013 or inverse modeling approach gutmann and small 2007 obtaining swcc via an experimental approach commonly involves using centrifuges or pressure plate apparatus in laboratory tests on soil samples additionally saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be measured by infiltrometer assisting in investigating the subsurface hydrological conditions dai et al 2013 goyal et al 2019 however each single experimental test can only represent the soil hydraulic properties for a certain limited area when aiming to quantify the spatially varied soil hydraulic properties it commonly requires a large number of experiments berti and simoni 2010 liu and wang 2021 inverse modeling approach integrates parameter optimization algorithms in vadose zone models to either find a best fitted parameter set or an ensemble of posterior parameter sets inverse modeling relies on soil moisture data which can be obtained through remote sensing or in situ measurement charoenhirunyingyos et al 2011 dong et al 2016 moreover the inverse modeling approach can support more comprehensive analysis e g identification of temporal variation of soil hydraulic properties gabriel et al 2019 le bourgeois et al 2016 shao et al 2022 it is well recognized that soil hydraulic properties are intimately associated with physical properties of soil particle composition pedotransfer functions employ either artificial neural network ann systems or nonlinear functions to study existing soil hydraulic databases which can build empirical relations between soil hydraulic parameters and soil particle composition mcneill et al 2018 van looy et al 2017 vereecken et al 2010 weber et al 2020 pedotransfer functions can serve as a parameterization strategy because they can transfer easily measurable soil texture information to soil hydraulic parameters chirico et al 2007 schaap et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 when soil texture maps are available pedotransfer functions can be applied to the global scale dai et al 2019 van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 among the several well developed pedotransfer functions vereecken et al 1989 w√∂sten et al 2001 zhang and schaap 2017 rosetta may be the most widely used rosetta was essentially an artificial neural network ann trained with a soil database containing 2134 soil samples with water retention data and 1306 soil samples with measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivities rosetta can generate soil hydraulic parameters of mvg model following uni variate and bi variate probability distributions zhang and schaap 2017 the early version of rosetta 1 based on fortran programming language has been incorporated to the software hydrus assefa and woodbury 2013 schaap et al 2001 ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 the upgrade version of rosetta 3 based on python 3 programming language conveniently supports newly developed numerical models zhang and schaap 2017 moreover rosetta 3 improves the performance of transferring soil texture to soil hydraulic parameters and provides a more accurate estimation of swcc and hcf zhang and schaap 2017 however all pedotransfer functions have uncertainty because soil hydraulic properties are dictated with pore structures rather than particle size distribution arya and paris 1981 campos guereta et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 no studies have yet investigated the uncertainties associated with implementing rosetta 3 to the darcy richards equation which is the primary focus of our initiative for this study the glue method has been widely used for uncertainty analysis candela et al 2005 etminan et al 2021 unlike other parameter optimization techniques e g genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization which attempt to find parameter set with the best performance ines and mohanty 2008 the glue method attempts to find posterior probability densities of the parameter sets by applying a monte carlo method to evaluate the likelihood of a large number of randomly generated parameter sets all the parameters with likelihood larger than a threshold are regarded as valid kan et al 2020 liang et al 2021 yang et al 2008 in the glue method an ensemble of posterior parameters is adopted to avoid falling into local optima therefore glue tries to fully explore all the possibilities in parameter space especially for the parameter space of the mvg model featuring highly nonlinear characteristics and relatively low dimensionality the glue method could be a suitable tool to investigate the uncertainty in parameterization the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters existing in soil hydrological modeling and 2 to further quantify the impacts of equifinality phenomenon on simulations of soil moisture dynamics under natural rainfall conditions the uncertainty analysis is conducted for the most widely used numerical model based on the darcy richards equation parameterized with mvg equations systematic numerical experiments are designed for nine typical soil textures under a transient rainfall condition the glue method is integrated with both conventional random sampling glue random and the rosetta 3 pedotransfer function glue rosetta to obtain posterior parameters and simulations comparison between glue random and glue rosetta focus on 1 whether the posterior soil hydraulic parameters can enclose the predefined true parameter values or show equifinality phenomenon 2 whether the posterior swcc and hcf are well constrained with a small uncertainty band 3 whether the posterior parameters also perform well under different intensities of rainfall finally we try to illustrate the causes of uncertainty when using conventional random sampling strategies e g glue random and offer insight into the necessity of integrating rosetta 3 to reduce the uncertainty in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology 2 methods 2 1 unsaturated flow model vertical water flow in unsaturated porous media can be simulated by the richards equation baum et al 2010 1 c h t z k h z 1 where t t is time z l is depth positive upward h l is pressure head c l 1 is differential water capacity and k l t 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity effective saturation is the normalized volumetric water content ranging from zero saturation to full saturation 2 s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r where s e is effective saturation Œ∏ l 3 l 3 is volumetric water content Œ∏ r l 3 l 3 is residual water content and Œ∏ s l 3 l 3 is saturated water content the soil water characteristic curve proposed by van genuchten 1980 adopts a nonlinear function to describe relationships between effective saturation and pore water pressure 3 s e 1 Œ± h n m where Œ± l 1 m and n are shape parameters the parameter m is commonly approximated to 1 1 n obtaining a closed form of the hydraulic conductivity by combining swcc with the pore bundle model mualem 1976 4 k k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s l t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is an empirical parameter generally 0 5 2 2 rosetta 3 pedotransfer function for a monte carlo analysis soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten model can be generated through a rosetta pedotransfer function with five options of hierarchical models table 1 the first model h1w is a simple lookup table for each usda soil textural class including recommended parameter sets for 12 typical soil types the second model h2w to fifth model h5w are essentially artificial neural network pedotransfer systems trained with bootstrap resampling of soil hydraulic data with the infinite possibility of soil particle composition i e the fraction of sand silt and clay particle according to the usda classification as inputs the second model h2w to fifth model h5w support continuous prediction for whole soil texture triangle the h2w solely uses soil particle composition as input and it is featured with simplicity and flexibility to apply to various types of soils moreover other hierarchical models require additional input of bulk density h3w h4w h5w and water content at field capacity and wilting point h4w h5w h4w and h5w may provide a more accurate description for soils under special conditions e g extremely low or high densities after tillage or compression because in these cases the water content at field capacity and wilting point pore water pressure at 33 kpa and 1500 kpa may be rather different from normal values this study is designed for natural soil under normal environmental conditions hence the h2w model in rosetta 3 zhang and schaap 2017 can describe soil hydraulic properties for various soils with sufficient accuracy especially h2w model solely uses soil particle composition as input and its degree of freedom is 2 from a theoretical point of view soil particle composition satisfies sand clay loam 100 the h2w model in rosetta 3 may reduce the dimensionality of parameter space in the mvg model thus reducing the uncertainty of estimated soil hydraulic parameters 2 3 glue method the glue method is based on a monte carlo analysis using a latin hypercube sampling method the method typically requires a sufficient number of simulations to fully explore the parameter space the model s performance can be evaluated with a single objective likelihood function e g an equation assumes the error residuals are uncorrelated and obey a normal distribution beven and freer 2001 vrugt et al 2022 vrugt et al 2008 in hydrological study the likelihood function required for the glue method can be replaced with

nse is applied to evaluate model performance according to the model evaluation criteria nse is sensitive to extreme values due to the squared difference the range of nse is between and 1 0 where 1 0 means a perfect match of simulations to observations a threshold of acceptance is defined in the glue method to judge whether a parameter set has satisfying performance in its model simulation parameter sets with lower likelihood than the defined threshold of acceptance will be regarded as inappropriate for modeling the posterior probability density function pdf of each parameter can be obtained through a statistical analysis of parameters with a likelihood larger than the threshold of acceptance all the simulated results based on the posterior parameter sets compose an ensemble and the uncertainty band of such ensemble indicates the ranges of possible local optimum simulation the threshold of acceptance may be specified according to research purpose a strict criterion may lead to a small uncertainty band which may be closer to the best fitted simulation a less strict criteria may obtain a larger number of parameter sets which may provide more comprehensive information on posterior results the equifinality phenomenon can be revealed through the posterior probabilistic distribution of estimated soil hydraulic parameters results of monte carlo simulations can be plotted as scattered dots in a figure specifying x axis as parameter value and y axis as the likelihood the dots located at the top represent the parameter sets with the best fitted simulation of observation and other dots within the likelihood range represent other acceptable parameter sets with less satisfying simulation excluded dots represent parameters sets with poor performance in terms of lower likelihood than the threshold of acceptance the shape of the envelope covering the likelihood values is denoted as a response surface indicating whether the performance of simulation is sensitive to the specified parameter apparently a curved shape of response surface or posterior probability distribution indicates a sensitive relation between model performance and parameter values whereas a flat shape indicates a significant equifinality phenomenon equifinality phenomenon brings a confusion on evaluating whether one parameter set is better than the others and it is questionable whether the accepted parameter sets perform equally well in the prediction period in addition the root mean square error rmse is used as an indicator to evaluate model performance 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n Œ∏ t r u e Œ∏ s i m 2 for each parameter set the likelihood measure i e nse in this study together with rmse are used to evaluate the performance of output variables 2 4 modeling strategy the hypothesis adopted in numerical modeling considers unsaturated flow in relatively homogeneous soil under transient rainfall only a basic version of single domain darcy richards equation was adopted under python 3 programming environment the mvg parameters were generated either randomly or through rosetta 3 pedotransfer function then the numerical simulation of unsaturated soil hydrology was based on an author developed python script for solving the darcy richards equation shao et al 2016 the numerical scheme used the implicit finite difference method and picard iteration technique to ensure the mass balance and numerical accuracy the input of meteorological forcing data was consecutive rainfall with a duration of 30 days in a rainy season measured in a mountainous area in southwest china the lower boundary was gravitational drainage in the numerical analysis we excluded more comprehensive specifications in terms of physical processes e g preferential flow parameterization e g hysteresis swcc anisotropic layered soil and boundary conditions e g plant transpiration soil surface evaporation because the associated extra parameters may increase the dimensionality of parameter optimization problem consequently the numerical analysis focused on uncertainty in the parameterization of soil hydraulic properties nine soil textures according to usda classification were included for uncertainty analysis we excluded the soil textures of clay silty clay and sandy clay which may be less frequently found in the soil hydraulic database nemes et al 2001 quantification of soil hydraulic properties of fine textured soil is always time consuming during the experiment which may be the reason why they take only a small faction in the soil hydraulic database thomas et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 it is worth noticing that the h2w model in rosetta 3 can certainly be implemented to all possibilities of particle compositions in the whole textural triangle for classified 12 soil types however the selected 9 soil textures in this study may be sufficient to represent typical soils the simulations of soil moisture dynamics for the 9 typical soils were provided in section 3 1 which were regarded as true values i e observation for inverse modeling the true parameter set and its corresponding time series of soil moisture dynamics were defined for implementing the glue method for glue random pre defined true soil hydraulic parameters directly adopted typical soil hydraulic parameters table 2 in glue rosetta the true soil particle compositions were shown in fig 1 and table 3 and transferred mvg parameters were shown in table 4 the glue method was used to explore the soil hydraulic parameter space by picking up sufficient parameter sets that gave a reasonable prediction of the pre defined true soil moisture dynamics two different parameterization approaches were used to generate soil hydraulic parameters in mvg model for monte carlo analysis the first randomly generates mvg parameters of Œ∏ r Œ∏ s k s Œ± and n which is referred as glue random and the second strategy use rosetta 3 to transfer soil particle compositions to mvg parameters clearly the glue method integrated with rosetta has less degree of freedom referring to glue rosetta for the implementation of glue random parameters Œ± n and k s were log transformed because their distributions were skewed the soil hydraulic parameters transferred through rosetta were listed as l o g 10 Œ± l o g 10 n l o g 10 k s that are consistent with glue random the glue method commonly generates each parameter obeying a uniform probability distribution in its parameter range however other choices of probability distribution e g normal or lognormal distribution of soil hydraulic parameter may affect posterior pdf in this study a uniform probability distribution was specified for random sampling of soil hydraulic parameters for glue random or soil particle compositions for glue rosetta in glue random the specified ranges of mvg parameters were equally wide to cover all the possible soil hydraulic properties for all soil textures table 5 similarly in glue rosetta specified soil particle composition with a uniform distribution can evenly cover the entire soil texture triangle and then these soil particle compositions were transferred to mvg parameters using rosetta 3 for each method 10 000 parameter sets were generated to represent all possible combinations of the five soil hydraulic parameters the threshold of acceptance for the glue method is defined as nse 0 7 the threshold can only be defined after all simulations have been completed so we can evaluate the overall model performance of all the generated parameter sets the threshold of acceptance must enable the selection of a sufficient number of parameter sets to obtain comprehensive posterior results while guaranteeing accurate performance in simulation of soil moisture the pdf of accepted soil hydraulic parameter were approximated with a fitted curve using ksdensity function in matlab statistical toolbox we did not provide an envelope to mimic a response surface because our glue random results have rather flat response surface showing significant equifinality phenomenon with the above mentioned modeling strategies the content of the results was organized as follows the pre defined true soil moisture dynamics of 9 typical soils were given in section 3 1 section 3 2 focuses on evaluating the abilities of glue random and glue rosetta in recovering the predefined true parameter the data dots of posterior soil hydraulic parameter vs nse values were given in fig 3 together with fitted posterior pdf curves to reveal equifinality phenomena other results were plotted as uncertainty bands to express the ensemble of simulations including posterior soil moisture fig 4 section 3 3 posterior soil particle compositions of glue rosetta fig 6 section 3 4 posterior swcc and hcf figs 7 and 8 section 3 5 and the predicted soil moisture dynamics under two other rainfalls using the posterior soil hydraulic parameters fig 9 and fig 10 section 3 6 the discussion section clarified the following issues 1 the modeling strategies 2 correlations of constrained mvg parameters with rosetta 3 and 3 the necessity of using rosetta 3 in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology 3 results 3 1 predefined true soil moisture dynamics of 9 typical soils for both glue random and glue rosetta the soil moisture dynamics simulated using the pre defined true soil hydraulic parameters table 2 4 are shown in fig 2 for all soil types the peak soil moisture content occurs after a high intensity rain pulse and the lowest point occurs after sufficient time of drainage similar magnitudes of variations can be found in soil moisture dynamics of different soil types however the soil moisture dynamics fluctuated in different ranges revealing different storage properties among soils for example the soil moisture dynamics of the typical silt soil fluctuated from 0 3060 to 0 4012 indicating high storage properties fig 2b while the soil moisture dynamics of the typical sand soil under the same rainfall were in a range of 0 0619 to 0 3407 3 2 equifinality phenomenon in posterior soil hydraulic parameters in this study the glue approach was implemented for the monte carlo analysis of 10 000 group soil hydraulic parameters generated randomly referring to as glue random or through rosetta pedotransfer function referring to as glue rosetta fig 3 shows the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters as dotty plots of nse coefficients versus soil hydraulic parameters shown in different columns with nine soil textures shown in different rows the true soil hydraulic parameters of typical soils plotted as vertical lines in fig 3 indicated weak correlations with soil textures the true Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s had weak negative relations with soil texture whereas other three parameters log 10 Œ± l o g 10 n l o g 10 k s generally increased from fine texture soils to coarse texture soils each subfigure in fig 3 contained dots of nse vs parameters values facilitating a direct comparison of the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters under glue random and glue rosetta the nse values were used as indicators to express the model performance under different parameter sets among different soil types fine texture soil commonly led to accurate simulations in comparison with true soil moisture dynamics with their highest nse values commonly 0 95 on the contrary for the coarse soil texture of sand the nse values were less than 0 90 indicating less satisfying numerical simulations the relatively low performance of sandy soils may be related to the low variation in the true soil moisture dynamics the ranges of scattered dots were equivalent to the ranges of posterior probabilistic distribution of each parameter the uncertainties can be revealed by the range of posterior pdf and the response surface of each parameter for all the five soil hydraulic parameters the ranges of mvg parameters generated by glue random were significantly wider than those generated by glue rosetta significant uncertainties existed in the soil hydraulic parameters selected by glue random method because the ranges of the posterior pdf of k s may deviate from the true values for fine textured soils with random sampling strategy the selected mvg soil hydraulic parameters failed to recover the predefined true parameter values on the contrary posterior pdf of parameters generated by the glue rosetta method can recover the true parameters with much higher accuracy the scatter diagram of the nse vs soil hydraulic parameters fig 3 indicated that the parameter sets selected by glue random had irregular posterior pdf curves and flat response surfaces indicating the equifinality phenomenon on the contrary parameters generated through the rosetta pedotransfer function could significantly reduce the equifinality phenomenon fig 3 3 3 ensemble of simulated soil moisture content in this study parameter sets with a performance of nse 0 7 were considered as equal acceptance and all the simulated soil moisture dynamics nse 0 7 under the selected soil hydraulic parameter sets were shown in fig 4 ensembles of simulated soil moisture content had relatively narrow uncertainty bands showing high agreement with the true soil moisture dynamics fig 4 the boxplot of r m s e Œ∏ of the simulated soil moisture also indicated small error shown in fig 5 the acceptance of simulated soil moisture obtained with both of glue random and glue rosetta led to quite small r m s e Œ∏ the least r m s e Œ∏ of coarse texture soil of sand and loamy sand showed larger values around 0 04 and 0 06 meaning the best fitted results of the two coarse soil textures were less satisfying for fine texture soils the least r m s e Œ∏ were close to 0 002 which implied the best fitted results obtained by glue random and glue rosetta provided an accurate simulation to the defined true soil moisture content the boxplot of r m s e Œ∏ indicated an overall performance of simulated soil moisture dynamics with parameter sets with equal acceptance the median r m s e Œ∏ of glue rosetta were consistently smaller than that of glue random except for silty clay loam which suggested that the soil moisture content simulated by parameter sets generated through glue rosetta had better performance compared to glue random 3 4 posterior soil particle composition of glue rosetta on soil texture triangle the posterior soil particle composition of the glue rosetta was plotted in soil texture triangles fig 6 the color bar represented the nse of simulated soil moisture dynamics using the soil hydraulic parameters transferred by rosetta nse of limited data dots was interpolated to obtain a continuous map in the soil texture triangle different from the analyses in section 3 2 3 3 adopting a threshold of acceptance of nse 0 7 see fig 3 here the ranges of nse were specified as 0 1 0 to include more comprehensive information on model performance under different soil particle compositions fig 6 the glue random method can only straightforwardly generate mvg parameters but there is no method to reversely transfer soil hydraulic parameter to soil particle composition the soil texture triangles only include the posterior soil particle composition selected with the glue rosetta for all the 9 typical soils texture considered in this study the nse contours were featured with strip shapes in the soil texture triangle the core of each strip was in a color of red representing nse 0 9 while the color from blue to yellow represented nse between 0 and 0 7 the soil particle composition that was closer to the core of each strip usually had a larger nse indicating better model performance except for the sandy soil with the highest nse of 0 7394 the highest nse value of other eight soil types were all 0 99 according to the model evaluation criteria the overall performance of numerical simulations was acceptable all the strips had a relatively narrow range in comparison with the scales of the soil texture triangle the true values of the predefined soil particle composition see table 3 were exactly lying in the core of the strips meaning that the posterior soil texture can recover the predefined true values however the core of each strip may cross the soil texture triangles indicating equifinality phenomenon in glue rosetta 3 5 posterior swcc and hcf for both glue random and glue rosetta the ensembles of posterior swcc and hcf were respectively plotted in fig 7 and fig 8 as uncertainty bands and the true values estimated with predefined true soil hydraulic parameters were plotted as solid lines the swcc and hcf had similar shapes and curvatures whereas their ranges differed among soil textures and parameterizations the values of predefined true soil hydraulic parameters for glue random and glue rosetta were different table 2 and table 4 which led to different swcc and hcf curves for all typical soil types fig 7 and fig 8 the discrepancies of soil hydraulic properties of selected parameters through glue random and glue rosetta were significant under low saturation conditions the uncertainty bands of swcc and hcf described with soil hydraulic parameters selected through glue rosetta were much narrower in comparison with those generated through glue random it implies the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters selected through glue rosetta were much smaller than glue random for all the selected soil types 3 6 predication of soil moisture dynamics under different rainfall to evaluate the performance of parameter sets selected by glue random and glue rosetta during the predication periods we conducted numerical simulations of soil moisture dynamics under two extra rainfall conditions specifically rainfall time series with doubled intensities leading to higher saturation condition case 1 and half intensities leading to lower saturation condition case 2 respectively the simulated soil moisture dynamics using the selected soil hydraulic parameters are provided in fig 9 and fig 10 under the two rainfall conditions and the r m s e Œ∏ in comparison with the defined true soil moisture dynamics are shown in fig 11 the ranges of fluctuating soil moisture dynamic were larger under rainfall intensity of case 1 fig 9 and smaller under rainfall intensity of case 2 fig 10 as for the model performance the r m s e Œ∏ under the two different rainfall condition fig 11 indicated a relatively satisfying simulations although the errors were generally larger than the calibration period fig 5 moreover for both calibration and predication periods the r m s e Œ∏ of parameter sets selected by glue rosetta consistently outperformed glue random which suggests that the parameter set generated by glue rosetta may be more suited to simulate soil moisture dynamics 4 discussion 4 1 analyzing for parameter uncertainty uncertainties in modeling of unsaturated hydrology arise from multiple sources including model structure parameterization observation initial and boundary conditions liang et al 2021 samadi et al 2017 yang et al 2008 the importance of these uncertainties in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology may vary the possible combination of mvg parameter provides a large degree of flexibility in describing soil hydraulic properties making it the most important source of uncertainties initial conditions can only affect the simulation of soil moisture dynamics for a limited period and their uncertainty becomes negligible after a few cycles of drainage and infiltration upper boundary conditions e g evaporation and precipitation can drive unsaturated flow and therefore significantly affect the soil moisture dynamics bauser et al 2016 dong et al 2016 uncertainties in model structure arise from theoretical flaws in the standard darcy richards equation e g the neglection of preferential flow shao et al 2016 shao et al 2015 the modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology can be improved by including more comprehensive processes or parameterization e g modifications to the dual permeability model and parameterization of hysteresis swcc etc but these modifications often introduced additional parameters that increased the degree of freedom in the parameter space ultimately the choices of how to simulate the real soil depends on the environmental conditions and the purpose of study after determining the model structure and boundary conditions additional efforts may be taken to reduce the uncertainties in parameterization this study only focuses on uncertainty originating from soil hydraulic parameters and other sources of uncertainty are neglected however in real cased study modeling of soil moisture dynamics is mutually affected by uncertainties in model structure parameterizations and errors in input and output variables making it difficult to separate uncertainties from parameterization kan et al 2020 liang et al 2021 samadi et al 2017 in this study numerical simulations using the darcy richards equation with mvg parameterization consider a single layer homogenous soil for nine typical soil texture the true soil hydraulic parameters were predetermined and their modeling results of soil moisture dynamics were also regarded as observed true in this way uncertainties from model conceptualization input of rainfall and output of observed soil moisture were excluded facilitating the identification of the equifinality phenomenon caused by parameterization 4 2 why can rosetta reduce equifinality phenomenon how the glue rosetta reduces the equifinality phenomenon may be revealed through a correlation analysis of posterior soil hydraulic parameters taking clay loam as an example the correlation analysis of soil hydraulic parameters generated by glue rosetta and glue random is shown in fig 12 and fig 13 similar analyses for other eight soil types are included in the supplementary material figs s1 s16 in comparison with glue random whose correlation coefficient ranges from 0 39 to 0 61 parameters generated through glue rosetta feature stronger correlation with coefficient ranges 0 99 to 0 93 in glue random the correlation between Œ∏ s and l o g 10 n is the highest 0 61 whereas other parameters have weaker correlations in glue rosetta the correlation analysis of parameters indicated much stronger correlations especially for l o g 10 Œ± l o g 10 n 0 99 Œ∏ s l o g 10 Œ± 0 95 and Œ∏ s l o g 10 n 0 93 which provide evidence of significantly reduced degree of freedom in parameter space besides other parameters e g Œ∏ s l o g 10 k s are also featured with strong correlation of 0 58 the parameter Œ∏ r may have weak impacts on simulated soil moisture whereas its correlation coefficients with l o g 10 Œ± l o g 10 n and l o g 10 k s are 0 66 0 75 and 0 05 respectively high correlations between parameters commonly imply that the parameter space has more degree of freedom than necessary glue random and glue rosetta differ in their sampling strategies in their parameter spaces the glue random directly generates the five mvg parameters and the dimensionality of its parameter space is five the glue rosetta solely uses soil particle composition as inputs and dimensionality is reduced to two from a theoretical point of view zhang and schaap 2017 therefore glue rosetta has less degree of freedom in its parameter space which is associated with significantly reduced equifinality phenomenon fig 3 and fewer uncertainties in posterior results fig 7 fig 11 in conclusion rosetta 3 can reduce the dimensionality in parameter optimization and the strong correlations among parameters can reduce the uncertainty in modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology natural soils are self organized and it is well recognized that the swcc and k s are strongly correlated with soil texture for example based on a theoretical derivation of pore size distribution guarracino 2007 developed a quadratic relation between mvg parameter k s and Œ± that is consistence with the 12 typical soil texture groups however how to identify the correlations in soil hydraulic parameters from more informative data remains an unsolved issue the correlations identified through glue rosetta can be regarded as an achievement of correctly including prior information from soil hydraulic database the results in this study solidly support the reliability of using rosetta 3 in parameter optimization 1 posterior soil hydraulic parameters have an increasing trend from fine texture soil to coarse texture soil which is consistent with existing knowledge 2 the posterior soil particle compositions correctly encompass the predefined true soil texture information as seen in fig 6 section 3 4 overall this study enhances the understanding of soil hydraulic properties in major soil types and the result of glue rosetta provide more comprehensive information on posterior soil hydraulic parameter of the nine typical soil texture 4 3 necessity of using rosetta 3 in unsaturated soil hydrology the soil hydraulic parameters in swcc and hcf describe the hydraulic properties from the residual water content to saturated water content and this saturation range was commonly wider than the measurable soil moisture dynamics under natural conditions for example natural soils located in humid areas may rarely reach residual water content similarly in arid area due to low initial saturation condition soil may rarely reach saturation until unanticipated extreme rainfall occurs the uncertainty analysis in section 3 1 3 5 considered a 30 day consecutive rainfall which is not able to drive the soil moisture content to cross the full saturation range in order to reveal how incomplete information affected the inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameter the pdf of soil moisture data of sandy loam and silt clay were plotted in fig 14 a b clearly the availability of soil moisture data only covers a fraction of the full saturation range small uncertainties in posterior swcc and hcf can only be found in the ranges with informative soil moisture data however for the low saturation and high saturation range significant discrepancies can be found in the all the three selected posterior swcc and hcf the analysis clearly manifests two issues 1 equifinal soil hydraulic parameter described rather differed swcc and hcf fig 7 fig 8 and fig 14 2 rosetta 3 reduced the uncertainties in comparison with random sampling of mvg parameters during natural rainfall it is impossible to observe a soil moisture time series evenly distributed from residual to saturated water content such incomplete information may undermine the reliability of inverse modeling calibrated soil hydraulic parameters in rainy periods may embed large uncertainties for modeling in dry period and vice versa however correct simulation of soil moisture during a drought period is essential for ecohydrology in arid and semi arid regions especially when extreme drought events have become more frequent during the last few decades hoover et al 2022 konapala and mishra 2017 yuan et al 2023 in vegetated soils soil moisture dynamics from field capacity to wilting point strongly interact with ecosystem resilience especially during long lasting drought periods when vegetation survival may rely on root water uptake from soil moisture van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 similarly in arid areas calibrated soil hydraulic parameters under relatively dry period may not cope with high saturation conditions under high intensity rainfall the changing environment challenges the reliability of current parameterizing strategies considering rosetta 3 has appropriately included the prior knowledge of hydraulic properties of natural soils its integration with inverse modeling may be more reliable than the random generating soil hydraulic parameters the rosetta adopted in this study is an improved version rosetta 3 that unifies the swcc and hcf submodules into one the soil hydraulic parameters were empirically bounded for maximum performance especially the soil hydraulic parameters generated by rosetta pedotransfer function need to be constrained when the ann models were calibrated with incomplete soil hydraulic data that caused difficulties in completely measuring the swcc and hcf for low saturation range thus the pedotransfer function of rosetta comprehensively considers dry to saturation soil hydraulic parameters besides rosetta 3 also considers the weight of soil hydraulic parameters to reduce the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters and these factors carried the same weight as the fitted soil hydraulic parameters should lead to perfect smooth swcc and hcf curves overall it is recommended to use rosetta to provide more constrained soil hydraulic parameter sets for reducing the uncertainty in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology 5 conclusions this study used the glue method to explore the uncertainty in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology a numerical experiment was conducted for nine typical soils under the same initial and rainfall conditions and the model structure adopted the darcy richards equation and mvg parametrization two sampling strategies of mvg parameter were considered 1 conventional random sampling refer to as glue random and 2 using rosetta for sampling from soil particle composition glue rosetta the results indicated that both glue random and glue rosetta showed equifinality phenomenon however glue rosetta outperformed glue random in terms of 1 more accurately estimating posterior soil hydraulic parameter to recover predefined true values 2 better constrained posterior swcc and hcf and 3 better simulation of soil moisture dynamics for all three cases of rainfall conditions moreover glue rosetta provided correct estimation of posterior soil particle compositions in comparison with predefined true soil textures demonstrating its effectiveness in linking soil textures with soil hydraulic properties in inverse modeling of soil hydraulic parameter uncertainties in estimated swcc and hcf were caused by imperfection of soil moisture data that only cover an incomplete and limited saturation range the results clearly indicated the necessity of using prior information to constrain inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameters as rosetta 3 is a well trained ann networks built through a reliable soil hydraulic database it provides a more reliable estimation of hydraulic properties for real soils the correlation analysis showed that the parameters selected through glue rosetta were strongly correlated which reduced the dimensionality in parameter space in comparison with conventional random sampling rosetta 3 provided more reliable constraining of swcc and hfc therefore the integration of rosetta 3 with parameter optimization algorithms is recommended for more reliable modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology credit authorship contribution statement wei shao

1713,numerical simulation of unsaturated soil hydrology relies on calibrated soil hydraulic parameters which are subject to uncertainty due to imperfect information during the inverse modelling this study investigates the effectiveness of reducing parameter uncertainty using the recently developed rosetta 3 pedotransfer function the glue method was employed for numerical modeling using the darcy richards equation under two strategies for sampling mualem van genuchten mvg parameters the first uses conventional random generation of mvg parameters glue random while the second adopts rosetta 3 to transfer soil particle composition to mvg parameter glue rosetta both approaches were used for inverse modeling of 9 typical soils each with a recommended parameter set defined as true values and associated soil moisture dynamics as observations the posterior parameters selected with both glue random and glue rosetta show an equifinality phenomenon glue random fails to provide well constrained posterior parameters to recover the pre defined true values and its posterior results of soil water characteristic curve swcc and soil hydraulic conductivity function hcf are poorly constrained in contrast glue rosetta significantly improves the accuracy of the inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameters and the ensemble of posterior swcc and hcf also encompasses the predefined true curves the results demonstrate the effectiveness of using rosetta 3 to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem which results in reliable estimation of soil hydraulic parameters and soil particle compositions moreover glue rosetta outperforms glue random in predicting soil moisture dynamics under different rainfall intensities overall it is recommended to integrate rosetta 3 with existing optimization tools to reduce the uncertainty of soil parameters and support more reliable modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology keywords soil hydraulic parameters equifinality phenomenon glue method rosetta pedotransfer function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction darcy richards equation is commonly used to describe soil moisture dynamics in various fields including unsaturated soil hydrology agriculture management geotechnical engineering and earth system modeling montzka et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhang and schaap 2019 however natural soils have significant variations in particle composition and pore structure resulting in distinct hydraulic properties or et al 2000 the accuracy and reliability of unsaturated soil hydrology simulations heavily rely on the appropriate parametrization of soil hydraulic properties cho 2014 liu and wang 2021 xu et al 2022 soil water characteristic curve swcc and soil hydraulic function hcf are used to describe the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils which are related to storage and transport characteristics rudiyanto et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 existing models of swcc and hcf differ in their conceptualization and mathematical formulations for example swcc in the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 and the campbell model campbell 1985 includes one parameter to express air entry pressure or capillary rise under near saturated conditions in contrast the swcc proposed by van genuchten van genuchten 1980 excludes the air entry pressure and established a continuous relation between pore water pressure and soil moisture content from residual to saturated water content the van genuchten model is widely used due to its continuous swcc which better characterizes the water storage behavior in natural soils and provides a rather robust numerical scheme for the darcy richards equation ippisch et al 2006 luo et al 2019 soil hydraulic properties can be determined through experimental approach durner and iden 2011 gallage et al 2013 or inverse modeling approach gutmann and small 2007 obtaining swcc via an experimental approach commonly involves using centrifuges or pressure plate apparatus in laboratory tests on soil samples additionally saturated hydraulic conductivity k s can be measured by infiltrometer assisting in investigating the subsurface hydrological conditions dai et al 2013 goyal et al 2019 however each single experimental test can only represent the soil hydraulic properties for a certain limited area when aiming to quantify the spatially varied soil hydraulic properties it commonly requires a large number of experiments berti and simoni 2010 liu and wang 2021 inverse modeling approach integrates parameter optimization algorithms in vadose zone models to either find a best fitted parameter set or an ensemble of posterior parameter sets inverse modeling relies on soil moisture data which can be obtained through remote sensing or in situ measurement charoenhirunyingyos et al 2011 dong et al 2016 moreover the inverse modeling approach can support more comprehensive analysis e g identification of temporal variation of soil hydraulic properties gabriel et al 2019 le bourgeois et al 2016 shao et al 2022 it is well recognized that soil hydraulic properties are intimately associated with physical properties of soil particle composition pedotransfer functions employ either artificial neural network ann systems or nonlinear functions to study existing soil hydraulic databases which can build empirical relations between soil hydraulic parameters and soil particle composition mcneill et al 2018 van looy et al 2017 vereecken et al 2010 weber et al 2020 pedotransfer functions can serve as a parameterization strategy because they can transfer easily measurable soil texture information to soil hydraulic parameters chirico et al 2007 schaap et al 2001 vereecken et al 2010 when soil texture maps are available pedotransfer functions can be applied to the global scale dai et al 2019 van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 among the several well developed pedotransfer functions vereecken et al 1989 w√∂sten et al 2001 zhang and schaap 2017 rosetta may be the most widely used rosetta was essentially an artificial neural network ann trained with a soil database containing 2134 soil samples with water retention data and 1306 soil samples with measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivities rosetta can generate soil hydraulic parameters of mvg model following uni variate and bi variate probability distributions zhang and schaap 2017 the early version of rosetta 1 based on fortran programming language has been incorporated to the software hydrus assefa and woodbury 2013 schaap et al 2001 ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 the upgrade version of rosetta 3 based on python 3 programming language conveniently supports newly developed numerical models zhang and schaap 2017 moreover rosetta 3 improves the performance of transferring soil texture to soil hydraulic parameters and provides a more accurate estimation of swcc and hcf zhang and schaap 2017 however all pedotransfer functions have uncertainty because soil hydraulic properties are dictated with pore structures rather than particle size distribution arya and paris 1981 campos guereta et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 no studies have yet investigated the uncertainties associated with implementing rosetta 3 to the darcy richards equation which is the primary focus of our initiative for this study the glue method has been widely used for uncertainty analysis candela et al 2005 etminan et al 2021 unlike other parameter optimization techniques e g genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization which attempt to find parameter set with the best performance ines and mohanty 2008 the glue method attempts to find posterior probability densities of the parameter sets by applying a monte carlo method to evaluate the likelihood of a large number of randomly generated parameter sets all the parameters with likelihood larger than a threshold are regarded as valid kan et al 2020 liang et al 2021 yang et al 2008 in the glue method an ensemble of posterior parameters is adopted to avoid falling into local optima therefore glue tries to fully explore all the possibilities in parameter space especially for the parameter space of the mvg model featuring highly nonlinear characteristics and relatively low dimensionality the glue method could be a suitable tool to investigate the uncertainty in parameterization the objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters existing in soil hydrological modeling and 2 to further quantify the impacts of equifinality phenomenon on simulations of soil moisture dynamics under natural rainfall conditions the uncertainty analysis is conducted for the most widely used numerical model based on the darcy richards equation parameterized with mvg equations systematic numerical experiments are designed for nine typical soil textures under a transient rainfall condition the glue method is integrated with both conventional random sampling glue random and the rosetta 3 pedotransfer function glue rosetta to obtain posterior parameters and simulations comparison between glue random and glue rosetta focus on 1 whether the posterior soil hydraulic parameters can enclose the predefined true parameter values or show equifinality phenomenon 2 whether the posterior swcc and hcf are well constrained with a small uncertainty band 3 whether the posterior parameters also perform well under different intensities of rainfall finally we try to illustrate the causes of uncertainty when using conventional random sampling strategies e g glue random and offer insight into the necessity of integrating rosetta 3 to reduce the uncertainty in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology 2 methods 2 1 unsaturated flow model vertical water flow in unsaturated porous media can be simulated by the richards equation baum et al 2010 1 c h t z k h z 1 where t t is time z l is depth positive upward h l is pressure head c l 1 is differential water capacity and k l t 1 is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity effective saturation is the normalized volumetric water content ranging from zero saturation to full saturation 2 s e Œ∏ Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r where s e is effective saturation Œ∏ l 3 l 3 is volumetric water content Œ∏ r l 3 l 3 is residual water content and Œ∏ s l 3 l 3 is saturated water content the soil water characteristic curve proposed by van genuchten 1980 adopts a nonlinear function to describe relationships between effective saturation and pore water pressure 3 s e 1 Œ± h n m where Œ± l 1 m and n are shape parameters the parameter m is commonly approximated to 1 1 n obtaining a closed form of the hydraulic conductivity by combining swcc with the pore bundle model mualem 1976 4 k k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s l t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is an empirical parameter generally 0 5 2 2 rosetta 3 pedotransfer function for a monte carlo analysis soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten model can be generated through a rosetta pedotransfer function with five options of hierarchical models table 1 the first model h1w is a simple lookup table for each usda soil textural class including recommended parameter sets for 12 typical soil types the second model h2w to fifth model h5w are essentially artificial neural network pedotransfer systems trained with bootstrap resampling of soil hydraulic data with the infinite possibility of soil particle composition i e the fraction of sand silt and clay particle according to the usda classification as inputs the second model h2w to fifth model h5w support continuous prediction for whole soil texture triangle the h2w solely uses soil particle composition as input and it is featured with simplicity and flexibility to apply to various types of soils moreover other hierarchical models require additional input of bulk density h3w h4w h5w and water content at field capacity and wilting point h4w h5w h4w and h5w may provide a more accurate description for soils under special conditions e g extremely low or high densities after tillage or compression because in these cases the water content at field capacity and wilting point pore water pressure at 33 kpa and 1500 kpa may be rather different from normal values this study is designed for natural soil under normal environmental conditions hence the h2w model in rosetta 3 zhang and schaap 2017 can describe soil hydraulic properties for various soils with sufficient accuracy especially h2w model solely uses soil particle composition as input and its degree of freedom is 2 from a theoretical point of view soil particle composition satisfies sand clay loam 100 the h2w model in rosetta 3 may reduce the dimensionality of parameter space in the mvg model thus reducing the uncertainty of estimated soil hydraulic parameters 2 3 glue method the glue method is based on a monte carlo analysis using a latin hypercube sampling method the method typically requires a sufficient number of simulations to fully explore the parameter space the model s performance can be evaluated with a single objective likelihood function e g an equation assumes the error residuals are uncorrelated and obey a normal distribution beven and freer 2001 vrugt et al 2022 vrugt et al 2008 in hydrological study the likelihood function required for the glue method can be replaced with

nse is applied to evaluate model performance according to the model evaluation criteria nse is sensitive to extreme values due to the squared difference the range of nse is between and 1 0 where 1 0 means a perfect match of simulations to observations a threshold of acceptance is defined in the glue method to judge whether a parameter set has satisfying performance in its model simulation parameter sets with lower likelihood than the defined threshold of acceptance will be regarded as inappropriate for modeling the posterior probability density function pdf of each parameter can be obtained through a statistical analysis of parameters with a likelihood larger than the threshold of acceptance all the simulated results based on the posterior parameter sets compose an ensemble and the uncertainty band of such ensemble indicates the ranges of possible local optimum simulation the threshold of acceptance may be specified according to research purpose a strict criterion may lead to a small uncertainty band which may be closer to the best fitted simulation a less strict criteria may obtain a larger number of parameter sets which may provide more comprehensive information on posterior results the equifinality phenomenon can be revealed through the posterior probabilistic distribution of estimated soil hydraulic parameters results of monte carlo simulations can be plotted as scattered dots in a figure specifying x axis as parameter value and y axis as the likelihood the dots located at the top represent the parameter sets with the best fitted simulation of observation and other dots within the likelihood range represent other acceptable parameter sets with less satisfying simulation excluded dots represent parameters sets with poor performance in terms of lower likelihood than the threshold of acceptance the shape of the envelope covering the likelihood values is denoted as a response surface indicating whether the performance of simulation is sensitive to the specified parameter apparently a curved shape of response surface or posterior probability distribution indicates a sensitive relation between model performance and parameter values whereas a flat shape indicates a significant equifinality phenomenon equifinality phenomenon brings a confusion on evaluating whether one parameter set is better than the others and it is questionable whether the accepted parameter sets perform equally well in the prediction period in addition the root mean square error rmse is used as an indicator to evaluate model performance 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n Œ∏ t r u e Œ∏ s i m 2 for each parameter set the likelihood measure i e nse in this study together with rmse are used to evaluate the performance of output variables 2 4 modeling strategy the hypothesis adopted in numerical modeling considers unsaturated flow in relatively homogeneous soil under transient rainfall only a basic version of single domain darcy richards equation was adopted under python 3 programming environment the mvg parameters were generated either randomly or through rosetta 3 pedotransfer function then the numerical simulation of unsaturated soil hydrology was based on an author developed python script for solving the darcy richards equation shao et al 2016 the numerical scheme used the implicit finite difference method and picard iteration technique to ensure the mass balance and numerical accuracy the input of meteorological forcing data was consecutive rainfall with a duration of 30 days in a rainy season measured in a mountainous area in southwest china the lower boundary was gravitational drainage in the numerical analysis we excluded more comprehensive specifications in terms of physical processes e g preferential flow parameterization e g hysteresis swcc anisotropic layered soil and boundary conditions e g plant transpiration soil surface evaporation because the associated extra parameters may increase the dimensionality of parameter optimization problem consequently the numerical analysis focused on uncertainty in the parameterization of soil hydraulic properties nine soil textures according to usda classification were included for uncertainty analysis we excluded the soil textures of clay silty clay and sandy clay which may be less frequently found in the soil hydraulic database nemes et al 2001 quantification of soil hydraulic properties of fine textured soil is always time consuming during the experiment which may be the reason why they take only a small faction in the soil hydraulic database thomas et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 it is worth noticing that the h2w model in rosetta 3 can certainly be implemented to all possibilities of particle compositions in the whole textural triangle for classified 12 soil types however the selected 9 soil textures in this study may be sufficient to represent typical soils the simulations of soil moisture dynamics for the 9 typical soils were provided in section 3 1 which were regarded as true values i e observation for inverse modeling the true parameter set and its corresponding time series of soil moisture dynamics were defined for implementing the glue method for glue random pre defined true soil hydraulic parameters directly adopted typical soil hydraulic parameters table 2 in glue rosetta the true soil particle compositions were shown in fig 1 and table 3 and transferred mvg parameters were shown in table 4 the glue method was used to explore the soil hydraulic parameter space by picking up sufficient parameter sets that gave a reasonable prediction of the pre defined true soil moisture dynamics two different parameterization approaches were used to generate soil hydraulic parameters in mvg model for monte carlo analysis the first randomly generates mvg parameters of Œ∏ r Œ∏ s k s Œ± and n which is referred as glue random and the second strategy use rosetta 3 to transfer soil particle compositions to mvg parameters clearly the glue method integrated with rosetta has less degree of freedom referring to glue rosetta for the implementation of glue random parameters Œ± n and k s were log transformed because their distributions were skewed the soil hydraulic parameters transferred through rosetta were listed as l o g 10 Œ± l o g 10 n l o g 10 k s that are consistent with glue random the glue method commonly generates each parameter obeying a uniform probability distribution in its parameter range however other choices of probability distribution e g normal or lognormal distribution of soil hydraulic parameter may affect posterior pdf in this study a uniform probability distribution was specified for random sampling of soil hydraulic parameters for glue random or soil particle compositions for glue rosetta in glue random the specified ranges of mvg parameters were equally wide to cover all the possible soil hydraulic properties for all soil textures table 5 similarly in glue rosetta specified soil particle composition with a uniform distribution can evenly cover the entire soil texture triangle and then these soil particle compositions were transferred to mvg parameters using rosetta 3 for each method 10 000 parameter sets were generated to represent all possible combinations of the five soil hydraulic parameters the threshold of acceptance for the glue method is defined as nse 0 7 the threshold can only be defined after all simulations have been completed so we can evaluate the overall model performance of all the generated parameter sets the threshold of acceptance must enable the selection of a sufficient number of parameter sets to obtain comprehensive posterior results while guaranteeing accurate performance in simulation of soil moisture the pdf of accepted soil hydraulic parameter were approximated with a fitted curve using ksdensity function in matlab statistical toolbox we did not provide an envelope to mimic a response surface because our glue random results have rather flat response surface showing significant equifinality phenomenon with the above mentioned modeling strategies the content of the results was organized as follows the pre defined true soil moisture dynamics of 9 typical soils were given in section 3 1 section 3 2 focuses on evaluating the abilities of glue random and glue rosetta in recovering the predefined true parameter the data dots of posterior soil hydraulic parameter vs nse values were given in fig 3 together with fitted posterior pdf curves to reveal equifinality phenomena other results were plotted as uncertainty bands to express the ensemble of simulations including posterior soil moisture fig 4 section 3 3 posterior soil particle compositions of glue rosetta fig 6 section 3 4 posterior swcc and hcf figs 7 and 8 section 3 5 and the predicted soil moisture dynamics under two other rainfalls using the posterior soil hydraulic parameters fig 9 and fig 10 section 3 6 the discussion section clarified the following issues 1 the modeling strategies 2 correlations of constrained mvg parameters with rosetta 3 and 3 the necessity of using rosetta 3 in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology 3 results 3 1 predefined true soil moisture dynamics of 9 typical soils for both glue random and glue rosetta the soil moisture dynamics simulated using the pre defined true soil hydraulic parameters table 2 4 are shown in fig 2 for all soil types the peak soil moisture content occurs after a high intensity rain pulse and the lowest point occurs after sufficient time of drainage similar magnitudes of variations can be found in soil moisture dynamics of different soil types however the soil moisture dynamics fluctuated in different ranges revealing different storage properties among soils for example the soil moisture dynamics of the typical silt soil fluctuated from 0 3060 to 0 4012 indicating high storage properties fig 2b while the soil moisture dynamics of the typical sand soil under the same rainfall were in a range of 0 0619 to 0 3407 3 2 equifinality phenomenon in posterior soil hydraulic parameters in this study the glue approach was implemented for the monte carlo analysis of 10 000 group soil hydraulic parameters generated randomly referring to as glue random or through rosetta pedotransfer function referring to as glue rosetta fig 3 shows the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters as dotty plots of nse coefficients versus soil hydraulic parameters shown in different columns with nine soil textures shown in different rows the true soil hydraulic parameters of typical soils plotted as vertical lines in fig 3 indicated weak correlations with soil textures the true Œ∏ r and Œ∏ s had weak negative relations with soil texture whereas other three parameters log 10 Œ± l o g 10 n l o g 10 k s generally increased from fine texture soils to coarse texture soils each subfigure in fig 3 contained dots of nse vs parameters values facilitating a direct comparison of the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters under glue random and glue rosetta the nse values were used as indicators to express the model performance under different parameter sets among different soil types fine texture soil commonly led to accurate simulations in comparison with true soil moisture dynamics with their highest nse values commonly 0 95 on the contrary for the coarse soil texture of sand the nse values were less than 0 90 indicating less satisfying numerical simulations the relatively low performance of sandy soils may be related to the low variation in the true soil moisture dynamics the ranges of scattered dots were equivalent to the ranges of posterior probabilistic distribution of each parameter the uncertainties can be revealed by the range of posterior pdf and the response surface of each parameter for all the five soil hydraulic parameters the ranges of mvg parameters generated by glue random were significantly wider than those generated by glue rosetta significant uncertainties existed in the soil hydraulic parameters selected by glue random method because the ranges of the posterior pdf of k s may deviate from the true values for fine textured soils with random sampling strategy the selected mvg soil hydraulic parameters failed to recover the predefined true parameter values on the contrary posterior pdf of parameters generated by the glue rosetta method can recover the true parameters with much higher accuracy the scatter diagram of the nse vs soil hydraulic parameters fig 3 indicated that the parameter sets selected by glue random had irregular posterior pdf curves and flat response surfaces indicating the equifinality phenomenon on the contrary parameters generated through the rosetta pedotransfer function could significantly reduce the equifinality phenomenon fig 3 3 3 ensemble of simulated soil moisture content in this study parameter sets with a performance of nse 0 7 were considered as equal acceptance and all the simulated soil moisture dynamics nse 0 7 under the selected soil hydraulic parameter sets were shown in fig 4 ensembles of simulated soil moisture content had relatively narrow uncertainty bands showing high agreement with the true soil moisture dynamics fig 4 the boxplot of r m s e Œ∏ of the simulated soil moisture also indicated small error shown in fig 5 the acceptance of simulated soil moisture obtained with both of glue random and glue rosetta led to quite small r m s e Œ∏ the least r m s e Œ∏ of coarse texture soil of sand and loamy sand showed larger values around 0 04 and 0 06 meaning the best fitted results of the two coarse soil textures were less satisfying for fine texture soils the least r m s e Œ∏ were close to 0 002 which implied the best fitted results obtained by glue random and glue rosetta provided an accurate simulation to the defined true soil moisture content the boxplot of r m s e Œ∏ indicated an overall performance of simulated soil moisture dynamics with parameter sets with equal acceptance the median r m s e Œ∏ of glue rosetta were consistently smaller than that of glue random except for silty clay loam which suggested that the soil moisture content simulated by parameter sets generated through glue rosetta had better performance compared to glue random 3 4 posterior soil particle composition of glue rosetta on soil texture triangle the posterior soil particle composition of the glue rosetta was plotted in soil texture triangles fig 6 the color bar represented the nse of simulated soil moisture dynamics using the soil hydraulic parameters transferred by rosetta nse of limited data dots was interpolated to obtain a continuous map in the soil texture triangle different from the analyses in section 3 2 3 3 adopting a threshold of acceptance of nse 0 7 see fig 3 here the ranges of nse were specified as 0 1 0 to include more comprehensive information on model performance under different soil particle compositions fig 6 the glue random method can only straightforwardly generate mvg parameters but there is no method to reversely transfer soil hydraulic parameter to soil particle composition the soil texture triangles only include the posterior soil particle composition selected with the glue rosetta for all the 9 typical soils texture considered in this study the nse contours were featured with strip shapes in the soil texture triangle the core of each strip was in a color of red representing nse 0 9 while the color from blue to yellow represented nse between 0 and 0 7 the soil particle composition that was closer to the core of each strip usually had a larger nse indicating better model performance except for the sandy soil with the highest nse of 0 7394 the highest nse value of other eight soil types were all 0 99 according to the model evaluation criteria the overall performance of numerical simulations was acceptable all the strips had a relatively narrow range in comparison with the scales of the soil texture triangle the true values of the predefined soil particle composition see table 3 were exactly lying in the core of the strips meaning that the posterior soil texture can recover the predefined true values however the core of each strip may cross the soil texture triangles indicating equifinality phenomenon in glue rosetta 3 5 posterior swcc and hcf for both glue random and glue rosetta the ensembles of posterior swcc and hcf were respectively plotted in fig 7 and fig 8 as uncertainty bands and the true values estimated with predefined true soil hydraulic parameters were plotted as solid lines the swcc and hcf had similar shapes and curvatures whereas their ranges differed among soil textures and parameterizations the values of predefined true soil hydraulic parameters for glue random and glue rosetta were different table 2 and table 4 which led to different swcc and hcf curves for all typical soil types fig 7 and fig 8 the discrepancies of soil hydraulic properties of selected parameters through glue random and glue rosetta were significant under low saturation conditions the uncertainty bands of swcc and hcf described with soil hydraulic parameters selected through glue rosetta were much narrower in comparison with those generated through glue random it implies the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters selected through glue rosetta were much smaller than glue random for all the selected soil types 3 6 predication of soil moisture dynamics under different rainfall to evaluate the performance of parameter sets selected by glue random and glue rosetta during the predication periods we conducted numerical simulations of soil moisture dynamics under two extra rainfall conditions specifically rainfall time series with doubled intensities leading to higher saturation condition case 1 and half intensities leading to lower saturation condition case 2 respectively the simulated soil moisture dynamics using the selected soil hydraulic parameters are provided in fig 9 and fig 10 under the two rainfall conditions and the r m s e Œ∏ in comparison with the defined true soil moisture dynamics are shown in fig 11 the ranges of fluctuating soil moisture dynamic were larger under rainfall intensity of case 1 fig 9 and smaller under rainfall intensity of case 2 fig 10 as for the model performance the r m s e Œ∏ under the two different rainfall condition fig 11 indicated a relatively satisfying simulations although the errors were generally larger than the calibration period fig 5 moreover for both calibration and predication periods the r m s e Œ∏ of parameter sets selected by glue rosetta consistently outperformed glue random which suggests that the parameter set generated by glue rosetta may be more suited to simulate soil moisture dynamics 4 discussion 4 1 analyzing for parameter uncertainty uncertainties in modeling of unsaturated hydrology arise from multiple sources including model structure parameterization observation initial and boundary conditions liang et al 2021 samadi et al 2017 yang et al 2008 the importance of these uncertainties in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology may vary the possible combination of mvg parameter provides a large degree of flexibility in describing soil hydraulic properties making it the most important source of uncertainties initial conditions can only affect the simulation of soil moisture dynamics for a limited period and their uncertainty becomes negligible after a few cycles of drainage and infiltration upper boundary conditions e g evaporation and precipitation can drive unsaturated flow and therefore significantly affect the soil moisture dynamics bauser et al 2016 dong et al 2016 uncertainties in model structure arise from theoretical flaws in the standard darcy richards equation e g the neglection of preferential flow shao et al 2016 shao et al 2015 the modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology can be improved by including more comprehensive processes or parameterization e g modifications to the dual permeability model and parameterization of hysteresis swcc etc but these modifications often introduced additional parameters that increased the degree of freedom in the parameter space ultimately the choices of how to simulate the real soil depends on the environmental conditions and the purpose of study after determining the model structure and boundary conditions additional efforts may be taken to reduce the uncertainties in parameterization this study only focuses on uncertainty originating from soil hydraulic parameters and other sources of uncertainty are neglected however in real cased study modeling of soil moisture dynamics is mutually affected by uncertainties in model structure parameterizations and errors in input and output variables making it difficult to separate uncertainties from parameterization kan et al 2020 liang et al 2021 samadi et al 2017 in this study numerical simulations using the darcy richards equation with mvg parameterization consider a single layer homogenous soil for nine typical soil texture the true soil hydraulic parameters were predetermined and their modeling results of soil moisture dynamics were also regarded as observed true in this way uncertainties from model conceptualization input of rainfall and output of observed soil moisture were excluded facilitating the identification of the equifinality phenomenon caused by parameterization 4 2 why can rosetta reduce equifinality phenomenon how the glue rosetta reduces the equifinality phenomenon may be revealed through a correlation analysis of posterior soil hydraulic parameters taking clay loam as an example the correlation analysis of soil hydraulic parameters generated by glue rosetta and glue random is shown in fig 12 and fig 13 similar analyses for other eight soil types are included in the supplementary material figs s1 s16 in comparison with glue random whose correlation coefficient ranges from 0 39 to 0 61 parameters generated through glue rosetta feature stronger correlation with coefficient ranges 0 99 to 0 93 in glue random the correlation between Œ∏ s and l o g 10 n is the highest 0 61 whereas other parameters have weaker correlations in glue rosetta the correlation analysis of parameters indicated much stronger correlations especially for l o g 10 Œ± l o g 10 n 0 99 Œ∏ s l o g 10 Œ± 0 95 and Œ∏ s l o g 10 n 0 93 which provide evidence of significantly reduced degree of freedom in parameter space besides other parameters e g Œ∏ s l o g 10 k s are also featured with strong correlation of 0 58 the parameter Œ∏ r may have weak impacts on simulated soil moisture whereas its correlation coefficients with l o g 10 Œ± l o g 10 n and l o g 10 k s are 0 66 0 75 and 0 05 respectively high correlations between parameters commonly imply that the parameter space has more degree of freedom than necessary glue random and glue rosetta differ in their sampling strategies in their parameter spaces the glue random directly generates the five mvg parameters and the dimensionality of its parameter space is five the glue rosetta solely uses soil particle composition as inputs and dimensionality is reduced to two from a theoretical point of view zhang and schaap 2017 therefore glue rosetta has less degree of freedom in its parameter space which is associated with significantly reduced equifinality phenomenon fig 3 and fewer uncertainties in posterior results fig 7 fig 11 in conclusion rosetta 3 can reduce the dimensionality in parameter optimization and the strong correlations among parameters can reduce the uncertainty in modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology natural soils are self organized and it is well recognized that the swcc and k s are strongly correlated with soil texture for example based on a theoretical derivation of pore size distribution guarracino 2007 developed a quadratic relation between mvg parameter k s and Œ± that is consistence with the 12 typical soil texture groups however how to identify the correlations in soil hydraulic parameters from more informative data remains an unsolved issue the correlations identified through glue rosetta can be regarded as an achievement of correctly including prior information from soil hydraulic database the results in this study solidly support the reliability of using rosetta 3 in parameter optimization 1 posterior soil hydraulic parameters have an increasing trend from fine texture soil to coarse texture soil which is consistent with existing knowledge 2 the posterior soil particle compositions correctly encompass the predefined true soil texture information as seen in fig 6 section 3 4 overall this study enhances the understanding of soil hydraulic properties in major soil types and the result of glue rosetta provide more comprehensive information on posterior soil hydraulic parameter of the nine typical soil texture 4 3 necessity of using rosetta 3 in unsaturated soil hydrology the soil hydraulic parameters in swcc and hcf describe the hydraulic properties from the residual water content to saturated water content and this saturation range was commonly wider than the measurable soil moisture dynamics under natural conditions for example natural soils located in humid areas may rarely reach residual water content similarly in arid area due to low initial saturation condition soil may rarely reach saturation until unanticipated extreme rainfall occurs the uncertainty analysis in section 3 1 3 5 considered a 30 day consecutive rainfall which is not able to drive the soil moisture content to cross the full saturation range in order to reveal how incomplete information affected the inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameter the pdf of soil moisture data of sandy loam and silt clay were plotted in fig 14 a b clearly the availability of soil moisture data only covers a fraction of the full saturation range small uncertainties in posterior swcc and hcf can only be found in the ranges with informative soil moisture data however for the low saturation and high saturation range significant discrepancies can be found in the all the three selected posterior swcc and hcf the analysis clearly manifests two issues 1 equifinal soil hydraulic parameter described rather differed swcc and hcf fig 7 fig 8 and fig 14 2 rosetta 3 reduced the uncertainties in comparison with random sampling of mvg parameters during natural rainfall it is impossible to observe a soil moisture time series evenly distributed from residual to saturated water content such incomplete information may undermine the reliability of inverse modeling calibrated soil hydraulic parameters in rainy periods may embed large uncertainties for modeling in dry period and vice versa however correct simulation of soil moisture during a drought period is essential for ecohydrology in arid and semi arid regions especially when extreme drought events have become more frequent during the last few decades hoover et al 2022 konapala and mishra 2017 yuan et al 2023 in vegetated soils soil moisture dynamics from field capacity to wilting point strongly interact with ecosystem resilience especially during long lasting drought periods when vegetation survival may rely on root water uptake from soil moisture van looy et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 similarly in arid areas calibrated soil hydraulic parameters under relatively dry period may not cope with high saturation conditions under high intensity rainfall the changing environment challenges the reliability of current parameterizing strategies considering rosetta 3 has appropriately included the prior knowledge of hydraulic properties of natural soils its integration with inverse modeling may be more reliable than the random generating soil hydraulic parameters the rosetta adopted in this study is an improved version rosetta 3 that unifies the swcc and hcf submodules into one the soil hydraulic parameters were empirically bounded for maximum performance especially the soil hydraulic parameters generated by rosetta pedotransfer function need to be constrained when the ann models were calibrated with incomplete soil hydraulic data that caused difficulties in completely measuring the swcc and hcf for low saturation range thus the pedotransfer function of rosetta comprehensively considers dry to saturation soil hydraulic parameters besides rosetta 3 also considers the weight of soil hydraulic parameters to reduce the uncertainties of soil hydraulic parameters and these factors carried the same weight as the fitted soil hydraulic parameters should lead to perfect smooth swcc and hcf curves overall it is recommended to use rosetta to provide more constrained soil hydraulic parameter sets for reducing the uncertainty in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology 5 conclusions this study used the glue method to explore the uncertainty in modeling unsaturated soil hydrology a numerical experiment was conducted for nine typical soils under the same initial and rainfall conditions and the model structure adopted the darcy richards equation and mvg parametrization two sampling strategies of mvg parameter were considered 1 conventional random sampling refer to as glue random and 2 using rosetta for sampling from soil particle composition glue rosetta the results indicated that both glue random and glue rosetta showed equifinality phenomenon however glue rosetta outperformed glue random in terms of 1 more accurately estimating posterior soil hydraulic parameter to recover predefined true values 2 better constrained posterior swcc and hcf and 3 better simulation of soil moisture dynamics for all three cases of rainfall conditions moreover glue rosetta provided correct estimation of posterior soil particle compositions in comparison with predefined true soil textures demonstrating its effectiveness in linking soil textures with soil hydraulic properties in inverse modeling of soil hydraulic parameter uncertainties in estimated swcc and hcf were caused by imperfection of soil moisture data that only cover an incomplete and limited saturation range the results clearly indicated the necessity of using prior information to constrain inversely estimated soil hydraulic parameters as rosetta 3 is a well trained ann networks built through a reliable soil hydraulic database it provides a more reliable estimation of hydraulic properties for real soils the correlation analysis showed that the parameters selected through glue rosetta were strongly correlated which reduced the dimensionality in parameter space in comparison with conventional random sampling rosetta 3 provided more reliable constraining of swcc and hfc therefore the integration of rosetta 3 with parameter optimization algorithms is recommended for more reliable modeling of unsaturated soil hydrology credit authorship contribution statement wei shao

discharge rates were assessed using the nonparametric mann kendall sen trend test kendall 1948 sen 1968 with the function mmkh in the modifedmk package in r 4 1 3 r core team 2020 we adopted the seasonal breakdown of yu and bourque 2022 whereby the snowmelt season was defined from march may i e day of year doy 60 151 and the warm mostly snow free season from june october or doy 152 304 with a daily mean t 5 c the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was used to describe the extent linear relationships existed between discharge rate q and the other variables i e p pet swe vp sdd wdd and Œ¥f during the snowmelt and warm seasons respectively to explore the seasonal time courses of variables daily data were smoothed with a savitzky golay filter press and teukolsky 1990 to obtain the 19 year trend lines for q p swe t and pet respectively 2 5 extreme gradient boosting here we used the extreme gradient boosting option i e xgboost in the caret package r v 4 1 3 to analyze the relative importance of each forcing variable i e p swe pet t vp sdd as proxy of springtime transitioning in meltwater production and atmospheric warming wdd atmospheric warming and Œ¥f in the regulation of outlet discharge rates from 2001 to 2019 according to season analysis of streamflow dynamics was applied on datasets created by randomly selecting 70 of available hydrometric and hydrometeorological records associated with each season as defined in this study the two season specific xgboost models thus created were subsequently tested on the remaining 30 of corresponding datasets relative importance of forcing variables was gauged in terms of their respective gain factor generated with xgboost dependencies among variables were subsequently examined with partial dependence plots pdp which helped visualize the marginal dependency of q on specific forcing variables after removing shared effects associated with the other variables 2 6 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis wa provides information about the oscillations and inherent interactions in timeseries data at multiple frequencies presenting a very powerful analytical procedure here we analyzed the combined datasets by continuous and cross wavelet transformations i e cwt and xwt respectively and wavelet coherence wtc testing the details of wa can be found in grinsted et al 2004 and vargas et al 2010 continuous wavelet transformations were used to distinguish the timescales e g monthly annual decadal at which variability in timeseries data is potentially expressed the cwt of a discrete timeseries i e x n with n 1 n recorded at a uniform timestep i e Œ¥ t is defined as the convolution integral of x n with a scaled and normalized basis wavelet œà 0 Œ∑ we write 2 w n x s Œ¥ t s n 1 n x n œà 0 n n Œ¥ t s where œà 0 denotes the complex conjugate and s the set of wavelet scales inherent in the data cazelles et al 2008 here we used the morlet wavelet as the basis wavelet i e 3 œà 0 Œ∑ œÄ 1 4 e iw 0 Œ∑ e Œ∑ 2 2 because it balances localization of frequency and time elapsed ouyang et al 2014 the wavelet power of x n i e s n is defined as 4 s n s w n x s 2 likewise to quantify the spectral relationship between two timeseries i e xn representative of variables p swe pet or t and yn discharge rate q we defined the cross wavelet power spectrum c n phase angle spectrum a n and wtc spectrum r n 2 respectively as 5 c n s w n xy s w n x s w n y s 6 a n s ta n 1 im w n xy s re w n xy s a n d 7 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator that is applied in both time and scale which provides the minimal amount of smoothing necessary to include two independent points in both dimensions here w n xy denotes xwt and re w n xy s and im w n xy s are the real and imaginary parts of w n xy s grinsted et al 2004 the global cross wavelet power spectrum i e the mean of c n over time quantifies the magnitude of covariance that occurs between two timeseries across the time frequency domain phase angles in a n indicate the time frequency domain in c n or r n 2 arrows in wtc pointing right or left signify two timeseries either in phase or anti phase if two timeseries variables i e x n and y n are positively correlated phase arrows pointing upward indicate x n lagging y n by a 1 4 period or leading y n by a 3 4 period whereas phase arrows pointing downward indicate x n leading y n by a 1 4 period or lagging y n by a 3 4 period statistical significance was established at a critical p value of 0 05 since we are interested in the phase difference between the components of two timeseries at a time we need to calculate their mean and confidence interval by converting the direction of arrows into the lag phase difference thus we use the circular mean of the phase over a statistically significant area i e wtc correlation coefficient wtcsig 1 that is inside the cone of influence coi to quantify the phase information as suggested by vargas et al 2010 significance tests for wtc were based on monte carlo simulations number of replicates n 500 all timeseries were normalized and mean centered to generate timeseries of unit variance and mean of zero before applying the procedure we carried out wa in matlab r2018b the mathworks usa with codes acquired from grinsted et al 2004 and ng and chan 2012 3 results 3 1 interannual variability of variables fig 2 displays the interannual variation in t p pet maximum swe i e swemax annual forest cover loss Œ¥f and discharge rate q over the 19 year study period 2001 2019 with coefficients of variation cv of 21 6 10 2 2 3 25 8 30 2 and 19 5 respectively annual mean t ranged from 2 4 to 5 1 c with a mean of 3 4 c fig 2a annual p and pet varied in the ranges of 895 0 1399 6 and 600 9 650 1 mm year 1 with a mean of 1185 5 and 622 0 mm year 1 respectively fig 2b annual swemax varied from 111 1 to 402 1 kg m 2 with a mean of 246 3 kg m 2 fig 2c annual Œ¥f increased with an average annual rate of 7 7 year 1 fig 2d mean forest cover loss basin area was 181 7 km2 with a total of 3453 2 km2 over the 19 years annual mean q varied from 298 4 638 3 m3 s 1 over the same period during the snowmelt season q exhibited a significant upward trend of about 2 1 year 1 ranging from 487 1 1101 1 m3 s 1 in contrast discharge rates during the warm season were generally much lower than the rates observed during the snowmelt season fluctuating at the grand falls station between 165 1 436 7 m3 s 1 fig 2e fig 3 illustrates the key forcing variables controlling variation in q based on pccs we found from the analysis that q was most clearly correlated with pet and vp during the snowmelt season albeit at variance with the feature importance values given in fig 4 to be addressed later meanwhile other biophysical factors and Œ¥f also showed significant positive linear correlation in contrast the stimulative effects of pet and vp on q were largely suppressed during the warm seasons negatively correlating with wdd and Œ¥f fig 3 3 2 xgboost application and prediction level fig 4 summarizes the relative importance of six predictor variables during the snowmelt season sdd was shown to be the most important predictor of q achieving an importance score gain factor of 74 9 whereas swe and Œ¥f provided individual scores of 11 4 and 9 8 the other forcing variables considered namely pet vp and p were relatively less important predictors of q with gain factors of 1 7 1 6 and 0 3 respectively fig 4a during the warm season wdd and Œ¥f were the most important predictors of q with importance scores of 41 1 and 30 9 warm season pet and vp ranked low with importance score of 10 1 and 7 3 relative importance of warm season p and swe were similar with scores averaging about 5 for each variable fig 4b figs 5 and 6 give the partial dependence plots of q as related to the six forcing variables for both the snowmelt fig 5 and warm seasons fig 6 during the snowmelt season discharge rates were shown to increase as a function of sdd reaching their maxima around sdd 65 c and soon after declining with further increases in sdd associated with the natural transition of local climate to warmer spring conditions and ongoing depletion of the snowpack fig 5a during the spring snowmelt period discharge rates were shown to increase with increasing p fig 5b but the variable s impact was small compared to some of the other forcing variables such as swe and Œ¥f fig 4a also yu and bourque 2022 the influence of swe on q during the snowmelt period was more complex apart from a pronounced peak at 350 kg m 2 fig 5c snowmelt season q exhibited obvious upward trends with increasing pet and vp especially within the range between 2 and 3 mm and 0 3 0 75 kpa for the two variables fig 5d and e increases in annual forest cover removal via changes in Œ¥f was responsible for an approximate monotonic increase in daily discharge rates fig 5g consistent with observations made by yu and bourque 2022 using entirely different analytical methods during the warm season q tended to decrease with increasing wdd and then sharply increase at wdd 1400 c most likely in response to increases in p from early to mid autumn fig 6a daily discharge rates during the warm season were also positively associated with p fig 6b albeit at lower levels of contribution fig 4b daily discharge yielded a positive correlation with swe especially between 0 and 75 kg m 2 fig 6c with melting of the residual snow cover in the high elevation areas of the subbasin yu and bourque 2022 however q exhibited a sharp decline when pet varied between 0 and 1 mm fig 6d daily discharge rates were shown to increase with increasing ambient water vapor content vp fig 6e from fig 6f warm season q was shown to be negatively correlated to Œ¥f suggesting that repeated forest cover removal had an important role in diminishing river discharge rates during the warm season fig 7 provides scatterplots of observed vs xgboost generated predictions of daily q based on testing data 30 of available data associated with each season datapoints representative of the snowmelt season tended to assemble more closely to the 1 1 correspondence line providing a robust coefficient of determination r2 of 0 88 p 0 01 corresponding data for the warm season however were not as strongly aligned to the 1 1 correspondence line r2 0 69 p 0 01 due to the occasional poorly modelled low flow events during the warm june october period of each year fig 7b 3 3 periodicity between discharge and environmental variables fig 8 presents the global wavelet power spectra of discharge rate and four forcing variables namely p swe t and pet for 2001 2019 global wavelet power spectra of these variables as expected all show strong peaks at 365 day annual timescales and oscillate at intermediate timescales of weeks to months at multi day and annual timescales discontinuous areas of significant wtc were observed between q and the hydrometeorological variables over a wide range of timescales notably p showed areas of significant wavelet coherence high frequency hotspots with q over 8 32 day periods fig 9 a likewise swe and pet exhibited non continuous bands around the 128 day period fig 9b and d unsurprisingly continuous area of significant wtc between q and t was observed to coincide every 1 year 365 day period fig 9c on a monthly timescale the lag in pet was the shortest by converting the direction of arrows into a lag phase difference of about 5 4 days followed by those of p t and swe at 5 9 7 5 and 8 9 days respectively on an annual timescale the lag between maximum swe and q was the shortest at about 44 5 days conversely peak q led pet t and p by about 55 1 84 4 and 85 1 days overall on a monthly timescale the lag between q and p significantly decreased slope 2 66 with increasing annual forest cover removal 0 4 1 4 fig 10 a on an annual timescale the lag between pairwise expressions of q and t and pet significantly increased with increasing annual forest cover loss slopes 21 0 and 19 7 respectively whereas the lag between peak swe and q exhibited a persistent decreasing trend slope 27 4 fig 10b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of timing and environmental variables on streamflow dynamics large discrepancies in the importance of environmental variables in predicting q figs 3 and 4 demonstrate the benefits of machine learning in dealing with the nonlinear properties of multivariate data chen and guestrin 2016 ni et al 2020 yu and bourque 2022 fig 4 traditional statistical methods that assume linearity often struggle to capture these complex relationships figs 3 and 4 li et al 2020 unlike pcc xgboost was able to isolate sdd and wdd as the two most important drivers of q over the year fig 4 during the snowmelt season sdd can be viewed as a proxy that contributes towards the production of meltwater yu and bourque 2022 during the transition from the snowmelt to warm season snowmelt dominated processes give way to rain dominated processes and wdd redefines the annual distribution and amount of rainfall and pet during the warm season mao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 fisher et al 2017 as a result q displayed very different responses during the snowmelt and warm seasons figs 3 5a and 6a meanwhile the responses of q to most of the environmental variables exhibited clear seasonal differences except for p and vp figs 5 and 6 compared with traditional statistical methods i e pcc fig 3 partial dependence plots can display nonlinear relationships and interaction between forcing variables and streamflow friedman and popescu 2008 li et al 2020 during the snowmelt season with on the ground snow serving as primary source of discharge d√©ry et al 2005 sadro et al 2018 swe had the second highest feature importance ranking fig 4a variations in snowmelt season vp and pet were associated with the influx of sensible and latent heat associated with the synoptic scale advection of warm moist air from more southerly positions promoting accelerated melting in the subbasin tjernstr√∂m et al 2015 yu and bourque 2022 in energy limited basins some of its characteristics could include lower pet due to snow cover or shading by vegetation lower temperatures or higher soil moisture content lawrence et al 2007 wang and alimohammadi 2012 which are consistent with the characteristics of the current study area it is notable that q tended to stabilize when the forcing variables had reached their respective thresholds i e pet 3 mm and vp 0 75 kpa fig 5d and e this may be due to an increased sublimation rate of snow on the ground box and steffen 2001 albeit a minor component compared to the other variables yu and bourque 2022 resulting in some release of water vapor directly into the atmosphere generally plant transpiration accounts for 60 of evapotranspiration during the warm season especially in densely forested areas schlesinger and jasechko 2014 many studies have shown that pet regulates evapotranspiration by influencing canopy stomatal conductance xiao et al 2013 li et al 2016 sun et al 2016 manning et al 2018 and direct evaporation of surface and shallow subsurface water this would explain the negative relationship between q and pet during the warm season fig 6d it is worth noting that the positive correlation between warm season vp and q may be related to the importance of fog drip in the area fig 6e owing to the area s proximity to the cold water of the bay of fundy to the south and the production of fog and low lying clouds regionally yin and arp 1994 since high humidity levels promote the formation of fog liquid water drip from the canopy to the ground causes river q to increase ham 1982 yin and arp 1994 prada et al 2009 associated with an increase in fog and low lying clouds is a corresponding reduction in pet and actual evapotranspiration and water lost to the atmosphere the combined effects of fog drip and reductions in pet can account for an additional 10 of river discharge as estimated by yin and arp 1994 at the end of the warm season temperatures drop sharply while rainfall is abundant fig 6a during this period of transition freezing of the topsoil may occur causing the infiltration capacity of the soil to decrease bayard et al 2005 and surface runoff to increase leading to an increase in stream and river flow 4 2 time lags in streamflow dynamics on multiple timescales on a monthly scale differences in lag between q and p and q and swe with the former being shorter could be explained as follows firstly the transformation of swe into streamflow requires endothermic melting takeuchi et al 2002 tjernstr√∂m et al 2015 secondly under concentrated high intensity p in summer and autumn the shallow soil layer is usually saturated causing rainfall to flow as surface runoff bonell and gilmour 1978 tao et al 2021 assessments of lag in prior studies which have mostly focused on experiments based on rainfall runoff event based measurements ranged from 1 2 h to a few days uchida et al 1999 tramblay et al 2010 talei and chua 2012 yao et al 2016 discrepancies in peak response in basins vary in relation to their size physiographic differences surface vegetation cover rainfall intensity as well as discharge sources istok and boersma 1986 nakken 1999 uchida et al 1999 talei and chua 2012 mu et al 2015 since most river discharge measured at grand falls originates from groundwater qg 75 of outlet discharge on average fig 11 a large time lags can be expected because of the increased resistance to flow from the land surface underground to the subbasin outlet as return flow berghuijs et al 2022 on an annual scale the time lag can be regarded as a phase difference in seasonal fluctuations periodic peaks in the controlling variables and streamflow rather than by a single hydrometeorological event nakken 1999 szolgayova et al 2014 for instance swe peaked in early march and q in mid april fig 11b as a result q and swe had the shortest time lag of 1 5 months similarly the peak of p occurred in august whereas t and pet normally peaked in july fig 11b causing the time lag to vary by about 2 3 months 4 3 effects of forest loss on streamflow dynamics forest cover removal was revealed to increase the snowmelt season discharge rates at the grand falls hydrometric station over the 19 years figs 3 and 5f consistent with the results of many other studies varhola et al 2010 goeking and tarboton 2020 yu and bourque 2022 some studies have confirmed that snowmelt rates in forest openings can be greater than forest covered areas due to the understory shading provided by intact overstory vegetation varhola et al 2010 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2022 other studies have attributed this trend to decreases in evaporative and interception losses bladon et al 2019 goeking and tarboton 2020 in contrast forest cover removal had a prominent role in decreasing the warm season discharge rates over the same 19 year period figs 3 and 6f this contradicts the general observation that forest cover losses tend to increase rather than decrease low streamflow period runoff keppeler and ziemer 1990 xiao et al 2022 previous research has suggested that forests regulate the amount and timing of water that enters streams and rivers through the process of evapotranspiration zhu et al 2014 mao et al 2015 furthermore other studies revealed that forest cover loss over the intermediate term can lead to changes in soil characteristics such as reduced organic matter content and increased compaction shi et al 2016 wang et al 2021 which can decrease the soil water holding capacity and soil water retention this can further increase surface flow and reduce groundwater recharge however unlike most water limited basins the current results suggest that energy is a key limiting factor and that water resources are virtually unlimited figs 2 and 4 when forests are cleared or degraded more sunlight can reach the ground leading to increased surface radiation and higher soil temperatures this can increase evaporation rates and decrease soil moisture which can in turn decrease transpiration rates mcdonnell et al 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 limiting soil moisture that otherwise would have contributed to runoff yield bosch and hewlett 1982 fig 6f meanwhile studies have shown that low streamflow in summer is often accompanied by warmer water temperatures istok and boersma 1986 van vliet et al 2013 which can further stress aquatic habitats and the production of food low water levels during the warm season if maintained can accelerate the effects of river ice buildup in winter bradford and heinonen 2008 el jabi and caissie 2019 gronsdahl et al 2019 when water levels are low during the cold season the flow of water in rivers slows down and allows ice at the surface to accumulate more easily further reducing flow rates we found that the lag between peak q and p decreased with increasing forest cover removal fig 9a and 10a which is consistent with other researchers findings e g zhang et al 2016 these results correspond to the rainfall interception capacity of forests which can slow down peak streamflow by reducing the amount of rainwater that can reach streams and rivers bladon et al 2019 goeking and tarboton 2020 most notably increases in forest cover removal promoted a decrease in the lag between peak swe and q fig 9b and 10b causing the snowmelt season peak flow to shift forward some studies have pointed out that the presence of forest cover promoted surface runoff conversion to subsurface flow and groundwater contributing to a net storage of water in forested landscapes newman et al 2010 kim and jackson 2012 an explanation for this is that the vadose zone of woodlands is usually less compacted than the same zone in non woodland areas newman et al 2010 kim and jackson 2012 and as a result meltwater and rain can more easily infiltrate into the soil furthermore as a biological pump of atmospheric moisture forests play an important role in regulating the hydrological cycle locally chen et al 1993 thus changes in the extent of canopy cover may alter canopy microclimate makarieva and gorshkov 2007 von arx et al 2013 causing delayed seasonal patterns in pet and t fig 10b overall our results confirmed that forest cover removal has an important role in exacerbating the advancement of springtime flooding and its associated peak flow and onset and duration of summer low streamflow events although the effect that forests may have on the timing and magnitude of streamflow could be greatly altered as the regional climate shifts from a mostly snow to rain driven system one of the key challenges facing forest management under a changing climate is the potential for increased hydrological variability forest harvesting practices may need to be adjusted to maintain or enhance the water holding capacity of forested landscapes 5 conclusions annual forest cover removal rates and snowmelt season discharge rates in the upper saint john river subbasin were shown to increase from 2001 to 2019 with a rate of change of 7 7 and 2 1 year 1 respectively during the spring snowmelt season variation in discharge rates was mostly dominated by sdd and swe during the warm season discharge rates were controlled primarily by wdd and annual forest cover removal with increasing forest cover loss spring flooding peaks increased with no net increase in snowfall whereas warm season discharge rates decreased basin wide forest cover removal influenced waterflow dynamics over a range of timescales at a monthly timescale the lag between peak q and p significantly decreased with increasing forest cover removal on an annual scale lag between q and swe yielded a negative correlation with increasing annual forest cover loss forest cover removal has the potential to exacerbate the advancement of spring flooding and its associated peak as well as promote summer low streamflow events changes in river flow dynamics anticipated with future climate change and continued repeated annual forest cover removal highlight the need for a multi

commercial forestry operations annual mean forest cover removal ranged from 0 39 to 1 35 of basin area with an obvious increasing trend of 7 7 per year the long term annual mean discharge rate at the basin outlet was 457 5 m3 s 1 an analysis based on extreme gradient boosting revealed that daily discharge rates during the snowmelt season were largely influenced by i cumulative snow degree days as proxy of springtime northeasterly advection of warm moist air from southerly positions and affiliated increases in snowmelt ii cumulative on the ground snow water equivalent swe and iii extent of within basin annual forest cover removal in contrast daily discharge rates during the warm period of the year i e june october was controlled primarily by warm season degree days and annual forest cover removal spring flood maxima increased by 2 1 per year with annual forest cover loss whereas mid summer discharge rates tended to drop we used wavelet analysis to investigate the role of related environmental variables in controlling river flow dynamics across the time frequency domain annually the time lag between peak discharge rate and swe significantly decreased with increasing annual

decrease because of increased understory sunlight and associated evaporative losses from residual understory vegetation following overstory canopy removal mcdonnell et al 2018 goeking and tarboton

cover removal on stream and river flow dynamics however these models especially fully distributed models require a vast amount of watershed specific point information and hydro climatic records for their calibration and subsequent validation limiting their suitability for ungauged watersheds li et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 data based models in contrast can directly predict watershed streamflow dynamics once statistical assumptions of linearity of surface and shallow subsurface flow and associated controlling factors have been established stoneman 1993 sahin and hall 1996 unfortunately these

hydrometeorological variables and annual forest cover removal patterns in a large subbasin of the upper saint john river basin we hypothesize that i the effects of repeated forest cover removal and

discharge rates were assessed using the nonparametric mann kendall sen trend test kendall 1948 sen 1968 with the function mmkh in the modifedmk package in r 4 1 3 r core team 2020 we adopted the seasonal breakdown of yu and bourque 2022 whereby the snowmelt season was defined from march may i e day of year doy 60 151 and the warm mostly snow free season from june october or doy 152 304 with a daily mean t 5 c the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was used to describe the extent linear relationships existed between discharge rate q and the other variables i e p pet swe vp sdd wdd and Œ¥f during the snowmelt and warm seasons respectively to explore the seasonal time courses of variables daily data were smoothed with a savitzky golay filter press and teukolsky 1990 to obtain the 19 year trend lines for q p swe t and pet respectively 2 5 extreme gradient boosting here we used the extreme gradient boosting option i e xgboost in the caret package r v 4 1 3 to analyze the relative importance of each forcing variable i e p swe pet t vp sdd as proxy of springtime transitioning in meltwater production and atmospheric warming wdd atmospheric warming and Œ¥f in the regulation of outlet discharge rates from 2001 to 2019 according to season analysis of streamflow dynamics was applied on datasets created by randomly selecting 70 of available hydrometric and hydrometeorological records associated with each season as defined in this study the two season specific xgboost models thus created were subsequently tested on the remaining 30 of corresponding datasets relative importance of forcing variables was gauged in terms of their respective gain factor generated with xgboost dependencies among variables were subsequently examined with partial dependence plots pdp which helped visualize the marginal dependency of q on specific forcing variables after removing shared effects associated with the other variables 2 6 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis wa provides information about the oscillations and inherent interactions in timeseries data at multiple frequencies presenting a very powerful analytical procedure here we analyzed the combined datasets by continuous and cross wavelet transformations i e cwt and xwt respectively and wavelet coherence wtc testing the details of wa can be found in grinsted et al 2004 and vargas et al 2010 continuous wavelet transformations were used to distinguish the timescales e g monthly annual decadal at which variability in timeseries data is potentially expressed the cwt of a discrete timeseries i e x n with n 1 n recorded at a uniform timestep i e Œ¥ t is defined as the convolution integral of x n with a scaled and normalized basis wavelet œà 0 Œ∑ we write 2 w n x s Œ¥ t s n 1 n x n œà 0 n n Œ¥ t s where œà 0 denotes the complex conjugate and s the set of wavelet scales inherent in the data cazelles et al 2008 here we used the morlet wavelet as the basis wavelet i e 3 œà 0 Œ∑ œÄ 1 4 e iw 0 Œ∑ e Œ∑ 2 2 because it balances localization of frequency and time elapsed ouyang et al 2014 the wavelet power of x n i e s n is defined as 4 s n s w n x s 2 likewise to quantify the spectral relationship between two timeseries i e xn representative of variables p swe pet or t and yn discharge rate q we defined the cross wavelet power spectrum c n phase angle spectrum a n and wtc spectrum r n 2 respectively as 5 c n s w n xy s w n x s w n y s 6 a n s ta n 1 im w n xy s re w n xy s a n d 7 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator that is applied in both time and scale which provides the minimal amount of smoothing necessary to include two independent points in both dimensions here w n xy denotes xwt and re w n xy s and im w n xy s are the real and imaginary parts of w n xy s grinsted et al 2004 the global cross wavelet power spectrum i e the mean of c n over time quantifies the magnitude of covariance that occurs between two timeseries across the time frequency domain phase angles in a n indicate the time frequency domain in c n or r n 2 arrows in wtc pointing right or left signify two timeseries either in phase or anti phase if two timeseries variables i e x n and y n are positively correlated phase arrows pointing upward indicate x n lagging y n by a 1 4 period or leading y n by a 3 4 period whereas phase arrows pointing downward indicate x n leading y n by a 1 4 period or lagging y n by a 3 4 period statistical significance was established at a critical p value of 0 05 since we are interested in the phase difference between the components of two timeseries at a time we need to calculate their mean and confidence interval by converting the direction of arrows into the lag phase difference thus we use the circular mean of the phase over a statistically significant area i e wtc correlation coefficient wtcsig 1 that is inside the cone of influence coi to quantify the phase information as suggested by vargas et al 2010 significance tests for wtc were based on monte carlo simulations number of replicates n 500 all timeseries were normalized and mean centered to generate timeseries of unit variance and mean of zero before applying the procedure we carried out wa in matlab r2018b the mathworks usa with codes acquired from grinsted et al 2004 and ng and chan 2012 3 results 3 1 interannual variability of variables fig 2 displays the interannual variation in t p pet maximum swe i e swemax annual forest cover loss Œ¥f and discharge rate q over the 19 year study period 2001 2019 with coefficients of variation cv of 21 6 10 2 2 3 25 8 30 2 and 19 5 respectively annual mean t ranged from 2 4 to 5 1 c with a mean of 3 4 c fig 2a annual p and pet varied in the ranges of 895 0 1399 6 and 600 9 650 1 mm year 1 with a mean of 1185 5 and 622 0 mm year 1 respectively fig 2b annual swemax varied from 111 1 to 402 1 kg m 2 with a mean of 246 3 kg m 2 fig 2c annual Œ¥f increased with an average annual rate of 7 7 year 1 fig 2d mean forest cover loss basin area was 181 7 km2 with a total of 3453 2 km2 over the 19 years annual mean q varied from 298 4 638 3 m3 s 1 over the same period during the snowmelt season q exhibited a significant upward trend of about 2 1 year 1 ranging from 487 1 1101 1 m3 s 1 in contrast discharge rates during the warm season were generally much lower than the rates observed during the snowmelt season fluctuating at the grand falls station between 165 1 436 7 m3 s 1 fig 2e fig 3 illustrates the key forcing variables controlling variation in q based on pccs we found from the analysis that q was most clearly correlated with pet and vp during the snowmelt season albeit at variance with the feature importance values given in fig 4 to be addressed later meanwhile other biophysical factors and Œ¥f also showed significant positive linear correlation in contrast the stimulative effects of pet and vp on q were largely suppressed during the warm seasons negatively correlating with wdd and Œ¥f fig 3 3 2 xgboost application and prediction level fig 4 summarizes the relative importance of six predictor variables during the snowmelt season sdd was shown to be the most important predictor of q achieving an importance score gain factor of 74 9 whereas swe and Œ¥f provided individual scores of 11 4 and 9 8 the other forcing variables considered namely pet vp and p were relatively less important predictors of q with gain factors of 1 7 1 6 and 0 3 respectively fig 4a during the warm season wdd and Œ¥f were the most important predictors of q with importance scores of 41 1 and 30 9 warm season pet and vp ranked low with importance score of 10 1 and 7 3 relative importance of warm season p and swe were similar with scores averaging about 5 for each variable fig 4b figs 5 and 6 give the partial dependence plots of q as related to the six forcing variables for both the snowmelt fig 5 and warm seasons fig 6 during the snowmelt season discharge rates were shown to increase as a function of sdd reaching their maxima around sdd 65 c and soon after declining with further increases in sdd associated with the natural transition of local climate to warmer spring conditions and ongoing depletion of the snowpack fig 5a during the spring snowmelt period discharge rates were shown to increase with increasing p fig 5b but the variable s impact was small compared to some of the other forcing variables such as swe and Œ¥f fig 4a also yu and bourque 2022 the influence of swe on q during the snowmelt period was more complex apart from a pronounced peak at 350 kg m 2 fig 5c snowmelt season q exhibited obvious upward trends with increasing pet and vp especially within the range between 2 and 3 mm and 0 3 0 75 kpa for the two variables fig 5d and e increases in annual forest cover removal via changes in Œ¥f was responsible for an approximate monotonic increase in daily discharge rates fig 5g consistent with observations made by yu and bourque 2022 using entirely different analytical methods during the warm season q tended to decrease with increasing wdd and then sharply increase at wdd 1400 c most likely in response to increases in p from early to mid autumn fig 6a daily discharge rates during the warm season were also positively associated with p fig 6b albeit at lower levels of contribution fig 4b daily discharge yielded a positive correlation with swe especially between 0 and 75 kg m 2 fig 6c with melting of the residual snow cover in the high elevation areas of the subbasin yu and bourque 2022 however q exhibited a sharp decline when pet varied between 0 and 1 mm fig 6d daily discharge rates were shown to increase with increasing ambient water vapor content vp fig 6e from fig 6f warm season q was shown to be negatively correlated to Œ¥f suggesting that repeated forest cover removal had an important role in diminishing river discharge rates during the warm season fig 7 provides scatterplots of observed vs xgboost generated predictions of daily q based on testing data 30 of available data associated with each season datapoints representative of the snowmelt season tended to assemble more closely to the 1 1 correspondence line providing a robust coefficient of determination r2 of 0 88 p 0 01 corresponding data for the warm season however were not as strongly aligned to the 1 1 correspondence line r2 0 69 p 0 01 due to the occasional poorly modelled low flow events during the warm june october period of each year fig 7b 3 3 periodicity between discharge and environmental variables fig 8 presents the global wavelet power spectra of discharge rate and four forcing variables namely p swe t and pet for 2001 2019 global wavelet power spectra of these variables as expected all show strong peaks at 365 day annual timescales and oscillate at intermediate timescales of weeks to months at multi day and annual timescales discontinuous areas of significant wtc were observed between q and the hydrometeorological variables over a wide range of timescales notably p showed areas of significant wavelet coherence high frequency hotspots with q over 8 32 day periods fig 9 a likewise swe and pet exhibited non continuous bands around the 128 day period fig 9b and d unsurprisingly continuous area of significant wtc between q and t was observed to coincide every 1 year 365 day period fig 9c on a monthly timescale the lag in pet was the shortest by converting the direction of arrows into a lag phase difference of about 5 4 days followed by those of p t and swe at 5 9 7 5 and 8 9 days respectively on an annual timescale the lag between maximum swe and q was the shortest at about 44 5 days conversely peak q led pet t and p by about 55 1 84 4 and 85 1 days overall on a monthly timescale the lag between q and p significantly decreased slope 2 66 with increasing annual forest cover removal 0 4 1 4 fig 10 a on an annual timescale the lag between pairwise expressions of q and t and pet significantly increased with increasing annual forest cover loss slopes 21 0 and 19 7 respectively whereas the lag between peak swe and q exhibited a persistent decreasing trend slope 27 4 fig 10b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of timing and environmental variables on streamflow dynamics large discrepancies in the importance of environmental variables in predicting q figs 3 and 4 demonstrate the benefits of machine learning in dealing with the nonlinear properties of multivariate data chen and guestrin 2016 ni et al 2020 yu and bourque 2022 fig 4 traditional statistical methods that assume linearity often struggle to capture these complex relationships figs 3 and 4 li et al 2020 unlike pcc xgboost was able to isolate sdd and wdd as the two most important drivers of q over the year fig 4 during the snowmelt season sdd can be viewed as a proxy that contributes towards the production of meltwater yu and bourque 2022 during the transition from the snowmelt to warm season snowmelt dominated processes give way to rain dominated processes and wdd redefines the annual distribution and amount of rainfall and pet during the warm season mao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 fisher et al 2017 as a result q displayed very different responses during the snowmelt and warm seasons figs 3 5a and 6a meanwhile the responses of q to most of the environmental variables exhibited clear seasonal differences except for p and vp figs 5 and 6 compared with traditional statistical methods i e pcc fig 3 partial dependence plots can display nonlinear relationships and interaction between forcing variables and streamflow friedman and popescu 2008 li et al 2020 during the snowmelt season with on the ground snow serving as primary source of discharge d√©ry et al 2005 sadro et al 2018 swe had the second highest feature importance ranking fig 4a variations in snowmelt season vp and pet were associated with the influx of sensible and latent heat associated with the synoptic scale advection of warm moist air from more southerly positions promoting accelerated melting in the subbasin tjernstr√∂m et al 2015 yu and bourque 2022 in energy limited basins some of its characteristics could include lower pet due to snow cover or shading by vegetation lower temperatures or higher soil moisture content lawrence et al 2007 wang and alimohammadi 2012 which are consistent with the characteristics of the current study area it is notable that q tended to stabilize when the forcing variables had reached their respective thresholds i e pet 3 mm and vp 0 75 kpa fig 5d and e this may be due to an increased sublimation rate of snow on the ground box and steffen 2001 albeit a minor component compared to the other variables yu and bourque 2022 resulting in some release of water vapor directly into the atmosphere generally plant transpiration accounts for 60 of evapotranspiration during the warm season especially in densely forested areas schlesinger and jasechko 2014 many studies have shown that pet regulates evapotranspiration by influencing canopy stomatal conductance xiao et al 2013 li et al 2016 sun et al 2016 manning et al 2018 and direct evaporation of surface and shallow subsurface water this would explain the negative relationship between q and pet during the warm season fig 6d it is worth noting that the positive correlation between warm season vp and q may be related to the importance of fog drip in the area fig 6e owing to the area s proximity to the cold water of the bay of fundy to the south and the production of fog and low lying clouds regionally yin and arp 1994 since high humidity levels promote the formation of fog liquid water drip from the canopy to the ground causes river q to increase ham 1982 yin and arp 1994 prada et al 2009 associated with an increase in fog and low lying clouds is a corresponding reduction in pet and actual evapotranspiration and water lost to the atmosphere the combined effects of fog drip and reductions in pet can account for an additional 10 of river discharge as estimated by yin and arp 1994 at the end of the warm season temperatures drop sharply while rainfall is abundant fig 6a during this period of transition freezing of the topsoil may occur causing the infiltration capacity of the soil to decrease bayard et al 2005 and surface runoff to increase leading to an increase in stream and river flow 4 2 time lags in streamflow dynamics on multiple timescales on a monthly scale differences in lag between q and p and q and swe with the former being shorter could be explained as follows firstly the transformation of swe into streamflow requires endothermic melting takeuchi et al 2002 tjernstr√∂m et al 2015 secondly under concentrated high intensity p in summer and autumn the shallow soil layer is usually saturated causing rainfall to flow as surface runoff bonell and gilmour 1978 tao et al 2021 assessments of lag in prior studies which have mostly focused on experiments based on rainfall runoff event based measurements ranged from 1 2 h to a few days uchida et al 1999 tramblay et al 2010 talei and chua 2012 yao et al 2016 discrepancies in peak response in basins vary in relation to their size physiographic differences surface vegetation cover rainfall intensity as well as discharge sources istok and boersma 1986 nakken 1999 uchida et al 1999 talei and chua 2012 mu et al 2015 since most river discharge measured at grand falls originates from groundwater qg 75 of outlet discharge on average fig 11 a large time lags can be expected because of the increased resistance to flow from the land surface underground to the subbasin outlet as return flow berghuijs et al 2022 on an annual scale the time lag can be regarded as a phase difference in seasonal fluctuations periodic peaks in the controlling variables and streamflow rather than by a single hydrometeorological event nakken 1999 szolgayova et al 2014 for instance swe peaked in early march and q in mid april fig 11b as a result q and swe had the shortest time lag of 1 5 months similarly the peak of p occurred in august whereas t and pet normally peaked in july fig 11b causing the time lag to vary by about 2 3 months 4 3 effects of forest loss on streamflow dynamics forest cover removal was revealed to increase the snowmelt season discharge rates at the grand falls hydrometric station over the 19 years figs 3 and 5f consistent with the results of many other studies varhola et al 2010 goeking and tarboton 2020 yu and bourque 2022 some studies have confirmed that snowmelt rates in forest openings can be greater than forest covered areas due to the understory shading provided by intact overstory vegetation varhola et al 2010 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2022 other studies have attributed this trend to decreases in evaporative and interception losses bladon et al 2019 goeking and tarboton 2020 in contrast forest cover removal had a prominent role in decreasing the warm season discharge rates over the same 19 year period figs 3 and 6f this contradicts the general observation that forest cover losses tend to increase rather than decrease low streamflow period runoff keppeler and ziemer 1990 xiao et al 2022 previous research has suggested that forests regulate the amount and timing of water that enters streams and rivers through the process of evapotranspiration zhu et al 2014 mao et al 2015 furthermore other studies revealed that forest cover loss over the intermediate term can lead to changes in soil characteristics such as reduced organic matter content and increased compaction shi et al 2016 wang et al 2021 which can decrease the soil water holding capacity and soil water retention this can further increase surface flow and reduce groundwater recharge however unlike most water limited basins the current results suggest that energy is a key limiting factor and that water resources are virtually unlimited figs 2 and 4 when forests are cleared or degraded more sunlight can reach the ground leading to increased surface radiation and higher soil temperatures this can increase evaporation rates and decrease soil moisture which can in turn decrease transpiration rates mcdonnell et al 2018 goeking and tarboton 2020 limiting soil moisture that otherwise would have contributed to runoff yield bosch and hewlett 1982 fig 6f meanwhile studies have shown that low streamflow in summer is often accompanied by warmer water temperatures istok and boersma 1986 van vliet et al 2013 which can further stress aquatic habitats and the production of food low water levels during the warm season if maintained can accelerate the effects of river ice buildup in winter bradford and heinonen 2008 el jabi and caissie 2019 gronsdahl et al 2019 when water levels are low during the cold season the flow of water in rivers slows down and allows ice at the surface to accumulate more easily further reducing flow rates we found that the lag between peak q and p decreased with increasing forest cover removal fig 9a and 10a which is consistent with other researchers findings e g zhang et al 2016 these results correspond to the rainfall interception capacity of forests which can slow down peak streamflow by reducing the amount of rainwater that can reach streams and rivers bladon et al 2019 goeking and tarboton 2020 most notably increases in forest cover removal promoted a decrease in the lag between peak swe and q fig 9b and 10b causing the snowmelt season peak flow to shift forward some studies have pointed out that the presence of forest cover promoted surface runoff conversion to subsurface flow and groundwater contributing to a net storage of water in forested landscapes newman et al 2010 kim and jackson 2012 an explanation for this is that the vadose zone of woodlands is usually less compacted than the same zone in non woodland areas newman et al 2010 kim and jackson 2012 and as a result meltwater and rain can more easily infiltrate into the soil furthermore as a biological pump of atmospheric moisture forests play an important role in regulating the hydrological cycle locally chen et al 1993 thus changes in the extent of canopy cover may alter canopy microclimate makarieva and gorshkov 2007 von arx et al 2013 causing delayed seasonal patterns in pet and t fig 10b overall our results confirmed that forest cover removal has an important role in exacerbating the advancement of springtime flooding and its associated peak flow and onset and duration of summer low streamflow events although the effect that forests may have on the timing and magnitude of streamflow could be greatly altered as the regional climate shifts from a mostly snow to rain driven system one of the key challenges facing forest management under a changing climate is the potential for increased hydrological variability forest harvesting practices may need to be adjusted to maintain or enhance the water holding capacity of forested landscapes 5 conclusions annual forest cover removal rates and snowmelt season discharge rates in the upper saint john river subbasin were shown to increase from 2001 to 2019 with a rate of change of 7 7 and 2 1 year 1 respectively during the spring snowmelt season variation in discharge rates was mostly dominated by sdd and swe during the warm season discharge rates were controlled primarily by wdd and annual forest cover removal with increasing forest cover loss spring flooding peaks increased with no net increase in snowfall whereas warm season discharge rates decreased basin wide forest cover removal influenced waterflow dynamics over a range of timescales at a monthly timescale the lag between peak q and p significantly decreased with increasing forest cover removal on an annual scale lag between q and swe yielded a negative correlation with increasing annual forest cover loss forest cover removal has the potential to exacerbate the advancement of spring flooding and its associated peak as well as promote summer low streamflow events changes in river flow dynamics anticipated with future climate change and continued repeated annual forest cover removal highlight the need for a multi
