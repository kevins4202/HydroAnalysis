22555,this note investigates the waypoints based path following problem of underactuated surface vehicles usvs considering that there exists the moving obstacle around the reference path an improved dynamic virtual ship dvs guidance principle is proposed by incorporating the safety prediction obstacle avoidance spoa strategy in the mechanism a real time distance function is established to obtain the distance to closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa which are employed to evaluate the current sailing situation then the own ship could choose the corresponding sailing mode path following mode or obstacle avoidance mode especially for the latter one the velocity and the heading angle orders are taken into account together to generate the reasonable avoidance order which is consistent with the international regulations of preventing collisions at sea colregs and the marine practice furthermore based on the full state observerable characteristic of the underactuated system the eso based output feedback control algorithm is derived to guarantee the convergence of the own ship to the dvs and the external disturbance and the model uncertainty are integrated as an augmented variable to be estimated besides all signals in the closed loop system are ensured to be semi global uniformly ultimately bounded sguub the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme are verified by the comparative experiment and the experiment within the simulated ocean environment keywords dvs guidance path following control obstacle avoidance eso underactuated ships 1 induction in the past decades the control of underactuated ships has attracted a lot of attention from the control community especially in the aspect of the path following control yu et al 2018 gao et al 2017 the issue concerning the path following control of the underactuated ship has been extensively studied on account of its superiorities in saving energy and improving the autonomy cheng et al 2017 ghommam et al 2018 in the marine practice the waypoints based path following tasks are carried out for usvs in the most of time whereas the own ship should be required to take the obstacles avoidance into consideration when performing the waypoints based path following tasks as for the common static obstacles such as the light buoy and the small island they are easier to be avoided because of its poor or none mobility however there still exist more difficulties for the moving obstacle avoidance zhang et al 2017 e g the ship to ship avoidance therefore it is imperative to develop an effective guidance and control scheme for usvs and that is significant for ensuring the security and improving the autonomy of usvs to achieve the automatic navigation of usvs along the waypoints based reference path several guidance principles have been developed in the existing literatures such as the line of sight los algorithm and dvs one the los guidance is one of the most widely used algorithms for usvs owing to its effectiveness and simplicity lu et al 2017 though when the underactuated ship is sailing with the uncertain external disturbance e g the wind the irregular wave and the sea current the accuracy of traditional los law would be affected by the existence of the nonzero sideslip angle to alleviate the influence of the nonzero sideslip angle several improved versions of the los guidance have been presented in the references lekkas and fossen 2014 fossen et al 2015 where the sideslip angle is estimated and compensated online to get the better closed loop performance furthermore in order to improve the tracking effects of los algorithm at turning points zhang and zhang 2016 presents a novel dvs guidance algorithm by utilizing the time series information of the guidance virtue ship and it gives full consideration to the limitation of practical machinery in the existing literatures the obstacle avoidance problem of usvs is mainly tackled by planning obstacle free reference path memon et al 2016 in moe and pettersen 2016 a novel obstacle avoidance principle is presented to improve the navigation safety of ships and that conforms to the related collision prevention regulations e g colregs actually the solution applied in the issue of the robot s obstacle avoidance could be referred to implement the obstacle avoidance manoeuvering for usvs in chu et al 2012 a real time path planning algorithm for the mobile robot is developed to program the optimal path for the off road autonomous driving with the static obstacles avoidance and the experiment result has won the 2010 autonomous vehicle competition organized by the hyundai kia automotive group moreover to cope with the more complex cases the neural network planner and q learning are united to generate the collision free trajectory for the autonomous robot in the environment containing the static and dynamic obstacles duguleana and mogan 2016 nevertheless the underactuated ship has its own unique structure with a rudder propeller system as mentioned in polvara et al 2017 which means there are only two control inputs in the system and the time efficiency of the obstacle avoidance operation is poor due to the large inertia of usvs in addition the obstacle detecting equipment onboard is with the limited measurability these characteristics would increase the difficulty in the maneuverability of obstacle avoidance for underactuated ships thus there exist more factors needed to be considered while designing the obstacle avoidance strategy of usvs as for the path following control of usvs the robustness of the closed loop system is critical for applying the corresponding algorithm into the control practice especially for the model uncertainty and the unmeasured external disturbance for this purpose a class of nonlinear approximation schemes are well developed including the neural networks nns control zhang and zhang 2016 bin 2011 the fuzzy logic control flc fraga and sheng 2011 xu and sun 2017 nevertheless the aforementioned approaches may not be applicable for the case that only the attitude information is available in liu et al 2017 the reduced order eso is constructed to identify the time varying sideslip angle and the robust stability of the closed loop system is guaranteed via the cascade control structure more specifically the eso could be employed to estimate the system state and provide the real time estimation of the system uncertainty and external disturbance and that does not depend on the accurate model structures fu et al 2015 motivated by the above observations a novel eso based path following control algorithm is proposed for usvs with the safety prediction obstacle avoidance strategy and the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the spoa dvs algorithm is proposed to deal with the dynamic obstacle problem for the underactuated ship in the proposed strategy a real time minimum distance function is developed to predict the collision risk between both ships based on it the speed and heading angle as obstacle avoidance reference are considered together to generate the reasonable obstacle avoidance trajectory that could not only promote the safety of navigation for underactuated ships and also conforms to the colregs and the nautical practice 2 the eso based output feedback control algorithm is developed by constructing the eso the external disturbance and the model uncertainty could be integrated as an augmented variable to be estimated and compensated online furthermore the proposed control law is with the concise form which could facilitate its implementation on the practical engineering 2 problem formulation 2 1

denote the control inputs of the system to facilitate the subsequent analysis the forementioned model is transformed into a matrix form eqs 5 and 6 could be rewritten as eqs 7 and 8 7 η j η ν with j η

the underactuated system described by eqs 7 and 8 is deemed as full state observable remark 1 in the existing literatures the assumption 2 is quite common and reasonable for underactuated ships and that could illustrate the rationality for the design of the eso based control algorithm in eq 8 it is noted that the disturbance and unknown structure are synthesized into g ν more importantly g ν could be approximated by an augmented variable in the eso and is disposable in the controller design 3 guidance and control design 3 1 spoa dvs guidance in this subsection the spoa dvs guidance principle will be ulteriorly elaborated as shown in fig 1 there are two key parts in the dvs guidance algorithm including the dvs and gvs the gvs is designed to generate the reference path based on waypoints planning trajectory meanwhile the dvs will sail along the reference path actually it is exactly the strength of the dvs guidance law comparing with other guidance strategies it takes the limitations of the actuators into account for usvs and it is more convenient to connect obstacle avoidance with path following by altering the dvs s behaviors to facilitate the subsequent design and analysis the original dvs guidance principle is slightly modified in this paper in the dvs guidance principle the dvs and gvs are described as eq 9 and they are deemed as two ideal ships with no inertia and damping effects 9 x i u i cos ψ i y i u i sin ψ i ψ i r i i g d different from our previous researches the generation of dvs is no longer restricted on the line between the gvs and the real ship it is considered as an independent sailing objective which could facilitate the design of the spoa dvs guidance strategy in the marine practice the capability of obstacles recognition is obtained by sensors equipped in the ship such as radar lidar etc in this paper considering that the following design of controller will guarantee the fast convergence of the own ship to the dvs so one assume the dvs has the same detecting capability as the real ship and define r t e s t as the detecting range of dvs case 1 path following mode when eq 10 meets the condition as l r r t e s t it is proven that the approaching ship is out of the detecting range of dvs with radius r t e s t the path following task is performed as shown in fig 1 in this mode the speed of gvs is selected to be a constant by adjusting the propelling plants i e u g u g p the heading angle ψ g of gvs is always in accordance to the geometry of the reference path no matter in the path following mode or the obstacle avoidance mode as shown in fig 1 the heading angle ψ d of dvs is chosen to be ψ g p shown in eq 11 10 l r x c x d 2 y c y d 2 where l r denotes the real time distance of two ships x c y c is the real time position of the approaching ship x d y d is the position of dvs 11 ψ d p 0 5 1 sgn x g x d sgn y g y d π arctan y g y d x g x d the speed u d of dvs is selected as eq 12 12 u d p k d l d g u g p cos ψ g ψ d p l d b s e t l d b l d b s e t in eq 12 k d 0 is an designing parameter to determine the convergence rate of dvs l d b s e t is the upper limit of distance l d b when l d b l d b s e t one could derive that u d p 0 and that means the dvs will not be away from the own ship beyond l d b s e t which takes the saturation of actuators into account eq 12 guarantees the convergence of dvs to the own ship thus the path following task of the own ship could be carried out now the lyapunov candidate v d g 1 2 l d g 2 is introduced to complete the proof one could obtain that v d g 1 2 x d g 2 y d g 2 by the geometry where x d g and y d g are coordinate errors between the dvs and gvs in x and y axis respectively differentiate v d g and substitute eq 9 into v d g one can conclude 13 v d g x d g x d g y d g y d g l d g cos ψ d p u g cos ψ g u d p cos ψ d p l d g sin ψ d p u g sin ψ g u d p sin ψ d p l d g u g cos ψ g ψ d p u d p while the controller facilitates l d b 0 it can be rendered from eq 13 that v d g 2 k d v d g i e v d g tends to be exponentially stable if the controller is effective case 2 obstacle avoidance mode if an approaching ship is within the detecting circle with radius r t e s t the approaching ship is considered as an obstacle ship and the dvs will switch rapidly to the obstacle avoidance mode at first the encountered situation is divided to four categories in fig 2 according to the included angle θ d a between the dvs and the obstacle ship in a of fig 2 the definition of θ d a is given based on this included angle four collision avoidance situations are divided with respect to the sectors in b of fig 2 it is noted that once a specific situation is determined it will keep unchanged until the obstacle ship sails out of the detecting range on the basis of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs when the real ship encountered different collision situations the avoidance manoeuvring needed to take would be different when the two ships are in the head on situation the dvs and the obstacle ship should meet each other from their portsides and in the light of nautical experience both ships should slow down for the obstacle ship ready to cross from the portside of dvs the dvs is with the priority of holding the course and speed versus the obstacle ship it may speed up to reduce encountering time and take no adjustments in the heading angle unless the obstacle ship didn t abide the colregs once noticing that there is a ship crossing from the starboard side of dvs it should slow down and steer right rudder actively with regard to the overtaking situation the dvs could speed up appropriately to pass the obstacle ship from either side it is easy to find out that all above situations could be resolved for the own ship by steering rudder and adjusting its speed thus in the following analysis of manoeuvering four situations could be divided into two categories according to the commonness of their avoidance adjustments i e a overtaking and crossing from left b head on and crossing from right before the manoeuvering is discussed the notion safety prediction proposed in this note need to be introduced to facilitate the understanding for the spoa dvs guidance principle briefly speaking the spoa dvs guidance law could predict the forthcoming distance between the dvs and the obstacle ship hence the collision risk could be evaluated in real time meanwhile one present the safety distance i e l s a f e which is considered as an safety index by comparing with the minimal distance l m i n one can decide whether or not to perform the obstacle avoidance manoeuvering the illustration of its rationale and requisite parameters are shown in fig 3 in fig 3 t 1 denotes the present time whereas t 2 and t 3 denote the future ones if the position orientation and speed information of dvs and the obstacle ship i e x d y d ψ d u d and x c y c ψ c u c are both available the varying distance between them at any given moments can be calculated the distance is described by a function l x d y d ψ d u d x c y c ψ c u c t 1 t it can be rendered that l a 2 b 2 a x c x d u c cos ψ c u d cos ψ d t t 1 b y c y d u c sin ψ c u d sin ψ d t t 1 from eq 9 differentiate l eq 14 could be derived 14 d l d t c t t 1 d a 2 b 2 where c u c cos ψ c u d cos ψ d 2 u c sin ψ c u d sin ψ d 2 d x c x d u c cos ψ c u d cos ψ d y c y d u c sin ψ c u d sin ψ d excluding the extreme condition u d u c ψ d ψ c it is clear that from eq 14 that there is a global minimum point t m i n with respect to the minimal distance l m i n according to t m i n and l m i n the following risk evaluation principle is formulated 1 if t m i n t 1 but l m i n l s a f e it is regarded to be with risk of collision and the dvs should be manipulated to avoid collision 2 otherwise there is no risk and the speed u d and heading angle ψ d of dvs still hold on for instance as shown in fig 3 there exist collision risks at t m i n t 2 and l m i n l s a f e now the gain coefficient ε is first defined according to the mechanical behavior of dvs which indicates that ψ d are able to change by ε δ u while u d changes by λ δ u then the manoeuvering commands for collision avoidance can be obtained the expected values of the collision avoidance speed u d o and heading angle ψ d o are depicted in eqs 15 and 16 15 δ u arg min δ u l ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u u d t 1 t s λ δ u t m i n t 1 δ u 0 where l ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u u d t 1 t s λ δ u l s a f e t s is the sampling span t 1 t s denotes the last sampling time point λ 1 corresponds to case a and b respectively eq 16 could be obtained 16 u d o u d t 1 t s λ δ u ψ d o ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u while sailing according to the path following mode or that of last sampling time point both cases are under risk of collision for case a the dvs should speed up to eliminate the risk thus let λ 1 in eqs 15 and 16 for case b the dvs should slow down and give a right rudder which implies λ 1 to ensure the continuity the values of expectation such as u d o and ψ d o are not assigned to the current speed u d and heading angle ψ d of dvs directly thus in the detecting scale of dvs a transition function is defined i e u 1 δ u t s u 2 δ u t s is the maximal varying scale of speed in the sampling span t s if u 2 u 1 δ u t s u 1 δ u t s u 2 u 2 otherwise u 1 δ u t s u 2 u 1 δ u t s sign u 2 u 1 thus let u d u d t 1 t s δ u t s u d o and ψ d ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u t s ψ d o the spoa dvs guidance algorithm could be developed through table 1 and one could see from table 1 that the safety prediction will be performed in the sequence from the path following mode to that of the last sampling time when the obstacle ship is detected according to the sequence the guidance commands are derived from the former one under no risks of collision if both of them are at risks the manoeuvering commands can be obtained from eqs 15 and 16 the arrangements in the flow could ensure that the dvs will revert to the path following mode after finishing the avoidance manoeuvering and the deviation from the waypoints based reference path could be reduced as far as possible 3 2 the design of the controller based on eso in this part an eso based output feedback control law will be developed by utilizing the linear eso to facilitate the design of eso eq 17 is derived by combining eq 7 with 8 17 η j η g ν j η η ν j η m 1 τ to construct the eso one defines ξ 1 η ξ 2 η and ξ 3 j η g ν j η η ν let ξ i j denotes the j th element of ξ i then the eso for eq 17 is designed as eq 18 18 ξ ˆ 1 ξ ˆ 2 1 ε k 1 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 1 ξ ˆ 2 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 m 1 τ 1 ε 2 k 2 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 1 ξ ˆ 3 1 ε 3 k 3 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 1 then according to eq 3 one can obtain a 3 3 hurwitz matrix e and a symmetric positive definite matrix p satisfying pe e t p i 3 by tuning k 1 k 2 k 3 by assigning an initial value to variables one can acquire k j j 1 2 3 the conclusion is described as eq 19 19 ξ i j ξ ˆ i j k j ε 4 i t t c where t c 6 λ m a x p ε ln ε 1 let k k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 eq 20 could be deduced 20 ξ i ξ ˆ i k ε 4 i i 1 2 3 ulteriorly one can obtain the estimated value of ν by substituting ξ ˆ 2 to eq 7 i e ν ˆ j 1 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2 by virtue of eq 12 the estimation error can be derived as eq 21 21 ν ν ˆ j 1 ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ ˆ 2 3 k ε 2 furthermore the model uncertainty and external disturbance could also be approximated by fusing estimation of the extended state ξ ˆ 3 i e g ˆ ν j 1 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2 ν ˆ it is known that ν belongs to a compact set which will be discussed in section 3 3 thus defining the function b ν ν ν to be with the upper bound b ν ν from eq 21 the approximating error could be derived as eq 22 22 g g ˆ j 1 ξ 1 ξ 3 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2 ν ˆ j ξ 1 ξ 2 ν j 1 ξ 1 ξ 3 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2 ν ˆ j ξ 1 ξ 2 ν ˆ j ξ 1 ξ 2 ν ˆ j ξ 1 ξ 2 ν 3 k ε 2 k 3 ε 2 ν ˆ 2 3 k ε 2 ν 3 k ε 6 k ε 2 b ν ν 3 2 k 2 ε 4 3 2 k ε 2 b ν ν denote f ε 3 k ε 6 k ε 2 b ν ν 3 2 k 2 ε 4 3 2 k ε 2 b ν ν one can recognize f ε to be a class of k function to eliminate the kinematic error the following error system as eq 23 is constructed by coordinate transformation 23 x e y e ψ e cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 x d x y d y ψ d ψ differentiate eq 23 one can obtain eq 24 24 x e u u d cos ψ e r y e y e v u d sin ψ e r x e ψ e r d r the virtual control law in kinematic loop is first proposed as eq 25 25 α u k x x e u

outputs of the fist order filter ψ e β ψ e ψ e to avoid the explosion of complexity the dynamic surface control dsc technique is employed by introducing two first order filters β ψ e and β ψ e let the virtual controls pass through them with time constants ξ u and ξ r respectively the filter error is denoted by z i α i β i 26 ξ i β i β i α i i u r by substituting eqs 25 and 26 to eq 24 it could be obtained as eq 27 27 x e k x x e z u u e r y e y e k y y e v ˆ v r x e u d ψ d ψ e k ψ ψ e z r r e where ψ d sin ψ e sin α ψ e u e β u u r e β r r one define g i as the i t h element of g since there is no driving force in the sway motion only two degrees of freedom are discussed in eq 8 then the error system in dynamic loop can be described as eq 28 28 u e β u g 1 τ u m u r e β r g 3 τ r m r thus the final control inputs τ u and τ r are designed as eq 29 29 τ u m u β u k u β u u ˆ x e g ˆ 1 τ r m r β r k r β r r ˆ ψ e g ˆ 3 where k u and k r are design parameters by substituting eqs 29 28 eq 30 could be derived 30 u e k u u e k u u u ˆ x e g ˆ 1 g 1 r e k r r e k r r r ˆ ψ e g ˆ 3 g 3 remark 2 the proposed eso based output feedback control law could approximate the unmeasurable states by utilizing the location and attitude information of the ship which can be easily available by navigational instrument such as compass and gps furthermore the model uncertainty and the external disturbance could be integrated as an augmented state to be estimated and the excellent approximation performance could be obtained guo and zhang 2017 chen et al 2017 3 3 stability analysis the completed proof will be shown in this subsection which is used to ensure the stability of whole closed loop system the main result of this note is summarized as follows theorem 1 for eqs 5 and 6

foregoing parameters σ can be selected to be arbitrarily small therefore the closed loop system is demonstrated to be sguub under the proposed control law for the sway velocity v it is content with the condition of passivity boundedness according to li et al 2008 i e v is surely bounded as u and r are bounded this is tenable in practice owing to the effectiveness of hydraulic damping which always prevents v from being divergent remark 3 the analysis is only presented after t c because the inequality eqs 20 and 21 only holds while t t c in the duration of 0 t c the error between state and its estimation exponentially converges to the right side of inequality this will not affect the subsequent analysis since t c is a relative smaller value and all variables are always constrained to be within ω 4 illustrative experiments in this section two experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm including the comparative experiment and the experiment in the simulated ocean environment the result of the comparison with moe and pettersen 2016 is shown in section 4 1 in order to evaluate the reliability of the spoa dvs guidance principle the simulated experiment is conducted in section 4 2 both experiments are carried out on the basis of the research vessel yukun perpendiculars length l p p 108 m modeled breadth b 18 m volume 5710 2 m

comparative experiment the superiority of the proposed spoa dvs guidance mechanism is verified by comparing with the result in moe and pettersen 2016 where the set based los guidance is adopted with regard to the guidance performance the crossing situation is selected to present the comparison result without considering the external disturbance the reference path is determined by two waypoints w 1 200 m 200 m w 2 200 m 2500 m the initial states of the own ship and the obstacle ship are set as x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 real ship 0 m 50 m 90 deg 6 3 m s 0 m s 0 deg s x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 obstacle ship 1200 m 500 m 90 deg 4 m s 0 m s 0 deg s and the trajectory of the obstacle ship is described by a hump function as eq 36 for the set based los guidance and the spoa dvs guidance the detecting scale r t e s t of the own ship is set to be 8 l p p and the safety distance l s a f e is set as 4 l p p the parameters in the set based los guidance mechanism could be obtained from moe and pettersen 2016 the final comparison results are displayed in figs 4 5 36 x 1200 200 exp y 200 2 80000 fig 4 shows the different avoidance maneuverings based on their own guidance algorithm in the crossing situation those marked ship positions at five time points i e t 1 100 s t 2 150 s t 3 200 s t 4 250 s t 5 300 s are used to check the effectiveness of both guidance principles as for the sailing voyage the proposed guidance algorithm is with the better performance over the set based los guidance principle by the quantitative analysis i e the spoa dvs guidance 2494 9 m the set based los guidance 2907 7 m fig 5 presents the comparison result of surge speed it is noted that the set based los guidance principle needs larger speed to avoid the obstacle successfully that may lead to the increasing burden of actuators and be unacceptable in marine practice thus the proposed spoa dvs algorithm is with more practicability in the engineering application 4 2 experiment in the simulated ocean environment to verify the robustness of the proposed guidance and control scheme under the actual sea condition this section carries out the simulation of the teaching ship yukun which sails with the modeling uncertainty and the external disturbance based on the torsethaugen wave spectrum the mechanism models of the irregular wave and wind force are set respectively by referring to fossen 2011 in this experiment the wind direction and the average velocity are set as ψ wind 200 deg and v wind 15 7 m s respectively and the corresponding graphs of the simulated wind and wave are displayed in fig 6 the waypoints based reference path is defined by five waypoints i e 50 m 50 m 250 m 2000 m 1700 m 2580 m 3200 m 2000 m 3500 m 400 m the initial states of the own ship are set as x 0

law and the control algorithm could be obtained from table 2 to illustrate the validity of the avoidance maneuvering in different encountered situations one give the corresponding information of the obstacle ships listed in table 3 figs 7 10 are the final simulated results in fig 7 the own ship could achieve the effective obstacle avoidance at four different situations which are marked at 8 time points i e t 1 130 s t 2 200 s t 3 460 s t 4 520 s t 5 730 s t 6 770 s t 7 940 s t 8 1020 s in t 5 t 6 although the maneuvering of the own ship is not consistent with the colregs which results from the failed avoidance maneuvering of the obstacle ship the avoidance result could still verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm figs 8 and 9 present the eso s approximation performance for the system kinstates and external disturbance it is clear that the approximation ability of the eso is satisfied fig 10 is the control effort of the spoa dvs guidance in the simulated ocean environment and it is noted that the control inputs are reasonable although there exists the oscillation phenomenon the actuated servo system has the filtering effectiveness in the nautical practice which could eliminate the effects caused by the oscillation on the basis of the above analysis the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed law could be demonstrated 5 conclusion the ship to ship avoidance issue for the underactuated ship is investigated in this paper which exists widely in the waypoints based path following missions of underactuated ships the proposed spoa dvs guidance principle could improve the sailing safety and sailing efficiency for usvs based on the function of safety prediction the own ship could automatically switch to the most appropriate sailing mode according to different encountered situations especially for the obstacle avoidance maneuvering the joint adjustments of speed and heading angle are more consistent with the marine practice moreover the eso based output feedback control algorithm could ensure the convergence of the own ship to dvs the model uncertainty and external disturbance could be integrated as an extended state to estimated

22555,this note investigates the waypoints based path following problem of underactuated surface vehicles usvs considering that there exists the moving obstacle around the reference path an improved dynamic virtual ship dvs guidance principle is proposed by incorporating the safety prediction obstacle avoidance spoa strategy in the mechanism a real time distance function is established to obtain the distance to closest point of approach dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa which are employed to evaluate the current sailing situation then the own ship could choose the corresponding sailing mode path following mode or obstacle avoidance mode especially for the latter one the velocity and the heading angle orders are taken into account together to generate the reasonable avoidance order which is consistent with the international regulations of preventing collisions at sea colregs and the marine practice furthermore based on the full state observerable characteristic of the underactuated system the eso based output feedback control algorithm is derived to guarantee the convergence of the own ship to the dvs and the external disturbance and the model uncertainty are integrated as an augmented variable to be estimated besides all signals in the closed loop system are ensured to be semi global uniformly ultimately bounded sguub the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme are verified by the comparative experiment and the experiment within the simulated ocean environment keywords dvs guidance path following control obstacle avoidance eso underactuated ships 1 induction in the past decades the control of underactuated ships has attracted a lot of attention from the control community especially in the aspect of the path following control yu et al 2018 gao et al 2017 the issue concerning the path following control of the underactuated ship has been extensively studied on account of its superiorities in saving energy and improving the autonomy cheng et al 2017 ghommam et al 2018 in the marine practice the waypoints based path following tasks are carried out for usvs in the most of time whereas the own ship should be required to take the obstacles avoidance into consideration when performing the waypoints based path following tasks as for the common static obstacles such as the light buoy and the small island they are easier to be avoided because of its poor or none mobility however there still exist more difficulties for the moving obstacle avoidance zhang et al 2017 e g the ship to ship avoidance therefore it is imperative to develop an effective guidance and control scheme for usvs and that is significant for ensuring the security and improving the autonomy of usvs to achieve the automatic navigation of usvs along the waypoints based reference path several guidance principles have been developed in the existing literatures such as the line of sight los algorithm and dvs one the los guidance is one of the most widely used algorithms for usvs owing to its effectiveness and simplicity lu et al 2017 though when the underactuated ship is sailing with the uncertain external disturbance e g the wind the irregular wave and the sea current the accuracy of traditional los law would be affected by the existence of the nonzero sideslip angle to alleviate the influence of the nonzero sideslip angle several improved versions of the los guidance have been presented in the references lekkas and fossen 2014 fossen et al 2015 where the sideslip angle is estimated and compensated online to get the better closed loop performance furthermore in order to improve the tracking effects of los algorithm at turning points zhang and zhang 2016 presents a novel dvs guidance algorithm by utilizing the time series information of the guidance virtue ship and it gives full consideration to the limitation of practical machinery in the existing literatures the obstacle avoidance problem of usvs is mainly tackled by planning obstacle free reference path memon et al 2016 in moe and pettersen 2016 a novel obstacle avoidance principle is presented to improve the navigation safety of ships and that conforms to the related collision prevention regulations e g colregs actually the solution applied in the issue of the robot s obstacle avoidance could be referred to implement the obstacle avoidance manoeuvering for usvs in chu et al 2012 a real time path planning algorithm for the mobile robot is developed to program the optimal path for the off road autonomous driving with the static obstacles avoidance and the experiment result has won the 2010 autonomous vehicle competition organized by the hyundai kia automotive group moreover to cope with the more complex cases the neural network planner and q learning are united to generate the collision free trajectory for the autonomous robot in the environment containing the static and dynamic obstacles duguleana and mogan 2016 nevertheless the underactuated ship has its own unique structure with a rudder propeller system as mentioned in polvara et al 2017 which means there are only two control inputs in the system and the time efficiency of the obstacle avoidance operation is poor due to the large inertia of usvs in addition the obstacle detecting equipment onboard is with the limited measurability these characteristics would increase the difficulty in the maneuverability of obstacle avoidance for underactuated ships thus there exist more factors needed to be considered while designing the obstacle avoidance strategy of usvs as for the path following control of usvs the robustness of the closed loop system is critical for applying the corresponding algorithm into the control practice especially for the model uncertainty and the unmeasured external disturbance for this purpose a class of nonlinear approximation schemes are well developed including the neural networks nns control zhang and zhang 2016 bin 2011 the fuzzy logic control flc fraga and sheng 2011 xu and sun 2017 nevertheless the aforementioned approaches may not be applicable for the case that only the attitude information is available in liu et al 2017 the reduced order eso is constructed to identify the time varying sideslip angle and the robust stability of the closed loop system is guaranteed via the cascade control structure more specifically the eso could be employed to estimate the system state and provide the real time estimation of the system uncertainty and external disturbance and that does not depend on the accurate model structures fu et al 2015 motivated by the above observations a novel eso based path following control algorithm is proposed for usvs with the safety prediction obstacle avoidance strategy and the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the spoa dvs algorithm is proposed to deal with the dynamic obstacle problem for the underactuated ship in the proposed strategy a real time minimum distance function is developed to predict the collision risk between both ships based on it the speed and heading angle as obstacle avoidance reference are considered together to generate the reasonable obstacle avoidance trajectory that could not only promote the safety of navigation for underactuated ships and also conforms to the colregs and the nautical practice 2 the eso based output feedback control algorithm is developed by constructing the eso the external disturbance and the model uncertainty could be integrated as an augmented variable to be estimated and compensated online furthermore the proposed control law is with the concise form which could facilitate its implementation on the practical engineering 2 problem formulation 2 1

denote the control inputs of the system to facilitate the subsequent analysis the forementioned model is transformed into a matrix form eqs 5 and 6 could be rewritten as eqs 7 and 8 7 η j η ν with j η

the underactuated system described by eqs 7 and 8 is deemed as full state observable remark 1 in the existing literatures the assumption 2 is quite common and reasonable for underactuated ships and that could illustrate the rationality for the design of the eso based control algorithm in eq 8 it is noted that the disturbance and unknown structure are synthesized into g ν more importantly g ν could be approximated by an augmented variable in the eso and is disposable in the controller design 3 guidance and control design 3 1 spoa dvs guidance in this subsection the spoa dvs guidance principle will be ulteriorly elaborated as shown in fig 1 there are two key parts in the dvs guidance algorithm including the dvs and gvs the gvs is designed to generate the reference path based on waypoints planning trajectory meanwhile the dvs will sail along the reference path actually it is exactly the strength of the dvs guidance law comparing with other guidance strategies it takes the limitations of the actuators into account for usvs and it is more convenient to connect obstacle avoidance with path following by altering the dvs s behaviors to facilitate the subsequent design and analysis the original dvs guidance principle is slightly modified in this paper in the dvs guidance principle the dvs and gvs are described as eq 9 and they are deemed as two ideal ships with no inertia and damping effects 9 x i u i cos ψ i y i u i sin ψ i ψ i r i i g d different from our previous researches the generation of dvs is no longer restricted on the line between the gvs and the real ship it is considered as an independent sailing objective which could facilitate the design of the spoa dvs guidance strategy in the marine practice the capability of obstacles recognition is obtained by sensors equipped in the ship such as radar lidar etc in this paper considering that the following design of controller will guarantee the fast convergence of the own ship to the dvs so one assume the dvs has the same detecting capability as the real ship and define r t e s t as the detecting range of dvs case 1 path following mode when eq 10 meets the condition as l r r t e s t it is proven that the approaching ship is out of the detecting range of dvs with radius r t e s t the path following task is performed as shown in fig 1 in this mode the speed of gvs is selected to be a constant by adjusting the propelling plants i e u g u g p the heading angle ψ g of gvs is always in accordance to the geometry of the reference path no matter in the path following mode or the obstacle avoidance mode as shown in fig 1 the heading angle ψ d of dvs is chosen to be ψ g p shown in eq 11 10 l r x c x d 2 y c y d 2 where l r denotes the real time distance of two ships x c y c is the real time position of the approaching ship x d y d is the position of dvs 11 ψ d p 0 5 1 sgn x g x d sgn y g y d π arctan y g y d x g x d the speed u d of dvs is selected as eq 12 12 u d p k d l d g u g p cos ψ g ψ d p l d b s e t l d b l d b s e t in eq 12 k d 0 is an designing parameter to determine the convergence rate of dvs l d b s e t is the upper limit of distance l d b when l d b l d b s e t one could derive that u d p 0 and that means the dvs will not be away from the own ship beyond l d b s e t which takes the saturation of actuators into account eq 12 guarantees the convergence of dvs to the own ship thus the path following task of the own ship could be carried out now the lyapunov candidate v d g 1 2 l d g 2 is introduced to complete the proof one could obtain that v d g 1 2 x d g 2 y d g 2 by the geometry where x d g and y d g are coordinate errors between the dvs and gvs in x and y axis respectively differentiate v d g and substitute eq 9 into v d g one can conclude 13 v d g x d g x d g y d g y d g l d g cos ψ d p u g cos ψ g u d p cos ψ d p l d g sin ψ d p u g sin ψ g u d p sin ψ d p l d g u g cos ψ g ψ d p u d p while the controller facilitates l d b 0 it can be rendered from eq 13 that v d g 2 k d v d g i e v d g tends to be exponentially stable if the controller is effective case 2 obstacle avoidance mode if an approaching ship is within the detecting circle with radius r t e s t the approaching ship is considered as an obstacle ship and the dvs will switch rapidly to the obstacle avoidance mode at first the encountered situation is divided to four categories in fig 2 according to the included angle θ d a between the dvs and the obstacle ship in a of fig 2 the definition of θ d a is given based on this included angle four collision avoidance situations are divided with respect to the sectors in b of fig 2 it is noted that once a specific situation is determined it will keep unchanged until the obstacle ship sails out of the detecting range on the basis of the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs when the real ship encountered different collision situations the avoidance manoeuvring needed to take would be different when the two ships are in the head on situation the dvs and the obstacle ship should meet each other from their portsides and in the light of nautical experience both ships should slow down for the obstacle ship ready to cross from the portside of dvs the dvs is with the priority of holding the course and speed versus the obstacle ship it may speed up to reduce encountering time and take no adjustments in the heading angle unless the obstacle ship didn t abide the colregs once noticing that there is a ship crossing from the starboard side of dvs it should slow down and steer right rudder actively with regard to the overtaking situation the dvs could speed up appropriately to pass the obstacle ship from either side it is easy to find out that all above situations could be resolved for the own ship by steering rudder and adjusting its speed thus in the following analysis of manoeuvering four situations could be divided into two categories according to the commonness of their avoidance adjustments i e a overtaking and crossing from left b head on and crossing from right before the manoeuvering is discussed the notion safety prediction proposed in this note need to be introduced to facilitate the understanding for the spoa dvs guidance principle briefly speaking the spoa dvs guidance law could predict the forthcoming distance between the dvs and the obstacle ship hence the collision risk could be evaluated in real time meanwhile one present the safety distance i e l s a f e which is considered as an safety index by comparing with the minimal distance l m i n one can decide whether or not to perform the obstacle avoidance manoeuvering the illustration of its rationale and requisite parameters are shown in fig 3 in fig 3 t 1 denotes the present time whereas t 2 and t 3 denote the future ones if the position orientation and speed information of dvs and the obstacle ship i e x d y d ψ d u d and x c y c ψ c u c are both available the varying distance between them at any given moments can be calculated the distance is described by a function l x d y d ψ d u d x c y c ψ c u c t 1 t it can be rendered that l a 2 b 2 a x c x d u c cos ψ c u d cos ψ d t t 1 b y c y d u c sin ψ c u d sin ψ d t t 1 from eq 9 differentiate l eq 14 could be derived 14 d l d t c t t 1 d a 2 b 2 where c u c cos ψ c u d cos ψ d 2 u c sin ψ c u d sin ψ d 2 d x c x d u c cos ψ c u d cos ψ d y c y d u c sin ψ c u d sin ψ d excluding the extreme condition u d u c ψ d ψ c it is clear that from eq 14 that there is a global minimum point t m i n with respect to the minimal distance l m i n according to t m i n and l m i n the following risk evaluation principle is formulated 1 if t m i n t 1 but l m i n l s a f e it is regarded to be with risk of collision and the dvs should be manipulated to avoid collision 2 otherwise there is no risk and the speed u d and heading angle ψ d of dvs still hold on for instance as shown in fig 3 there exist collision risks at t m i n t 2 and l m i n l s a f e now the gain coefficient ε is first defined according to the mechanical behavior of dvs which indicates that ψ d are able to change by ε δ u while u d changes by λ δ u then the manoeuvering commands for collision avoidance can be obtained the expected values of the collision avoidance speed u d o and heading angle ψ d o are depicted in eqs 15 and 16 15 δ u arg min δ u l ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u u d t 1 t s λ δ u t m i n t 1 δ u 0 where l ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u u d t 1 t s λ δ u l s a f e t s is the sampling span t 1 t s denotes the last sampling time point λ 1 corresponds to case a and b respectively eq 16 could be obtained 16 u d o u d t 1 t s λ δ u ψ d o ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u while sailing according to the path following mode or that of last sampling time point both cases are under risk of collision for case a the dvs should speed up to eliminate the risk thus let λ 1 in eqs 15 and 16 for case b the dvs should slow down and give a right rudder which implies λ 1 to ensure the continuity the values of expectation such as u d o and ψ d o are not assigned to the current speed u d and heading angle ψ d of dvs directly thus in the detecting scale of dvs a transition function is defined i e u 1 δ u t s u 2 δ u t s is the maximal varying scale of speed in the sampling span t s if u 2 u 1 δ u t s u 1 δ u t s u 2 u 2 otherwise u 1 δ u t s u 2 u 1 δ u t s sign u 2 u 1 thus let u d u d t 1 t s δ u t s u d o and ψ d ψ d t 1 t s ε δ u t s ψ d o the spoa dvs guidance algorithm could be developed through table 1 and one could see from table 1 that the safety prediction will be performed in the sequence from the path following mode to that of the last sampling time when the obstacle ship is detected according to the sequence the guidance commands are derived from the former one under no risks of collision if both of them are at risks the manoeuvering commands can be obtained from eqs 15 and 16 the arrangements in the flow could ensure that the dvs will revert to the path following mode after finishing the avoidance manoeuvering and the deviation from the waypoints based reference path could be reduced as far as possible 3 2 the design of the controller based on eso in this part an eso based output feedback control law will be developed by utilizing the linear eso to facilitate the design of eso eq 17 is derived by combining eq 7 with 8 17 η j η g ν j η η ν j η m 1 τ to construct the eso one defines ξ 1 η ξ 2 η and ξ 3 j η g ν j η η ν let ξ i j denotes the j th element of ξ i then the eso for eq 17 is designed as eq 18 18 ξ ˆ 1 ξ ˆ 2 1 ε k 1 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 1 ξ ˆ 2 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 m 1 τ 1 ε 2 k 2 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 1 ξ ˆ 3 1 ε 3 k 3 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 1 then according to eq 3 one can obtain a 3 3 hurwitz matrix e and a symmetric positive definite matrix p satisfying pe e t p i 3 by tuning k 1 k 2 k 3 by assigning an initial value to variables one can acquire k j j 1 2 3 the conclusion is described as eq 19 19 ξ i j ξ ˆ i j k j ε 4 i t t c where t c 6 λ m a x p ε ln ε 1 let k k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 eq 20 could be deduced 20 ξ i ξ ˆ i k ε 4 i i 1 2 3 ulteriorly one can obtain the estimated value of ν by substituting ξ ˆ 2 to eq 7 i e ν ˆ j 1 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2 by virtue of eq 12 the estimation error can be derived as eq 21 21 ν ν ˆ j 1 ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ ˆ 2 3 k ε 2 furthermore the model uncertainty and external disturbance could also be approximated by fusing estimation of the extended state ξ ˆ 3 i e g ˆ ν j 1 ξ 1 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2 ν ˆ it is known that ν belongs to a compact set which will be discussed in section 3 3 thus defining the function b ν ν ν to be with the upper bound b ν ν from eq 21 the approximating error could be derived as eq 22 22 g g ˆ j 1 ξ 1 ξ 3 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2 ν ˆ j ξ 1 ξ 2 ν j 1 ξ 1 ξ 3 ξ ˆ 3 j ξ 1 ξ ˆ 2

is no driving force in the sway motion only two degrees of freedom are discussed in eq 8 then the error system in dynamic loop can be described as eq 28 28 u e β u g 1 τ u m u r e β r g 3 τ r m r thus the final control inputs τ u and τ r are designed as eq 29 29 τ u m u β u k u β u u ˆ x e g ˆ 1 τ r m r β r k r β r r ˆ ψ e g ˆ 3 where k u and k r are design parameters by substituting eqs 29 28 eq

utilizing the location and attitude information of the ship which can be easily available by navigational instrument such as compass and gps furthermore the model uncertainty and the external disturbance could be integrated as an augmented state to be estimated and the excellent approximation performance could be obtained guo and zhang 2017 chen et al 2017 3 3 stability analysis the

draw a conclusion as eq 35 35 v t v t c e γ t t c ϱ γ t t c where there always exists a t σ t c for any σ ϱ γ satisfying that all error variables will settle within 0 σ while t t σ by adjusting the foregoing parameters σ can be selected to be arbitrarily small therefore the closed loop system is demonstrated to be sguub under the proposed control law for the sway velocity v it is content with the condition of passivity boundedness according to li et al 2008 i e v is surely bounded as u and r are bounded this is tenable in practice owing to the effectiveness of hydraulic damping which always prevents v from being divergent remark 3 the analysis is only presented after t c because the inequality eqs 20 and 21 only holds while t t c in the duration of 0 t c the error between state and its estimation exponentially converges to the right side of inequality this will not affect the subsequent analysis since t c is a relative smaller value and all variables are always constrained to be within ω 4 illustrative experiments in this section two experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm including the comparative experiment and the experiment in the simulated ocean environment the result of the comparison with moe and pettersen 2016 is shown in section 4 1 in order to evaluate the reliability of the spoa dvs guidance principle the simulated experiment is conducted in section 4 2 both experiments are carried out on the basis of the research vessel yukun perpendiculars length l p p 108 m modeled breadth b 18 m volume 5710 2 m 2 from dalian maritime university china it is noted that the detailed hydraulic parameters in the mathematical model eqs 5 and 6 have been given in zhang et al 2015 4 1 comparative experiment in the comparative experiment the superiority of the proposed spoa dvs guidance mechanism is verified by comparing with the result in moe and pettersen 2016 where the set based los guidance is adopted with regard to the guidance performance the crossing situation is selected to present the comparison result without considering the external disturbance the reference path is determined by two waypoints w 1 200 m 200 m w 2 200 m 2500 m the initial states of the own ship and the obstacle ship are set as x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 real ship 0 m 50 m 90 deg 6 3 m s 0 m s 0 deg s x 0 y 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 r 0 obstacle ship 1200 m 500 m 90 deg 4 m s 0 m s 0 deg s and the trajectory of the obstacle ship is described by a hump function as eq 36 for the set based los guidance and the spoa dvs guidance the detecting scale r t e s t of the own ship is set to be 8 l p p and the safety distance l s a f e is set as 4 l p p the parameters in the set based los guidance mechanism could be obtained from moe and pettersen 2016 the final comparison results are displayed in figs 4 5 36 x 1200 200 exp y 200 2 80000 fig 4 shows the different avoidance maneuverings based on their own guidance algorithm in the crossing situation those marked ship positions at five time points i e t 1 100 s t 2 150 s t 3 200 s t 4 250 s t 5 300 s are used to check the effectiveness of both guidance principles as for the sailing voyage the proposed guidance algorithm is with the better performance over the set based los guidance principle by the quantitative analysis i e the spoa dvs guidance 2494 9 m the set based los guidance 2907 7 m fig 5 presents the comparison result of surge speed it is noted that the set based los guidance principle needs larger speed to avoid the obstacle successfully that may lead to the increasing burden of actuators and be unacceptable in marine practice thus the proposed spoa dvs algorithm is with more practicability in the engineering application 4 2 experiment in the simulated ocean environment to verify the robustness of the proposed guidance and control scheme under the actual sea condition this section carries out the simulation of the teaching ship yukun which sails with the modeling uncertainty and the external disturbance based on the torsethaugen wave spectrum the mechanism models of the irregular wave and wind force are set respectively by referring to fossen 2011 in this experiment the wind direction and the average velocity are set as ψ wind 200 deg and v wind 15 7 m s respectively and the corresponding graphs of the simulated wind and wave are displayed in fig 6 the waypoints based reference path is defined by five waypoints i e 50 m 50 m 250 m 2000 m 1700 m 2580 m 3200 m 2000 m 3500 m 400 m the initial states of the own ship are set as x 0

law and the control algorithm could be obtained from table 2 to illustrate the validity of the avoidance maneuvering in different encountered situations one give the corresponding information of the obstacle ships listed in table 3 figs 7 10 are the final simulated results in fig 7 the own ship could achieve the effective obstacle avoidance at four different situations which are marked at 8 time points i e t 1 130 s t 2 200 s t 3 460 s t 4 520 s t 5 730 s t 6 770 s t 7 940 s t 8 1020 s in t 5 t 6 although the maneuvering of the own ship is not consistent with the colregs which results from the failed avoidance maneuvering of the obstacle ship the avoidance result could still verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm figs 8 and 9 present the eso s approximation performance for the system kinstates and external disturbance it is clear that the approximation ability of the eso is satisfied fig 10 is the control effort of the spoa dvs guidance in the simulated ocean environment and it is noted that the control inputs are reasonable although there exists the oscillation phenomenon the actuated servo system has the filtering effectiveness in the nautical practice which could eliminate the effects caused by the oscillation on the basis of the above analysis the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed law could be demonstrated 5 conclusion the ship to ship avoidance issue for the underactuated ship is investigated in this paper which exists widely in the waypoints based path following missions of underactuated ships the proposed spoa dvs guidance principle could improve the sailing safety and sailing efficiency for usvs based on the function of safety prediction the own ship could automatically switch to the most appropriate sailing mode according to different encountered situations especially for the obstacle avoidance maneuvering the joint adjustments of speed and heading angle are more consistent with the marine practice moreover the eso based output feedback control algorithm could ensure the convergence of the own ship to dvs the model uncertainty and external disturbance could be integrated as an extended state to estimated together besides the sguub stability of the closed loop system is verified through the lyapunov theory finally the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by the comparative

22556,moonpool is a common structure form in the marine and ocean engineering field the natural oscillation characteristics analysis of fluid in a two dimensional moonpool is presented based on modified fourier series method in the paper the governing equation and boundary conditions of fluid in the two dimensional moonpool are established via potential flow theory the velocity potential function in the moonpool is assumed to be the sum of fourier cosine series and two auxiliary functions the natural frequencies can be calculated conveniently through a normal eigenvalue problem by submitting fourier series as well as auxiliary functions into the governing equations and the boundary conditions with comparing frequencies results from proposed method with those in the literature convergence and validation studies are developed firstly the characteristics of oscillation frequencies and mode shapes are systematically discussed in parametric studies in which the effects of width and depth of the moonpool are especially focused keywords moonpool piston like fluid motion sloshing like fluid motion modified fourier series method 1 introduction moonpool structure are widely applied in the field of offshore petroleum resources drilling for example moonpool is set up in tension leg platform or spar platform in order to install risers and lay pipelines aalbers 1984 because of the special structure form of the moonpool in which an open area exists at the bottom and a free surface exists inside violent fluid motion can be occurred when the moonpool is subjected to external flow and wave excitation hsu and wu 1997 mavrakos 1997 mciver 1986 sannasiraj et al 2001 zheng et al 2004 therefore hydrodynamic characteristics and mechanism of fluid motions in moonpool have attracted more and more attentions of researchers early researches were usually carried out in conjunction with model experiments fukuda 1977 carried out two kinds of experiment observed the piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion in the moonpool and pointed out that the piston like fluid motion could be equivalent to the vibration of rigid body supported by a spring under this assumption an approximate formula for calculating frequency of piston mode was put forward by fukuda and this formula was further revised according to the results of experiment the experimental phenomena of sloshing like fluid motion is studied in detail by madhani 1985 it was proved in experiment that the sloshing like fluid motion occurred when the frequency of external excitation was close to that of sloshing like fluid motion and the phase difference of sloshing like fluid motion and excitation force is equal to π 2 inspired by the study of sloshing in tank faltinsen et al 2000 miles 1972 troesch 1973 theoretical model of fluid oscillation in the moonpool was gradually developed and improved molin 2001 drew lessons from researches on sloshing in a half space established governing equations and boundary conditions of two dimensional and three dimensional moonpool and solved the problem by separation of variables the previous natural frequencies of piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion were calculated by molin in addition several groups of free surface shapes were given the steady state response of two dimensional moonpool under vertical harmonic excitation was investigated by faltinsen et al 2007 the differential equations of the whole system were established under the assumption of domain decomposition the kernel function of nonhomogeneous boundary value problem was regarded as a special green s function and the equations could be solved by the galerkin method with special basis function by comparing the calculated results with experimental results it could be found that the predictions of resonant frequencies and resonant amplitudes were in good agreement with results in model test but the resonant amplitudes were different from the results given by molin et al molin 2001 molin et al 2002 and the cause for these differences was nonlinearity of the oscillation rather than the vortex shedding on the corner maisondieu et al 2001 by using similar method of domain decomposition the problem of resonance and wave diffraction of moonpool were investigated by many researchers chen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 yeung and seah 2007 zhou et al 2013 zhou and zhang 2013 kang et al kang et al 2007 yao and kang 2007 performed a large number of experimental studies on piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion of circular moonpool the excitation source and mechanism of fluid oscillation in moonpool were analyzed emphatically the effects of entrance area at the bottom on amplitudes and frequencies of water in the moonpool were investigated by sphaier et al 2007 the results showed that the oscillation period becomes longer and oscillation amplitudes of fluid in moonpool decreased with the decrease of entrance area at the bottom of moonpool the resonance of two dimensional moonpool were studied by kristiansen and faltinsen 2008 based on a nonlinear numerical wave tank an inviscid vortex tracking method and a method for simplifying the free shear layer were proposed to simulate the flow separation phenomena of boundary layer on the bottom of moonpool accurately guo et al 2017 studied the oscillation characteristics of a recessing type moonpool it was pointed out that multiple modes of water motions could be occurred when the moonpool was under regular waves that is multiple water motions might emerge even if there was only one excitation source in moonpool moreover resonance response in moonpool would intensify under the interference effect of such recessing structure the similar form of moonpool with a recess was also studied by newman and molin due to its wide application in drillships molin 2017 newman 2018 the natural oscillation characteristics of water in a rectangular three dimensional moonpool are studied by liu et al 2017 on the basis of research of molin 2001 a lot of research on wave resonance behavior in moonpool has been accomplished by jiang et al 2018 2019 the works were developed by using numerical wave tank based on the openfoam package the effects of energy dissipation and energy transformation were emphatically discussed by reviewing the up to date study of hydrodynamic characteristics of moonpool mentioned above it can be found that the most important and the most concerned parameter in engineering is the resonance frequencies it is necessary to predict the resonance frequency of moonpool efficiently and accurately the modified fourier series method was firstly proposed by w l 2000 2002 to solve natural frequencies of a beam in the flied of structural dynamics then w l and daniels 2002 extended this method to vibration analysis of plate whose boundary condition was elastically restrained along two opposite edges due to its fast convergence good stability and high accuracy this method initiated the passion of researchers and was subsequently widely used to calculate natural frequencies of structures with various types and materials jingtao et al 2007 established a unified solution to the in plane vibration problems of rectangular plates with elastic boundary conditions based on modified fourier series method the static deflections and dynamic characteristics of orthotropic plates were studied by khov et al 2009 using modified fourier series method different loading features and boundary conditions were considered in their research ismail et al 2013 combined modified fourier series method with the inverse method to analyse material properties of orthotropic plates under arbitrary boundary conditions which indicated that this method has been successfully used in a new field jin et al 2015 adopted a new type of auxiliary function to study vibration and damping characteristics of cylindrical shells based on modified fourier series method the influence of shear parameter and layers thickness on loss factors and frequencies were mainly discussed and some new results of vibration and damping behaviors of constrained layer damping cylindrical shells under elastically restrained were presented then shi et al 2014 extended this method to deal with vibro acoustic coupling problems of structure with an acoustic cavity the modified fourier series method was applied to analyse vibration behaviors of composite plates and shells of revolution and coupled structures in the research of wang et al 2016 2017 their researches showed that modified fourier series method had broad application prospects in the field of structural dynamics analysis in solution procedure of modified fourier series method the key variables such as displacement functions and velocity potential functions are assumed to be the sum of fourier cosine series and several auxiliary functions these auxiliary functions are introduced to eliminate the possible discontinuity on the boundary in derivation operation process as a result modified fourier series method has outstanding capability to deal with various types of boundary conditions the complex boundary conditions of problems in hydrodynamics often bring great difficulties to the solution process so modified fourier series method has a broad application prospect in solution of some hydrodynamic problems by reviewing the up to date study of hydrodynamic characteristics of moonpool mentioned above it can be found that the most important and the most concerned parameter in engineering is the resonance frequencies it is necessary to predict the resonance frequency of moonpool efficiently and accurately in this study oscillation characteristics of fluid in a two dimensional moonpool are studied based on strong solution form of modified fourier series method convergence analysis and validation are carried out firstly by comparing the results from proposed method with those from other researchers the variation of oscillation frequencies and mode shapes of free surface with the length and width of the moonpool are systematically analyzed subsequently which provide reference datas for future researchers 2 theory and formulation the sketch and corresponding coordinates of a two dimensional moonpool are shown in fig 1 b and h denote the width and thickness of the moonpool respectively the hull structures are assumed to be motionless the whole fluid domain can be artificially divided into two subdomains in which subdomain i is a rectangular region with a width of b and a height of h in the moonpool and subdomain ii is the external flow field the subdomain i is considered as solution region governing equation and boundary conditions are established based on linearized potential theory under this assumption the flow is steady inviscid incompressible and irrotational so there must be velocity potential in the moonpool and the velocity potential functions are satisfied with the laplace s equation 1a 2 ϕ 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 0 x b 0 y h 1b φ x y t re ϕ x y e i ω t in which φ x y t is the velocity potential function because of neglecting the effect of viscosity the walls of the moonpool are not satisfied with no slip boundary conditions the tangential velocity on the walls is not equal to zero and the normal velocity is equal to zero therefore the fluid on the walls of the moonpool only satisfy the impermeable boundary conditions which can be written as 2 ϕ x 0 at x 0 b ignoring the surface tension displacement function of the free surface is defined as η x t which is satisfied with 3 y x y t y η x t and the derivative of function y x y t with respect to time is 4 d y d t y t v y in which v is the velocity vector of fluid particle motion because the fluid particles on the free surface always maintain on the free surface during movement the left side of the equation 4 is equal to zero so the kinematic boundary condition of free surface is 5 ϕ y η t ϕ x η x according to the above hypothesis the fluid in the moonpool is inviscid and irrotational the euler equation must be satisfied so the dynamic boundary condition of the free surface is 6 p 0 ρ g η ϕ t 1 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 at y η by taking the derivative of both sides of above equation with respect to time ignoring the nonlinear terms in equation 5 and equation 6 and submitting equation 5 into equation 6 to eliminate the free surface displacement function η the linearized free surface boundary condition can be obtained 7 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ y g ϕ y ω 2 ϕ 0 at y h assuming that the width of hulls are much larger than that of the moonpool the width of hulls are taken to be infinite the velocity potential of subdomain ii are satisfied with the laplace s equation neumann boundary conditions on the surface y 0 and decaying conditions at infinity so the complex velocity potential at any point of subdomain ii can be expressed as 8 φ ι ι u t 1 π 0 b ϕ ι ι ζ 0 t y ln u ζ d ζ in which u x i y because of the flow of fluid at the bottom of the moonpool this complex velocity potential would generate singularity at infinity point in order to simulate the effect of the outer free surface and eliminate the singularity two sinks are assumed to be symmetrically arranged at x h 2 b 2 and x h 2 b 2 then the equation 8 can be written as 9 φ ι ι u t 1 π 0 b ϕ ι ι ζ 0 t y ln u ζ 1 2 ln u h 2 b 2 1 2 ln u h 2 b 2 d ζ neglecting the high order terms of equation 9 the velocity potential of subdomain ii on the interval 0 b can be written as 10 ϕ ι ι x 0 t 1 π 0 b ϕ ι ι ζ 0 t y ln x ζ h 2 d ζ moreover at the junction of the subdomain i and subdomain ii the velocity potential and its normal derivatives of these two subdomains should be equal that is 11a ϕ ι x 0 t ϕ ι ι x 0 t 11b ϕ ι x 0 t y ϕ ι ι x 0 t y according to equation 11 boundary conditions at the bottom of moonpool can be defined as 12 ϕ x 0 1 π 0 b ϕ ζ 0 y ln x ζ h 2 d ζ based on modified fourier series method the oscillation characteristics of fluid in moonpool are solved step by step as follows the velocity potential function is assumed to be the sum of two dimensional fourier cosine series expansions and auxiliary function terms by submitting the velocity potential function into governing equation and boundary conditions of the moonpool the natural frequencies and the associated shapes of the free surface can be solved by a standard eigenvalue problem instead of solving partial differential equations the detailed derivation is given as follows the velocity potential function of the moonpool are defined in the form of 13 ϕ x y m 0 n 0 a m n cos λ m x cos λ n y p 1 x y p 2 x y in which λ m m π b λ n n π h a mn are the corresponding coefficients of fourier series p 1 x y and p 2 x y are the auxiliary functions there are many kinds of auxiliary functions such as orthogonal polynomials trigonometric polynomials and legendre polynomials orthogonal polynomials are the easiest auxiliary functions which are suitable for rectangular solution domain so the p 1 x y and p 2 x y can be defined as 14a p 1 x y x x b 1 2 n 0 a 1 n cos λ n y x 2 b x b 1 n 0 a 2 n cos λ n y 14b p 2 x y y y h 1 2 m 0 b 1 m cos λ m x y 2 h y h 1 m 0 b 2 m cos λ m x in which a i n and b i m i 1 2 represent the auxiliary functions coefficients in the real calculation it is impossible to use infinite fourier series terms two sufficiently large positive integer m and n are selected for truncation of series in following derivation submitting equation 13 and equation 14 into equation 2 the impermeable boundary condition are written as 15 ϕ x m 0 m n 0 n a m n λ m sin λ m x cos λ n y 3 x 2 b 2 4 x b 1 n 0 n a 1 n cos λ n y 3 x 2 b 2 2 x b n 0 n a 2 n cos λ n y y y h 1 2 m 0 m b 1 m λ m sin λ m x y 2 h y h 1 m 0 m b 2 m λ m sin λ m x 0 x 0 b submitting x 0 b into equation 15 the equation can be simplified as 16a n 0 n a 1 n cos λ n y 0 16b n 0 n a 2 n cos λ n y 0 the equation is valid for all values of y so a 1 n 0 a 2 n 0 then p 1 x y 0 submitting equation 13 and equation 14 into equation 7 the linearized free surface boundary condition are written as 17 m 0 m n 0 n g a m n λ n cos λ m x sin λ n y 3 y 2 h 2 4 y h 1 m 0 m g b 1 m cos λ m x 3 y 2 h 2 2 y h m 0 m g b 2 m cos λ m x ω 2 m 0 m n 0 n a m n cos λ m x cos λ

submitting equation 13 and equation 14 into equation 12 boundary conditions at the bottom of moonpool can be written as 19 m 0 m n 0 n a m n cos λ m x 1 π 0 b m 0 m b 1 m cos λ m ζ ln x ζ h 2 d ζ

eigenvalue calculated by equation 25 represents corresponding natural frequency of the moonpool the eigenvectors are the coefficients of fourier series the coefficients of auxiliary functions can be obtained by equation 22 the approximate solution of the velocity potential can be obtained by submitting these coefficients into equation 13 and the mode shapes can be plotted via following equation 27 η ω g ϕ x y 3 numerical results and discussion in this section convergence study and validation are carried out firstly to illustrate the feasibility and accuracy of the present method unless otherwise statement the dimensionless frequency parameters are defined as ω ω 2 b 2 g in following study in the calculated results the first order frequency represents the resonance frequency of piston mode the second order frequency represents the resonance frequency of first order sloshing mode and so on it is impossible to employ infinite terms of fourier series in effective calculation the higher truncated number are used the more precise result can be obtained but higher computing capabilities and longer computation time are needed the following examples are carried out to study the convergence of present method the first five natural frequency parameters ω for the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool are presented in the table 1 the width of the moonpool is taken to be 20 m and the water depth is 5 m and the two sinks are assumed to be arranged at x 90 m and x 90 m respectively good convergence can be observed in table 2 in which the natural frequencies converge rapidly with increasing of series terms m and n the truncated number in chosen to be 6 6 in the following study because the natural frequencies are not changed basically as the series terms are more than 6 accuracy validation of present method and rationality of sink location should be developed after the convergence study in the foregoing derivation the sinks are introduced to simulate the effect of free surface outside the moonpool the location of the sink has a direct effect on the results of natural frequencies fig 2 shows the variation of the first three natural frequencies as the sink position h increases from 0 5b to 10b as the distance between sink and the origin increases the frequency of piston mode decreases rapidly at first and the trend of decrease gradually flattens after the distance is more than 3b while the frequency of sloshing mode remains unchanged therefore the position of sink only affects the frequency of the piston mode and has no effect on the sloshing mode at all as the position of the sink becomes more and more remote the influence of the location of the sink on piston mode is gradually weakened when the depth is relatively shallow the resonance frequency of the piston mode is more sensitive to the location of the sink in the following section if there is on special agreement the position of sink is taken as 8b as shown in tables 2 and 3 the natural frequencies for the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool are calculated and compared to those published by other researchers in the literature three kinds of moonpool with different widths and depths are considered table 2 presents the first four natural frequencies for the fluid in a moonpool with width b 20 m two kinds of depths are considered i e b 1 m and b 10 m it is obvious that the frequencies solved by proposed method is highly consistent with the results from huang huang et al 2014 and molin 2001 the error of most of the results is less than 1 compared with molin s results and the maximum error in all results is less than 2 table 3 presents the comparison of natural frequencies from proposed method with molin and miles the ratio of depth and width h b is taken as 0 0001 it can be seen that the results from proposed method are in good agreement with those in literature and the frequency error of the first order sloshing mode is only 0 043 the above two examples fully demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method accurate results can be obtained by proposed method for the moonpool with different dimensions to further illustrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed method in this paper the results calculated by modified fourier series method are compared with experimental results from veer van t veer and tholen and magee et al 2018 see table 4 it is obvious that the calculated frequency of sloshing like fluid motion is very close to the experimental results and there are some errors in the frequency of piston like fluid motion compared with the experimental results the reasons for this phenomenon can be summarized as two aspects one is the measurement error in model test the other is that calculated frequency of piston mode is influenced by the location of point sinks but in general the proposed method in this paper presents higher accuracy the characteristics of piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion mainly depend on the size of the moonpool in the following examples the influence of the dimension parameters on the natural frequency of the moonpool is studied systematically firstly the effect of the width on natural frequency of the moonpool is analyzed in fig 3 the variation rule of the first four frequency parameters with the width of the moonpool is given three different depths h 5 m h 10 m and h 20 m are considered the width increases from 1 m to 10 m it can be seen from the diagram that the first four natural frequencies are consistent with the width variation all the frequencies decrease gradually with the increase of the width compared with the frequencies of sloshing mode the frequency of piston mode varies gently with the width of the moonpool when the width of the moonpool is small b 5 m the frequencies of sloshing mode decrease rapidly with the increase of the width if the width of moonpool continues to increase the rate of change in the frequency of sloshing mode has also slowed down when the water depth of the moonpool is different the change rate of the natural frequencies versus width of the moonpool is also different the shallower the depth is the greater the change rate of the frequencies versus width will be that is to say the influence of the width on oscillation frequency of the moonpool is more significant when the depth is relatively shallow in addition when the width of the moonpool increases to a certain extent the frequencies of the sloshing mode in the case of different depths are basically the same it indicates that the frequencies of the sloshing mode are not affected by the depth of the moonpool when the width is large enough fig 4 shows the first four natural frequencies of the fluid in the moonpool with different depths the depth varies from 1m to 10 m and the width is taken as h 5 m h 10 m and h 20 m respectively it is obvious that the depth has a great influence on the frequency of piston mode while frequencies of the sloshing mode is less affected by the depth of moonpool with the increase of depth the frequency of piston mode gradually decreases and its change rate is also decreasing although the frequencies of sloshing mode keeps the trend of decrease the its overall change is very small in order to compare the effects of the width and the depth of the moonpool on the natural frequencies the results in figs 3 and 4 are transformed to dimensionless frequencies and the first four frequency parameters are displayed in one figure as can be seen in fig 5 width is the decisive factor for the sloshing mode the reason fot this phenomenon is that the sloshing like fluid motion is mainly influenced by the motion of free surface and the transformation of the width directly changes the shape of the free surface when the width of the moonpool is larger than the depth the influence of the width on the frequencies of sloshing mode gradually weakens the following examples are focused on characteristics of mode shape of the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool the every mode shape can be plotted according to eq 27 the effect of the depth of moonpool on the first four mode shapes are shown in fig 6 the width of the moonpool is taken as b 10 m four different depths h 0 01 m h 0 1 m h 1 m and h 10 m are considered as can be seen from the diagram the shape of piston mode is in the form of a semi arc when the depth is relatively shallow and the peak appears at the center of the moonpool with the increase of the depth the peak of the mode shape gradually decreases and the mode shape degenerates from the arc to the plane paralleled to the primary water surface for the first two sloshing mode the peak value of mode shape increases with the increase of the depth and the peak value appear at the seventh width from the wall of the moonpool rather than on the wall of the moonpool when the depth is comparatively shallow for the third order sloshing mode the mode shapes under different depths are basically similar but the peak value of the case h 1 m is obviously larger than those under other depths therefore the influence of the depth on mode shapes of fluid in the moonpool is more significant than that on the natural frequencies of the moonpool and the effect is more complex the influence of width on the first four mode shapes of fluid in the moonpool is given in fig 7 the depth is taken to be h 1 m and four different widths are considered which are b 0 01 m b 0 1 m b 1 m and b 10 m with the decrease of the width of moonpool the peak value of the piston mode shape increases continuously and the mode shape changes from cambered surface to a plane for each order of sloshing mode the mode shape is similar under different widths but the amplitude of the case h 1 m is much higher than those with other widths that is to say the amplitude of the sloshing mode first increase then decrease with the decrease of width and the amplitude reaches the maximum value when the width is approximately equal to depth 4 conclusions a model for the natural oscillation of fluid in the two dimensional moonpool is developed based on potential theory and solved by the modified fourier series method the velocity potential function is approximately represented as a fourier cosine series with two supplementary functions by submitting the modified fourier series representations to the boundary conditions and governing equations of the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool the natural oscillation frequencies and mode shapes can be obtained convergence analysis and validation of proposed method are developed by comparing the results from present solution with those in the literature in which good convergence speed and high accuracy can be found parametric studies are carried out to discuss oscillation characteristics of the fluid in the moonpool with different geometrical dimensions which contain natural frequencies and mode shapes of piston mode and sloshing mode the natural frequencies gradually decrease as the width or depth increases and the effect of depth on frequencies of piston mode is more significant than that of sloshing mode the mode shapes change remarkably as the depth of the moonpool is different the peak value of the mode shape reaches its maximum as the ratio of width and depth is approximately equal to 1 acknowledgment the authors would

modified fourier series method in the paper the governing equation and boundary conditions of fluid in the two dimensional moonpool are established via potential flow theory the velocity potential function in the moonpool is assumed to be the sum of fourier cosine series and two auxiliary functions the natural frequencies can be calculated conveniently through a normal eigenvalue problem by submitting fourier series as well as auxiliary functions into the governing equations and the boundary conditions with comparing frequencies results from proposed method with those in the literature convergence and validation studies are developed firstly the characteristics of oscillation frequencies and mode shapes are systematically discussed in parametric studies in which the effects of width and depth of the moonpool are especially focused keywords moonpool piston like fluid motion sloshing like fluid motion modified fourier series method 1 introduction moonpool structure are widely applied in the field of offshore petroleum resources drilling for example moonpool is set up in tension leg platform or spar platform in order to install risers and lay pipelines aalbers 1984 because of the special structure form of the moonpool in which an open area exists at the bottom and a free surface exists inside violent fluid motion can be occurred when the moonpool is subjected to external flow and wave excitation hsu and wu 1997 mavrakos 1997 mciver 1986 sannasiraj et al 2001 zheng et al 2004 therefore hydrodynamic characteristics and mechanism of fluid motions in moonpool have attracted more and more attentions of researchers early researches were usually carried out in conjunction with model experiments fukuda 1977 carried out two kinds of experiment observed the piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion in the moonpool and pointed out that the piston like fluid motion could be equivalent to the vibration of rigid body supported by a spring under this assumption an approximate formula for calculating frequency of piston mode was put forward by fukuda and this formula was further revised according to the results of experiment the experimental phenomena of sloshing like fluid motion is studied in detail by madhani 1985 it was proved in experiment that the sloshing like fluid motion occurred when the frequency of external excitation was close to that of sloshing like fluid motion and the phase difference of sloshing like fluid motion and excitation force is equal to π 2 inspired by the study of sloshing in tank faltinsen et al 2000 miles 1972 troesch 1973 theoretical model of fluid oscillation in the moonpool was gradually developed and improved molin 2001 drew lessons from researches on sloshing in a half space established governing equations and boundary conditions of two dimensional and three dimensional moonpool and solved the problem by separation of variables the previous natural frequencies of piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion were calculated by molin in addition several groups of free surface shapes were given the steady state response of two dimensional moonpool under vertical harmonic excitation was investigated by faltinsen et al 2007 the differential equations of the whole system were established under the assumption of domain decomposition the kernel function of nonhomogeneous boundary value problem was regarded as a special green s function and the equations could be solved by the galerkin method with special basis function by comparing the calculated results with experimental results it could be found that the predictions of resonant frequencies and resonant amplitudes were in good agreement with results in model test but the resonant amplitudes were different from the results given by molin et al molin 2001 molin et al 2002 and the cause for these differences was nonlinearity of the oscillation rather than the vortex shedding on the corner maisondieu et al 2001 by using similar method of domain decomposition the problem of resonance and wave diffraction of moonpool were investigated by many researchers chen et al 2015 yang et al 2017 yeung and seah 2007 zhou et al 2013 zhou and zhang 2013 kang et al kang et al 2007 yao and kang 2007 performed a large number of experimental studies on piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion of circular moonpool the excitation source and mechanism of fluid oscillation in moonpool were analyzed emphatically the effects of entrance area at the bottom on amplitudes and frequencies of water in the moonpool were investigated by sphaier et al 2007 the results showed that the oscillation period becomes longer and oscillation amplitudes of fluid in moonpool decreased with the decrease of entrance area at the bottom of moonpool the resonance of two dimensional moonpool were studied by kristiansen and faltinsen 2008 based on a nonlinear numerical wave tank an inviscid vortex tracking method and a method for simplifying the free shear layer were proposed to simulate the flow separation phenomena of boundary layer on the bottom of moonpool accurately guo et al 2017 studied the oscillation characteristics of a recessing type moonpool it was pointed out that multiple modes of water motions could be occurred when the moonpool was under regular waves that is multiple water motions might emerge even if there was only one excitation source in moonpool moreover resonance response in moonpool would intensify under the interference effect of such recessing structure the similar form of moonpool with a recess was also studied by newman and molin due to its wide application in drillships molin 2017 newman 2018 the natural oscillation characteristics of water in a rectangular three dimensional moonpool are studied by liu et al 2017 on the basis of research of molin 2001 a lot of research on wave resonance behavior in moonpool has been accomplished by jiang et al 2018 2019 the works were developed by using numerical wave tank based on the openfoam package the effects of energy dissipation and energy transformation were emphatically discussed by reviewing the up to date study of hydrodynamic characteristics of moonpool mentioned above it can be found that the most important and the most concerned parameter in engineering is the resonance frequencies it is necessary to predict the resonance frequency of moonpool efficiently and accurately the modified fourier series method was firstly proposed by w l 2000 2002 to solve natural frequencies of a beam in the flied of structural dynamics then w l and daniels 2002 extended this method to vibration analysis of plate whose boundary condition was elastically restrained along two opposite edges due to its fast convergence good stability and high accuracy this method initiated the passion of researchers and was subsequently widely used to calculate natural frequencies of structures with various types and materials jingtao et al 2007 established a unified solution to the in plane vibration problems of rectangular plates with elastic boundary conditions based on modified fourier series method the static deflections and dynamic characteristics of orthotropic plates were studied by khov et al 2009 using modified fourier series method different loading features and boundary conditions were considered in their research ismail et al 2013 combined modified fourier series method with the inverse method to analyse material properties of orthotropic plates under arbitrary boundary conditions which indicated that this method has been successfully used in a new field jin et al 2015 adopted a new type of auxiliary function to study vibration and damping characteristics of cylindrical shells based on modified fourier series method the influence of shear parameter and layers thickness on loss factors and frequencies were mainly discussed and some new results of vibration and damping behaviors of constrained layer damping cylindrical shells under elastically restrained were presented then shi et al 2014 extended this method to deal with vibro acoustic coupling problems of structure with an acoustic cavity the modified fourier series method was applied to analyse vibration behaviors of composite plates and shells of revolution and coupled structures in the research of wang et al 2016 2017 their researches showed that modified fourier series method had broad application prospects in the field of structural dynamics analysis in solution procedure of modified fourier series method the key variables such as displacement functions and velocity potential functions are assumed to be the sum of fourier cosine series and several auxiliary functions these auxiliary functions are introduced to eliminate the possible discontinuity on the boundary in derivation operation process as a result modified fourier series method has outstanding capability to deal with various types of boundary conditions the complex boundary conditions of problems in hydrodynamics often bring great difficulties to the solution process so modified fourier series method has a broad application prospect in solution of some hydrodynamic problems by reviewing the up to date study of hydrodynamic characteristics of moonpool mentioned above it can be found that the most important and the most concerned parameter in engineering is the resonance frequencies it is necessary to predict the resonance frequency of moonpool efficiently and accurately in this study oscillation characteristics of fluid in a two dimensional moonpool are studied based on strong solution form of modified fourier series method convergence analysis and validation are carried out firstly by comparing the results from proposed method with those from other researchers the variation of oscillation frequencies and mode shapes of free surface with the length and width of the moonpool are systematically analyzed subsequently which provide reference datas for future researchers 2 theory and formulation the sketch and corresponding coordinates of a two dimensional moonpool are shown in fig 1 b and h denote the width and thickness of the moonpool respectively the hull structures are assumed to be motionless the whole fluid domain can be artificially divided into two subdomains in which subdomain i is a rectangular region with a width of b and a height of h in the moonpool and subdomain ii is the external flow field the subdomain i is considered as solution region governing equation and boundary conditions are established based on linearized potential theory under this assumption the flow is steady inviscid incompressible and irrotational so there must be velocity potential in the moonpool and the velocity potential functions are satisfied with the laplace s equation 1a 2 ϕ 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 0 0 x b 0 y h 1b φ x y t re ϕ x y e i ω t in which φ x y t is the velocity potential function because of neglecting the effect of viscosity the walls of the moonpool are not satisfied with no slip boundary conditions the tangential velocity on the walls is not equal to zero and the normal velocity is equal to zero therefore the fluid on the walls of the moonpool only satisfy the impermeable boundary conditions which can be written as 2 ϕ x 0 at x 0 b ignoring the surface tension displacement function of the free surface is defined as η x t which is satisfied with 3 y x y t y η x t and the derivative of function y x y t with respect to time is 4 d y d t y t v y in which v is the velocity vector of fluid particle motion because the fluid particles on the free surface always maintain on the free surface during movement the left side of the equation 4 is equal to zero so the kinematic boundary condition of free surface is 5 ϕ y η t ϕ x η x according to the above hypothesis the fluid in the moonpool is inviscid and irrotational the euler equation must be satisfied so the dynamic boundary condition of the free surface is 6 p 0 ρ g η ϕ t 1 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 at y η by taking the derivative of both sides of above equation with respect to time ignoring the nonlinear terms in equation 5 and equation 6 and submitting equation 5 into equation 6 to eliminate the free surface displacement function η the linearized free surface boundary condition can be obtained 7 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ y g ϕ y ω 2 ϕ 0 at y h assuming that the width of hulls are much larger than that of the moonpool the width of hulls are taken to be infinite the velocity potential of subdomain ii are satisfied with the laplace s equation neumann boundary conditions on the surface y 0 and decaying conditions at infinity so the complex velocity potential at any point of subdomain ii can be expressed as 8 φ ι ι u t 1 π 0 b ϕ ι ι ζ 0 t y ln u ζ d ζ in which u x i y because of the flow of fluid at the bottom of the moonpool this complex velocity potential would generate singularity at infinity point in order to simulate the effect of the outer free surface and eliminate the singularity two sinks are assumed to be symmetrically arranged at x h 2 b 2 and x h 2 b 2 then the equation 8 can be written as 9 φ ι ι u t 1 π 0 b ϕ ι ι ζ 0 t y ln u ζ 1 2 ln u h 2 b 2 1 2 ln u h 2 b 2 d ζ neglecting the high order terms of equation 9 the velocity potential of subdomain ii on the interval 0 b can be written as 10 ϕ ι ι x 0 t 1 π 0 b ϕ ι ι ζ 0 t y ln x ζ h 2 d ζ moreover at the junction of the subdomain i and subdomain ii the velocity potential and its normal derivatives of these two subdomains should be equal that is 11a ϕ ι x 0 t ϕ ι ι x 0 t 11b ϕ ι x 0 t y ϕ ι ι x 0 t y according to equation 11 boundary conditions at the bottom of moonpool can be defined as 12 ϕ x 0 1 π 0 b ϕ ζ 0 y ln x ζ h 2 d ζ based on modified fourier series method the oscillation characteristics of fluid in moonpool are solved step by step as follows the velocity potential function is assumed to be the sum of two dimensional fourier cosine series expansions and auxiliary function terms by submitting the velocity potential function into governing equation and boundary conditions of the moonpool the natural frequencies and the associated shapes of the free surface can be solved by a standard eigenvalue problem instead of solving partial differential equations the detailed derivation is given as follows the velocity potential function of the moonpool are defined in the form of 13 ϕ x y m 0 n 0 a m n cos λ m x cos λ n y p 1 x y p 2 x y in which λ m m π b λ n n π h a mn are the corresponding coefficients of fourier series p 1 x y and p 2 x y are the auxiliary functions there are many kinds of auxiliary functions such as orthogonal polynomials trigonometric polynomials and legendre polynomials orthogonal polynomials are the easiest auxiliary functions which are suitable for rectangular solution domain so the p 1 x y and p 2 x y can be defined as 14a p 1 x y x x b 1 2 n 0 a 1 n cos λ n y x 2 b x b 1 n 0 a 2 n cos λ n y 14b p 2 x y y y h 1 2 m 0 b 1 m cos λ m x y 2 h y h 1 m 0 b 2 m cos λ m x in which a i n and b i m i 1 2 represent the auxiliary functions coefficients in the real calculation it is impossible to use infinite fourier series terms two sufficiently large positive integer m and n are selected for truncation of series in following derivation submitting equation 13 and equation 14 into equation 2 the impermeable boundary condition are written as 15 ϕ x m 0 m n 0 n a m n λ m sin λ m x cos λ n y 3 x 2 b 2 4 x b 1 n 0 n a 1 n cos λ n y 3 x 2

cos λ n y 0 16b n 0 n a 2 n cos λ n y 0 the equation is valid for all values of y so a 1 n 0 a 2 n 0 then p 1 x y 0 submitting equation 13 and equation 14 into equation 7 the linearized free surface boundary condition are written as 17 m 0 m n 0 n g a m n λ n cos λ m x sin λ n y 3 y 2 h 2 4 y h 1 m 0 m g b 1 m cos λ m x 3 y 2 h 2 2 y h m 0 m g b 2 m cos λ m x ω 2 m 0 m n 0 n a m n cos λ m x cos λ

submitting equation 13 and equation 14 into equation 12 boundary conditions at the bottom of moonpool can be written as 19 m 0 m n 0 n a m n cos λ m x 1 π 0 b m 0 m b 1 m cos λ m ζ ln x ζ h 2 d ζ multiplying equation 18 and equation 19 with vector h cos λ 1 x cos λ m x t on the both side and integrating them from 0 to b with respect to x m 1 linear equations can be obtained respectively expressing those representations in the matrix form 20a s b s ω 2 l h a 20b l l a t b f in which a a 00 a 01 a 0 n a 10 a m n t b f b 10 b 11 b 1 m t and b s b 20 b 21 b 2 m t are the coefficient

eigenvalue calculated by equation 25 represents corresponding natural frequency of the moonpool the eigenvectors are the coefficients of fourier series the coefficients of auxiliary functions can be obtained by equation 22 the approximate solution of the velocity potential can be obtained by submitting these coefficients into equation 13 and the mode shapes can be plotted via following equation 27 η ω g ϕ x y 3 numerical results and discussion in this section convergence study and validation are carried out firstly to illustrate the feasibility and accuracy of the present method unless otherwise statement the dimensionless frequency parameters are defined as ω ω 2 b 2 g in following study in the calculated results the first order frequency represents the resonance frequency of piston mode the second order frequency represents the resonance frequency of first order sloshing mode and so on it is impossible to employ infinite terms of fourier series in effective calculation the higher truncated number are used the more precise result can be obtained but higher computing capabilities and longer computation time are needed the following examples are carried out to study the convergence of present method the first five natural frequency parameters ω for the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool are presented in the table 1 the width of the moonpool is taken to be 20 m and the water depth is 5 m and the two sinks are assumed to be arranged at x 90 m and x 90 m respectively good convergence can be observed in table 2 in which the natural frequencies converge rapidly with increasing of series terms m and n the truncated number in chosen to be 6 6 in the following study because the natural frequencies are not changed basically as the series terms are more than 6 accuracy validation of present method and rationality of sink location should be developed after the convergence study in the foregoing derivation the sinks are introduced to simulate the effect of free surface outside the moonpool the location of the sink has a direct effect on the results of natural frequencies fig 2 shows the variation of the first three natural frequencies as the sink position h increases from 0 5b to 10b as the distance between sink and the origin increases the frequency of piston mode decreases rapidly at first and the trend of decrease gradually flattens after the distance is more than 3b while the frequency of sloshing mode remains unchanged therefore the position of sink only affects the frequency of the piston mode and has no effect on the sloshing mode at all as the position of the sink becomes more and more remote the influence of the location of the sink on piston mode is gradually weakened when the depth is relatively shallow the resonance frequency of the piston mode is more sensitive to the location of the sink in the following section if there is on special agreement the position of sink is taken as 8b as shown in tables 2 and 3 the natural frequencies for the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool are calculated and compared to those published by other researchers in the literature three kinds of moonpool with different widths and depths are considered table 2 presents the first four natural frequencies for the fluid in a moonpool with width b 20 m two kinds of depths are considered i e b 1 m and b 10 m it is obvious that the frequencies solved by proposed method is highly consistent with the results from huang huang et al 2014 and molin 2001 the error of most of the results is less than 1 compared with molin s results and the maximum error in all results is less than 2 table 3 presents the comparison of natural frequencies from proposed method with molin and miles the ratio of depth and width h b is taken as 0 0001 it can be seen that the results from proposed method are in good agreement with those in literature and the frequency error of the first order sloshing mode is only 0 043 the above two examples fully demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method accurate results can be obtained by proposed method for the moonpool with different dimensions to further illustrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed method in this paper the results calculated by modified fourier series method are compared with experimental results from veer van t veer and tholen and magee et al 2018 see table 4 it is obvious that the calculated frequency of sloshing like fluid motion is very close to the experimental results and there are some errors in the frequency of piston like fluid motion compared with the experimental results the reasons for this phenomenon can be summarized as two aspects one is the measurement error in model test the other is that calculated frequency of piston mode is influenced by the location of point sinks but in general the proposed method in this paper presents higher accuracy the characteristics of piston like fluid motion and sloshing like fluid motion mainly depend on the size of the moonpool in the following examples the influence of the dimension parameters on the natural frequency of the moonpool is studied systematically firstly the effect of the width on natural frequency of the moonpool is analyzed in fig 3 the variation rule of the first four frequency parameters with the width of the moonpool is given three different depths h 5 m h 10 m and h 20 m are considered the width increases from 1 m to 10 m it can be seen from the diagram that the first four natural frequencies are consistent with the width variation all the frequencies decrease gradually with the increase of the width compared with the frequencies of sloshing mode the frequency of piston mode varies gently with the width of the moonpool when the width of the moonpool is small b 5 m the frequencies of sloshing mode decrease rapidly with the increase of the width if the width of moonpool continues to increase the rate of change in the frequency of sloshing mode has also slowed down when the water depth of the moonpool is different the change rate of the natural frequencies versus width of the moonpool is also different the shallower the depth is the greater the change rate of the frequencies versus width will be that is to say the influence of the width on oscillation frequency of the moonpool is more significant when the depth is relatively shallow in addition when the width of the moonpool increases to a certain extent the frequencies of the sloshing mode in the case of different depths are basically the same it indicates that the frequencies of the sloshing mode are not affected by the depth of the moonpool when the width is large enough fig 4 shows the first four natural frequencies of the fluid in the moonpool with different depths the depth varies from 1m to 10 m and the width is taken as h 5 m h 10 m and h 20 m respectively it is obvious that the depth has a great influence on the frequency of piston mode while frequencies of the sloshing mode is less affected by the depth of moonpool with the increase of depth the frequency of piston mode gradually decreases and its change rate is also decreasing although the frequencies of sloshing mode keeps the trend of decrease the its overall change is very small in order to compare the effects of the width and the depth of the moonpool on the natural frequencies the results in figs 3 and 4 are transformed to dimensionless frequencies and the first four frequency parameters are displayed in one figure as can be seen in fig 5 width is the decisive factor for the sloshing mode the reason fot this phenomenon is that the sloshing like fluid motion is mainly influenced by the motion of free surface and the transformation of the width directly changes the shape of the free surface when the width of the moonpool is larger than the depth the influence of the width on the frequencies of sloshing mode gradually weakens the following examples are focused on characteristics of mode shape of the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool the every mode shape can be plotted according to eq 27 the effect of the depth of moonpool on the first four mode shapes are shown in fig 6 the width of the moonpool is taken as b 10 m four different depths h 0 01 m h 0 1 m h 1 m and h 10 m are considered as can be seen from the diagram the shape of piston mode is in the form of a semi arc when the depth is relatively shallow and the peak appears at the center of the moonpool with the increase of the depth the peak of the mode shape gradually decreases and the mode shape degenerates from the arc to the plane paralleled to the primary water surface for the first two sloshing mode the peak value of mode shape increases with the increase of the depth and the peak value appear at the seventh width from the wall of the moonpool rather than on the wall of the moonpool when the depth is comparatively shallow for the third order sloshing mode the mode shapes under different depths are basically similar but the peak value of the case h 1 m is obviously larger than those under other depths therefore the influence of the depth on mode shapes of fluid in the moonpool is more significant than that on the natural frequencies of the moonpool and the effect is more complex the influence of width on the first four mode shapes of fluid in the moonpool is given in fig 7 the depth is taken to be h 1 m and four different widths are considered which are b 0 01 m b 0 1 m b 1 m and b 10 m with the decrease of the width of moonpool the peak value of the piston mode shape increases continuously and the mode shape changes from cambered surface to a plane for each order of sloshing mode the mode shape is similar under different widths but the amplitude of the case h 1 m is much higher than those with other widths that is to say the amplitude of the sloshing mode first increase then decrease with the decrease of width and the amplitude reaches the maximum value when the width is approximately equal to depth 4 conclusions a model for the natural oscillation of fluid in the two dimensional moonpool is developed based on potential theory and solved by the modified fourier series method the velocity potential function is approximately represented as a fourier cosine series with two supplementary functions by submitting the modified fourier series representations to the boundary conditions and governing equations of the fluid in the two dimensional moonpool the natural oscillation frequencies and mode shapes can be obtained convergence analysis and validation of proposed method are developed by comparing the results from present solution with those in the literature in which good convergence speed and high accuracy can be found parametric studies are carried out to discuss oscillation characteristics of the fluid in the moonpool with different geometrical dimensions which contain natural frequencies and mode shapes of piston mode and sloshing mode the natural frequencies gradually decrease as the width or depth increases and the effect of depth on frequencies of piston mode is more significant than that of sloshing mode the mode shapes change remarkably as the depth of the moonpool is different the peak value of the mode shape reaches its maximum as the ratio of width and depth is approximately equal to 1 acknowledgment the authors would

22557,the purpose of this study was to investigate the installation water pressure of the offshore wind turbine suction bucket caisson foundation the fluid filled mixture theory was used in the study and the theoretical equations are derived from the basic theory of ocean fluid dynamics and flow in porous media and they were solved by finite difference methods benchmark verification was performed prior to further simulation cases numerical examples were made based on several penetration depths and different suction pressures different boundary conditions were tested and the most reasonable boundary conditions were proposed suction induced stresses in response to various suction pressures and penetration depths were investigated the overall lateral resistance and possible piping potential were studied the frictional stress and bearing capacity on the outside of the caisson are greater than those on the inside even the critical suction pressure is given and the penetration depth increases to 2 5 m the suction induced stress at the outer corner of the caisson tip only increases to 70 of the static effective soil stress and does not reduce the effective vertical soil stress to zero and no piping is occurred keywords offshore wind turbine suction bucket foundation solid fluid mixture 1 introduction after the fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 many countries began to abolish nuclear energy and switch to developing new renewable energy sources to meet energy demand wind energy has become one of the major and mature renewable energy developments taiwan s terrestrial resources are limited and the development of onshore wind power is unfavorable in 2013 the wind turbines installed in the yuanli miaoli were opposed to the project because the wind turbines were too close to the residential area and did not meet the minimum distance requirement 470 700 m in addition taiwan s terrain is very narrow and the space of land based wind turbines is almost saturated compared to land based wind turbines the advantages of offshore wind turbines include farther away from residential areas stronger and more stable winds and greater energy density since the energy research program erp proposed by denmark in 1970 the risone national laboratory danmarks tekniske universitet dtu and the danish power system dps have been trained in wind turbine manufacturing and wind power generation in the 1980s the financial subsidy policy helped 55 kw small wind turbines gradually gain a foothold in the market at the same time the company is looking forward to the development of larger units as a result government policies and market forces have promoted the rapid development of wind power in denmark in order to expand the scale of wind power generation denmark built the world s first offshore wind turbine nogersund in 1991 the wind turbine has a capacity of 0 22 mw the first offshore wind farm was built in vindeby denmark with a total capacity of 4 95 megawatts https windeurope org according to data released by ewea european wind energy association in 2018 there are currently 87 offshore wind farms in europe most of which are located in the north sea of the uk and germany the total power generation has reached 14 gw accounting for 90 of global production capacity as the world s largest offshore wind farm the london array officially began operations in 2013 20 km from the kent coast outside the mouth of the thames covering an area of 100 it can generate up to 630 mw of electricity providing enough power for more than 500 000 homes per year it can reduce carbon dioxide by about 900 000 tons equivalent to the carbon emissions of 300 000 cars the uk plans to achieve 18 gw of wind power by 2020 enough to meet nearly 20 of the uk s electricity demands one of the most important issues of a successful wind energy project is the foundation currently the most common foundation types for offshore wind turbines are the monopile foundation and gravity foundation however due to the softer seabed in taiwan deeper water depths and frequent earthquakes and typhoons the above two types of foundations may not be applicable to taiwan it may be necessary to meet the highest standards of foreign regulations as the lower limit of design to meet safety requirements which will make the manufacturing cost of single pile and gravity foundation too expensive therefore finding an alternative foundation type suitable for taiwan s marine environment is an important issue a single wind turbine is composed of the upper wind turbine generator the middle tower structure and the lowest foundation structures there are many foundation structures used today which can be roughly classified into four types gravity base foundation pile foundation floating foundation and suction foundations the suction caissons is a large steel cylindrical structure open at the base and closed at the top the installation of suction caissons is to penetrate into the seabed caused by its self weight first then a suction relative to seabed water pressure is applied within the caisson by pumped out water through the top of bucket that forces the remainder of the caisson to embed itself the advantages of this type include quick installation and less expensive and easier removal upon decommissioning the disadvantage of suction caisson foundation is the limited proven installation data for different types of soils and detailed installation analyses are required prior to foundation design the typical diameter of suction caissons range from 2 to 4 m for water depths less than 5 m and up to 12 15 m in deeper waters houlsby and byrne 2000 the choice of the offshore wind turbine foundation is not only related to the type of wind turbine unit but also needs to consider some local information including soil conditions environmental loads costs and negative impacts of construction the gravity foundation is not suitable for deep water and the most important issues with the monopile foundation including the huge installation costs and the noise caused by piling may have a negative impact on important marine life such as the chinese white dolphin which is an endangered species in taiwan the suction caisson foundation is a relatively new foundation and has been widely used in recent years it does not require piling and wind turbines can be fixed on the seabed by extracting seawater to create suction and solve the problem of accumulating noise to the environment the suction caisson structure and construction are relatively simple compared to other types of foundations it can be easily removed only by increasing the internal pressure of the structure during decommissioning 1 1 development of suction caissons the first application of suction caissons was in the oil and gas industry of the 1980s and the norwegian national oil company s druper e riser four legged platform formerly known as europipe 16 11 e was located in the north sea olson roy and gilbert robert 2005 the case was successfully installed in 1994 at a depth of 70 m the caisson has a base diameter of 12 m and a skirt length of 6 m the tip resistance measured from the cone penetration test is more than 50 mpa from 2 m down in 1995 suction caissons was also used in the sleipner vest slt platform built in the north sea the above two engineering cases play an important role in the development of the caisson foundation the first offshore wind farm using bucket caisson foundation was the frederikshavn wind farm in denmark which was manufactured in 2002 by the universal foundation and dong energy ørsted the site is a shallow water area the base type is a single bucket and a veatas v90 generator with a power generation capacity of 3 mw it is 6 m high 12 m in diameter 8 5 cm in wall thickness and 135 tons in weight api 2005 proposed six evaluation factors for the field application process of negative pressure caisson the distance from design and installation location the change of the internal suction the final penetration depth the penetration speed the verticality and the orientation of the suction anchor houlsby and byrne 2005a summarize the findings of byrne 2000 and tjelta 1994 and sorted out the design rules for caisson size it classified the caisson into two types the first is the anchorage foundation which is more common in clay and the other is common in sand called shallow foundation houlsby and byrne 2005b assumed that when the suction caisson is immersed in water the suction provides a net downward force on the caisson and this force can be equivalent to a net downward effective vertical load they proposed equations to calculate the self weight penetration and suction penetration in clay and sand and then compared the predicted values with four case records in laboratory model tests of villalobos et al 2009 the very small scale l d ratios of 0 5 and 1 0 experiments were carried out in loose dry sand they define the yield point based on the load deformation curve and the derived moment horizontal load interaction diagram for the yield state they also proposed a model scale test that was loaded instantaneously in sand which was dense and saturated as a result it was found that the capacity of the suction installation was significantly smaller than the capacity of the pushing installation recently some three dimensional numerical analysis has been reported zhang et al 2017 proposed a limit method based on the upper limit theory which was used to analyze the stability of the foundation of the suction platform of the offshore platform centrifugal model test results showed that the method can reasonably predict the ultimate bearing capacity hung and kim 2012 studied three dimensional finite element analysis of normally consolidated homogeneous clay under undrained conditions and they proposed an equation for calculating vertical and horizontal bearing capacity a comparison of the numerical results indicates that the proposed equation appropriately predicts the capacity of a uniform or non uniform clay they also simulated the tripod bucket foundation in undrained clay in 2014 and the design equation for combining horizontal bending moment capability is a function of the underlying aspect ratio skirt length diameter in numerical simulation achmus et al 2013 used the finite element program abaqus and obtained the normalized equation of ultimate bearing capacity and initial stiffness it can be used for the preliminary design of suction caisson in sand achmus et al 2014 also used abaqus to numerically simulate the tensile strength of suction caisson in sand they proposed a numerical model that can explain the bearing capacity of partial drainage under a single tensile load condition suction caisson by considering the importance of seepage parameters during the pumping process harireche et al 2013 assumed that the permeability profile is a function of the depth below the mud line it is concluded that the assumption of constant permeability is not conservative due to the reduced estimate of the effective stress under seepage due to suction zhang et al 2017 used the finite element method to compare the seepage field characteristics of a bucket foundation with and without compartments according to the experimental results of the scale model the simulation results showed that the base without the compartment is more sensitive to the inclination of the barrel than to the inclination of the compartment use the mohr coulomb model following non associated flow rules park et al 2016 2017 performed a series of two dimensional axisymmetric finite element analyses to calculate the vertical bearing capacity of the bucket foundation in sand and sand covered clay the lateral bearing capacity of the bucket foundation in saturated sand was studied experimentally and numerically by liu et al 2017 the results show that the rotation is the main failure mode of the bucket foundation and the center of rotation changes with the change of the height to diameter ratio the above studies were majorly carried out in abquas and its constitutive models for soils are mohr coulomb plasticity however the abaqus built in procedures do not cover multiphase dynamics i e it is not possible to perform dynamic consolidation analysis for saturated or unsaturated soils the deposition material on the sea bottom are basically composed of soil particle pore water and pore air and the theory of mixtures such as theory of porous media might be more suitable to model the sediment mechanics in this study the fluid filled mixture was used to investigate the penetration mechanics of bucket caisson in sand the mixture is a two phase system consisting of a solid phase and a fluid phase each phase is regarded as a continuum following its own motion besides to model the far field boundary the boundary conditions used in the former simulations such as houlsby and byrne 2005a b harireche et al 2013 were too simple that the zero pressure was given at boundary of computational domain and that is not suitable if their computational domain was not large enough the more reasonable boundary conditions such as sommerfeld s radiation boundary condition was used in this study with proper domain size tests in this study section 2 describes the theoretical and numerical models used in the study the results and discussion are given in section 3 and the final concluding remarks drew from this study are stated in section 4 2 theoretical analysis and numerical methods in the analysis of suction bucket caisson penetration into sand in the seabed the sediment saturated sand soil is modeled as a fluid filled mixture which is a two phase system consisting of a solid phase and a fluid phase each phase system is regarded as a continuum and follows its own motion 2 1 governing equations in engineering practice the suction bucket foundation is in a cylindrical shape and cylindrical coordinate system is generally used and the axisymmetric condition can be applied whereas in this study we used a developed 2d cartesian computer code chen and huang 2002 and a simplified 2d square bucket foundation is therefore assumed in this study and the cartesian coordinate system is used fig 1 shows the sketch of the simplified 2d square suction bucket caisson foundation 2 1 1 seawater the seawater is assumed to be incompressible and the viscosity and layering density are not considered the linear momentum equation of seawater can be represented as 1 u u 0 t 1 ρ w p x 2 v v 0 t 1 ρ w p y g the continuous equation can be rewritten as 3 u x v y 0 where u and v represent the velocity components of the seawater in the x and y directions and u 0 and v 0 represent the velocity applied on the caisson ρ w is the density of seawater g is the acceleration of gravity and p is the sea water pressure 2 1 2 sediment the sediment is assumed as a mixture of fluid and solids prevost jean 1985 considered that both solid and fluid phases can be regarded as continuous with independent motion patterns the pore water part should satisfy darcy s law and the stress strain relation of soil particle satisfies the generalized hooke s law the plane strain problem is assumed and the relation between the effective soil stresses and strain can be written as the following equations 4 σ x x t λ 2 μ v x x λ v y y σ x x 0 t λ 2 μ v x x λ v y y d t 5 σ x y t μ v x y v y x σ x y 0 t μ v x y v y x dt 6 σ y y t λ 2 μ v y y λ v x x σ y y 0 t λ 2 μ v y y λ v x x d t where λ and μ are the first and the second lamé modulus of soil based on the continuous theory of elastic solids the velocity components of solids and fluids are respectively expressed as v j and u j the mass conservation equations for fluid filled soil mixture can be written as prevost jean 1985 7 n t 1 n v x x v y y 0 8 n t n u x x u y y 0 combining the above two equation we may get the storage equation as 9 n u x x u y y 1 n v x x v y y 0 the corresponding linearizing the momentum equation can be expressed as chen and hung 1993 10 1 n ρ s v x u 0 t σ x x x σ x y y 1 n p x n 2 κ u x v x 11 1 n ρ s v y v 0 t σ x y x σ y y y 1 n p y n 2 κ u y v y 1 n ρ s g 12 n ρ u x u 0 t n p x n 2 κ u x v x 13 n ρ u y v 0 t

pressure full saturation is assumed and the incompressible water is assumed and the pressure wave equation can be obtained by coupling momentum equations and storage equation and can be written as 14 2 p 2 σ x x x 2 2 2 σ x y x y 2 σ y y y 2 2 1 3 boundary conditions for the seawater calculation of pressure on caisson walls the boundary condition treatment was the same as described by chen and hung 1993 for fluid filled soil mixture the non slip boundary condition is employed for the fluid phase of the sediment thus the fluid velocity components on horizontal interface between soil are zero on the interface between caisson wall and soil the pore water pressure defined as pej is not known a priori whereas the finite difference expression for the pressure gradient in the x direction can be expressed as 15 p e 1 j p e 1 j δ x ρ u 0 t e j where p e 1 j is a ficticious pressure located at 0 5 δx inside the caisson walls while the same velocity and pressure boundary conditions at the interface between seawater and sediment were adopted chen and hung 1993 the sommerfeld radiation condition was used on the far field boundary that is the radiation condition at outside boundary is 16 p t 1 c p x and the speed c in seawater is β w ρ w and c β w n ρ w in sediment the pressure of sea water at free surface is p suction no water penetration into solid face is assumed and the normal gradient of sea water pressure on the caisson surface is zero i e 17 0 p x and the boundary condition of pore water pressure on the solid interface can be expressed as 18 0 σ x x x σ x y y 1 n p x for the boundary condition of pressure of sea water and pore water pressure of soil at the interface we assumed the velocity continuity and based on eqns 2 and 11 we have 19 1 ρ w p y 1 ρ s p y 1 1 n ρ s σ y y y the normal stress σyy and shear stress σxy at the interface of seawater and sediment are σ y y 0 and σ x y 0 cheng 1986 chen and huang 2002 and all the other soil stresses were evaluated by eqns 4 6 2 2 numerical methods this study uses the implicit formula implicit scheme in the finite difference method to calculate the pressure wave equation the crank nicolson scheme and gauss seidel method were used to solve the momentum equations and soil constitutive equations the staggered grid system is used the iteration procedures are brief described here the pressure can be solved from the finite difference approximation of equation 14 and can be expressed as 20 p i j δ x 2 δ y 2 2 δ x 2 δ y 2 p i 1 j p i 1 j δ x 2 p i j 1 p i j 1 δ y 2 c s i j after the pressure field being evaluated the velocity of soil solid and pore water can be calculated by momentum equations 10 13 since 21 u x v x t 1 1 n ρ s n p 1 n ρ s u x t p x σ x x x σ x y y we may using crank nicolson scheme have 22 u x v x n 1 u x v x n δ t 1 n ρ s n p 1 n ρ s u x n 1 u x n δ t p n 1 2 x 0 5 σ x x n 1 σ x x n x 0 5 σ x y n 1 σ x y n y and 23 u x v x n 1 u x v x n 2 k n ρ u x n 1 u x n δ t p n 1 2 x then we can calculate x component of the velocity field of pore water and soil solid by the following two equations respectively 24 u x n 1 1 2 u x v x n 1 u x v x n 1 25 v x n 1 1 2 u x v x n 1 u x v x n 1 the y component velocity fields can be calculated using similar approach and is omitted here the stresses are calculated by 26 σ x x l 1 σ x x l δ t 0 5 λ 2 μ v x l 1 v x l x 0 5 λ v y l 1 v y l y 27 σ x y

procedures can be found in chen and huang 2002 2 3 stability analysis and domain test houlsby and byrne 2005a assumed that if the suction is regarded as equivalent to the downward static pressure a uniform negative value can be given at the free surface to simulate suction we took a simulation of houlsby and byrne 2005a in sandy heaven as an example to do the domain test of our numerical model the dimensions and soil conditions of this case are diameter of bucket caisson is d 4 m the height of the bucket is l 2 5 m the thickness of the caisson wall is t 20 m m is the weight of the caisson is v 100 kn m3 and φ 40 γ 8 5 k n m 3 k tan δ 0 48 k f 2 0 houlsby and byrne 2005a also let suction be equivalent to a net downward effective vertical load they assumed that the distribution of pore pressure on the inside and outside of the caisson is linear with depth and the excess pore pressure at the tip of the caisson is as so the absolute pressure in the caisson is p a γ w h w s and at the tip of the caisson is p a γ w h w h a s then the distribution of pore pressure on the inside and outside of the caisson is a s γ w h and 1 a s γ w h respectively 29 v s π d i 2 4 γ a s h z o 2 exp h z

of a in uniform permeability soil for h d up to 0 8 the relationship between the penetration depth and suction pressure and the range of the critical suction force and the minimum suction can be obtained as 30 p c r 535 5 h 60 2 13 9 ln 1 5 h 0 3 23 3 e 0 5 h 31 p min 4 08 h 2 13 77 h 7 1 0 24 h 1 6 0 48 h 0 94 0 22 ln 1 5 h 0 3 0 37 e 0 5 h referring to bowles joseph 1997 and the sediment type in sandy heaven is sand we can choose the stress strain modulus equal to about 20 mn m3 and the density of seawater ρ w 1000 k g m 3 the first and second lamé modulus is λ 1 44 10 6 k g m sec 2

domain assuming the computational domain is h x x h y and h y h yw h ys and define ay h ys h and a x h x r in a sandy heaven simulation the radius length and thickness of the caisson are r 2 m l 2 5 m and t 20 m m respectively the simulation results of various a x and a y can be used to represent the influence of far field boundary when a x and a y increase which means the distance of the far field end increases fig 3 shows the excess pore water pressure with various a y on the outer caisson wall the pore water pressure are almost the same when a y 20 and 25 and a y 20 was used to define the far field boundary in z direction of the computational domain the domain test in x direction was also made and the influence of the far field boundary in x direction is also shown in fig 3 and a x 15 was used as the far field boundary in x direction fig 4 shows the normalized excess water pressure on the outer caisson wall versus different number of mesh m n with the same domain size h x 1 and h y 1 the excess pressure along the outer side of the caisson wall of the last two mesh size are about the same and the mesh size m n 300 200 is used for the later simulations 3 results and discussions before presenting simulation results obtained in the study a benchmark simulation was made to confirm the accuracy of the numerical model used in the study 3 1 benchmark problem harireche et al 2013 reported an excess pore water pressure contours and used the normalization parameters as p p s s suction pressure z z r and r r r in his study the excess pore water pressure was solved by a laplacian pressure wave equation 2 p 2 p r 2 1 r p r 2 p z 2 0 the sketch of his computational domain is shown in fig 5 and the corresponding boundary conditions used were p 1 on o c p 0 on c f f h b h and p r 0 on c d o b note that the boundaries fh and bh were assumed far enough from the zone of suction disturbance they however did not indicate the exact distance of far field ends from the suction caisson 3 1 1 excess pore pressure fig 6 depicts the contours of the simulated normalized excess pore pressures p p s for various self weight penetrations h 0 2 1 and 2 note that the boundary conditions bcs used in our model were the velocity continuous at interface on seawater and sediment 1 ρ w p y 1 ρ s p y 1 1 n ρ s σ y y y on c f sommerfeld radiation condition p t 1 c p y on bh f h the others boundary conditions used are the same as those of harireche et al 2013 the plots of fig 6 at the left and right columns are respectively the results of using bcs of harireche et al 2013 and the bcs of this study as shown in the figure the pore water pressure distribution inside the caisson tends to aligned as the penetration depth increases and the simulation results of both bcs basically have similar pressure distribution patterns however harireche s pressure distribution become aligned much earlier than our simulation since the zero pressure given at the far field end might numerically constraints the pressure propagation pattern especially when the far end bh was not far enough from the disturbance of the suction the boundary conditions used in our study are more physically reasonable and the accuracy of our numerical model might be more acceptable more detailed effects of boundary condition on porewater pressure propagation will be discussed in the later sections the geometries of harireche et al and this paper are respectively cylindrical and square shapes and the contours of the normalized excess pore pressures of the present study are therefore are not in conformity with the results in harireche et al 2013 but the distributed trends are quite similar 3 1 2 velocity fig 7 shows the evolution of the pore water velocity vector in the sediment inside and outside the caisson the result of each case has the same tendency that the maximum percolation and velocity into the caisson bucket occurs at the tip of the caisson the pore water velocity inside and outside the caisson is upward and downward respectively as shown the direction of the velocity of the pore water inside and outside the caisson represents upward and downward flow due to the pressure gradient generated by the suction at the bucket cap and the maximum flow rate occurring at the tip of the caisson the upward velocity of the pore water in the caisson wall is greater than the downward velocity of the water outside the caisson and the upward and downward velocity will result in a decrease and enhancement of the effective vertical stress σyy inside and outside the caisson the lateral effective pressure normal stress on the caisson wall is proportional to the effective vertical stress due to the asymmetry of the reduction and enhancement the overall friction soil resistance along the caisson wall is also reduced the velocity is greatest near the tip of the caisson and the velocity of the tip of the caisson increases as the penetration depth increases for the same reason the load carrying capacity of the top of the caisson affected by seepage may also be reduced and will be investigated in more detail in later sections 3 2 influence of boundary conditions 3 2 1 far field boundary condition in x direction the study by harireche et al 2013 set the far field boundary condition to zero but their report did not clearly define the infinite domain size and the zero pressure condition given at the boundary of the finite distance from the caisson does not correspond to the real physical condition this study rigorously tests different far field boundary conditions and sommerfeld radiation conditions may be more suitable for simulating far field boundary conditions with finite boundary distance from caisson figs 8 and 9 show the pressure profiles of a caissons with two different penetration depths 0 2 and 1 respectively as shown in fig 8 the contour of this study is roughly the same as the pressure contour of the study by harireche et al however the excess pore water pressure at the tip of the caisson is slightly different from that of harireche et al 2013 the contour plot also shows that the pressure differential at the tip of the caisson becomes slightly larger as the penetration depth increases in our study when the penetration depth h 1 0 the pressure propagation outside the bucket caisson is smoother than that of harireche et al 2013 3 2 2 far field end boundary in y direction in the study by harireche et al 2013 the excess water pressure in the far field boundary condition in the y direction is also set as zero assuming that the disturbance of the caisson is negligible however they did not indicate the distance between caisson and the far field end in this study we used two different boundary conditions one is impermeable and the other is radiation conditions fig 10 compares simulated pore water pressure contours based on harireche et al s bc and impervious conditions and radiation conditions as shown the pore water pressure affected by suction will diffuse deeper in the simulation using impervious conditions and the corresponding pore water pressure at the tip of the caisson is much greater than the pressure obtained using bc from harireche et al the simulated pore water pressure at caisson tip using the radiation boundary condition is about the average of the pore water pressures of the other two bcs it is impractical to use an infinity field end in the numerical calculation domain and the impermeable bottom condition is not a general geophysical condition and the radiation bc may be more reasonable condition fig 11 further compares the simulated pressure profiles of various penetration depths the far field end condition has a greater influence on the pore water pressure at the tip of the caisson and the influence is larger on a larger penetration depth than on the small penetration depth fig 12 shows the pore water pressures of the caisson tips of different penetration depths for the various far field ends bc used as can be seen from the figure the pore water pressure of the caisson tip of bc using harireche et al was underestimated by 6 regardless of the penetration depth while the result obtained using impermeable bc was overestimated by 13 3 2 3 the boundary condition at the interface of seawater and sediment in the study of harireche et al 2013 the interface between seawater and sediment neglects the seapage effects across the interface we considered the influence of seapage assume the fluid velocity of seawater and the velocity of soil on the boundary are the same fig 13 illustrates the excess pore pressure contour fig 13 a a using b c of harireche et al 2013 and that of this study fig 13 b b compare the results shown in fig 13 a b we can clearly find that the results based on the boundary condition used in harireche et al 2013 underestimates the excess pore pressure and the porewater pressure at caisson tip of our simulation is 8 32 larger than that of harireche et al 2013 3 2 4 suction induced stresses seepage caused by suction will change the excess pore water pressure of the sediment and soil stress fig 14 compares the normal stress caused by the suction on the inner and outer walls of the caisson the normal stress on both sides of the caisson wall is approximately the same many other researchers have assumed this phenomenon as shown since the pressure gradient on the caisson wall is zero the normal stress on the caisson wall is almost constant and approaches zero along the caisson wall due to the highest pressure gradient occurring at the tip of the caisson the normal stress of the deposit near the tip of the caisson sharply increases to a maximum at the tip of the caisson the normal stress caused by the suction will affect the transverse normal force acting on the caisson wall and the corresponding friction will change in addition to the normal stress on the caisson wall the shear stress caused by the suction of the sediment on the caisson also affects the friction on the caisson wall fig 15 a depicts the distribution of shear stress caused by suction on both sides of the caisson wall fig 15 b further illustrates the evolution of the velocity vector the seepage on the both sides of the caisson is very different and affects the shear stress the shear stress caused by the suction on the outer caisson wall is much larger than the stress on the inner caisson wall because the percolation along the outer wall of the caisson is slower than the percolation along the inner caisson wall the unbalanced shear stress on both sides of the caisson increases as does the depth further as shown in fig 16 as the penetration depth of the caisson increases the imbalance of the shear stress on both sides also increases 3 3 the overall soil resistance based on the coulomb 1776 limit theory the lateral effective earth pressure is a function of effective vertical pressure and can be expressed as 32 p h k p v where p h is the lateral effective earth pressure p v is the effective vertical pressure and k is the lateral earth pressure coefficient there are three types of soil states namely active passive and rest states only static rest state will be discussed in this study when the caisson is submerged in water the net downward vertical load is the weight of the caisson v 100 k n and the force that caused by suction can be gained by f p p r the static equilibrium equation can be written as f f p v f f f t 0 where f f f f i n f f o u t is the total friction on the inner and outer caisson wall and f t is the vertical bearing force on the caisson tip refer to the study of harireche et al 2013 the friction stress σ f that induced by critical suction pressure along the inner and outer caisson walls can be calculated by the following equations 33 σ f 1 k γ z σ x x 34 σ f tan δ σ f 1 σ x y where σ f 1 is the lateral soil pressure with suction pressure effect included σ f is the frictional stress along caisson wall and σ x x and σ x y are the suction pressure induced stresses 3 3 1 friction stress in self weight penetration depth at first the self weight penetration depth h h r 0 2 was used and the given suction pressures are evaluated from equations 20 and 21 and we have p c r 535 5 0 4 60 2 13 9 ln 1 5 0 4 1 3 23 3 e 0 5 0 4 8347 4 p a p min 4 08 0 4 2 13 77 0 4 7 1 0 24 0 4 1 6 0 48 0 4 0 94 0 22 ln 1 5 0 4 1 3 0 37 e 0 5 0 4 505 9 p a under the minimum suction pressure the suction induced soil stresses σ x x and σ x y along the caisson wall are shown in fig 17 a b and the suction induced normal stress σ y y on the caisson tips is shown in fig 17 c while under the critical suction pressure the suction induced stresses σ x x σ x y and σ y y are shown in fig 17 a b and c respectively as shown in fig 17 a a the suction induced normal stress σ x x is nearly zero and invariant before z h 0 8 and it gradually increases as z h 0 8 the same trend occurs for the critical suction pressure cases when z h 0 6 but the normal stress increase rapidly when z h 0 8 fig 17 b b presents the suction induced shear stress σ x y under minimum suction pressure the suction induced shear stress on the inner wall is nearly zero and it remains small and invariant until z h 0 8 on the outer caisson wall while when the suction pressure increases to the critical pressure the suction induced shear stress on the inner wall also increases but it is still almost invariant before z h 0 8 whereas the suction induced shear stress on the outer wall constantly increases before z h 0 8 and rapidly increases as z h 0 8 it also implies the difference of σ x y between the inner and outer caisson wall becomes larger as the penetration depth increases the suction induced normal stress σ y y across the caisson tips from the inner to the outer parts is linearly and mildly increasing when the minimum suction pressure is applied the σ y y is sharply increasing from inner corner to the outer corner as the critical suction pressure is applied in the later sub sections we will calculate the suction induced soil stresses according to different suction pressures when the soil earth is at rest the lateral soil coefficient is k 0 0 255 fig 18 a shows the lateral soil stress σ f 1 acting on the caisson walls under the minimum suction pressure in the critical suction pressure case fig 18 b b the trend of σ f 1 at the outer wall of the caisson is almost the same as k 0 γ z when z h is less than 0 9 the friction stress σ f at the outer face increases rapidly as z h is larger than 0 8 in addition comparing the trends of σ f and σ x y we can find the suction induced shear stress significantly affect the frictional stress along the caisson walls no matter the minimum or critical suction pressure are applied for the minimum suction pressure the total frictional force is f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 70 9 138 5 210 4 n the total friction at the inner part is also smaller than that at the outer part and for the critical suction pressure the total frictional force is f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 58 6 186 1 244 7 n the frictional force at the inner wall is smaller than that of the minimum suction pressure case because the suction induced shear stress of critical pressure case is larger than that of the minimum case the seepage flow is upward at the inner side of the caisson that results in the reduction of the frictional force at the inner caisson wall whereas the downward seepage flow at the outside region of the caisson results in the increase of the frictional force at the outer caisson wall while the bearing resistance force at caisson tip can be calculated by integrating the σ y y along caisson tip for self weight penetration condition we have σ y y d x 20 09 n and 38 44 n for minimum suction pressure and critical suction pressure case respectively the total resistance force is remarkably affected by the suction induced soil stresses at the caisson tip 3 4 friction stress in full penetration depth in this section the full penetration depth is given as h h r 2 5 2 1 25 and the corresponding minimum and critical suction pressures are respectively calculated as p min 4 08 2 5 2 13 77 2 5 7 1 0 24 2 5 1 6 0 48 2 5 0 94 0 22 ln 1 5 2 5 1 3 0 37 e 0 5 2 5 30458 0 p a p c r 535 5 2 5 60 2 13 9 ln 1 5 2 5 1 3 23 3 e 0 5 2 5 43164 7 p a for the minimum suction pressure case the suction induced stress σ x x and σ x y along the caisson walls z z h are shown in fig 19 a and b and the suction induced normal stress in y direction on the caisson tips from the inner x 0 to the outer caisson wall x 1 are shown in fig 19 c for the critical suction pressure case the suction induced stresses σ x x σ x y and σ y y are shown in fig 19 a b c respectively the trends of the minimum suction and the critical cases are almost the same but the magnitude of the minimum case is smaller than those of the critical case comparing with the self weight penetration depth case the suction induced stress σ x x is also nearly invariant before z 0 8 and increase rapidly when z 0 8 however the magnitude was larger than that of the self weight penetration depth case and the difference of suction induce shear stress σ x y between the inner and outer walls also becomes larger fig 19 c c shows the suction induced normal stress in y direction and we can found that the σ y y along the caisson tips increases almost linearly from the inner corner to the outer corner although the full penetration depth condition still increases linearly the rate of increase is greater than the rate of increase in the case of self weight penetration for the full penetration depth fig 20 shows the friction force versus depth and the σ f 1 increases as z increases if z 0 9 and then decreases rapidly the lateral frictional stress at the inner wall decreases slightly with z 0 8 while the lateral frictional stress σ f at the outer wall increases with z 0 8 and increases rapidly even at z 0 9 a similar behavior was found in the critical suction pressure case however the increase or decrease rates were greater the total frictional force for the minimum can be obtained as f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 2800 5 9421 3 12221 8 n and for the critical suction pressure as f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 2249 5 11495 8 13 n in the full penetration depth the friction force is larger than that of the self weight penetration depth case the bearing resistance forces at the caisson tip becomes 256 4 n and 345 n for minimum suction pressure and critical suction pressure case respectively and the total resistance force is not significantly affected by the suction induced soil stresses at the caisson tip 3 5 the piping potential at the caisson tip seepage would also affect the vertical effective stress σ v and results in a further reduction in the total resisting force especially at the caisson tip and it can be expressed as σ v γ z σ y y fig 21 shows the vertical effective stress σ v for the self weight penetration depth and the critical cases the magnitude of the critical case is smaller than that of the minimum case at the inner corner of the caisson tip however the increment of the suction induced stress under critical case is larger than that of the minimum case the magnitude of the suction induced stress under critical case is larger than that of the minimum case at the outer corner of the caisson tip dispersive nature of soils and seepage were found to be the main reason for piping to occur piping is the soil particles taken away by the seepage water which leads to the formation of a concentrated water flow in the soil and piping will occur when the effective soil stress becomes zero since the installation of the suction caisson is to pump out the water within the caisson and then it might generate a critical seepage flow that may reduce the effective vertical soil stress to zero and cause the piping the effective vertical normal stress can be evaluated by σ v γ z σ y y and the piping will take place when γ z σ y y 0 the values of γ z for the self weight and full penetration depths are 3400 pa and 21250 pa respectively moreover fig 22 shows the ratio of suction induced vertical stress to γ z i e σ y y γ z the maximum value of σ y y γ z is at the outer corner of the caisson tip and the value is 45 21 when the caisson is under critical suction pressure and the piping is most likely occurred at the outer corner of the caisson tips 4 conclusions in the analysis of suction bucket caisson penetration into the sand in the seabed the sediment saturated sand soil is modeled as a fluid filled mixture which is a two phase continuum system consisting of a solid phase and a fluid phase the seawater part is assumed incompressible the viscosity and layering density is not considered the sediment is assumed as a mixture of fluid and solids the pore water part should satisfy darcy s law and the stress strain relation of soil particle satisfies the generalized hooke s law the key conclusions that discussed in the previous sections are briefly described as follows 1 in the previous study that was done by harireche et al 2013 made some simplification of the boundary and we found that boundary conditions have considerable influences of the excess water pressure calculation and the proper physical conditions should be used in the analysis 2 as the penetration depth increases we can clearly observe that the normalize excess water pressure gradient has the distribution patterns that a direction inside the caisson tends to become aligned with the caisson top and the excess water pressure at the caisson tip become smaller 3 the suction induced stress will lead the friction stress within the caisson decrease and the outer parts will increase the present results can confirm the study of houlsby and byrne 2005a b that the seepage would lead the effective stress of soil outside the caisson increased then the effective stress of soil inside the caisson and caisson tip would be decreased 4 the magnitude of the maximums suction induced stress on the caisson tip is near the outer caisson wall in full penetration depth however the maximums suction induced normal stress is on the near inner part in self weight penetration case in addition the maximums suction induced stress in the inner part is negative which means the piping is most like occur in this location 5 piping occurs when the effective soil stress reduced to zero the maximum decrement of the effective soil stress is at the inner corner of the caisson tip and the piping potential is however only 45 in this study 
22557,the purpose of this study was to investigate the installation water pressure of the offshore wind turbine suction bucket caisson foundation the fluid filled mixture theory was used in the study and the theoretical equations are derived from the basic theory of ocean fluid dynamics and flow in porous media and they were solved by finite difference methods benchmark verification was performed prior to further simulation cases numerical examples were made based on several penetration depths and different suction pressures different boundary conditions were tested and the most reasonable boundary conditions were proposed suction induced stresses in response to various suction pressures and penetration depths were investigated the overall lateral resistance and possible piping potential were studied the frictional stress and bearing capacity on the outside of the caisson are greater than those on the inside even the critical suction pressure is given and the penetration depth increases to 2 5 m the suction induced stress at the outer corner of the caisson tip only increases to 70 of the static effective soil stress and does not reduce the effective vertical soil stress to zero and no piping is occurred keywords offshore wind turbine suction bucket foundation solid fluid mixture 1 introduction after the fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 many countries began to abolish nuclear energy and switch to developing new renewable energy sources to meet energy demand wind energy has become one of the major and mature renewable energy developments taiwan s terrestrial resources are limited and the development of onshore wind power is unfavorable in 2013 the wind turbines installed in the yuanli miaoli were opposed to the project because the wind turbines were too close to the residential area and did not meet the minimum distance requirement 470 700 m in addition taiwan s terrain is very narrow and the space of land based wind turbines is almost saturated compared to land based wind turbines the advantages of offshore wind turbines include farther away from residential areas stronger and more stable winds and greater energy density since the energy research program erp proposed by denmark in 1970 the risone national laboratory danmarks tekniske universitet dtu and the danish power system dps have been trained in wind turbine manufacturing and wind power generation in the 1980s the financial subsidy policy helped 55 kw small wind turbines gradually gain a foothold in the market at the same time the company is looking forward to the development of larger units as a result government policies and market forces have promoted the rapid development of wind power in denmark in order to expand the scale of wind power generation denmark built the world s first offshore wind turbine nogersund in 1991 the wind turbine has a capacity of 0 22 mw the first offshore wind farm was built in vindeby denmark with a total capacity of 4 95 megawatts https windeurope org according to data released by ewea european wind energy association in 2018 there are currently 87 offshore wind farms in europe most of which are located in the north sea of the uk and germany the total power generation has reached 14 gw accounting for 90 of global production capacity as the world s largest offshore wind farm the london array officially began operations in 2013 20 km from the kent coast outside the mouth of the thames covering an area of 100 it can generate up to 630 mw of electricity providing enough power for more than 500 000 homes per year it can reduce carbon dioxide by about 900 000 tons equivalent to the carbon emissions of 300 000 cars the uk plans to achieve 18 gw of wind power by 2020 enough to meet nearly 20 of the uk s electricity demands one of the most important issues of a successful wind energy project is the foundation currently the most common foundation types for offshore wind turbines are the monopile foundation and gravity foundation however due to the softer seabed in taiwan deeper water depths and frequent earthquakes and typhoons the above two types of foundations may not be applicable to taiwan it may be necessary to meet the highest standards of foreign regulations as the lower limit of design to meet safety requirements which will make the manufacturing cost of single pile and gravity foundation too expensive therefore finding an alternative foundation type suitable for taiwan s marine environment is an important issue a single wind turbine is composed of the upper wind turbine generator the middle tower structure and the lowest foundation structures there are many foundation structures used today which can be roughly classified into four types gravity base foundation pile foundation floating foundation and suction foundations the suction caissons is a large steel cylindrical structure open at the base and closed at the top the installation of suction caissons is to penetrate into the seabed caused by its self weight first then a suction relative to seabed water pressure is applied within the caisson by pumped out water through the top of bucket that forces the remainder of the caisson to embed itself the advantages of this type include quick installation and less expensive and easier removal upon decommissioning the disadvantage of suction caisson foundation is the limited proven installation data for different types of soils and detailed installation analyses are required prior to foundation design the typical diameter of suction caissons range from 2 to 4 m for water depths less than 5 m and up to 12 15 m in deeper waters houlsby and byrne 2000 the choice of the offshore wind turbine foundation is not only related to the type of wind turbine unit but also needs to consider some local information including soil conditions environmental loads costs and negative impacts of construction the gravity foundation is not suitable for deep water and the most important issues with the monopile foundation including the huge installation costs and the noise caused by piling may have a negative impact on important marine life such as the chinese white dolphin which is an endangered species in taiwan the suction caisson foundation is a relatively new foundation and has been widely used in recent years it does not require piling and wind turbines can be fixed on the seabed by extracting seawater to create suction and solve the problem of accumulating noise to the environment the suction caisson structure and construction are relatively simple compared to other types of foundations it can be easily removed only by increasing the internal pressure of the structure during decommissioning 1 1 development of suction caissons the first application of suction caissons was in the oil and gas industry of the 1980s and the norwegian national oil company s druper e riser four legged platform formerly known as europipe 16 11 e was located in the north sea olson roy and gilbert robert 2005 the case was successfully installed in 1994 at a depth of 70 m the caisson has a base diameter of 12 m and a skirt length of 6 m the tip resistance measured from the cone penetration test is more than 50 mpa from 2 m down in 1995 suction caissons was also used in the sleipner vest slt platform built in the north sea the above two engineering cases play an important role in the development of the caisson foundation the first offshore wind farm using bucket caisson foundation was the frederikshavn wind farm in denmark which was manufactured in 2002 by the universal foundation and dong energy ørsted the site is a shallow water area the base type is a single bucket and a veatas v90 generator with a power generation capacity of 3 mw it is 6 m high 12 m in diameter 8 5 cm in wall thickness and 135 tons in weight api 2005 proposed six evaluation factors for the field application process of negative pressure caisson the distance from design and installation location the change of the internal suction the final penetration depth the penetration speed the verticality and the orientation of the suction anchor houlsby and byrne 2005a summarize the findings of byrne 2000 and tjelta 1994 and sorted out the design rules for caisson size it classified the caisson into two types the first is the anchorage foundation which is more common in clay and the other is common in sand called shallow foundation houlsby and byrne 2005b assumed that when the suction caisson is immersed in water the suction provides a net downward force on the caisson and this force can be equivalent to a net downward effective vertical load they proposed equations to calculate the self weight penetration and suction penetration in clay and sand and then compared the predicted values with four case records in laboratory model tests of villalobos et al 2009 the very small scale l d ratios of 0 5 and 1 0 experiments were carried out in loose dry sand they define the yield point based on the load deformation curve and the derived moment horizontal load interaction diagram for the yield state they also proposed a model scale test that was loaded instantaneously in sand which was dense and saturated as a result it was found that the capacity of the suction installation was significantly smaller than the capacity of the pushing installation recently some three dimensional numerical analysis has been reported zhang et al 2017 proposed a limit method based on the upper limit theory which was used to analyze the stability of the foundation of the suction platform of the offshore platform centrifugal model test results showed that the method can reasonably predict the ultimate bearing capacity hung and kim 2012 studied three dimensional finite element analysis of normally consolidated homogeneous clay under undrained conditions and they proposed an equation for calculating vertical and horizontal bearing capacity a comparison of the numerical results indicates that the proposed equation appropriately predicts the capacity of a uniform or non uniform clay they also simulated the tripod bucket foundation in undrained clay in 2014 and the design equation for combining horizontal bending moment capability is a function of the underlying aspect ratio skirt length diameter in numerical simulation achmus et al 2013 used the finite element program abaqus and obtained the normalized equation of ultimate bearing capacity and initial stiffness it can be used for the preliminary design of suction caisson in sand achmus et al 2014 also used abaqus to numerically simulate the tensile strength of suction caisson in sand they proposed a numerical model that can explain the bearing capacity of partial drainage under a single tensile load condition suction caisson by considering the importance of seepage parameters during the pumping process harireche et al 2013 assumed that the permeability profile is a function of the depth below the mud line it is concluded that the assumption of constant permeability is not conservative due to the reduced estimate of the effective stress under seepage due to suction zhang et al 2017 used the finite element method to compare the seepage field characteristics of a bucket foundation with and without compartments according to the experimental results of the scale model the simulation results showed that the base without the compartment is more sensitive to the inclination of the barrel than to the inclination of the compartment use the mohr coulomb model following non associated flow rules park et al 2016 2017 performed a series of two dimensional axisymmetric finite element analyses to calculate the vertical bearing capacity of the bucket foundation in sand and sand covered clay the lateral bearing capacity of the bucket foundation in saturated sand was studied experimentally and numerically by liu et al 2017 the results show that the rotation is the main failure mode of the bucket foundation and the center of rotation changes with the change of the height to diameter ratio the above studies were majorly carried out in abquas and its constitutive models for soils are mohr coulomb plasticity however the abaqus built in procedures do not cover multiphase dynamics i e it is not possible to perform dynamic consolidation analysis for saturated or unsaturated soils the deposition material on the sea bottom are basically composed of soil particle pore water and pore air and the theory of mixtures such as theory of porous media might be more suitable to model the sediment mechanics in this study the fluid filled mixture was used to investigate the penetration mechanics of bucket caisson in sand the mixture is a two phase system consisting of a solid phase and a fluid phase each phase is regarded as a continuum following its own motion besides to model the far field boundary the boundary conditions used in the former simulations such as houlsby and byrne 2005a b harireche et al 2013 were too simple that the zero pressure was given at boundary of computational domain and that is not suitable if their computational domain was not large enough the more reasonable boundary conditions such as sommerfeld s radiation boundary condition was used in this study with proper domain size tests in this study section 2 describes the theoretical and numerical models used in the study the results and discussion are given in section 3 and the final concluding remarks drew from this study are stated in section 4 2 theoretical analysis and numerical methods in the analysis of suction bucket caisson penetration into sand in the seabed the sediment saturated sand soil is modeled as a fluid filled mixture which is a two phase system consisting of a solid phase and a fluid phase each phase system is regarded as a continuum and follows its own motion 2 1 governing equations in engineering practice the suction bucket foundation is in a cylindrical shape and cylindrical coordinate system is generally used and the axisymmetric condition can be applied whereas in this study we used a developed 2d cartesian computer code chen and huang 2002 and a simplified 2d square bucket foundation is therefore assumed in this study and the cartesian coordinate system is used fig 1 shows the sketch of the simplified 2d square suction bucket caisson foundation 2 1 1 seawater the seawater is assumed to be incompressible and the viscosity and layering density are not considered the linear momentum equation of seawater can be represented as 1 u u 0 t 1 ρ w p x 2 v v 0 t 1 ρ w p y g the continuous equation can be rewritten as 3 u x v y 0 where u and v represent the velocity components of the seawater in the x and y directions and u 0 and v 0 represent the velocity applied on the caisson ρ w is the density of seawater g is the acceleration of gravity and p is the sea water pressure 2 1 2 sediment the sediment is assumed as a mixture of fluid and solids prevost jean 1985 considered that both solid and fluid phases can be regarded as continuous with independent motion patterns the pore water part should satisfy darcy s law and the stress strain relation of soil particle satisfies the generalized hooke s law the plane strain problem is assumed and the relation between the effective soil stresses and strain can be written as the following equations 4 σ x x t λ 2 μ v x x λ v y y σ x x 0 t λ 2 μ v x x λ v y y d t 5 σ x y t μ v x y v y x σ x y 0 t μ v x y v y x dt 6 σ y y t λ 2 μ v y y λ v x x σ y y 0 t λ 2 μ v y y λ v x x d t where λ and μ are the first and the second lamé modulus of soil based on the continuous theory of elastic solids the velocity components of solids and fluids are respectively expressed as v j and u j the mass conservation equations for fluid filled soil mixture can be written as prevost jean 1985 7 n t 1 n v x x v y y 0 8 n t n u x x u y y 0 combining the above two equation we may get the storage equation as 9 n u x x u y y 1 n v x x v y y 0 the corresponding linearizing the momentum equation can be expressed as

pressure full saturation is assumed and the incompressible water is assumed and the pressure wave equation can be obtained by coupling momentum equations and storage equation and can be written as 14 2 p 2 σ x x x 2 2 2 σ x y x y 2 σ y y y 2 2 1 3 boundary conditions for the seawater calculation of pressure on caisson walls the boundary condition treatment was the same as described by chen and hung 1993 for fluid filled soil mixture the non slip boundary condition is employed for the fluid phase of the sediment thus the fluid velocity components on horizontal interface between soil are zero on the interface between caisson wall and soil the pore water pressure defined as pej is not known a priori whereas the finite difference expression for the pressure gradient in the x direction can be expressed as 15 p e 1 j p e 1 j δ x ρ u 0 t e j where p e 1 j is a ficticious pressure located at 0 5 δx inside the caisson walls while the same velocity and pressure boundary conditions at the interface between seawater and sediment were adopted chen and hung 1993 the sommerfeld radiation condition was used on the far field boundary that is the radiation condition at outside boundary is 16 p t 1 c p x and the speed c in seawater is β w ρ w and c β w n ρ w in sediment the pressure of sea water at free surface is p suction no water penetration into solid face is assumed and the normal gradient of sea water pressure on the caisson surface is zero i e 17 0 p x and the boundary condition of pore water pressure on the solid interface can be expressed as 18 0 σ x x x σ x y y 1 n p x for the boundary condition of pressure of sea water and pore water pressure of soil at the interface we assumed the velocity continuity and based on eqns 2 and 11 we have 19 1 ρ w p y 1 ρ s p y 1 1 n ρ s σ y y y the normal stress σyy and shear stress σxy at the interface of seawater and sediment are σ y y 0 and σ x y 0 cheng 1986 chen and huang 2002 and all the other soil stresses were evaluated by eqns 4 6 2 2 numerical methods this study uses the implicit formula implicit scheme in the finite difference method to calculate the pressure wave equation the crank nicolson scheme and gauss seidel method were used to solve the momentum equations and soil constitutive equations the staggered grid system is used the iteration procedures are brief described here the pressure can be solved from the finite difference approximation of equation 14 and can be expressed as 20 p i j δ x 2 δ y 2 2 δ x 2 δ y 2 p i 1 j p i 1 j δ x 2 p i j 1 p i j 1 δ y 2 c s i j after the pressure field being evaluated the velocity of soil solid and pore water can be calculated by momentum equations 10 13 since 21 u x v x t 1 1 n ρ s n p 1 n ρ s u x t p x σ x x x σ x y y we may using crank nicolson scheme have 22 u x v x n 1 u x v x n δ t 1 n ρ s n p 1 n ρ s u x n 1 u x n δ t p n 1 2 x 0 5 σ x x n 1 σ x x n x 0 5 σ x y n 1 σ x y n y and 23 u x v x n 1 u x v x n 2 k n ρ u x n 1 u x n δ t p n 1 2 x then we can calculate x component of the velocity field of pore water and soil solid by the following two equations respectively 24 u x n 1 1 2 u x v x n 1 u x v x n 1 25 v x n 1 1 2 u x v x n 1 u x v x n 1 the y component velocity fields can be calculated using similar approach and is omitted here the stresses are calculated by 26 σ x x l 1 σ x x l δ t 0 5 λ 2 μ v x l 1 v x l x 0 5 λ v y l 1 v y l y 27 σ x y

procedures can be found in chen and huang 2002 2 3 stability analysis and domain test houlsby and byrne 2005a assumed that if the suction is regarded as equivalent to the downward static pressure a uniform negative value can be given at the free surface to simulate suction we took a simulation of houlsby and byrne 2005a in sandy heaven as an example to do the domain test of our numerical model the dimensions and soil conditions of this case are diameter of bucket caisson is d 4 m the height of the bucket is l 2 5 m the thickness of the caisson wall is t 20 m m is the weight of the caisson is v 100 kn m3 and φ 40 γ 8 5 k n m 3 k tan δ 0 48 k f 2 0 houlsby and byrne 2005a also let suction be equivalent to a net downward effective vertical load they assumed that the distribution of pore pressure on the inside and outside of the caisson is linear with depth and the excess pore pressure at the tip of the caisson is as so the absolute pressure in the caisson is p a γ w h w s and at the tip of the caisson is p a γ w h w h a s then the distribution of pore pressure on the inside and outside of the caisson is a s γ w h and 1 a s γ w h respectively 29 v s π d i 2 4 γ a s h z o 2 exp h z

base should be 0 5 for very shallow penetration in the soil of uniform permeability and would be a function of h d refer to houlsby and byrne 2005a did a finite element analysis to calculate the value of a in uniform permeability soil for h d up to 0 8 the relationship between the penetration depth and suction pressure and the range of the critical suction force and the minimum suction can be obtained as 30 p c r 535 5 h 60 2 13 9 ln 1 5 h 0 3 23 3 e 0 5 h 31 p min 4 08 h 2 13 77 h 7 1 0 24 h 1 6 0 48 h 0 94 0 22 ln 1 5 h 0 3 0 37 e 0 5 h referring to bowles joseph 1997 and the sediment type in sandy heaven is sand we can choose the stress strain modulus equal to about 20 mn m3 and the density of seawater ρ w 1000 k g m 3 the first and second lamé modulus is λ 1 44 10 6 k g m sec 2 and μ 7 2 10 5 k g m sec 2 respectively permeability κ 1 94 10 8 m 3 sec k g and the density of solids particles in sediment ρ s 1498 k g m 3 2 3 1 mesh and domain size fig 2 shows the computational domain assuming the computational domain is h x x h y and h y h yw h ys and define ay h ys h and a x h x r in a sandy heaven simulation the radius length and thickness of the caisson are r 2 m l 2 5 m and t 20 m m respectively the simulation results of various a x and a y can be used to represent the influence of far field boundary when a x and a y increase which means the distance of the far field end increases fig 3 shows the excess pore water pressure with various a y on the outer caisson wall the pore water pressure are almost the same when a y 20 and 25 and a y 20 was used to define the far field boundary in z direction of the computational domain the domain test in x direction was also made and the influence of the far field boundary in x direction is also shown in fig 3 and a x 15 was used as the far field boundary in x direction fig 4 shows the normalized excess water pressure on the outer caisson wall versus different number of mesh m n with the same domain size h x 1 and h y 1 the excess pressure along the outer side of the caisson wall of the last two mesh size are about the same and the mesh size m n 300 200 is used for the later simulations 3 results and discussions before presenting simulation results obtained in the study a benchmark simulation was made to confirm the accuracy of the numerical model used in the study 3 1 benchmark problem harireche et al 2013 reported an excess pore water pressure contours and used the normalization parameters as p p s s suction pressure z z r and r r r in his study the excess pore water pressure was solved by a laplacian pressure wave equation 2 p 2 p r 2 1 r p r 2 p z 2 0 the sketch of his computational domain is shown in fig 5 and the corresponding boundary conditions used were p 1 on o c p 0 on c f f h b h and p r 0 on c d o b note that the boundaries fh and bh were assumed far enough from the zone of suction disturbance they however did not indicate the exact distance of far field ends from the suction caisson 3 1 1 excess pore pressure fig 6 depicts the contours of the simulated normalized excess pore pressures p p s for various self weight penetrations h 0 2 1 and 2 note that the boundary conditions bcs used in our model were the velocity continuous at interface on seawater and sediment 1 ρ w p y 1 ρ s p y 1 1 n ρ s σ y y y on c f sommerfeld radiation condition p t 1 c p y on bh f h the others boundary conditions used are the same as those of harireche et al 2013 the plots of fig 6 at the left and right columns are respectively the results of using bcs of harireche et al 2013 and the bcs of this study as shown in the figure the pore water pressure distribution inside the caisson tends to aligned as the penetration depth increases and the simulation results of both bcs basically have similar pressure distribution patterns however harireche s pressure distribution become aligned much earlier than our simulation since the zero pressure given at the far field end might numerically constraints the pressure propagation pattern especially when the far end bh was not far enough from the disturbance of the suction the boundary conditions used in our study are more physically reasonable and the accuracy of our numerical model might be more acceptable more detailed effects of boundary condition on porewater pressure propagation will be discussed in the later sections the geometries of harireche et al and this paper are respectively cylindrical and square shapes and the contours of the normalized excess pore pressures of the present study are therefore are not in conformity with the results in harireche et al 2013 but the distributed trends are quite similar 3 1 2 velocity fig 7 shows the evolution of the pore water velocity vector in the sediment inside and outside the caisson the result of each case has the same tendency that the maximum percolation and velocity into the caisson bucket occurs at the tip of the caisson the pore water velocity inside and outside the caisson is upward and downward respectively as shown the direction of the velocity of the pore water inside and outside the caisson represents upward and downward flow due to the pressure gradient generated by the suction at the bucket cap and the maximum flow rate occurring at the tip of the caisson the upward velocity of the pore water in the caisson wall is greater than the downward velocity of the water outside the caisson and the upward and downward velocity will result in a decrease and enhancement of the effective vertical stress σyy inside and outside the caisson the lateral effective pressure normal stress on the caisson wall is proportional to the effective vertical stress due to the asymmetry of the reduction and enhancement the overall friction soil resistance along the caisson wall is also reduced the velocity is greatest near the tip of the caisson and the velocity of the tip of the caisson increases as the penetration depth increases for the same reason the load carrying capacity of the top of the caisson affected by seepage may also be reduced and will be investigated in more detail in later sections 3 2 influence of boundary conditions 3 2 1 far field boundary condition in x direction the study by harireche et al 2013 set the far field boundary condition to zero but their report did not clearly define the infinite domain size and the zero pressure condition given at the boundary of the finite distance from the caisson does not correspond to the real physical condition this study rigorously tests different far field boundary conditions and sommerfeld radiation conditions may be more suitable for simulating far field boundary conditions with finite boundary distance from caisson figs 8 and 9 show the pressure profiles of a caissons with two different penetration depths 0 2 and 1 respectively as shown in fig 8 the contour of this study is roughly the same as the pressure contour of the study by harireche et al however the excess pore water pressure at the tip of the caisson is slightly different from that of harireche et al 2013 the contour plot also shows that the pressure differential at the tip of the caisson becomes slightly larger as the penetration depth increases in our study when the penetration depth h 1 0 the pressure propagation outside the bucket caisson is smoother than that of harireche et al 2013 3 2 2 far field end boundary in y direction in the study by harireche et al 2013 the excess water pressure in the far field boundary condition in the y direction is also set as zero assuming that the disturbance of the caisson is negligible however they did not indicate the distance between caisson and the far field end in this study we used two different boundary conditions one is impermeable and the other is radiation conditions fig 10 compares simulated pore water pressure contours based on harireche et al s bc and impervious conditions and radiation conditions as shown the pore water pressure affected by suction will diffuse deeper in the simulation using impervious conditions and the corresponding pore water pressure at the tip of the caisson is much greater than the pressure obtained using bc from harireche et al the simulated pore water pressure at caisson tip using the radiation boundary condition is about the average of the pore water pressures of the other two bcs it is impractical to use an infinity field end in the numerical calculation domain and the impermeable bottom condition is not a general geophysical condition and the radiation bc may be more reasonable condition fig 11 further compares the simulated pressure profiles of various penetration depths the far field end condition has a greater influence on the pore water pressure at the tip of the caisson and the influence is larger on a larger penetration depth than on the small penetration depth fig 12 shows the pore water pressures of the caisson tips of different penetration depths for the various far field ends bc used as can be seen from the figure the pore water pressure of the caisson tip of bc using harireche et al was underestimated by 6 regardless of the penetration depth while the result obtained using impermeable bc was overestimated by 13 3 2 3 the boundary condition at the interface of seawater and sediment in the study of harireche et al 2013 the interface between seawater and sediment neglects the seapage effects across the interface we considered the influence of seapage assume the fluid velocity of seawater and the velocity of soil on the boundary are the same fig 13 illustrates the excess pore pressure contour fig 13 a a using b c of harireche et al 2013 and that of this study fig 13 b b compare the results shown in fig 13 a b we can clearly find that the results based on the boundary condition used in harireche et al 2013 underestimates the excess pore pressure and the porewater pressure at caisson tip of our simulation is 8 32 larger than that of harireche et al 2013 3 2 4 suction induced stresses seepage caused by suction will change the excess pore water pressure of the sediment and soil stress fig 14 compares the normal stress caused by the suction on the inner and outer walls of the caisson the normal stress on both sides of the caisson wall is approximately the same many other researchers have assumed this phenomenon as shown since the pressure gradient on the caisson wall is zero the normal stress on the caisson wall is almost constant and approaches zero along the caisson wall due to the highest pressure gradient occurring at the tip of the caisson the normal stress of the deposit near the tip of the caisson sharply increases to a maximum at the tip of the caisson the normal stress caused by the suction will affect the transverse normal force acting on the caisson wall and the corresponding friction will change in addition to the normal stress on the caisson wall the shear stress caused by the suction of the sediment on the caisson also affects the friction on the caisson wall fig 15 a depicts the distribution of shear stress caused by suction on both sides of the caisson wall fig 15 b further illustrates the evolution of the velocity vector the seepage on the both sides of the caisson is very different and affects the shear stress the shear stress caused by the suction on the outer caisson wall is much larger than the stress on the inner caisson wall because the percolation along the outer wall of the caisson is slower than the percolation along the inner caisson wall the unbalanced shear stress on both sides of the caisson increases as does the depth further as shown in fig 16 as the penetration depth of the caisson increases the imbalance of the shear stress on both sides also increases 3 3 the overall soil resistance based on the coulomb 1776 limit theory the lateral effective earth pressure is a function of effective vertical pressure and can be expressed as 32 p h k p v where p h is the lateral effective earth pressure p v is the effective vertical pressure and k is the lateral earth pressure coefficient there are three types of soil states namely active passive and rest states only static rest state will be discussed in this study when the caisson is submerged in water the net downward vertical load is the weight of the caisson v 100 k n and the force that caused by suction can be gained by f p p r the static equilibrium equation can be written as f f p v f f f t 0 where f f f f i n f f o u t is the total friction on the inner and outer caisson wall and f t is the vertical bearing force on the caisson tip refer to the study of harireche et al 2013 the friction stress σ f that induced by critical suction pressure along the inner and outer caisson walls can be calculated by the following equations 33 σ f 1 k γ z σ x x 34 σ f tan δ σ f 1 σ x y where σ f 1 is the lateral soil pressure with suction pressure effect included σ f is the frictional stress along caisson wall and σ x x and σ x y are the suction pressure induced stresses 3 3 1 friction stress in self weight penetration depth at first the self weight penetration depth h h r 0 2 was used and the given suction pressures are evaluated from equations 20 and 21 and we have p c r 535 5 0 4 60 2 13 9 ln 1 5 0 4 1 3 23 3 e 0 5 0 4 8347 4 p a p min 4 08 0 4 2 13 77 0 4 7 1 0 24 0 4 1 6 0 48 0 4 0 94 0 22 ln 1 5 0 4 1 3 0 37 e 0 5 0 4 505 9 p a under the minimum suction pressure the suction induced soil stresses σ x x and σ x y along the caisson wall are shown in fig 17 a b and the suction induced normal stress σ y y on the caisson tips is shown in fig 17 c while under the critical suction pressure the suction induced stresses σ x x σ x y and σ y y are shown in fig 17 a b and c respectively as shown in fig 17 a a the suction induced normal stress σ x x is nearly zero and invariant before z h 0 8 and it gradually increases as z h 0 8 the same trend occurs for the critical suction pressure cases when z h 0 6 but the normal stress increase rapidly when z h 0 8 fig 17 b b presents the suction induced shear stress σ x y under minimum suction pressure the suction induced shear stress on the inner wall is nearly zero and it remains small and invariant until z h 0 8 on the outer caisson wall while when the suction pressure increases to the critical pressure the suction induced shear stress on the inner wall also increases but it is still almost invariant before z h 0 8 whereas the suction induced shear stress on the outer wall constantly increases before z h 0 8 and rapidly increases as z h 0 8 it also implies the difference of σ x y between the inner and outer caisson wall becomes larger as the penetration depth increases the suction induced normal stress σ y y across the caisson tips from the inner to the outer parts is linearly and mildly increasing when the minimum suction pressure is applied the σ y y is sharply increasing from inner corner to the outer corner as the critical suction pressure is applied in the later sub sections we will calculate the suction induced soil stresses according to different suction pressures when the soil earth is at rest the lateral soil coefficient is k 0 0 255 fig 18 a shows the lateral soil stress σ f 1 acting on the caisson walls under the minimum suction pressure in the critical suction pressure case fig 18 b b the trend of σ f 1 at the outer wall of the caisson is almost the same as k 0 γ z when z h is less than 0 9 the friction stress σ f at the outer face increases rapidly as z h is larger than 0 8 in addition comparing the trends of σ f and σ x y we can find the suction induced shear stress significantly affect the frictional stress along the caisson walls no matter the minimum or critical suction pressure are applied for the minimum suction pressure the total frictional force is f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 70 9 138 5 210 4 n the total friction at the inner part is also smaller than that at the outer part and for the critical suction pressure the total frictional force is f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 58 6 186 1 244 7 n the frictional force at the inner wall is smaller than that of the minimum suction pressure case because the suction induced shear stress of critical pressure case is larger than that of the minimum case the seepage flow is upward at the inner side of the caisson that results in the reduction of the frictional force at the inner caisson wall whereas the downward seepage flow at the outside region of the caisson results in the increase of the frictional force at the outer caisson wall while the bearing resistance force at caisson tip can be calculated by integrating the σ y y along caisson tip for self weight penetration condition we have σ y y d x 20 09 n and 38 44 n for minimum suction pressure and critical suction pressure case respectively the total resistance force is remarkably affected by the suction induced soil stresses at the caisson tip 3 4 friction stress in full penetration depth in this section the full penetration depth is given as h h r 2 5 2 1 25 and the corresponding minimum and critical suction pressures are respectively calculated as p min 4 08 2 5 2 13 77 2 5 7 1 0 24 2 5 1 6 0 48 2 5 0 94 0 22 ln 1 5 2 5 1 3 0 37 e 0 5 2 5 30458 0 p a p c r 535 5 2 5 60 2 13 9 ln 1 5 2 5 1 3 23 3 e 0 5 2 5 43164 7 p a for the minimum suction pressure case the suction induced stress σ x x and σ x y along the caisson walls z z h are shown in fig 19 a and b and the suction induced normal stress in y direction on the caisson tips from the inner x 0 to the outer caisson wall x 1 are shown in fig 19 c for the critical suction pressure case the suction induced stresses σ x x σ x y and σ y y are shown in fig 19 a b c respectively the trends of the minimum suction and the critical cases are almost the same but the magnitude of the minimum case is smaller than those of the critical case comparing with the self weight penetration depth case the suction induced stress σ x x is also nearly invariant before z 0 8 and increase rapidly when z 0 8 however the magnitude was larger than that of the self weight penetration depth case and the difference of suction induce shear stress σ x y between the inner and outer walls also becomes larger fig 19 c c shows the suction induced normal stress in y direction and we can found that the σ y y along the caisson tips increases almost linearly from the inner corner to the outer corner although the full penetration depth condition still increases linearly the rate of increase is greater than the rate of increase in the case of self weight penetration for the full penetration depth fig 20 shows the friction force versus depth and the σ f 1 increases as z increases if z 0 9 and then decreases rapidly the lateral frictional stress at the inner wall decreases slightly with z 0 8 while the lateral frictional stress σ f at the outer wall increases with z 0 8 and increases rapidly even at z 0 9 a similar behavior was found in the critical suction pressure case however the increase or decrease rates were greater the total frictional force for the minimum can be obtained as f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 2800 5 9421 3 12221 8 n and for the critical suction pressure as f f t o t a l f f i n f f o u t 2249 5 11495 8 13 n in the full penetration depth the friction force is larger than that of the self weight penetration depth case the bearing resistance forces at the caisson tip becomes 256 4 n and 345 n for minimum suction pressure and critical suction pressure case respectively and the total resistance force is not significantly affected by the suction induced soil stresses at the caisson tip 3 5 the piping potential at the caisson tip seepage would also affect the vertical effective stress σ v and results in a further reduction in the total resisting force especially at the caisson tip and it can be expressed as σ v γ z σ y y fig 21 shows the vertical effective stress σ v for the self weight penetration depth and the critical cases the magnitude of the critical case is smaller than that of the minimum case at the inner corner of the caisson tip however the increment of the suction induced stress under critical case is larger than that of the minimum case the magnitude of the suction induced stress under critical case is larger than that of the minimum case at the outer corner of the caisson tip dispersive nature of soils and seepage were found to be the main reason for piping to occur piping is the soil particles taken away by the seepage water which leads to the formation of a concentrated water flow in the soil and piping will occur when the effective soil stress becomes zero since the installation of the suction caisson is to pump out the water within the caisson and then it might generate a critical seepage flow that may reduce the effective vertical soil stress to zero and cause the piping the effective vertical normal stress can be evaluated by σ v γ z σ y y and the piping will take place when γ z σ y y 0 the values of γ z for the self weight and full penetration depths are 3400 pa and 21250 pa respectively moreover fig 22 shows the ratio of suction induced vertical stress to γ z i e σ y y γ z the maximum value of σ y y γ z is at the outer corner of the caisson tip and the value is 45 21 when the caisson is under critical suction pressure and the piping is most likely occurred at the outer corner of the caisson tips 4 conclusions in the analysis of suction bucket caisson penetration into the sand in the seabed the sediment saturated sand soil is modeled as a fluid filled mixture which is a two phase continuum system consisting of a solid phase and a fluid phase the seawater part is assumed incompressible the viscosity and layering density is not considered the sediment is assumed as a mixture of fluid and solids the pore water part should satisfy darcy s law and the stress strain relation of soil particle satisfies the generalized hooke s law the key conclusions that discussed in the previous sections are briefly described as follows 1 in the previous study that was done by harireche et al 2013 made some simplification of the boundary and we found that boundary conditions have considerable influences of the excess water pressure calculation and the proper physical conditions should be used in the analysis 2 as the penetration depth increases we can clearly observe that the normalize excess water pressure gradient has the distribution patterns that a direction inside the caisson tends to become aligned with the caisson top and the excess water pressure at the caisson tip become smaller 3 the suction induced stress will lead the friction stress within the caisson decrease and the outer parts will increase the present results can confirm the study of houlsby and byrne 2005a b that the seepage would lead the effective stress of soil outside the caisson increased then the effective stress of soil inside the caisson and caisson tip would be decreased 4 the magnitude of the maximums suction induced stress on the caisson tip is near the outer caisson wall in full penetration depth however the maximums suction induced normal stress is on the near inner part in self weight penetration case in addition the maximums suction induced stress in the inner part is negative which means the piping is most like occur in this location 5 piping occurs when the effective soil stress reduced to zero the maximum decrement of the effective soil stress is at the inner corner of the caisson tip and the piping potential is however only 45 in this study 
22558,the quantitative prediction of parametric roll of a kcs containership are conducted using a 5 dof nonlinear time domain model based on the potential flow in the model linear radiation and diffraction forces are calculated by the stf method and transferred into time domain using irf approach while nonlinear restoring and f k forces are calculated through pressure integration over instantaneous wetted surfaces roll damping is estimated using the ikeda s method the sensitive analysis on roll damping is conducted five different models for nonlinear restoring and f k forces are discussed it is confirmed that the five models overestimate the parametric roll amplitude model a considering only the nonlinearity of restoring forces caused by instantaneous ship position under still water is suitable for parametric roll prediction among five models moreover accurate estimation of pitch motions is vital for parametric roll prediction through the sensitive analysis it is found that roll damping affects parametric roll amplitudes but has no effect on the speed region where parametric roll occurs the sensitivity of nonlinear quadric damping against parametric roll is small while the sensitivity of linear damping is large the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll for cases close to the speed threshold is significant keywords parametric roll roll damping nonlinear roll restoring moment 1 introduction the ship parametric roll is a self resonant roll motion caused by large variations of water plane area and roll restoring characteristics in heavy longitudinal seas severe parametric roll was reported on containerships france et al 2003 small fishing vessels neves et al 1999 cruise ship and pctc ovegård et al 2012 the study on the parametric roll were conducted through numerical simulations bulian 2005 hashimoto and umeda 2010 neves et al 1999 spanos and papanikolaou 2007 and model experiments hashimoto et al 2007 lu et al 2016 neves et al 2002 taguchi et al 2011 yu et al 2018 the international maritime organization sub committee on ship design and construction imo sdc is finalizing the multilevel second generation intact stability criteria on parametric roll imo sdc4 wp 4 2017 as a nonlinear phenomenon the quantitative prediction of parametric roll is affected by many factors many researches focused on evaluating the importance of these factors neves et al 1999 bulian 2005 and hashimoto and umeda 2010 investigated the influence of pitch and heave motions and confirmed their importance on parametric roll vidic perunovic and jensen 2009 and ma et al 2012 investigated the influence of surge motions on parametric roll and found that its influence is not significant lu et al 2011 and zhou 2016 investigated the influence of added mass and roll moment of inertia on parametric roll respectively among all the influencing factors roll damping and nonlinear roll restoring forces are of vital importance for the roll damping the most well known and widely used estimation method is the ikeda s semi empirical method ikeda and himeno 1978 its applicability on parametric roll was confirmed by hashimoto and umeda 2010 on a 6600teu containership considering the exact position of the bilge keels however it was reported by the authors that this method produced significant discrepancy with experiment results for another c11 containership therefore the inconsistency of this semi empirical method on parametric roll prediction is identified zhou et al 2016 also showed the possibility of using a 3 dof model with the roll damping estimated by the ikeda s semi empirical method to get parametric roll prediction results similar to results of the proposed hybrid method and model experiment for the nonlinear roll restoring moment the common practice is to take into account of nonlinearities of the hydrostatic moment and the froude krylov wave load in order to estimate nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov moments some researchers calculate gz curves in waves under the quasi static assumption bulian 2005 vidic perunovic 2011 some use the exact pressure integration method which conduct pressure integrals over instantaneous submerged hull matusiak 2011 rodríguez et al 2007 umeda et al 2016 vidic perunovic 2011 yu et al 2012 bulian 2005 developed an polynomial fit of the gz curve in wave the 1 5 dof model developed based on this analytical description of gz curve can predict parametric roll response accurately matusiak 2011 compared the parametric roll prediction results of three different pressure models regarding the froude krylov wave load it was found that results of the three pressure models had large differences and the conclusions on which one was the best could not be drawn although the ikeda s semi empirical method and the exact pressure integration method are the widely used estimation methods for roll damping and nonlinear restoring moment strong inconsistency and uncertainty are found when applied to parametric roll prediction in this paper the quantitative prediction of parametric roll of a kcs containership in regular head waves is conducted using a 5 dof weakly non linear seakeeping model methods for the estimation of roll damping and nonlinear restoring moment are compared and discussed in details the sensitive analysis on roll damping is conducted to evaluate its importance on parametric roll moreover the prediction results are compared with results of model experiments provided in yu et al 2018 2 numerical model 2 1 motion equations three coordinate systems the earth fixed coordinate oe xeyeze the body fixed coordinate g xyz and the horizontal body axes coordinate o xhyhzh are used as shown in fig 1 the o xhyhzh coordinate moves with the ship with the x axe pointing from ship stern to stem the y axe pointing from starboard to port the z axe pointing upwards the origin o is chosen at the bottom of the ship the displacement and velocity vectors are defined as 1 η η i x y z ϕ θ ψ t ν ν i u v w p q r t the model for parametric roll is a 5 dof sway heave roll pitch yaw weakly nonlinear time domain model based on the impulse response function irf approach cummins 1962 fonseca and guedes soares 1998 the equations of motion can be written as 2 m i ν i t f i r a d t f i r e s t b v ν 4 f i f k t f i d i f t i 2 6 where m i and ν i stands for the mass moment of inertia and velocity at the ith degree of freedom f i rad t f i r e s t f i f k t and f i d i f t are the radiation restoring wave froude krylov and wave diffraction forces and moments at the ith degree of freedom b v represents the nonlinear roll viscous damping with linear and quadric coefficients 3 b v ν 4 b 1 ν 4 b 2 ν 4 ν 4 the radiation and diffraction forces are calculated using the convolution integration of the retardation function r ij τ and q i τ as shown in eq 4 4 f i r a d t j 2 6 μ i j ν j t c i j η j t 0 t r i j t τ ν j τ d τ f i e x t t t q i t τ α τ d τ where n j is the displacement of the jth degree of freedom μ ij is the infinite frequency added mass and α τ is the wave elevation retardation functions r ij τ q i τ and the radiation restoring force c ij are derived from values in the frequency domain as presented in eq 5 5 r i j t 2 π 0 λ i j ω e cos ω e t d ω e 2 π 0 ω e μ i j ω e μ i j sin ω e t d ω e q i t 1 π 0 d i r ω e cos ω e t d i i ω e sin ω e t d ω e c i j ω e 2 μ i j μ i j ω e ω e 0 r i j τ sin ω e τ d τ where ω e is the encounter frequency the added mass μ ij damping coefficient λ ij and the real and imaginary part of diffraction force d i r and d i i in the frequency domain are calculated by the stf method the 5 dof time domain model is validated through comparisons with motion raos obtained by the frequency domain 2d stf method the frequency domain 3d panel method and the model experiment the comparison results are presented in figs 2 and 3 in these figures the square dots represent results of time domain simulations obtained through applying fft analysis on the motion time histories in fig 2 raos in heave pitch roll and yaw obtained by the time domain method agree very well with those of the frequency domain 2d stf method under wave angle 135 deg and froude number 0 for the kcs containership in fig 3 the time domain method are further compared with the model experiment and the frequency domain 3d panel method under wave angle 180 deg and froude number 0 158 it can be found that the time domain method has similar results as model experiments except for the peak area of the pitch motion the raos calculated by the 3d panel method are also plotted as black solid lines which agree very well with the model experiment in the peak area of the pitch motion therefore the differences between the time domain method and experiment in the peak area of the pitch motion are caused by the defects of the 2d stf method used in the time domain method however the 3d panel method overestimates the heave motion response between wave frequency 0 4 0 6 rad s comparing to the model experiment and the 2d stf method overall the underestimation in the peak area of the pitch motion for the time domain method is around 10 of the peak value which is generally acceptable for the motion prediction thus the 5 dof time domain model is validated to be able to predict accurately the linear ship motion 2 2 estimation of roll damping roll damping especially roll viscous damping b ν is vital for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll in the model the potential wave making damping b w is calculated by the potential stf method the viscous damping b ν is calculated using the ikeda s semi empirical method ikeda and himeno 1978 which divided viscous roll damping into five components the friction component b f the eddy making component b e the lift component b l and the bilge keel component b bk in this research two changes are made to the original ikeda s semi empirical method one change is to transfer the equivalent linearized roll damping b e used in ikeda s method back to its nonlinear form with linear and quadric coefficients in order to make it more suitable for the time domain simulation the other change is to develop a new formula for the rudder damping b r which is not included in ikeda s method details of these two changes are describe as follows in the first change the equivalent linearized roll damping b e used in the original ikeda s method is transferred back to the nonlinear form in ikeda s method the nonlinear roll damping b ν ν 4 is expressed as the equivalent linearized roll damping b e assuming that the energy loss due to damping in a half roll cycle is the same between nonlinear and linear damping as shown in eq 6 6 b v v 4 b 1 v 4 b 2 v 4 v 4 b 3 v 4 3 b e v 4 b e b 1 8 3 π ω η 4 a b 2 3 4 ω 2 η 4 a 2 b 3 where b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the linear quadric and cubic coefficients η 4a denotes the roll amplitude in order to calculate b e the roll amplitude η 4a is required this is not suitable for time domain simulation because the roll amplitude η 4a is unknown thus the equivalent linear damping is reproduced to the nonlinear form with linear and quadric coefficients b 1 and b 2 each component of roll damping all consists of linear and quadric part the estimation of linear and quadric part of each component are described as follows frictional damping b f is caused by the skin friction force on the hull while rolling it is estimated in terms of the equivalent linear damping as shown in eq 7 7 b f 0 787 ρ s f r f 2 ω μ 1 4 1 u ω l p p b 1 f where s f is the wetted area μ is the water viscosity r f is the roll equivalent radius because the equivalent linear damping is independent of the roll amplitude its nonlinear form under constant wave frequency ω can be viewed as the linear damping b 1f no quadric damping is considered eddy making damping b e is the nonlinear damping induced by the pressure variation and eddy shedding on the bare hull according to the experiments on several hull sections it is found that b e is proportional to the frequency and roll amplitude ikeda et al 1977 8 b e 8 3 π b 2 e ω η 4 a therefore the eddy making damping only has the quadric part b 2e which depends only on the shape of the hull section b 2e is calculated based on the semi empirical formula as shown in eq 9 9 b 2 e 1 2 ρ l d 0 4 c r where l and d 0 stand for ship length and draft the calculation of the eddy damping moment coefficient c r can be found in ikeda et al 1977 bilge keel damping b bk is generated by the bilge keel it can be divided into two parts the damping created by the normal force acted on the bilge keel b bkn and the damping due to the hull pressure created by the bilge keel b bkh b bkn is nonlinear and its equivalent linear damping is calculated as eq 10 10 b b k n 8 3 π ρ r b k 2 l b k b b k c d ω η 4 a where r bk l bk and b bk represent radius length and breadth of the bilge keel the drag force coefficient c d is related to the keulegan carpeter kc number πr bk η 4a b bk based on measurements by ikeda and himeno 1978 c d can be estimated by eq 11 11 c d 22 5 b b k π r b k η 4 a 2 4 finally the nonlinear form of b bkn with linear term b 1bkn and quadratic term b 2bkn can be derived as eq 12 12 b 1 b k n 8 3 π ρ r b k 3 l b k b b k ω f 2 22 5 b b k r π f b 2 b k n 2 4 ρ r b k 3 l b k b b k f 2 where f is an empirical coefficient for the modification of velocity increment b bkh is also nonlinear according to ikeda et al 1977 it is derived as the equivalent linear damping in eq 13 13 b b k h 8 3 π ρ r b k 2 η 4 a ω f 2 d 2 2 a c p b c p where a and b are functions of the kc number and hull shape c p and c p are the pressure coefficient at the front and back of the bilge keel in order to get the nonlinear form of b bkh with linear term b 1bkn and quadratic term b 2bkn the equivalent linear damping can be expressed approximately as eq 14 14 b b k h k 1 k 2 η 4 a b 1 b k h k 1 b 2 b k h k 2 8 3 π ω this approximation of the equivalent linear damping is accurate when the roll amplitude η 4a is less than 40 lift damping b l is generated by the lift force acting on the hull moving forward with roll motion lift damping depends little on the roll frequency thus the roll lift moment can be obtained under the quasi static assumption with constant heeling angle the lift damping is viewed as linear damping and can be calculated as eq 15 15 b l b 1 l 1 2 ρ s u k n l 0 l r 1 1 4 o g l r 0 7 o g 2 l 0 l r where the levers of the lift force l 0 0 3d and l r 0 5d k n is the lift gradient rudder damping b r is produced by the rudder under the roll motion it is pointed by zhou et al 2015 that the rudder roll damping cannot be neglected however the rudder damping is not included in the ikeda s method in this research the new method for the rudder damping is proposed based on the bilge keel damping created by the normal force it is calculated as 16 b r 4 3 π ρ r r 2 a r c d ω η 4 a where r r denote the distance between cog and the acting point of the rudder force a r is the rudder area the drag coefficient c d is related to the kc number πr r η 4a b r the relationship between c d and kc number of three different square plates is measured by singh 1979 as shown in fig 4 the fitted curve is presented as eq 17 17 c d 11 370 b r π r r η 4 a 1 823 finally the nonlinear form of b r with linear term b 1r and quadratic term b 2r can be derived as eq 18 18 b 1 r 4 3 π ρ r r 3 a r ω 11 370 b r r r π b 2 r 1 823 ρ r r 3 a r finally the total roll viscous damping b ν ν 4 in eq 3 is expressed in the nonlinear form with linear and quadric coefficients b 1 and b 2 the linear damping b 1 includes frictional damping lift damping bilge keel damping and rudder damping the quadric damping b 2 includes eddy damping bilge keel damping and rudder damping moreover the wave damping is calculated using the 2d linear stf method therefore wave damping is linear and included in b 1 19 b 1 b 1 f b 1 b k n b 1 b k h b 1 l b 1 r b 1 w b 2 b 2 e b 2 b k n b 2 b k h b 2 r 2 3 nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces are calculated through pressure integration on the instantaneous wetted surfaces considering the 5 dof ship motions as well as the wave elevation yu et al 2017 during the calculation the hull and upper deck are represented by several non uniform rational b splines nurbs surfaces as demonstrated in fig 5 the ith surface has an area of a i a central point r i x i y i z i with a normal vector n i n 1i n 2i n 3i in the body fixed coordinate g xyz the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces are calculated as 20 when z i e d x i e t f j r e s i 1 n a i p r e s r i n j i h m g cos

3 1 subject ship and simulation cases the subject ship is the kcs kriso container ship containership simman2008 2008 the free running model experiments on the parametric roll of the kcs containership in regular head waves are conducted in the towing tank of yokohama national university results on the model experiments are fully reported in yu et al 2018 during the simulation a 1 100 scale ship model same as the model experiment is used main particulars of the model ship are shown in table 1 simulation cases are also the same as experiment cases as shown in tables 2 and 3 two setups no i and ii with and without bilge keels are established in table 2 natural roll periods and roll damping coefficients under zero speed obtained from roll decay tests are shown for two setups cases in regular head waves with two wave lengths λ l pp 1 00 and 1 15 and various speeds are chosen as shown in table 3 in table 3 t e t roll indicates the relationship between the encounter period t e and the natural roll period t roll which is critical to the onset of parametric roll the mean parametric roll steady amplitudes of two setups obtained from the model experiment by yu et al 2018 are presented in table 3 the symbol indicates that no parametric roll occurs in the case 3 2 calculation of roll damping roll damping is important for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll the nonlinear roll damping of the kcs model ship under various speeds are estimated using the ikeda s empirical method described in section 2 2 the results of non dimensional linear damping b 1 and quadric damping b 2 are presented in table 4 and fig 6 when parametric roll occurs the roll period is near the ship natural roll period therefore the wave frequency ω in ikeda s empirical formula is set as the natural roll frequency for all the cases the estimated zero speed roll damping coefficients are compared with those of model experiments as shown in table 5 in the estimated damping the potential wave damping b w obtained by the stf method is also added from the table it can be found that the differences on the linear roll damping coefficients between numerical and experimental results are quite small however the differences on the quadric roll damping are quite large this is mainly because that the initial angles of free roll decay tests during the experiment are less than 10 which is not large enough to estimate the quadric roll damping accurately 3 3 calculation of nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces are important for the prediction of parametric roll in this paper they are estimated by pressure integration over the instantaneous wetted surface this method takes into account both the instantaneous position of the ship in space and the pressure due to waves extending up to the actual wave elevation the gm variation and gz curves in waves are calculated using this method and plotted in fig 7 it can be found from the figure that the gm variation when wave passes the ship is large and gz curves change a lot with different hull position in waves these indicate the kcs containership is vulnerable for parametric roll it is reported by hashimoto and umeda 2004 that this method based on froude krylov assumption could considerably overestimate the danger of parametric rolling in order to evaluate the magnitude of the overestimation different models with different levels of nonlinearity on restoring and froude krylov forces see table 6 are proposed as follows model a when z i e d 0 f j r e s i 1 n a i p r e s r i n

considers the nonlinearity of froude krylov forces caused by both the instantaneous position of the ship x i e y i e z i e and pressure due to waves extending up to the actual wave elevation d x i e t meanwhile the restoring forces are calculated linearly model e this model considers the nonlinearity of restoring and froude krylov forces caused by both the instantaneous position of the ship and pressure due to waves extending up to the actual wave elevation as described in eq 20 23 the numerical simulations based on these different models are conducted and their results are presented in the next chapter to investigate the magnitude of the overestimation using the froude krylov assumption 4 results and discussions in this chapter the simulation results of five different restoring force models described in the last chapter are presented their differences are analyzed and the most accurate model is found then the simulation results are compared with the experiment results finally the sensitive analysis on roll damping is conducted to evaluate the importance of roll damping on parametric roll 4 1 simulations using different models of restoring forces numerical simulations on kcs parametric roll using the five different models of restoring and froude krylov forces are conducted the resulting parametric roll steady amplitudes for cases of setup no i with λ l pp 1 15 are plotted in fig 8 as dashed lines with different markers the experiment results of roll steady amplitudes for all the repeated tests cross points and their mean values solid line with cross points are also plotted for comparison during the simulation the roll damping is taken from table 4 from fig 8 it can be confirmed that the five models based on the froude krylov assumption overestimate considerably the steady amplitude of parametric roll especially for model b and e there are large discrepancies among different models the results of model a which considers only the nonlinear restoring forces caused by instantaneous position of the ship agree best with model experiments among all the five models in terms of both the steady roll amplitude and the speed region where parametric roll occurs the possible reasons for this conclusion are discussed below firstly the simulated pitch and heave amplitudes of all the five models black dashed lines as well as the mean amplitudes of the experiment red solid line are plotted in figs 9 and 10 from fig 9 it can be observed that the simulated pitch amplitudes of model b and e have large differences with those of other three models and model experiments meanwhile the corresponding parametric roll amplitudes of model b and e in fig 8 also have large differences with those of other three models and model experiments thus it can be concluded that the accurate estimations of the pitch and heave motions are vital for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll that is to say the model which estimates the pitch and heave motions accurately is possible to give a good prediction of parametric roll model b and e which overestimate considerably the pitch and heave motions are not suitable for the prediction of parametric roll furthermore the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model a black solid line c blue dash dot line and d red dash line as well as the time histories of roll pitch and heave are presented in fig 11 with the additional consideration of wave pressure extending up to the actual wave elevation the restoring and froude krylov forces of model d are similar to those of model c with more fluctuations however these fluctuations generate some non harmonic and unreasonable roll motion red dash line with truncated crest as highlighted in the red circle of fig 11 thus model d is not suitable then it can be observed from fig 11 that the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model a considering only the nonlinearity of restoring forces are quite distinguishable from those of model c which consider only the nonlinearity of froude krylov forces in fig 10 during the time range a to b the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model a grow slower than other time ranges in one roll period because in this time range the wave crest is amid ship and the gz in wave is small however the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model c have a faster and sudden grow in this range which is unreasonable therefore it can be concluded that model a is suitable for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll among all the five models according to the analysis above 4 2 comparison with model experiments numerical simulations on all cases in table 3 using model a are conducted and compared with model experiments the simulated time histories of roll and pitch motions for several cases are presented in figs 12 16 as black dashed lines with experimental time histories plotted as red solid lines for comparison the parametric roll amplitudes for all the cases in table 3 are summarized and shown in fig 17 setup no i with bilge keel and 18 setup no ii without bilge keel for cases in figs 12 16 the simulated time histories of pitch and roll agree quite well with those of the experiment in terms of amplitudes moreover it is worth mentioning that the slight variations of roll and pitch periods in time histories of the experiment are caused by the heading change during the free running model experiment with the autopilot as described in yu et al 2018 then from figs 17 and 18 it can be found that the simulated parametric roll amplitudes and the speed region where parametric roll occurs agree with the experiment results with certain overestimation 4 3 sensitive analysis on the roll damping it is confirmed by hashimoto and umeda 2010 that ikeda s method has strong inconsistencies and uncertainties when applied to parametric roll prediction the large number of theoretical semi empirical and empirical coefficients in ikeda s method bring difficulties for the uncertainty analysis given that these uncertainties on coefficients eventually result in the change of total roll damping for simplicity the sensitive analysis on the total viscous roll damping b ν estimated by ikeda s method is conducted to evaluate the importance of roll damping on parametric roll during the sensitive analysis the total viscous roll damping b ν is changed by 10 20 and 30 and the parametric roll under changed b ν for all the cases is simulated to get the resulting steady parametric roll amplitudes η 4a as shown in figs 19 and 20 in these figures the area filled with yellow forward slash lines green dense backslash lines and blue dense forward slash lines stands for the roll amplitudes within 30 20 and 10 of damping change respectively the upper and lower limits of the area filled with yellow forward slash lines are roll amplitudes with roll damping changed by 30 and 30 and it is the same for the other two areas in order to quantify the sensitivity of roll damping on parametric roll the relative sensitivity s i and their average s for each case are defined as eq 24 and presented in table 7 24 s i d η 4 a η 4 a 0 d b v b v 0 η 4 a η 4 a 0 η 4 a 0 b v b v 0 b v 0 100 i 10 20 30 s s 10 s 10 s 20 s 20 s 30 s 30 6 from figs 19 and 20 and table 7 it can be found that 1 unlike the influence of different restoring models the roll damping mainly affects the parametric roll amplitudes but has no effect on the speed region where the parametric roll occurs 2 large discrepancies on the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll can be observed for different cases for setup no ii without bilge keels in fig 20 roll amplitudes are large and the nonlinear quadric damping is dominant for these cases the average relative sensitivity in table 7 is quite small this indicates that the sensitivity of nonlinear quadric damping against parametric roll is small in contrast the sensitivity of linear damping against parametric roll is quite large as the average relative sensitivity in table 7 is large for cases with bilge keels in which the linear damping is dominant under small roll amplitudes 3 for all two wave lengths and setups the largest average relative sensitivity red bold data in table 7 all occurs in cases close to the speed threshold of parametric roll this is most significant for the 0 3 m s case of setup no ii with λ l pp 1 15 for this case by increasing of 10 roll damping the steady roll amplitude changes dramatically from 34 to 15 thus the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll for cases close to the speed threshold is significant 5 conclusions in this research the quantitative predictions of parametric roll of a kcs containership in regular head waves with different wave lengths and ship speeds are conducted using a 5 dof weakly non linear seakeeping model different models for the estimation of nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces with different levels of nonlinearities are compared and discussed in details the sensitive analysis on roll damping estimated by the ikeda s method is conducted to evaluate the importance of roll damping on the prediction of parametric roll in terms of the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces it is confirmed that the five models based on the froude krylov assumption overestimate the steady amplitude of parametric roll it is further concluded that the accurate estimation of the pitch and heave motion is vital for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll finally model a considering only the nonlinearity of restoring forces caused by instantaneous position of the ship with the wetted surface extending up to the still water level is found to be the most suitable model for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll among all the five models in terms of roll damping it is found from sensitive analysis that the roll damping mainly affects the parametric roll amplitudes but has no effect on the speed region where the parametric roll occurs the sensitivity of nonlinear quadric damping against parametric roll is small in contrast the sensitivity of linear damping against parametric roll is quite large the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll for cases close to the speed threshold is significant moreover it should be noted that these conclusions are drawn based on results of only one containership possibilities for generalization on all containership is still doubted therefore these conclusions will be validated on other containerships when more experimental data is available acknowledgements

22558,the quantitative prediction of parametric roll of a kcs containership are conducted using a 5 dof nonlinear time domain model based on the potential flow in the model linear radiation and diffraction forces are calculated by the stf method and transferred into time domain using irf approach while nonlinear restoring and f k forces are calculated through pressure integration over instantaneous wetted surfaces roll damping is estimated using the ikeda s method the sensitive analysis on roll damping is conducted five different models for nonlinear restoring and f k forces are discussed it is confirmed that the five models overestimate the parametric roll amplitude model a considering only the nonlinearity of restoring forces caused by instantaneous ship position under still water is suitable for parametric roll prediction among five models moreover accurate estimation of pitch motions is vital for parametric roll prediction through the sensitive analysis it is found that roll damping affects parametric roll amplitudes but has no effect on the speed region where parametric roll occurs the sensitivity of nonlinear quadric damping against parametric roll is small while the sensitivity of linear damping is large the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll for cases close to the speed threshold is significant keywords parametric roll roll damping nonlinear roll restoring moment 1 introduction the ship parametric roll is a self resonant roll motion caused by large variations of water plane area and roll restoring characteristics in heavy longitudinal seas severe parametric roll was reported on containerships france et al 2003 small fishing vessels neves et al 1999 cruise ship and pctc ovegård et al 2012 the study on the parametric roll were conducted through numerical simulations bulian 2005 hashimoto and umeda 2010 neves et al 1999 spanos and papanikolaou 2007 and model experiments hashimoto et al 2007 lu et al 2016 neves et al 2002 taguchi et al 2011 yu et al 2018 the international maritime organization sub committee on ship design and construction imo sdc is finalizing the multilevel second generation intact stability criteria on parametric roll imo sdc4 wp 4 2017 as a nonlinear phenomenon the quantitative prediction of parametric roll is affected by many factors many researches focused on evaluating the importance of these factors neves et al 1999 bulian 2005 and hashimoto and umeda 2010 investigated the influence of pitch and heave motions and confirmed their importance on parametric roll vidic perunovic and jensen 2009 and ma et al 2012 investigated the influence of surge motions on parametric roll and found that its influence is not significant lu et al 2011 and zhou 2016 investigated the influence of added mass and roll moment of inertia on parametric roll respectively among all the influencing factors roll damping and nonlinear roll restoring forces are of vital importance for the roll damping the most well known and widely used estimation method is the ikeda s semi empirical method ikeda and himeno 1978 its applicability on parametric roll was confirmed by hashimoto and umeda 2010 on a 6600teu containership considering the exact position of the bilge keels however it was reported by the authors that this method produced significant discrepancy with experiment results for another c11 containership therefore the inconsistency of this semi empirical method on parametric roll prediction is identified zhou et al 2016 also showed the possibility of using a 3 dof model with the roll damping estimated by the ikeda s semi empirical method to get parametric roll prediction results similar to results of the proposed hybrid method and model experiment for the nonlinear roll restoring moment the common practice is to take into account of nonlinearities of the hydrostatic moment and the froude krylov wave load in order to estimate nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov moments some researchers calculate gz curves in waves under the quasi static assumption bulian 2005 vidic perunovic 2011 some use the exact pressure integration method which conduct pressure integrals over instantaneous submerged hull matusiak 2011 rodríguez et al 2007 umeda et al 2016 vidic perunovic 2011 yu et al 2012 bulian 2005 developed an polynomial fit of the gz curve in wave the 1 5 dof model developed based on this analytical description of gz curve can predict parametric roll response accurately matusiak 2011 compared the parametric roll prediction results of three different pressure models regarding the froude krylov wave load it was found that results of the three pressure models had large differences and the conclusions on which one was the best could not be drawn although the ikeda s semi empirical method and the exact pressure integration method are the widely used estimation methods for roll damping and nonlinear restoring moment strong inconsistency and uncertainty are found when applied to parametric roll prediction in this paper the quantitative prediction of parametric roll of a kcs containership in regular head waves is conducted using a 5 dof weakly non linear seakeeping model methods for the estimation of roll damping and nonlinear restoring moment are compared and discussed in details the sensitive analysis on roll damping is conducted to evaluate its importance on parametric roll moreover the prediction results are compared with results of model experiments provided in yu et al 2018 2 numerical model 2 1 motion equations three coordinate systems the earth fixed coordinate oe xeyeze the body fixed coordinate g xyz and the horizontal body axes coordinate o xhyhzh are used as shown in fig 1 the o xhyhzh coordinate moves with the ship with the x axe pointing from ship stern to stem the y axe pointing from starboard to port the z axe pointing upwards the origin o is chosen at the bottom of the ship the displacement and velocity vectors are defined as 1 η η i x y z ϕ θ ψ t ν ν i u v w p q r t the model for parametric roll is a 5 dof sway heave roll pitch yaw weakly nonlinear time domain model based on the impulse response function irf approach cummins 1962 fonseca and guedes soares 1998 the equations of motion can be written as 2 m i ν i t f i r a d t f i r e s t b v ν 4 f i f k t f i d i f t i 2 6 where m i and ν i stands for the mass moment of inertia and velocity at the ith degree of freedom f i rad t f i r e s t f i f k t and f i d i f t are the radiation restoring wave froude krylov and wave diffraction forces and moments at the ith degree of freedom b v represents the nonlinear roll viscous damping with linear and quadric coefficients 3 b v ν 4 b 1 ν 4 b 2 ν 4 ν 4 the radiation and diffraction forces are calculated using the convolution integration of the retardation function r ij τ and q i τ as shown in eq 4 4 f i r a d t j 2 6 μ i j ν j t c i j η j t 0 t r i j t τ ν j τ d τ f i e x t t t q i t τ α τ d τ where n j is the displacement of the jth degree of freedom μ ij is the infinite frequency added mass and α τ is the wave elevation retardation functions r ij τ q i τ and the radiation restoring force c ij are derived from values in the frequency domain as presented in eq 5 5 r i j t 2 π 0 λ i j ω e cos ω e t d ω e 2 π 0 ω e μ i j ω e μ i j sin ω e t d ω e q i t 1 π 0 d i r ω e cos ω e t d i i ω e sin ω e t d ω e c i j ω e 2 μ i j μ i j ω e ω e 0 r i j τ sin ω e τ d τ where ω e is the encounter frequency the added mass μ ij damping coefficient λ ij and the real and imaginary part of diffraction force d i r and d i i in the frequency domain are calculated by the stf method the 5 dof time domain model is validated through comparisons with motion raos obtained by the frequency domain 2d stf method the frequency domain 3d panel method and the model experiment the comparison results are presented in figs 2 and 3 in these figures the square dots represent results of time domain simulations obtained through applying fft analysis on the motion time histories in fig 2 raos in heave pitch roll and yaw obtained by the time domain method agree very well with those of the frequency domain 2d stf method under wave angle 135 deg and froude number 0 for the kcs containership in fig 3 the time domain method are further compared with the model experiment and the frequency domain 3d panel method under wave angle 180 deg and froude number 0 158 it can be found that the time domain method has similar results as model experiments except for the peak area of the pitch motion the raos calculated by the 3d panel method are also plotted as black solid lines which agree very well with the model experiment in the peak area of the pitch motion therefore the differences between the time domain method and experiment in the peak area of the pitch motion are caused by the defects of the 2d stf method used in the time domain method however the 3d panel method overestimates the heave motion response between wave frequency 0 4 0 6 rad s comparing to the model experiment and the 2d stf method overall the underestimation in the peak area of the pitch motion for the time domain method is around 10 of the peak value which is generally acceptable for the motion prediction thus the 5 dof time domain model is validated to be able to predict accurately the linear ship motion 2 2 estimation of roll damping roll damping especially roll viscous damping b ν is vital for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll in the model the potential wave making damping b w is calculated by the potential stf method the viscous damping b ν is calculated using the ikeda s semi empirical method ikeda and himeno 1978 which divided viscous roll damping into five components the friction component b f the eddy making component b e the lift component b l and the bilge keel component b bk in this research two changes are made to the original ikeda s semi empirical method one change is to transfer the equivalent linearized roll damping b e used in ikeda s method back to its nonlinear form with linear and quadric coefficients in order to make it more suitable for the time domain simulation the other change is to develop a new formula for the rudder damping b r which is not included in ikeda s method details of these two changes are describe as follows in the first change the equivalent linearized roll damping b e used in the original ikeda s method is transferred back to the nonlinear form in ikeda s method the nonlinear roll damping b ν ν 4 is expressed as the equivalent linearized roll damping b e assuming that the energy loss due to damping in a half roll cycle is the same between nonlinear and linear damping as shown in eq 6 6 b v v 4 b 1 v 4 b 2 v 4 v 4 b 3 v 4 3 b e v 4 b e b 1 8 3 π ω η 4 a b 2 3 4 ω 2 η 4 a 2 b 3 where b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the linear quadric and cubic coefficients η 4a denotes the roll amplitude in order to calculate b e the roll amplitude η 4a is required this is not suitable for time domain simulation because the roll amplitude η 4a is unknown thus the equivalent linear damping is reproduced to the nonlinear form with linear and quadric coefficients b 1 and b 2 each component of roll damping all consists of linear and quadric part the estimation of linear and quadric part of each component are described as follows frictional damping b f is caused by the skin friction force on the hull while rolling it is estimated in terms of the equivalent linear damping as shown in eq 7 7 b f 0 787 ρ s f r f 2 ω μ 1 4 1 u ω l p p b 1 f where s f is the wetted area μ is the water viscosity r f is the roll equivalent radius because the equivalent linear damping is independent of the roll amplitude its nonlinear form under constant wave frequency ω can be viewed as the linear damping b 1f no quadric damping is considered eddy making damping b e is the nonlinear damping induced by the pressure variation and eddy shedding on the bare hull according to the experiments on several hull sections it is found that b e is proportional to the frequency and roll amplitude ikeda et al 1977 8 b e 8 3 π b 2 e ω η 4 a therefore the eddy making damping only has the quadric part b 2e which depends only on the shape of the hull section b 2e is calculated based on the semi empirical formula as shown in eq 9 9 b 2 e 1 2 ρ l d 0 4 c r where l and d 0 stand for ship length and draft the calculation of the eddy damping moment coefficient c r can be found in ikeda et al 1977 bilge keel damping b bk is generated by the bilge keel it can be divided into two parts the damping created by the normal force acted on the bilge keel b bkn and the damping due to the hull pressure created by the bilge keel b bkh b bkn is nonlinear and its equivalent linear damping is calculated as eq 10 10 b b k n 8 3 π ρ r b k 2 l b k b b k c d ω η 4 a where r bk l bk and b bk represent radius length and breadth of the bilge keel the drag force coefficient c d is related to the keulegan carpeter kc number πr bk η 4a b bk based on measurements by ikeda and himeno 1978 c d can be estimated by eq 11 11 c d 22 5 b b k π r b k η 4 a 2 4 finally the nonlinear form of b bkn with linear term b 1bkn and quadratic term b 2bkn can be derived as eq 12 12 b 1 b k n 8 3 π ρ r b k 3 l b k b b k ω f 2 22 5 b b k r π f b 2 b k n 2 4 ρ r b k 3 l b k b b k f 2 where f is an empirical coefficient for the modification of velocity increment b bkh is also nonlinear according to ikeda et al 1977 it is derived as the equivalent linear damping in eq 13 13 b b k h 8 3 π ρ r b k 2 η 4 a ω f 2 d 2 2 a c p b c p where a and b are functions of the kc number and hull shape c p and c p are the pressure coefficient at the front and back of the bilge keel in order to get the nonlinear form of b bkh with linear term b 1bkn and quadratic term b 2bkn the equivalent linear damping can be expressed approximately as eq 14 14 b b k h k 1 k 2 η 4 a b 1 b k h k 1 b 2 b k h k 2 8 3 π ω this approximation of the equivalent linear damping is accurate when the roll amplitude η 4a is less than 40 lift damping b l is generated by the lift force acting on the hull moving forward with roll motion lift damping depends little on the roll frequency thus the roll lift moment can be obtained under the quasi static assumption with constant heeling angle the lift damping is viewed as linear damping and can be calculated as eq 15 15 b l b 1 l 1 2 ρ s u k n l 0 l r 1 1 4 o g l r 0 7 o g 2 l 0 l r where the levers of the lift force l 0 0 3d and l r 0 5d k n is the lift gradient rudder damping b r is produced by the rudder under the roll motion it is pointed by zhou et al 2015 that the rudder roll damping cannot be neglected however the rudder damping is not included in the ikeda s method in this research the new method for the rudder damping is proposed based on the bilge keel damping created by the normal force it is calculated as 16 b r 4 3 π ρ r r 2 a r c d ω η 4 a where r r denote the distance between cog and the acting point of the rudder force a r is the rudder area the drag coefficient c d is related to the kc number πr r η 4a b r the relationship between c d and kc number of three different square plates is measured by singh 1979 as shown in fig 4 the fitted curve is presented as eq 17 17 c d 11 370 b r π r r η 4 a 1 823 finally the nonlinear form of b r with linear term b 1r and quadratic term b 2r can be derived as eq 18 18 b 1 r 4 3 π ρ r r 3 a r ω 11 370 b r r r π b 2 r 1 823 ρ r r 3 a r finally the total roll viscous damping b ν ν 4 in eq 3 is expressed in the nonlinear form with linear and quadric coefficients b 1 and b 2 the linear damping b 1 includes frictional damping lift damping bilge keel damping and rudder damping the quadric damping b 2 includes eddy damping bilge keel damping and rudder damping moreover the wave damping is calculated using the 2d linear stf method therefore wave damping is linear and included in b 1 19 b 1 b 1 f b 1 b k n b 1 b k h b 1 l b 1 r b 1 w b 2 b 2 e b 2 b k n b 2 b k h b 2 r 2 3 nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces are calculated through pressure integration on the instantaneous wetted surfaces considering the 5 dof ship motions as well as the wave elevation yu et al 2017 during the calculation the hull and upper deck are represented by several non uniform rational b splines nurbs surfaces as demonstrated in fig 5 the ith surface has an area of a i a central point r i x i y i z i with a normal vector n i n 1i n 2i n 3i in the body fixed coordinate g xyz the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces are calculated as 20 when z i e d x i e t f j r e s i 1 n a i p r e s r i n j i h m g cos

3 1 subject ship and simulation cases the subject ship is the kcs kriso container ship containership simman2008 2008 the free running model experiments on the parametric roll of the kcs containership in regular head waves are conducted in the towing tank of yokohama national university results on the model experiments are fully reported in yu et al 2018 during the simulation a 1 100 scale ship model same as the model experiment is used main particulars of the model ship are shown in table 1 simulation cases are also the same as experiment cases as shown in tables 2 and 3 two setups no i and ii with and without bilge keels are established in table 2 natural roll periods and roll damping coefficients under zero speed obtained from roll decay tests are shown for two setups cases in regular head waves with two wave lengths λ l pp 1 00 and 1 15 and various speeds are chosen as shown in table 3 in table 3 t e t roll indicates the relationship between the encounter period t e and the natural roll period t roll which is critical to the onset of parametric roll the mean parametric roll steady amplitudes of two setups obtained from the model experiment by yu et al 2018 are presented in table 3 the symbol indicates that no parametric roll occurs in the case 3 2 calculation of roll damping roll damping is important for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll the nonlinear roll damping of the kcs model ship under various speeds are estimated using the ikeda s empirical method described in section 2 2 the results of non dimensional linear damping b 1 and quadric damping b 2 are presented in table 4 and fig 6 when parametric roll occurs the roll period is near the ship natural roll period therefore the wave frequency ω in ikeda s empirical formula is set as the natural roll frequency for all the cases the estimated zero speed roll damping coefficients are compared with those of model experiments as shown in table 5 in the estimated damping the potential wave damping b w obtained by the stf method is also added from the table it can be found that the differences on the linear roll damping coefficients between numerical and experimental results are quite small however the differences on the quadric roll damping are quite large this is mainly because that the initial angles of free roll decay tests during the experiment are less than 10 which is not large enough to estimate the quadric roll damping accurately 3 3 calculation of nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces are important for the prediction of parametric roll in this paper they are estimated by pressure integration over the instantaneous wetted surface this method takes into account both the instantaneous position of the ship in space and the pressure due to waves extending up to the actual wave elevation the gm variation and gz curves in waves are calculated using this method and plotted in fig 7 it can be found from the figure that the gm variation when wave passes the ship is large and gz curves change a lot with different hull position in waves these indicate the kcs containership is vulnerable for parametric roll it is reported by hashimoto and umeda 2004 that this method based on froude krylov assumption could considerably overestimate the danger of parametric rolling in order to evaluate the magnitude of the overestimation different models with different levels of nonlinearity on restoring and froude krylov forces see table 6 are proposed as follows model a when z i e d 0 f j r e s i 1 n a i p r e s r i n

considers the nonlinearity of froude krylov forces caused by both the instantaneous position of the ship x i e y i e z i e and pressure due to waves extending up to the actual wave elevation d x i e t meanwhile the restoring forces are calculated linearly model e this model considers the nonlinearity of restoring and froude krylov forces caused by both the instantaneous position of the ship and pressure due to waves extending up to the actual wave elevation as described in eq 20 23 the numerical simulations based on these different models are conducted and their results are presented in the next chapter to investigate the magnitude of the overestimation using the froude krylov assumption 4 results and discussions in this chapter the simulation results of five different restoring force models described in the last chapter are presented their differences are analyzed and the most accurate model is found then the simulation results are compared with the experiment results finally the sensitive analysis on roll damping is conducted to evaluate the importance of roll damping on parametric roll 4 1 simulations using different models of restoring forces numerical simulations on kcs parametric roll using the five different models of restoring and froude krylov forces are conducted the resulting parametric roll steady amplitudes for cases of setup no i with λ l pp 1 15 are plotted in fig 8 as dashed lines with different markers the experiment results of roll steady amplitudes for all the repeated tests cross points and their mean values solid line with cross points are also plotted for comparison during the simulation the roll damping is taken from table 4 from fig 8 it can be confirmed that the five models based on the froude krylov assumption overestimate considerably the steady amplitude of parametric roll especially for model b and e there are large discrepancies among different models the results of model a which considers only the nonlinear restoring forces caused by instantaneous position of the ship agree best with model experiments among all the five models in terms of both the steady roll amplitude and the speed region where parametric roll occurs the possible reasons for this conclusion are discussed below firstly the simulated pitch and heave amplitudes of all the five models black dashed lines as well as the mean amplitudes of the experiment red solid line are plotted in figs 9 and 10 from fig 9 it can be observed that the simulated pitch amplitudes of model b and e have large differences with those of other three models and model experiments meanwhile the corresponding parametric roll amplitudes of model b and e in fig 8 also have large differences with those of other three models and model experiments thus it can be concluded that the accurate estimations of the pitch and heave motions are vital for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll that is to say the model which estimates the pitch and heave motions accurately is possible to give a good prediction of parametric roll model b and e which overestimate considerably the pitch and heave motions are not suitable for the prediction of parametric roll furthermore the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model a black solid line c blue dash dot line and d red dash line as well as the time histories of roll pitch and heave are presented in fig 11 with the additional consideration of wave pressure extending up to the actual wave elevation the restoring and froude krylov forces of model d are similar to those of model c with more fluctuations however these fluctuations generate some non harmonic and unreasonable roll motion red dash line with truncated crest as highlighted in the red circle of fig 11 thus model d is not suitable then it can be observed from fig 11 that the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model a considering only the nonlinearity of restoring forces are quite distinguishable from those of model c which consider only the nonlinearity of froude krylov forces in fig 10 during the time range a to b the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model a grow slower than other time ranges in one roll period because in this time range the wave crest is amid ship and the gz in wave is small however the roll restoring and froude krylov forces of model c have a faster and sudden grow in this range which is unreasonable therefore it can be concluded that model a is suitable for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll among all the five models according to the analysis above 4 2 comparison with model experiments numerical simulations on all cases in table 3 using model a are conducted and compared with model experiments the simulated time histories of roll and pitch motions for several cases are presented in figs 12 16 as black dashed lines with experimental time histories plotted as red solid lines for comparison the parametric roll amplitudes for all the cases in table 3 are summarized and shown in fig 17 setup no i with bilge keel and 18 setup no ii without bilge keel for cases in figs 12 16 the simulated time histories of pitch and roll agree quite well with those of the experiment in terms of amplitudes moreover it is worth mentioning that the slight variations of roll and pitch periods in time histories of the experiment are caused by the heading change during the free running model experiment with the autopilot as described in yu et al 2018 then from figs 17 and 18 it can be found that the simulated parametric roll amplitudes and the speed region where parametric roll occurs agree with the experiment results with certain overestimation 4 3 sensitive analysis on the roll damping it is confirmed by hashimoto and umeda 2010 that ikeda s method has strong inconsistencies and uncertainties when applied to parametric roll prediction the large number of theoretical semi empirical and empirical coefficients in ikeda s method bring difficulties for the uncertainty analysis given that these uncertainties on coefficients eventually result in the change of total roll damping for simplicity the sensitive analysis on the total viscous roll damping b ν estimated by ikeda s method is conducted to evaluate the importance of roll damping on parametric roll during the sensitive analysis the total viscous roll damping b ν is changed by 10 20 and 30 and the parametric roll under changed b ν for all the cases is simulated to get the resulting steady parametric roll amplitudes η 4a as shown in figs 19 and 20 in these figures the area filled with yellow forward slash lines green dense backslash lines and blue dense forward slash lines stands for the roll amplitudes within 30 20 and 10 of damping change respectively the upper and lower limits of the area filled with yellow forward slash lines are roll amplitudes with roll damping changed by 30 and 30 and it is the same for the other two areas in order to quantify the sensitivity of roll damping on parametric roll the relative sensitivity s i and their average s for each case are defined as eq 24 and presented in table 7 24 s i d η 4 a η 4 a 0 d b v b v 0 η 4 a η 4 a 0 η 4 a 0 b v b v 0 b v 0 100 i 10 20 30 s s 10 s 10 s 20 s 20 s 30 s 30 6 from figs 19 and 20 and table 7 it can be found that 1 unlike the influence of different restoring models the roll damping mainly affects the parametric roll amplitudes but has no effect on the speed region where the parametric roll occurs 2 large discrepancies on the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll can be observed for different cases for setup no ii without bilge keels in fig 20 roll amplitudes are large and the nonlinear quadric damping is dominant for these cases the average relative sensitivity in table 7 is quite small this indicates that the sensitivity of nonlinear quadric damping against parametric roll is small in contrast the sensitivity of linear damping against parametric roll is quite large as the average relative sensitivity in table 7 is large for cases with bilge keels in which the linear damping is dominant under small roll amplitudes 3 for all two wave lengths and setups the largest average relative sensitivity red bold data in table 7 all occurs in cases close to the speed threshold of parametric roll this is most significant for the 0 3 m s case of setup no ii with λ l pp 1 15 for this case by increasing of 10 roll damping the steady roll amplitude changes dramatically from 34 to 15 thus the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll for cases close to the speed threshold is significant 5 conclusions in this research the quantitative predictions of parametric roll of a kcs containership in regular head waves with different wave lengths and ship speeds are conducted using a 5 dof weakly non linear seakeeping model different models for the estimation of nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces with different levels of nonlinearities are compared and discussed in details the sensitive analysis on roll damping estimated by the ikeda s method is conducted to evaluate the importance of roll damping on the prediction of parametric roll in terms of the nonlinear restoring and froude krylov forces it is confirmed that the five models based on the froude krylov assumption overestimate the steady amplitude of parametric roll it is further concluded that the accurate estimation of the pitch and heave motion is vital for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll finally model a considering only the nonlinearity of restoring forces caused by instantaneous position of the ship with the wetted surface extending up to the still water level is found to be the most suitable model for the quantitative prediction of parametric roll among all the five models in terms of roll damping it is found from sensitive analysis that the roll damping mainly affects the parametric roll amplitudes but has no effect on the speed region where the parametric roll occurs the sensitivity of nonlinear quadric damping against parametric roll is small in contrast the sensitivity of linear damping against parametric roll is quite large the sensitivity of roll damping against parametric roll for cases close to the speed threshold is significant moreover it should be noted that these conclusions are drawn based on results of only one containership possibilities for generalization on all containership is still doubted therefore these conclusions will be validated on other containerships when more experimental data is available acknowledgements

22559,in trawling the trawl gear is connected to a trawler through a warp and towed by the trawler propulsion the depth of the trawl gear determined by the warp length and the trawler direction are the most essential factors for successful trawling in fact the position and swimming depth of target fish school should be accurately determined to enable the trawl gear to reach the depth of the fish school by controlling the trawler velocity and direction automating this process requires three dimensional simultaneous control of the trawler direction and trawl gear depth in this study we applied fuzzy logic rules generated from language instructions used by skilled captains master fishermen and officers to control the trawl gear depth and trawler direction we verified the accurate enclosing of a target fish school at the center of the trawl gear through simulations when applying the proposed three dimensional position control of the trawl gear its depth was adjusted with an error up to 7 thus the depth of a trawl gear can be automatically controlled by adjusting the trawler direction and warp length during trawling keywords trawl trawl gear fuzzy logic automatic control three dimensional towing control 1 introduction trawl systems rely on a trawl gear connected to a trawler through a warp and towed by propulsion controlling the depth of the trawl gear is one of the most essential factors for successful fishing hence the position and underwater depth of a target fish school should be accurately determined to then position the trawl gear to catch the fish school by controlling the trawler velocity and direction in practice such control and the success of fishing depend on the experience and proficiency of captains master fishermen and officers however the shortage of executive crews becomes more serious due to staff aging and rising labor costs hence recruiting foreign executive crews is being considered in the fishing industry along with the automation of executive crew tasks such as fish scouting and fishing gear control fuzzy control is a method that relies on intuitive control rules that can be encoded as commands used by humans and avoids exact mathematical formulations thus being suitable for seamless task automation precup and hellendoorn 2011 fuzzy control has been applied to various industrial areas such as ship path control parsons et al 1995 dynamic placement of drilling vessels lee et al 2002 and automatic train operation yasunobu et al 1993 automated trawling can be achieved through three dimensional control to simultaneously adjust the trawler direction and trawl gear depth which is mainly regulated by the warp length several studies on trawling automation have provided the following contributions simple modeling of trawl system and fuzzy algorithm for gear depth control lee 1994 measurement and analysis of dynamic properties of trawl gear according to warp length and towing speed which are control inputs of a midwater trawl system lee et al 1998 depth control of a midwater trawl gear using fuzzy control rules lee 1995 lee et al 2000 2001 simulation based analysis of midwater trawl gear depth control according to warp length and towing speed hu et al 2001 horizontal control and development of control rules for a trawl system johansen et al 2001 and backtracking controller for three dimensional trajectory of a midwater trawl system zhao et al 2016 nevertheless existing research is limited to two dimensional control through a single control element such as the change of the warp length or the towing speed during trawl operation consequently this research does not include the capabilities of three dimensional control which is suitable for the complex and nonlinear towing trajectory of trawl gears and correct positioning around a fish school moreover realistic trawl operation comprises a multivariable nonlinear control system and hence linear controllers may hinder automation given the varying fishing performance and fishing strategies according to the skills of the crew therefore we propose an automated control system of the towing trajectory for trawl gear using language based rules obtained from skilled crews specifically we devised three dimensional control of the trawl gear towing trajectory from fuzzy control rules based on language instructions used by skilled captains master fishermen and officers the performance of the proposed controller was analyzed through simulations applied to a trawling multi mass system furthermore we estimated the controller error in various operating situations from the agreement between the trawl gear center and fish school location and evaluated the controller applicability to real trawl systems 2 methods 2 1 trawl system modeling 2 1 1 trawler model trawlers have different specifications regarding aspects such as dimension tonnage and power depending on the industry operation type and target fish species in this study we considered a 2000 ton trawler with the specifications listed in table 1 to control the trawler velocity and direction different kinetic properties can be applied according to a time constant which quantifies the response speed of a primary control system to an input specifically we consider the time constant to be the time necessary for the system response to reach 63 2 of the target output lee 2009 hence larger time constants imply longer time for a trawler to reach a target speed equation 1 describes the trawler speed according to propulsion 1 m d v t d t f p f s f g 2 f s 1 2 c s ρ s s v 2 t 3 f g 1 2 c g ρ s g v 2 t where m is the mass of the trawler v t is its velocity f p is the propulsion f s is the resistance of the trawler f g is the resistance of the trawl gear c s and c g are the coefficients of resistance of the trawler and trawl gear respectively ρ is the density of sea water and s s s g are the projected areas of the trawler and trawl gear respectively turning velocity ω of the trawler according to its rudder angle can be expressed as 4 i ω t q c o ω where i is the inertial moment ω is the turning acceleration t q is the rotational torque and c o is the rotational resistance coefficient 2 1 2 trawl gear model for depth control of the trawl gear we model a midwater trawl gear as a mass spring model the trawl gear used in this study is illustrated in fig 1 and its specifications are listed in table 2 from the specifications we designed the gear on the simutrawl software ver 1 025 mpsl korea for simulations in addition we apply the material point method to minimize the number of simulated points to 136 for reducing computation time cha 2003 lee et al 2008 kim et al 2007 hosseini et al 2011 2 1 3 models of coupling system trawler and trawl gear a trawl system consists of coupling of the trawler which is considered as a rigid body and the trawl gear which is considered as flexible we use a mass spring model to describe the system comprising the flexible trawl gear connected to the rigid trawler in fact while a large fishing net can be towed through the seabed or midwater the trawler motion is restricted whereas the shape and behavior of the trawl gear are influenced by the waves and varying ship direction and velocity furthermore as the trawler operates under the influence of the marine environment both the trawler and trawl gear cannot be modeled as independent systems but as an interdependent system fig 2 the above mass spring model can be applied to analyze various flexible structures including trawls cha 2003 fish cages lee et al 2008 longlines lee et al 2005 and purse seines kim et al 2007 hosseini et al 2011 we provide a brief description of the model in the sequel the general equation of motion for every material point of the trawler and trawl gear can be derived from the newton s second law of motion and expressed as 5 m δ m q f i n t f e x t where m is the mass of the material point δ m is the additional mass q is the acceleration of the material point f int is the internal force between material points and f ext is the external force acting on the material point the internal force acts among material points whereas the external force acts on each material point for instance buoyancy sinking force drag and lift are internal forces acting on the trawlers and trawl gears the specific equation of motion for a trawler a trawl gear and the coupling system can be expressed as equation 6 that is a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation with respect to time t and obtained from specifying the internal and external forces in equation 1 6 m q t c q t 2 k q t f t where q t q t and q t are the position velocity and acceleration of the material point over time respectively m is the mass of the material point c is an attenuation coefficient k is the modulus of elasticity of a spring and f t represents any external forces excluding drag 2 2 controller design of trawl system 2 2 1 direction controller for trawler during trawling the success of fishing depends on the accuracy of trawl gear shooting on the target fish school identified by sonar and fish finders in this study we analyzed the target accuracy of the trawler by adopting fuzzy control rules to control the trawler direction motion of the trawler and fish school are modeled by using the right handed scheme from first person shooter games in which the trawler location is set as the origin and the target i e fish school is located at an arbitrary point the size of the fish school depends on the species water depth of habitat and marine environment in this study we considered the target trajectory which represents a fish school as a straight line along 500 m the proposed fuzzy controller calculates the control input by using error e b r between the current trawler direction and target and error variation de b r 7 e b r y b r r e f b r 8 d e b r e b r e b r 1 9 u b r u b r 1 d u b r where subscript b denotes the directional control of the trawler y b r is the current trawler direction ref b r is the target direction set at the r th sampling time and du b r is the control input variation representing the variation in rudder angle of the trawler this process is expressed as a fuzzy set with integral structure and the control input is determined at each sampling time lee et al 2001 when the fish school direction and the current trawler direction are input into the fuzzy controller the corresponding membership function is determined for the fuzzy set of input values the membership function for controlling the direction of the trawler is constructed by using five linguistic evaluations namely positive big pb positive small ps zero zo negative small ns and negative big nb fig 3 shows that error e b r between the current trawler and target directions error variation de b r and control input variation du b r can be expressed as continuous triangular membership functions control input u b r is the rudder angle of the trawler determined at each sampling time the rudder angle is set according to the experience of a captain or another skilled officer who adjusts the rudder angle to catch the target fish school during trawling to control the trawler direction we established 25 control rules as the fuzzy associative memory detailed in table 3 once the directional error between the current coordinates of the trawler and fish school and the error variation are given the control input variation is determined from inference using the control rules in fuzzy inference if the directional error is 17 and its variation is 0 3 over consecutive sampling times the following four control rules are adopted see table 3 if e b nb and de b ps then du b ns if e b nb and de b pb then du b ps if e b ns and de b ps then du b zo if e b ns and de b pb then du b ps the final value of du b can be obtained from inference based on these four rules 2 2 2 depth controller for trawl gear the trawl gear depth can be controlled through the warp length and operation speed of the fishing winch like for the trawler direction controller we designed a fuzzy depth controller that calculates the control input using error e d k between the depths of the target i e fish school and net center of the trawl gear and error variation de d k 10 e d k y d k r e f d k 11 d e d k e d k e d k 1 12 u d k u d k 1 d u d k where subscript d denotes the depth control of trawl gear y d k is the current depth of the net center ref d k is the target depth set at the th sampling time and du d k is the control input variation representing the variation in warp length this process is expressed as a fuzzy set with integral structure and the control input is determined at each sampling time lee et al 2001 when the target and current depths of the net center are input into the fuzzy controller a corresponding membership function is determined for the fuzzy set of input values the membership function for controlling the trawl gear depth is constructed by using the same linguistic evaluations for the trawler direction controller fig 4 shows that error e d k between the current net center and target depths error variation de d k and control input variation du d k can be expressed as continuous triangular membership functions the following example illustrates the control instructions that a skilled crew uses during trawling if the net depth is considerably below the fish school depth and the depth of the fish school slightly varies the warp length should be reduced this instruction can be formally expressed as the following control rule if e d pb and de d ps then du d nb specifically if e d and de d are 20 m and 0 1 m s over consecutive sampling times respectively the following four control rules are adopted see table 4 if e d ps and de d zo then du d ns if e d ps and de d ps then du d nb if e d pb and de d zo then du d ns if e d pb and de d ps then du d pb the final value of du d can be obtained from inference based on these four rules control input value u d k is the warp length determined by fuzzy inference at each sampling time if the error between the net center and fish school depths and the error variation are given then the control input variation is determined from inference using the control rules 2 2 3 three dimensional towing trajectory controller for trawl gear to control the towing trajectory of the trawl gear we devised the simultaneous trawler direction and trawl gear depth control this control strategy aims to accurately locate the trawl gear at the depth of the target location to catch the fish school in the towing trajectory controller the direction control input for the trawler is calculated from direction error e b r and error variation de b r between the current trawl gear and fish school i e target directions in addition the depth control input of the trawl gear is calculated from error e d k and error variation de d k between the net center and fish school depths then the rudder angle of the trawler u b r and the warp length u d k are used as control inputs and determined from fuzzy reasoning to perform trawler direction control and trawl gear depth control fig 5 shows the block diagram of the proposed control system for three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear for the three dimensional towing trajectory control of trawl gear illustrated in fig 6 the target trajectory represents the fish school which is at distance l from the trawler in direction θ 1 the length of the target trajectory p 1 p 2 is fixed to 500 m and distance d from the target trajectory to the cast net point p 0 can be calculated using equation 13 which considers the time for the trawl to reach a steady position 13 d α v s d v g where α is the steady state settlement coefficient of the trawl gear which depends on the size of the gear set to 3 in this study v s is the trawler velocity d is the depth of the target and v g is the sinking speed of the trawl gear after the primary target point of the trawler p s is set to be the cast net point p 0 and the trawler direction is controlled accordingly net cast is performed when the angle between the direction angle and target trajectory θ 2 is below 5 i e θ 2 5 after net casting the three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear is conducted by the trawler towards the second target point p 1 to estimate the target trajectory when the distance between the trawler and secondary target p s p 1 is below 20 m i e p s p 1 20 m the three dimensional towing trajectory of the trawl gear is controlled to target point p 2 then if the distance between the trawler and third target point p s p 2 is below 20 m i e p s p 2 20 m and thus passes the third target point the control terminates 3 results and discussion 3 1 trawler direction control fig 7 illustrates the fuzzy inference for the control input when the fish school i e target is located at 2000 m from the trawler and at 17 from the portside the trawler velocity is 4 0 knots and the error variation is 0 3 s error e b r between the current trawler direction and the fish school position is 17 and error variation d e b r is 0 3 s based on the membership functions in fig 3 and the fuzzy associative memory detailed in table 3 the following control rules were adopted if e b nb and de b ps then du b ns if e b nb and de b pb then du b ps if e b ns and de b ps then du b zo if e b ns and de b pb then du b ps from these control rules the rudder angle which is a control input was determined as 31 6 using the center of gravity method for fuzzy inference mizumoto 1988 3 2 trawl gear depth control table 5 lists the distance between the trawler and fish school and the distance deviation between the trawl net depth and fish school trajectory according to the depth of the fish school the velocity of the trawler was set to 4 0 knots and the net cast velocity of the trawler was set to 2 0 m s the depth control performance can be evaluated by calculating the distance deviation between the center of the trawl net and target points p 1 and p 2 fig 6 as the target depth increases the distance variation between the net center depth and the fish school also increases this is possibly because when the depth of the target increases the warp length should increase thus amplifying the vibration on the warp trawl door float and sinker which notably increase the deviation in addition regardless of the target depth as the trawler approaches the target the distance between the net depth and target trajectory tends to increase this is possibly due to the insufficient time for the trawl gear to reach a steady position after the fishing net was cast and the warp released to solve this problem it is necessary to cast the net considering the time required for the trawl gear to settle for example consider that the distance between a trawler and a fish school is 2000 m whereas the trawler travels at a constant speed of 4 0 knots and the trawler gear is cast at sinking speed of 2 0 m s to catch the target located at the depths of 100 200 and 300 m the respective times for the trawl gear to reach its steady position are 150 340 and 430 s comparing the distances between the net center depth and target trajectory according to the fish school depths we found that the depth of the trawl gear can be controlled within 1 deviation irrespective of the fish school depths table 5 3 3 three dimensional towing trajectory control of trawl gear we conducted the trajectory control for towing the trawl gear using the fuzzy inference shown in fig 7 to simultaneously determine the trawler direction and warp length fig 8 shows the horizontal and vertical control of the trawl gear for a reference trajectory when viewed from above the trajectory of the trawl gear for the target trajectory is almost identical to the reference fig 8 a similarly when viewed from the side the depth of the trawl gear is almost identical to the reference trajectory fig 8 b after the position of the trawl gear reaches target point p 1 it is precisely controlled along the path towards target point p 2 tables 6 8 show the deviation and its rate according to the direction deviation between the trawler and target i e fish school when the depth of the target is 100 200 and 300 m respectively we set the trawler speed to 4 0 knots and the sinking speed of the trawl gear to 2 0 m s therefore the trajectory control performance for the trawl gear can be determined from the distance deviation between the trawl net center and target points p 1 and p 2 fig 6 regardless of the directional deviation between trawler and target as their distance decreases the deviation of the distance between the net depth and target trajectory tends to increase again this is possibly due to the insufficient time for the trawl gear to reach a steady position when the trawler approaches the target where the fishing net is cast and the warp released in addition regardless of the distance between trawler and target as the direction deviation between them increases the distance deviation between the net depth and target trajectory tends to increase this is possibly caused by the large rudder angle of the trawler to control its direction that notably distorts the trawl gear shape and thus there was sufficient time for the trawl gear to settle we compared the distance deviations between the net depth and target trajectory according to the target depth from the three dimensional trajectory of the trawl gear when the depths of the target were 100 200 and 300 m the three dimensional trajectory controller adjusted the distance between the center point of the trawl gear and the target trajectory within 6 7 5 5 and 3 7 respectively regardless of the direction deviation between the trawler and fish school 4 conclusion the success rate of fishing during trawl operation is mainly determined by the position of the target fish school and whether the trawl gear trajectory can be accurately predicted in water for successful trawl operation the appropriate type and suitable trawl gear considering the habitat layers of target species distribution water depth and other conditions should be determined in addition it is necessary to cast the trawl gear considering its time to reach a steady position after releasing the warp in real trawl operation this process is manually controlled according to the knowledge experience and skills of captains master fishermen and officers therefore there is an increasing demand for automation of fish scouting and trawl gear control which are currently carried out by executive crew in the trawl industry in this study we designed fuzzy control rules for the simultaneous and automatic control of the trawler direction and warp length the rules were constructed from linguistic instructions delivered by skilled captains or officers during trawling the distance deviations between the center point of the trawl gear and the target i e fish school trajectory were successfully controlled within 7 with respect to the target depth through the proposed three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear the designed control rules provide automatic adjustment of the trawler direction and warp length resembling the outcomes from trawling under the guidance skilled captains or officers in fact when the trawl gear was cast as recommended the three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear was realized with small error in future research we will apply learning techniques from artificial intelligence to determine the optimal navigation distance and direction for securing the appropriate distance from a target and casting point in addition we will explore the implementation of the designed fuzzy control rules to other trawler components such as sonar fish finder steering gear and fishing winch systems aiming to further automate trawling acknowledgement this work was supported by a grant from the national institute of fisheries science south korea r2019034

1 trawl system modeling 2 1 1 trawler model trawlers have different specifications regarding aspects such as dimension tonnage and power depending on the industry operation type and target fish species in this study we considered a 2000 ton trawler with the specifications listed in table 1 to control the trawler velocity and direction different kinetic properties can be applied according to a time constant which quantifies the response speed of a primary control system to an input specifically we consider the time constant to be the time necessary for the system response to reach 63 2 of the target output lee 2009 hence larger time constants imply longer time for a trawler to reach a target speed equation 1 describes the trawler speed according to propulsion 1 m d v t d t f p f s f g

study is illustrated in fig 1 and its specifications are listed in table 2 from the specifications we designed the gear on the simutrawl software ver 1 025 mpsl korea for simulations in addition we apply the material point method to minimize the number of simulated points to 136 for reducing computation time cha 2003 lee et al 2008 kim et al 2007 hosseini et al 2011 2 1 3 models of coupling system trawler and trawl gear a trawl system consists of coupling of the trawler which is considered as a rigid body and the trawl gear which is considered as flexible we use a mass spring model to describe the system comprising the flexible trawl gear connected to the rigid trawler in fact while a large fishing net can be towed through the seabed or midwater the trawler motion is restricted whereas the shape and behavior of the trawl gear are influenced by the waves and varying ship direction and velocity furthermore as the trawler operates under the influence of the marine environment both the trawler and trawl gear cannot be modeled as independent systems but as an interdependent system fig 2 the above mass spring model can be applied to analyze various flexible structures including trawls cha 2003 fish cages lee et al 2008 longlines lee et al 2005 and purse seines kim et al 2007 hosseini et al 2011 we provide a brief description of the model in the sequel the general equation of motion for every material point of the trawler and trawl gear can be derived from the newton s second law of motion and expressed as 5 m δ m q f i n t f e x t where m is the mass of the material point δ m is the additional mass q is the acceleration of the material point f int is the internal force between material points and f ext is the external force acting on the material point the internal force acts among material points whereas the external force acts on each material point for instance buoyancy sinking force drag and lift are internal forces acting on the trawlers and trawl gears the specific equation of motion for a trawler a trawl gear and the coupling system can be expressed as equation 6 that is a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation with respect to time t and obtained from specifying the internal and external forces in equation 1 6 m q t c q t 2 k q t f t where q t q t and q t are the position velocity and acceleration of the material point over time respectively m is the mass of the material point c is an attenuation coefficient k is the modulus of elasticity of a spring and f t represents any external forces excluding drag 2 2 controller design of trawl system 2 2 1 direction controller for trawler during trawling the success of fishing depends on the accuracy of trawl gear shooting on the target fish school identified by sonar and fish finders in this study we analyzed the target accuracy of the trawler by adopting fuzzy control rules to control the trawler direction motion of the trawler and fish school are modeled by using the right handed scheme from first person shooter games in which the trawler location is set as the origin and the target i e fish school is located at an arbitrary point the size of the fish school depends on the species water depth of habitat and marine environment in this study we considered the target trajectory which represents a fish school as a straight line along 500 m the proposed fuzzy controller calculates the control input by using error e b r between the current trawler direction and target and error variation de b r 7 e b r y b r r e f b r 8 d e b r e b r e b r 1 9 u b r u b r 1 d u b r where subscript b denotes the directional control of the trawler y b r is the current trawler direction ref b r is the target direction set at the r th sampling time and du b r is the control input variation representing the variation in rudder angle of the trawler this process is expressed as a fuzzy set with integral structure and the control input is determined at each sampling time lee et al 2001 when the fish school direction and the current trawler direction are input into the fuzzy controller the corresponding membership function is determined for the fuzzy set of input values the membership function for controlling the direction of the trawler is constructed by using five linguistic evaluations namely positive big pb positive small ps zero zo negative small ns and negative big nb fig 3 shows that error e b r between the current trawler and target directions error variation de b r and control input variation du b r can be expressed as continuous triangular membership functions control input u b r is the rudder angle of the trawler determined at each sampling time the rudder angle is set according to the experience of a captain or another skilled officer who adjusts the rudder angle to catch the target fish school during trawling to control the trawler direction we established 25 control rules as the fuzzy associative memory detailed in table 3 once the directional error between the current coordinates of the trawler and fish school and the error variation are given the control input variation is determined from inference using the control rules in fuzzy inference if the directional error is 17 and its variation is 0 3 over consecutive sampling times the following four control rules are adopted see table 3 if e b nb and de b ps then du b ns if e b nb and de b pb then du b ps if e b ns and de b ps then du b zo if e b ns and de b pb then du b ps the final value of du b can be obtained from inference based on these four rules 2 2 2 depth controller for trawl gear the trawl gear depth can be controlled through the warp length and operation speed of the fishing winch like for the trawler direction controller we designed a fuzzy depth controller that calculates the control input using error e d k between the depths of the target i e fish school and net center of the trawl gear and error variation de d k 10 e d k y d k r e f d k 11 d e d k e d k e d k 1 12 u d k u d k 1 d u d k where subscript d denotes the depth control of trawl gear y d k is the current depth of the net center ref d k is the target depth set at the th sampling time and du d k is the control input variation representing the variation in warp length this process is expressed as a fuzzy set with integral structure and the control input is determined at each sampling time lee et al 2001 when the target and current depths of the net center are input into the fuzzy controller a corresponding membership function is determined for the fuzzy set of input values the membership function for controlling the trawl gear depth is constructed by using the same linguistic evaluations for the trawler direction controller fig 4 shows that error e d k between the current net center and target depths error variation de d k and control input variation du d k can be expressed as continuous triangular membership functions the following example illustrates the control instructions that a skilled crew uses during trawling if the net depth is considerably below the fish school depth and the depth of the fish school slightly varies the warp length should be reduced this instruction can be formally expressed as the following control rule if e d pb and de d ps then du d nb specifically if e d and de d are 20 m and 0 1 m s over consecutive sampling times respectively the following four control rules are adopted see table 4 if e d ps and de d zo then du d ns if e d ps and de d ps then du d nb if e d pb and de d zo then du d ns if e d pb and de d ps then du d pb the final value of du d can be obtained from inference based on these four rules control input value u d k is the warp length determined by fuzzy inference at each sampling time if the error between the net center and fish school depths and the error variation are given then the control input variation is determined from inference using the control rules 2 2 3 three dimensional towing trajectory controller for trawl gear to control the towing trajectory of the trawl gear we devised the simultaneous trawler direction and trawl gear depth control this control strategy aims to accurately locate the trawl gear at the depth of the target location to catch the fish school in the towing trajectory controller the direction control input for the trawler is calculated from direction error e b r and error variation de b r between the current trawl gear and fish school i e target directions in addition the depth control input of the trawl gear is calculated from error e d k and error variation de d k between the net center and fish school depths then the rudder angle of the trawler u b r and the warp length u d k are used as control inputs and determined from fuzzy reasoning to perform trawler direction control and trawl gear depth control fig 5 shows the block diagram of the proposed control system for three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear for the three dimensional towing trajectory control of trawl gear illustrated in fig 6 the target trajectory represents the fish school which is at distance l from the trawler in direction θ 1 the length of the target trajectory p 1 p 2 is fixed to 500 m and distance d from the target trajectory to the cast net point p 0 can be calculated using equation 13 which considers the time for the trawl to reach a steady position 13 d α v s d v g where α is the steady state settlement coefficient of the trawl gear which depends on the size of the gear set to 3 in this study v s is the trawler velocity d is the depth of the target and v g is the sinking speed of the trawl gear after the primary target point of the trawler p s is set to be the cast net point p 0 and the trawler direction is controlled accordingly net cast is performed when the angle between the direction angle and target trajectory θ 2 is below 5 i e θ 2 5 after net casting the three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear is conducted by the trawler towards the second target point p 1 to estimate the target trajectory when the distance between the trawler and secondary target p s p 1 is below 20 m i e p s p 1 20 m the three dimensional towing trajectory of the trawl gear is controlled to target point p 2 then if the distance between the trawler and third target point p s p 2 is below 20 m i e p s p 2 20 m and thus passes the third target point the control terminates 3 results and discussion 3 1 trawler direction control fig 7 illustrates the fuzzy inference for the control input when the fish school i e target is located at 2000 m from the trawler and at 17 from the portside the trawler velocity is 4 0 knots and the error variation is 0 3 s error e b r between the current trawler direction and the fish school position is 17 and error variation d e b r is 0 3 s based on the membership functions in fig 3 and the fuzzy associative memory detailed in table 3 the following control rules were adopted if e b nb and de b ps then du b ns if e b nb and de b pb then du b ps if e b ns and de b ps then du b zo if e b ns and de b pb then du b ps from these control rules the rudder angle which is a control input was determined as 31 6 using the center of gravity method for fuzzy inference mizumoto 1988 3 2 trawl gear depth control table 5 lists the distance between the trawler and fish school and the distance deviation between the trawl net depth and fish school trajectory according to the depth of the fish school the velocity of the trawler was set to 4 0 knots and the net cast velocity of the trawler was set to 2 0 m s the depth control performance can be evaluated by calculating the distance deviation between the center of the trawl net and target points p 1 and p 2 fig 6 as the target depth increases the distance variation between the net center depth and the fish school also increases this is possibly because when the depth of the target increases the warp length should increase thus amplifying the vibration on the warp trawl door float and sinker which notably increase the deviation in addition regardless of the target depth as the trawler approaches the target the distance between the net depth and target trajectory tends to increase this is possibly due to the insufficient time for the trawl gear to reach a steady position after the fishing net was cast and the warp released to solve this problem it is necessary to cast the net considering the time required for the trawl gear to settle for example consider that the distance between a trawler and a fish school is 2000 m whereas the trawler travels at a constant speed of 4 0 knots and the trawler gear is cast at sinking speed of 2 0 m s to catch the target located at the depths of 100 200 and 300 m the respective times for the trawl gear to reach its steady position are 150 340 and 430 s comparing the distances between the net center depth and target trajectory according to the fish school depths we found that the depth of the trawl gear can be controlled within 1 deviation irrespective of the fish school depths table 5 3 3 three dimensional towing trajectory control of trawl gear we conducted the trajectory control for towing the trawl gear using the fuzzy inference shown in fig 7 to simultaneously determine the trawler direction and warp length fig 8 shows the horizontal and vertical control of the trawl gear for a reference trajectory when viewed from above the trajectory of the trawl gear for the target trajectory is almost identical to the reference fig 8 a similarly when viewed from the side the depth of the trawl gear is almost identical to the reference trajectory fig 8 b after the position of the trawl gear reaches target point p 1 it is precisely controlled along the path towards target point p 2 tables 6 8 show the deviation and its rate according to the direction deviation between the trawler and target i e fish school when the depth of the target is 100 200 and 300 m respectively we set the trawler speed to 4 0 knots and the sinking speed of the trawl gear to 2 0 m s therefore the trajectory control performance for the trawl gear can be determined from the distance deviation between the trawl net center and target points p 1 and p 2 fig 6 regardless of the directional deviation between trawler and target as their distance decreases the deviation of the distance between the net depth and target trajectory tends to increase again this is possibly due to the insufficient time for the trawl gear to reach a steady position when the trawler approaches the target where the fishing net is cast and the warp released in addition regardless of the distance between trawler and target as the direction deviation between them increases the distance deviation between the net depth and target trajectory tends to increase this is possibly caused by the large rudder angle of the trawler to control its direction that notably distorts the trawl gear shape and thus there was sufficient time for the trawl gear to settle we compared the distance deviations between the net depth and target trajectory according to the target depth from the three dimensional trajectory of the trawl gear when the depths of the target were 100 200 and 300 m the three dimensional trajectory controller adjusted the distance between the center point of the trawl gear and the target trajectory within 6 7 5 5 and 3 7 respectively regardless of the direction deviation between the trawler and fish school 4 conclusion the success rate of fishing during trawl operation is mainly determined by the position of the target fish school and whether the trawl gear trajectory can be accurately predicted in water for successful trawl operation the appropriate type and suitable trawl gear considering the habitat layers of target species distribution water depth and other conditions should be determined in addition it is necessary to cast the trawl gear considering its time to reach a steady position after releasing the warp in real trawl operation this process is manually controlled according to the knowledge experience and skills of captains master fishermen and officers therefore there is an increasing demand for automation of fish scouting and trawl gear control which are currently carried out by executive crew in the trawl industry in this study we designed fuzzy control rules for the simultaneous and automatic control of the trawler direction and warp length the rules were constructed from linguistic instructions delivered by skilled captains or officers during trawling the distance deviations between the center point of the trawl gear and the target i e fish school trajectory were successfully controlled within 7 with respect to the target depth through the proposed three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear the designed control rules provide automatic adjustment of the trawler direction and warp length resembling the outcomes from trawling under the guidance skilled captains or officers in fact when the trawl gear was cast as recommended the three dimensional towing trajectory control of the trawl gear was realized with small error in future research we will apply learning techniques from artificial intelligence to determine the optimal navigation distance and direction for securing the appropriate distance from a target and casting point in addition we will explore the implementation of the designed fuzzy control rules to other trawler components such as sonar fish finder steering gear and fishing winch systems aiming to further automate trawling acknowledgement this work was supported by a grant from the national institute of fisheries science south korea r2019034
