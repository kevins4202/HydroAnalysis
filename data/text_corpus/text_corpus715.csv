3575,vulnerability analysis is crucial to assess natural hazard risk methods for vulnerability assessment include indices as well as vulnerability curves vulnerability curves make use of empirical data to show the relationship between the process intensity and the resulting degree of loss on each affected building whereas vulnerability indices are based on a number of indicators representing building characteristics and their surroundings in the present paper damage data from two relatively recent torrential events in the european alps are used to compare results using a vulnerability curve beta model and a physical vulnerability index pvi following the application of both methods their strengths and weaknesses are outlined vulnerability curves constitute a valuable quantitative method for the assessment of physical vulnerability but in the present study they tend to overestimate damages on the other hand vulnerability indices better support the understanding of local scale damage patterns but they require detailed data and further research on weighting and indicator selection the study leads to the conclusion that both methods complement each other providing better insights into the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to torrential hazards furthermore uncertainties associated with the two approaches are related to the required data therefore a sensitivity analysis is carried out showing that process intensity is a key variable for the assessment of vulnerability whereas differences in the calculation of the degree of loss based on different building values are less important finally the paper gives clear recommendations for improved event and damage documentation and provides an outlook on future needs in vulnerability assessment including constant updating of both methods based on recent events keywords dynamic flooding vulnerability curves vulnerability indices degree of loss european alps 1 introduction mountain rivers are characterized by flow patterns with variable amounts of sediment erosion deposition and remobilisation borga et al 2014 church and jakob 2020 sturm et al 2018b that are hereinafter referred to as dynamic flooding typical hazard processes associated with dynamic flooding include fluvial sediment transport debris flows and related phenomena karagiorgos et al 2016 mazzorana et al 2014 milanesi et al 2018 slaymaker 2010 dynamic flooding events may not affect large areas the way river floods or earthquakes do but they cause significant interruption and monetary damage to households and the local community fuchs et al 2015 schlögl et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zischg et al 2018 zou et al 2018 analysis assessment and visualisation of vulnerabilities can provide the basis for the development of mitigation or adaptation strategies aiming to reduce the consequences of natural hazards physical vulnerability in particular is directly connected to monetary loss and interruptions that are in the centre of the interests of several stakeholders including governments authorities insurance companies engineers and homeowners for this reason several approaches have been developed over the years for the assessment of physical vulnerability vamvatsikos et al 2010 fuchs et al 2019b a review of methods used for the assessment of the physical vulnerability of buildings to dynamic flooding suggests that there are mainly three methods used vulnerability matrices curves or functions and indices papathoma köhle et al 2017 according to this review the most common method is the vulnerability curves built on empirical data vulnerability curves are based on the assessment of observed damage linked to underlying process intensities fuchs et al 2007 consequently vulnerability ranges from 0 no damage to 1 complete destruction they are important because they can also be used to compute the expected monetary loss of specific future scenarios and for this reason they constitute a valuable tool for planners engineers and local authorities fuchs et al 2019a sturm et al 2018a nevertheless two main drawbacks have been identified with respect to vulnerability curves firstly the spread of loss data is high so that the resulting vulnerability curves are often only used to show the expected mean loss associated with specific process intensities secondly input data are related to economic variables such as the loss and the reconstruction value of affected buildings and other characteristics of affected buildings that influence the loss are only indirectly acknowledged in the overall assessment these characteristics however play often a pivotal role in the question of whether or not damage occurs mazzorana et al 2014 sturm et al 2018a and include information on the building design and the overall location of the building towards the hazard process therefore an alternative method to assess vulnerability that considers building characteristics has been considered necessary papathoma köhle et al 2019 vulnerability indices have been presented as an alternative method fuchs et al 2019b these indices consider building characteristics and once they are identified and quantified with respect to their impact on triggering damage they can be used to assess vulnerability without requiring empirical damage data from past events papathoma köhle et al 2019 although such indices have their roots in social vulnerability assessment for an overview see e g cutter and finch 2008 fekete 2019 they also were increasingly used for the assessment of physical vulnerability however similar to the use of vulnerability curves some inherent uncertainties make their application challenging especially in data scarce regions as illustrated by malgwi et al 2020 and malgwi et al 2021 additionally these challenges are related to the lack of studies focusing on the validation of existing indices or sensitivity analysis of existing indicators chow et al 2019 agliata et al 2021 moreira et al 2021 the aim of the present paper is to close this gap and to contribute to the ongoing discussion in mountain hazard risk management starting with a current model to assess physical vulnerability using a curve beta model we present the challenges that arise when this model is applied to two recent incidents that occurred in the italian and austrian alps these events have been chosen due to the nature of the natural process dynamic flooding the similarity of the building design to the buildings that have been used for the original beta model and pvi and the data availability furthermore we apply in the same case study areas a physical vulnerability index pvi and we compare the results with the actual degree of loss in this way the predictive capacity of the vulnerability index can be assessed and its potential to supplement vulnerability curves is demonstrated additionally a sensitivity analysis is carried out so that the dependency of the overall index on the target variables becomes evident the results of the sensitivity analysis may be used to inform damage documentation practices to make them more accurate and precise the authors have used empirical data to develop the specific tools vulnerability curve and vulnerability index in previous studies fuchs et al 2019a papathoma köhle et al 2019 and this is the first time that both tools will be applied in newly derived empirical data from two recent events preliminary versions of the tools have been compared in the past papathoma köhle 2016 leaving many possibilities for further development and setting the scene for the present paper 2 methods in the following paragraphs a brief overview of the general methods used to derive a the vulnerability curve and b the vulnerability index is provided 2 1 vulnerability curves vulnerability curves are used to link the process intensity affecting a building to the degree of loss arrighi et al 2020 englhardt et al 2019 fuchs et al 2019a whereas the latter is usually expressed in terms of a quotient between the replacement value of an individual building and the loss that was reported during a specific event fuchs et al 2007 as far as the process intensity is concerned it is proxied by the deposit height this value is assessed by photographic documentation of the event or fieldwork by observing the mark of water and debris that has been left on the outside walls of a building when the building is not located on flat ground the maximum observed or average when the observations from all sides of the building are inspected deposit height is considered we use the word intensity and not magnitude because the value concerns a property of the process which is relevant to the element at risk debris height on the building envelope it is clear from the literature that there are more properties of the process that may influence its impact on a building other than the deposit height including the velocity of the flow its viscosity and impact pressure quan luna et al 2011 nevertheless these properties are usually not captured during an event by e g measurements but have to be modelled with resulting uncertainties of verification and validation respectively fuchs et al 2019b in summary the variables used for the development of the vulnerability curves include 1 the process intensity proxied by the deposit height 2 the degree of loss dol expressed as the ratio of the building value lost the degree of loss can be calculated when the following variables are known a the value of the building as the reconstruction and not the market value which may depend on other factors such as proximity to infrastructure touristic location view b the monetary damage e g the compensation that the building owner received to rebuild or the monetary loss calculated by assessing the costs of partial damages and their repair as such if the above information is available for a sufficient number of buildings a model can be used to compute the resulting vulnerability curve fuchs et al 2019a this model includes the process intensity as the explaining variable and specifically supports the computation of mean losses for buildings affected by accounting for data skewness moreover the model is an extension of classical empirical approaches that rely on a normal distribution of the degree of loss and allows for an ex ante assessment of damage once potential process intensities and the values of elements at risk are known e g the studies of cappabianca et al 2008 totschnig et al 2011 jakob et al 2012 cammerer et al 2013 totschnig and fuchs 2013 etc one of these approaches especially developed for dynamic flooding is the zero and one inflated beta regression model fuchs et al 2019a in fig 1 the model considers a large amount of data from recent events in the eastern european alps its solid predictive power warrants its application for supporting risk managers in the modelling of losses during different hazard scenarios and for different building types the model shows clearly that the loss increases with increasing process intensity proxied by deposition height the loss increases rapidly once the deposition height of 1 5 m is exceeded which can be explained by the presence of windows that allow the flow to enter the building the spread of the data for small intensities may be explained by the presence in some cases of a basement that despite the small intensity of the process increases the loss and the associated costs 2 2 the physical vulnerability index pvi the physical vulnerability index pvi for dynamic flooding has been developed based on the characteristics of buildings in the austrian alps that suffered significant damage during a dynamic flooding event in 2005 papathoma köhle et al 2019 during the development of the approach 23 indicators that were considered of being potentially important for explaining the degree of loss were collected for every building these vulnerability indicators were winnowed by applying the all relevant boruta feature selection kursa and rudnicki 2010 the initial set of indicators included wall thickness the existence of basement and basement openings surrounding vegetation ground slope natural barriers etc however the all relevant boruta feature selection revealed that only the following seven of these indicators proved to be able to explain the degree of loss the exposure of the building expressed as the water level at the location of the building ex proxied by the process intensity the vulnerability to water intrusion expressed as the number of levels affected by the flow wv the height of openings windows hop the height of the surrounding wall surwh the material of surrounding wall surwm the building row towards the flow row and the orientation of building ori the pvi was derived empirically by using the relative importance of each of the indicators as weight resulting in the following equation pvi ex 0 28 wv 0 23 hop 0 20 surwh 0 12 surwm 0 07 row 0 06 ori 0 04 1 the pvi was assigned to each building of the area under investigation and the spatial pattern of physical vulnerability was visualised in a map the pvi can form the basis for decision making as far as vulnerability reduction strategies are concerned including targeted building reinforcement planning of structural protection measures or recommending local adaptation measures the data requirements for the development of the pvi are considerably high detailed information on every building is required that in most of the cases can be acquired only following a detailed field survey nevertheless some of the necessary information may be acquired by public authorities photographic documentation or online platforms such as google maps and google street view the main uncertainties associated with the development of pvi are related to data describing the vulnerability indicators as well as challenges in assessing the relevant process intensity on each building several uncertainties are associated with the intensity of the process at least four out of seven indicators were related to the process intensity moreover by validating the method on the basis of the actual degree of loss different ways of calculating the value of buildings and consequently the degree of loss may influence the results of the validation 2 3 validation of the pvi and sensitivity analysis to assess the validity of the pvi the assigned pvi per building has been compared with the associated degree of loss which is also an important input variable for the classical vulnerability curves the degree of loss can be defined as the ratio of the building value that is lost following the impact of a natural process on a building however the degree of loss and its calculation are associated with a number of uncertainties as far as the value of the buildings is concerned it is important to clarify that this is not the market value which may fluctuate due to location view touristic attractiveness or proximity to infrastructure but the amount of money needed to reconstruct the building fuchs and mcalpin 2005 data related to the consequences descriptive or monetary of dynamic flooding events may be available by public authorities may be acquired indirectly from photographic documentation or may be provided by multiple sources leading to different results furthermore some of the indicators e g height of openings and height of the surrounding wall are directly related to the observed process intensity process intensity is often proxied by the deposition height fuchs et al 2007 totschnig and fuchs 2013 neglecting any other information on process intensities such as the flow velocity and pressure gall et al 2009 mazzorana et al 2013 milanesi et al 2018 sturm et al 2018a chow et al 2018 information regarding the process intensity is usually collected also from photographic documentation papathoma köhle et al 2012 nevertheless the assessment is not straightforward since in mountain environments buildings are often located on a slope meaning that the deposition height may vary around the building fig 2 thus the main sources of uncertainty related to the required data for the application of a pvi and the sensitivity analysis can be summarized as follows 1 uncertainties related to the assessment of the process intensity the process intensity deposition height per building is rarely quantified precisely and as such repeatedly mean or maximum values are used in most cases it is assessed from photographic documentation papathoma köhle et al 2012 totschnig et al 2011 available video documentation milanesi et al 2016 or it may be provided by modelling the process mazzorana et al 2012 quan luna et al 2011 or by civil protection authorities 2 uncertainties related to the monetary loss the monetary loss per building is often provided by the authorities compensation received per household owner but in some cases it may not reflect the actual damage see holub and fuchs 2009 and thaler et al 2018 for a discussion on loss compensation an alternative way to acquire this information is by translating the actual damage seen in the photographic documentation to monetary units knowing the size of the building and the cost of the rehabilitation works papathoma köhle et al 2012 3 uncertainties related to the value of the building the value of the building may be acquired by multiple sources including insurance companies authorities tax offices etc differences in the calculation of the price derived from the way the size of the building is conceived e g living area or total area and the unit of calculation m2 or m3 see e g papathoma köhle et al 2015 röthlisberger et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis can show how the differences in data may influence the results and consequently the reliability of the method in the following sections data from multiple sources and differences in the interpretation of photographic documentation to assess the process intensity are used as a basis for the sensitivity analysis in more detail the process intensity has been captured in two different ways a as maximum intensity meaning the maximum flow height that can be observed on the building envelope and b as mean intensity meaning the average intensity that can be observed on the building when we consider all the sides moreover the degree of loss has been calculated based on two different reconstruction value prices the first one is an approach by kranewitter 2017 providing averaged price levels for different building categories and the second one is a local approach using specific costs and price levels for each case study considered 2 4 case studies and data collection the beta model and the pvi were developed based on damage data from dynamic flooding events in austria and italy to test the predictive capacity of the methods two case studies have been chosen where recently dynamic flooding events have occurred the two case studies were dimaro 2018 trento italy and schallerbach 2015 tyrol austria 2 4 1 the rotian river event and the damages in dimaro 29 october 2018 trento italy dimaro is a small mountain village located in the autonomous province of trento in the eastern italian alps fig 3 the village covers an area of approximately 36 53 km2 and the average altitude is 766 m asl comune di dimaro folgarida 2016 according to the italian national institute of statistics istat the municipality counts 2071 inhabitants istat 2021 the village is located on the alluvial fan of the rotian river basin with a drainage area of 253 km2 and an altitude ranging between 829 and 2070 m asl during the last 150 years the area has been affected by several torrential events with two disastrous events occurring in 1882 and 1885 after the events a system of river dykes was built to prevent the inundation of the alluvial fan in the period 1973 1980 the first protection structures were planned in the headwater catchment and a system of 16 large reinforced concrete check dams was built together with retention basins later in the period 2014 2018 an open check dam was realised in the last reach of the river creek before the alluvial fan the extreme precipitation event occurring on 27 29 october 2018 triggered a sequence of three debris flows with 350 mm in 72 h the precipitation event is characterised by a return period computed based on the technique illustrated by norbiato et al 2007 exceeding 300 years in total more than 150 000 m3 of debris were deposited by the debris flows over the alluvial fan comune di dimaro folgarida 2020 the deposition zone of the debris flow encountered the western part of the settled area of dimaro causing considerable damage to the present built environment a woman got trapped in her home by the debris and lost her life and 26 buildings were damaged at various degrees about 200 people were forced to evacuate their homes comune di dimaro folgarida 2020 for the present study 24 residential buildings that have suffered damage during the dimaro event in 2018 have been identified and analysed to assess the deposition heights a significant amount of information has been collected including i photographs taken only a short time after the event ii images from google street view iii supplemented with pictures available online from local newspapers and iv also videos taken by private persons found on the video sharing platform youtube by using the set inventory of images the deposition height is derived from the evaluation of the height of the marks left by the debris and or the water on the walls of the structures this process depends on the subjective perception of the data collector to minimise a possible bias already known heights were used for comparison for instance the average height of a storey in the province of trento adds up to 2 90 m including the height of a room with 2 60 m and the thickness of the ceiling with 0 30 m this value can serve as a relevant reference point as well as the average height of the lower edge of windows with approximately 1 00 m or the mean height of balcony doors with 2 00 m the deposition heights for the 24 buildings have been estimated in two different ways as the maximum deposition height hmax and as the average deposition height haverage calculated from the maximum and minimum observed deposition height the monetary damage to each building has been assessed for every structure individually the reconstruction value of the building implies the repairing costs to rebuild or substitute the entire building and has been calculated by using given local standard prices in m2 or m3 two different locally linked pricing methods have been applied pricing method a the minimal real estate price for residential buildings was used for normal maintenance status given by the agenzia delle entrate the real estate observatory of the italian revenue agency for the location of dimaro in m2 gross area for the year 2019 the resulting building value was 1700 m2 pricing method b the standard costs for buildings in tyrol austria were used calculated after kranewitter 2017 in m2 net area the resulting building value was 1650 m2 building specific results of all calculation methods for the process intensity and the degree of loss are provided in appendix a and are used for the sensitivity analysis 2 4 2 the schallerbach torrent event and the damages in gries 08 june 2015 tyrol austria the case study area belongs administratively to the municipality of see which is situated in the paznaun valley in the austrian province of tyrol in the eastern european alps and according to statistik austria 2019 has 1197 inhabitants the river trisanna flows through the paznaun valley draining it into the river inn one of its tributaries in see is the torrent schallerbach the catchment of schallerbach has a size of 8 3 km2 and the elevation within the fan ranges from 1012 to 2936 masl on its flow length of 4 6 km the torrent has an average slope of approx 28 the steepest part with an average slope of 50 is located right above the settlement hübl et al 2016 the study area has been affected by several torrential events in the past past events in 1834 1876 1868 1919 and 1960 caused damage to farmlands small roads or bridges in 1961 the authorities started to build the first river engineering structures at the schallerbach and constructed a channel bed and a log dam with a bedload retention basin in 1961 earth dams secured by large boulders were also created to connect the concrete structures laterally with the terrain hübl et al 2016 on 8 june 2015 due to heavy rainfall a debris flow occurred directing the subsequent flow over the left earth dam leading to its collapse consequently about 90 of the discharge went down the alluvial cone into the direction of the settlement due to the collapsed earth dam the deposited sediments started to erode and three waves of fluvial sediment transport hit buildings in gries and elis leading to severe destruction the process was estimated to have a discharge of around 60 to 90 m3 s and a flow speed of 4 to 6 m s hübl et al 2016 the deposition occurred mainly on the deposition cone due to the flat terrain and the retention basin altogether around 60 000 m3 of sediments were deposited there 35 000 m3 of which were stored in the retention basin the debris flow the fluvial sediment transport and erosion resulting from the torrential event caused damage to infrastructure as well as to buildings several small roads were destroyed and federal road b 188 was temporarily closed according to the event documentation hübl et al 2016 70 houses were damaged and four were completely destroyed however a recent report claims that 45 houses were damaged whereas the damage protocols list 32 houses that suffered loss kurz and jäger 2019 the reported damage acknowledged by appraisers for private houses ins gries and elis cars excluded summed up to 6 21million for the 32 buildings for the present study 21 buildings in the district of gries that have suffered damage during the schallerbach event in 2015 have been identified and analysed the affected buildings were either residential buildings or hotels in this study however only residential buildings were considered most of them were constructed with brick masonry and the majority of the houses 16 out of 21 were constructed after 1970 the buildings were rather big for single family houses with a mean gross area of 454 m2 per building in the damage protocols there are 33 entries of damage data from houses of the study area however only 21 of those are used in this study because only for these buildings the required data were available the degree of loss was calculated using two different pricing methods pricing method a the standard costs for buildings in tyrol austria were used calculated after kranewitter 2017 in m2 net area the resulting building value was 1650 m2 pricing method b reconstruction values were calculated based on the building volume and interpolation the resulting value was 540 m3 in more detail pricing method a provided average prices for construction costs for different building types and standards these prices are given in per gross square meter and for a room height of 2 8 m furthermore it was possible to calculate the values for areas of different usage by multiplying the adapted value with different reduction factors following ranges given in kranewitter 2017 which were 40 to 70 of the adapted value for cellars garages and side buildings and 70 to 100 of the adapted value for attics the pricing method b used for the calculation was based on the building volume which was calculated based on digital elevation models a digital model of difference was calculated by subtracting the surface model dsm from the terrain model dtm dsm 2012 dtm 2012 the result was a model with the height of all filtered parts such as buildings or trees then the sum of all pixel values in the shapes of the buildings of the digital cadastral map was calculated this value provided an approximation for the building volume next the building volumes were multiplied by a price variable of 540 per cubic meter of building volume which equaled the reconstruction value the buildings were affected by maximum deposition heights ranging from 0 1 m to 3 4 m the hazard intensity was assessed in two different ways by taking the maximum deposition height hmax and the mean upslope deposition height hupmean for each building into account the maximum and mean intensity as well as the degree of loss per building calculated in two different ways for the schallerbach case study are shown in appendix b 3 results 3 1 application of the beta model the data from the two case studies are displayed together with data used in the original beta model fuchs et al 2019a in fig 4 it becomes obvious that the overall degree of loss is below a range of around 0 4 for all intensity values in both of the case studies similarly the increase of the vulnerability curve with increasing process intensities cannot be observed as clearly as in the original beta model although for low process intensities the data points are located close to the curve of the original beta model for intensities higher than 2 m the degree of loss ranges between 0 05 and 0 4 with one exception if the data of both of the case studies are regarded in relation to the original shape of the model considerable differences become evident fig 5 for both of the case studies process intensities higher than 1 m result in an underestimation of the original model fig 5 upper and lower left with a maximum around intensities of 2 5 m if the calculation is computed with mean process intensities the deviation is naturally less obvious because data get shifted to the left on the x axis with the same value of the degree of loss on the y axis fig 5 upper and lower right however for the dimaro case study an underestimation of around 10 is still detectable for process intensities higher than 1 m this provides evidence on the importance of the process intensity as an explaining variable in contrast the use of different methods to determine the degree of loss seems to have less influence on the results fig 5 upper and lower row an explanation for these results may be associated with the design and architectural characteristics of the buildings or the surroundings due to architectural or structural particularities that are not considered in the beta model these particularities may include differences in the material and design of buildings surroundings that may offer protection walls vegetation or even particularities such as balconies or other protruding parts instead the beta model mirrors the average vulnerability which has been empirically derived from the underlying case studies it is therefore crucial to include such information when we assess the physical vulnerability of the buildings hence the vulnerability index could be a promising approach and the index can be used to supplement loss information given by empirical vulnerability curves 3 2 application and sensitivity analysis of the pvi 3 2 1 application in dimaro according to equation 1 the physical vulnerability index was calculated for the 24 reviewed buildings with the subsequent results the spatial distribution of the pvi is shown in fig 6 the pvi per building is shown in appendix a the validation of the pvi in dimaro is based on the comparison between the pvi of the buildings and the observed degree of loss during the 2018 event from the distribution of the pvi it becomes evident that there is a cluster of buildings with high pvi in the east part of the village buildings with lower pvi are mostly located in the lower part of the valley and buildings with higher pvi are located in proximity to depositions of the 2018 event nevertheless some buildings located on higher ground close to the forest have a low pvi blue colour because they may also be protected by the vegetation around them in the highly exposed cluster of buildings a building with lower pvi orange colour is surrounded and probably also protected by some buildings with higher pvi red colour such so called shielding effects of buildings to neighbouring structures in mountain areas have been also recently reported from laboratory studies by sturm et al 2018a b 3 2 2 application in schallerbach the pvi has been also calculated for all the 21 damaged buildings in schallerbach and its spatial distribution is shown in fig 7 the pvi for each building is given in appendix b the spatial distribution of the pvi shows that there is a cluster of highly vulnerable buildings red colour in the centre of the case study area nevertheless buildings that had direct contact with the flowing water body belong to the second highest vulnerability class orange colour similar to the dimaro case study shielding effects resulting from a protective function of buildings closer to the process area can be observed and buildings that belong to the two lowest pvi classes seem to be protected by a cluster of buildings that are located on higher ground behind them 3 2 3 validation and sensitivity analysis the relationship between the pvi and the degree of loss is demonstrated in fig 8 by four panels the left panels show the pvi for the maximum process intensity and the right panels show the pvi for the mean intensity in all plots it becomes evident that buildings that have experienced a low degree of loss have been also assigned a very low pvi in turn with an increasing pvi the degree of loss is also increasing in all four panels which is consistent with the overall expectation similar to the vulnerability curves the key variable here is the process intensity which is also mirrored in equation 1 accordingly by a high weighting factor moreover the insignificant influence of different methods to calculate the degree of loss on the overall result is evident even though the pvi includes some information on building characteristics which renders it a useful method to complement vulnerability curves which rely on process intensity only some unobserved heterogeneities remain in fig 9 two buildings in schallerbach are shown that represent both a degree of loss of almost 1 violet squares in fig 8 these show different pvi values of 3 3 and 4 6 respectively if the maximum process intensity is considered hence information other than those considered during the calculation of the pvi e g material of construction number of floors wall thickness may also be important to gain full insight into the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed from all these observations it can be assumed that when the maximum process intensity is considered the pvi performs better than when the mean intensity is considered which is in line with the fact that the original weighting was established using maximum process intensity as a basis however as far as the degree of loss is considered the differences are minimal 4 discussion and conclusion for the assessment of physical vulnerability two different methods have been applied to two case studies vulnerability curves and vulnerability indicators the first beta model turned out to overestimate the losses in comparison to similar events that occurred in the past e g fuchs et al 2019a it is clear from fig 4 that the data from dimaro and schalerbach blue and green dots lie significantly lower than the data from past events orange dots this may be attributed to local differences in the housing which reflects on of the main disadvantages of vulnerability curves which is the lack of consideration of the characteristics of the buildings the application of the second approach pvi showed that it may be used to complement the use of vulnerability curves and provide insights on local scale damage patterns e g papathoma köhle et al 2019 for the present study a number of assumptions and limitations have to be pointed out the expression of the process intensity only by using one property deposit height of the process is one of the limitations of the study moreover detailed damage data are not always available partly due to the lack of standardised processes for their collection but also due to time limitations building owners start cleaning and repair damages right after the event finally the amount of available data is still relatively low but with ongoing updating of the database an improvement of the tools and their reliability can be expected however an overall consistency of both methods has been demonstrated leading to the conclusion that vulnerability indices such as the pvi can be used to supplement vulnerability curves during the assessment of vulnerability there was strong evidence in both methods applied that accurate and consistent information on process intensity is a key variable for the assessment of vulnerability whereas differences in the calculation of building values are less important the overall range in the data however is a result of many factors some of them have not been identified in the damage and event documentation underlying the presented case studies consequently to avoid such unobserved heterogeneities there is a strong need to expand the information collected so that the explanatory power of both vulnerability curves and indices can be enhanced specifically we propose the collection of additional information during event and loss documentation such information may include indicators related to the design and architecture of buildings holub et al 2012 schinke et al 2016 the building material and state of maintenance neubert et al 2016 available retrofitting and local structural protection attems et al 2020 rehan 2018 as well as other information on loss characteristics zischg et al 2021 in this way it is possible to update the vulnerability index but also to include local characteristics should the study area not share similar architecture with the areas used for the development of the index it has also been shown that data regarding building characteristics may be collected either through fieldwork or by using photographic documentation or even online tools such as google street map which in turn makes this method also suitable for application in data scarce regions malgwi et al 2020 the majority of the required data is straightforward e g orientation of the building building surroundings etc but some of them are related to the expected processes intensity and need therefore careful evaluation e g height of openings to conclude indicator based methods for the assessment of physical vulnerability are on the rise and can act as a good alternative to the use of vulnerability curves the application showed the reliability of the method and a sensitivity analysis provided valuable support for improved event documentation in more detail according to the results the way the reconstruction value of a building is calculated may be flexible whereas it is obvious that the consideration of the highest intensity of the process leads to more reliable results finally the consideration of additional indicators may be necessary but this requires additional data from buildings that have suffered damage from dynamic flooding tools such as the vulnerability curves and the vulnerability index should be continuously updated and improved since they provide quantitative information regarding the possible loss of future events credit authorship

3575,vulnerability analysis is crucial to assess natural hazard risk methods for vulnerability assessment include indices as well as vulnerability curves vulnerability curves make use of empirical data to show the relationship between the process intensity and the resulting degree of loss on each affected building whereas vulnerability indices are based on a number of indicators representing building characteristics and their surroundings in the present paper damage data from two relatively recent torrential events in the european alps are used to compare results using a vulnerability curve beta model and a physical vulnerability index pvi following the application of both methods their strengths and weaknesses are outlined vulnerability curves constitute a valuable quantitative method for the assessment of physical vulnerability but in the present study they tend to overestimate damages on the other hand vulnerability indices better support the understanding of local scale damage patterns but they require detailed data and further research on weighting and indicator selection the study leads to the conclusion that both methods complement each other providing better insights into the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to torrential hazards furthermore uncertainties associated with the two approaches are related to the required data therefore a sensitivity analysis is carried out showing that process intensity is a key variable for the assessment of vulnerability whereas differences in the calculation of the degree of loss based on different building values are less important finally the paper gives clear recommendations for improved event and damage documentation and provides an outlook on future needs in vulnerability assessment including constant updating of both methods based on recent events keywords dynamic flooding vulnerability curves vulnerability indices degree of loss european alps 1 introduction mountain rivers are characterized by flow patterns with variable amounts of sediment erosion deposition and remobilisation borga et al 2014 church and jakob 2020 sturm et al 2018b that are hereinafter referred to as dynamic flooding typical hazard processes associated with dynamic flooding include fluvial sediment transport debris flows and related phenomena karagiorgos et al 2016 mazzorana et al 2014 milanesi et al 2018 slaymaker 2010 dynamic flooding events may not affect large areas the way river floods or earthquakes do but they cause significant interruption and monetary damage to households and the local community fuchs et al 2015 schlögl et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zischg et al 2018 zou et al 2018 analysis assessment and visualisation of vulnerabilities can provide the basis for the development of mitigation or adaptation strategies aiming to reduce the consequences of natural hazards physical vulnerability in particular is directly connected to monetary loss and interruptions that are in the centre of the interests of several stakeholders including governments authorities insurance companies engineers and homeowners for this reason several approaches have been developed over the years for the assessment of physical vulnerability vamvatsikos et al 2010 fuchs et al 2019b a review of methods used for the assessment of the physical vulnerability of buildings to dynamic flooding suggests that there are mainly three methods used vulnerability matrices curves or functions and indices papathoma köhle et al 2017 according to this review the most common method is the vulnerability curves built on empirical data vulnerability curves are based on the assessment of observed damage linked to underlying process intensities fuchs et al 2007 consequently vulnerability ranges from 0 no damage to 1 complete destruction they are important because they can also be used to compute the expected monetary loss of specific future scenarios and for this reason they constitute a valuable tool for planners engineers and local authorities fuchs et al 2019a sturm et al 2018a nevertheless two main drawbacks have been identified with respect to vulnerability curves firstly the spread of loss data is high so that the resulting vulnerability curves are often only used to show the expected mean loss associated with specific process intensities secondly input data are related to economic variables such as the loss and the reconstruction value of affected buildings and other characteristics of affected buildings that influence the loss are only indirectly acknowledged in the overall assessment these characteristics however play often a pivotal role in the question of whether or not damage occurs mazzorana et al 2014 sturm et al 2018a and include information on the building design and the overall location of the building towards the hazard process therefore an alternative method to assess vulnerability that considers building characteristics has been considered necessary papathoma köhle et al 2019 vulnerability indices have been presented as an alternative method fuchs et al 2019b these indices consider building characteristics and once they are identified and quantified with respect to their impact on triggering damage they can be used to assess vulnerability without requiring empirical damage data from past events papathoma köhle et al 2019 although such indices have their roots in social vulnerability assessment for an overview see e g cutter and finch 2008 fekete 2019 they also were increasingly used for the assessment of physical vulnerability however similar to the use of vulnerability curves some inherent uncertainties make their application challenging especially in data scarce regions as illustrated by malgwi et al 2020 and malgwi et al 2021 additionally these challenges are related to the lack of studies focusing on the validation of existing indices or sensitivity analysis of existing indicators chow et al 2019 agliata et al 2021 moreira et al 2021 the aim of the present paper is to close this gap and to contribute to the ongoing discussion in mountain hazard risk management starting with a current model to assess physical vulnerability using a curve beta model we present the challenges that arise when this model is applied to two recent incidents that occurred in the italian and austrian alps these events have been chosen due to the nature of the natural process dynamic flooding the similarity of the building design to the buildings that have been used for the original beta model and pvi and the data availability furthermore we apply in the same case study areas a physical vulnerability index pvi and we compare the results with the actual degree of loss in this way the predictive capacity of the vulnerability index can be assessed and its potential to supplement vulnerability curves is demonstrated additionally a sensitivity analysis is carried out so that the dependency of the overall index on the target variables becomes evident the results of the sensitivity analysis may be used to inform damage documentation practices to make them more accurate and precise the authors have used empirical data to develop the specific tools vulnerability curve and vulnerability index in previous studies fuchs et al 2019a papathoma köhle et al 2019 and this is the first time that both tools will be applied in newly derived empirical data from two recent events preliminary versions of the tools have been compared in the past papathoma köhle 2016 leaving many possibilities for further development and setting the scene for the present paper 2 methods in the following paragraphs a brief overview of the general methods used to derive a the vulnerability curve and b the vulnerability index is provided 2 1 vulnerability curves vulnerability curves are used to link the process intensity affecting a building to the degree of loss arrighi et al 2020 englhardt et al 2019 fuchs et al 2019a whereas the latter is usually expressed in terms of a quotient between the replacement value of an individual building and the loss that was reported during a specific event fuchs et al 2007 as far as the process intensity is concerned it is proxied by the deposit height this value is assessed by photographic documentation of the event or fieldwork by observing the mark of water and debris that has been left on the outside walls of a building when the building is not located on flat ground the maximum observed or average when the observations from all sides of the building are inspected deposit height is considered we use the word intensity and not magnitude because the value concerns a property of the process which is relevant to the element at risk debris height on the building envelope it is clear from the literature that there are more properties of the process that may influence its impact on a building other than the deposit height including the velocity of the flow its viscosity and impact pressure quan luna et al 2011 nevertheless these properties are usually not captured during an event by e g measurements but have to be modelled with resulting uncertainties of verification and validation respectively fuchs et al 2019b in summary the variables used for the development of the vulnerability curves include 1 the process intensity proxied by the deposit height 2 the degree of loss dol expressed as the ratio of the building value lost the degree of loss can be calculated when the following variables are known a the value of the building as the reconstruction and not the market value which may depend on other factors such as proximity to infrastructure touristic location view b the monetary damage e g the compensation that the building owner received to rebuild or the monetary loss calculated by assessing the costs of partial damages and their repair as such if the above information is available for a sufficient number of buildings a model can be used to compute the resulting vulnerability curve fuchs et al 2019a this model includes the process intensity as the explaining variable and specifically supports the computation of mean losses for buildings affected by accounting for data skewness moreover the model is an extension of classical empirical approaches that rely on a normal distribution of the degree of loss and allows for an ex ante assessment of damage once potential process intensities and the values of elements at risk are known e g the studies of cappabianca et al 2008 totschnig et al 2011 jakob et al 2012 cammerer et al 2013 totschnig and fuchs 2013 etc one of these approaches especially developed for dynamic flooding is the zero and one inflated beta regression model fuchs et al 2019a in fig 1 the model considers a large amount of data from recent events in the eastern european alps its solid predictive power warrants its application for supporting risk managers in the modelling of losses during different hazard scenarios and for different building types the model shows clearly that the loss increases with increasing process intensity proxied by deposition height the loss increases rapidly once the deposition height of 1 5 m is exceeded which can be explained by the presence of windows that allow the flow to enter the building the spread of the data for small intensities may be explained by the presence in some cases of a basement that despite the small intensity of the process increases the loss and the associated costs 2 2 the physical vulnerability index pvi the physical vulnerability index pvi for dynamic flooding has been developed based on the characteristics of buildings in the austrian alps that suffered significant damage during a dynamic flooding event in 2005 papathoma köhle et al 2019 during the development of the approach 23 indicators that were considered of being potentially important for explaining the degree of loss were collected for every building these vulnerability indicators were winnowed by applying the all relevant boruta feature selection kursa and rudnicki 2010 the initial set of indicators included wall thickness the existence of basement and basement openings surrounding vegetation ground slope natural barriers etc however the all relevant boruta feature selection revealed that only the following seven of these indicators proved to be able to explain the degree of loss the exposure of the building expressed as the water level at the location of the building ex proxied by the process intensity the vulnerability to water intrusion expressed as the number of levels affected by the flow wv the height of openings windows hop the height of the surrounding wall surwh the material of surrounding wall surwm the building row towards the flow row and the orientation of building ori the pvi was derived empirically by using the relative importance of each of the indicators as weight resulting in the following equation pvi ex 0 28 wv 0 23 hop 0 20 surwh 0 12 surwm 0 07 row 0 06 ori 0 04 1 the pvi was assigned to each building of the area under investigation and the spatial pattern of physical vulnerability was visualised in a map the pvi can form the basis for decision making as far as vulnerability reduction strategies are concerned including targeted building reinforcement planning of structural protection measures or recommending local adaptation measures the data requirements for the development of the pvi are considerably high detailed information on every building is required that in most of the cases can be acquired only following a detailed field survey nevertheless some of the necessary information may be acquired by public authorities photographic documentation or online platforms such as google maps and google street view the main uncertainties associated with the development of pvi are related to data describing the vulnerability indicators as well as challenges in assessing the relevant process intensity on each building several uncertainties are associated with the intensity of the process at least four out of seven indicators were related to the process intensity moreover by validating the method on the basis of the actual degree of loss different ways of calculating the value of buildings and consequently the degree of loss may influence the results of the validation 2 3 validation of the pvi and sensitivity analysis to assess the validity of the pvi the assigned pvi per building has been compared with the associated degree of loss which is also an important input variable for the classical vulnerability curves the degree of loss can be defined as the ratio of the building value that is lost following the impact of a natural process on a building however the degree of loss and its calculation are associated with a number of uncertainties as far as the value of the buildings is concerned it is important to clarify that this is not the market value which may fluctuate due to location view touristic attractiveness or proximity to infrastructure but the amount of money needed to reconstruct the building fuchs and mcalpin 2005 data related to the consequences descriptive or monetary of dynamic flooding events may be available by public authorities may be acquired indirectly from photographic documentation or may be provided by multiple sources leading to different results furthermore some of the indicators e g height of openings and height of the surrounding wall are directly related to the observed process intensity process intensity is often proxied by the deposition height fuchs et al 2007 totschnig and fuchs 2013 neglecting any other information on process intensities such as the flow velocity and pressure gall et al 2009 mazzorana et al 2013 milanesi et al 2018 sturm et al 2018a chow et al 2018 information regarding the process intensity is usually collected also from photographic documentation papathoma köhle et al 2012 nevertheless the assessment is not straightforward since in mountain environments buildings are often located on a slope meaning that the deposition height may vary around the building fig 2 thus the main sources of uncertainty related to the required data for the application of a pvi and the sensitivity analysis can be summarized as follows 1 uncertainties related to the assessment of the process intensity the process intensity deposition height per building is rarely quantified precisely and as such repeatedly mean or maximum values are used in most cases it is assessed from photographic documentation papathoma köhle et al 2012 totschnig et al 2011 available video documentation milanesi et al 2016 or it may be provided by modelling the process mazzorana et al 2012 quan luna et al 2011 or by civil protection authorities 2 uncertainties related to the monetary loss the monetary loss per building is often provided by the authorities compensation received per household owner but in some cases it may not reflect the actual damage see holub and fuchs 2009 and thaler et al 2018 for a discussion on loss compensation an alternative way to acquire this information is by translating the actual damage seen in the photographic documentation to monetary units knowing the size of the building and the cost of the rehabilitation works papathoma köhle et al 2012 3 uncertainties related to the value of the building the value of the building may be acquired by multiple sources including insurance companies authorities tax offices etc differences in the calculation of the price derived from the way the size of the building is conceived e g living area or total area and the unit of calculation m2 or m3 see e g papathoma köhle et al 2015 röthlisberger et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis can show how the differences in data may influence the results and consequently the reliability of the method in the following sections data from multiple sources and differences in the interpretation of photographic documentation to assess the process intensity are used as a basis for the sensitivity analysis in more detail the process intensity has been captured in two different ways a as maximum intensity meaning the maximum flow height that can be observed on the building envelope and b as mean intensity meaning the average intensity that can be observed on the building when we consider all the sides moreover the degree of loss has been calculated based on two different reconstruction value prices the first one is an approach by kranewitter 2017 providing averaged price levels for different building categories and the second one is a local approach using specific costs and price levels for each case study considered 2 4 case studies and data collection the beta model and the pvi were developed based on damage data from dynamic flooding events in austria and italy to test the predictive capacity of the methods two case studies have been chosen where recently dynamic flooding events have occurred the two case studies were dimaro 2018 trento italy and schallerbach 2015 tyrol austria 2 4 1 the rotian river event and the damages in dimaro 29 october 2018 trento italy dimaro is a small mountain village located in the autonomous province of trento in the eastern italian alps fig 3 the village covers an area of approximately 36 53 km2 and the average altitude is 766 m asl comune di dimaro folgarida 2016 according to the italian national institute of statistics istat the municipality counts 2071 inhabitants istat 2021 the village is located on the alluvial fan of the rotian river basin with a drainage area of 253 km2 and an altitude ranging between 829 and 2070 m asl during the last 150 years the area has been affected by several torrential events with two disastrous events occurring in 1882 and 1885 after the events a system of river dykes was built to prevent the inundation of the alluvial fan in the period 1973 1980 the first protection structures were planned in the headwater catchment and a system of 16 large reinforced concrete check dams was built together with retention basins later in the period 2014 2018 an open check dam was realised in the last reach of the river creek before the alluvial fan the extreme precipitation event occurring on 27 29 october 2018 triggered a sequence of three debris flows with 350 mm in 72 h the precipitation event is characterised by a return period computed based on the technique illustrated by norbiato et al 2007 exceeding 300 years in total more than 150 000 m3 of debris were deposited by the debris flows over the alluvial fan comune di dimaro folgarida 2020 the deposition zone of the debris flow encountered the western part of the settled area of dimaro causing considerable damage to the present built environment a woman got trapped in her home by the debris and lost her life and 26 buildings were damaged at various degrees about 200 people were forced to evacuate their homes comune di dimaro folgarida 2020 for the present study 24 residential buildings that have suffered damage during the dimaro event in 2018 have been identified and analysed to assess the deposition heights a significant amount of information has been collected including i photographs taken only a short time after the event ii images from google street view iii supplemented with pictures available online from local newspapers and iv also videos taken by private persons found on the video sharing platform youtube by using the set inventory of images the deposition height is derived from the evaluation of the height of the marks left by the debris and or the water on the walls of the structures this process depends on the subjective perception of the data collector to minimise a possible bias already known heights were used for comparison for instance the average height of a storey in the province of trento adds up to 2 90 m including the height of a room with 2 60 m and the thickness of the ceiling with 0 30 m this value can serve as a relevant reference point as well as the average height of the lower edge of windows with approximately 1 00 m or the mean height of balcony doors with 2 00 m the deposition heights for the 24 buildings have been estimated in two different ways as the maximum deposition height hmax and as the average deposition height haverage calculated from the maximum and minimum observed deposition height the monetary damage to each building has been assessed for every structure individually the reconstruction value of the building implies the repairing costs to rebuild or substitute the entire building and has been calculated by using given local standard prices in m2 or m3 two different locally linked pricing methods have been applied pricing method a the minimal real estate price for residential buildings was used for normal maintenance status given by the agenzia delle entrate the real estate observatory of the italian revenue agency for the location of dimaro in m2 gross area for the year 2019 the resulting building value was 1700 m2 pricing method b the standard costs for buildings in tyrol austria were used calculated after kranewitter 2017 in m2 net area the resulting building value was 1650 m2 building specific results of all calculation methods for the process intensity and the degree of loss are provided in appendix a and are used for the sensitivity analysis 2 4 2 the schallerbach torrent event and the damages in gries 08 june 2015 tyrol austria the case study area belongs administratively to the municipality of see which is situated in the paznaun valley in the austrian province of tyrol in the eastern european alps and according to statistik austria 2019 has 1197 inhabitants the river trisanna flows through the paznaun valley draining it into the river inn one of its tributaries in see is the torrent schallerbach the catchment of schallerbach has a size of 8 3 km2 and the elevation within the fan ranges from 1012 to 2936 masl on its flow length of 4 6 km the torrent has an average slope of approx 28 the steepest part with an average slope of 50 is located right above the settlement hübl et al 2016 the study area has been affected by several torrential events in the past past events in 1834 1876 1868 1919 and 1960 caused damage to farmlands small roads or bridges in 1961 the authorities started to build the first river engineering structures at the schallerbach and constructed a channel bed and a log dam with a bedload retention basin in 1961 earth dams secured by large boulders were also created to connect the concrete structures laterally with the terrain hübl et al 2016 on 8 june 2015 due to heavy rainfall a debris flow occurred directing the subsequent flow over the left earth dam leading to its collapse consequently about 90 of the discharge went down the alluvial cone into the direction of the settlement due to the collapsed earth dam the deposited sediments started to erode and three waves of fluvial sediment transport hit buildings in gries and elis leading to severe destruction the process was estimated to have a discharge of around 60 to 90 m3 s and a flow speed of 4 to 6 m s hübl et al 2016 the deposition occurred mainly on the deposition cone due to the flat terrain and the retention basin altogether around 60 000 m3 of sediments were deposited there 35 000 m3 of which were stored in the retention basin the debris flow the fluvial sediment transport and erosion resulting from the torrential event caused damage to infrastructure as well as to buildings several small roads were destroyed and federal road b 188 was temporarily closed according to the event documentation hübl et al 2016 70 houses were damaged and four were completely destroyed however a recent report claims that 45 houses were damaged whereas the damage protocols list 32 houses that suffered loss kurz and jäger 2019 the reported damage acknowledged by appraisers for private houses ins gries and elis cars excluded summed up to 6 21million for the 32 buildings for the present study 21 buildings in the district of gries that have suffered damage during the schallerbach event in 2015 have been identified and analysed the affected buildings were either residential buildings or hotels in this study however only residential buildings were considered most of them were constructed with brick masonry and the majority of the houses 16 out of 21 were constructed after 1970 the buildings were rather big for single family houses with a mean gross area of 454 m2 per building in the damage protocols there are 33 entries of damage data from houses of the study area however only 21 of those are used in this study because only for these buildings the required data were available the degree of loss was calculated using two different pricing methods pricing method a the standard costs for buildings in tyrol austria were used calculated after kranewitter 2017 in m2 net area the resulting building value was 1650 m2 pricing method b reconstruction values were calculated based on the building volume and interpolation the resulting value was 540 m3 in more detail pricing method a provided average prices for construction costs for different building types and standards these prices are given in per gross square meter and for a room height of 2 8 m furthermore it was possible to calculate the values for areas of different usage by multiplying the adapted value with different reduction factors following ranges given in kranewitter 2017 which were 40 to 70 of the adapted value for cellars garages and side buildings and 70 to 100 of the adapted value for attics the pricing method b used for the calculation was based on the building volume which was calculated based on digital elevation models a digital model of difference was calculated by subtracting the surface model dsm from the terrain model dtm dsm 2012 dtm 2012 the result was a model with the height of all filtered parts such as buildings or trees then the sum of all pixel values in the shapes of the buildings of the digital cadastral map was calculated this value provided an approximation for the building volume next the building volumes were multiplied by a price variable of 540 per cubic meter of building volume which equaled the reconstruction value the buildings were affected by maximum deposition heights ranging from 0 1 m to 3 4 m the hazard intensity was assessed in two different ways by taking the maximum deposition height hmax and the mean upslope deposition height hupmean for each building into account the maximum and mean intensity as well as the degree of loss per building calculated in two different ways for the schallerbach case study are shown in appendix b 3 results 3 1 application of the beta model the data from the two case studies are displayed together with data used in the original beta model fuchs et al 2019a in fig 4 it becomes obvious that the overall degree of loss is below a range of around 0 4 for all intensity values in both of the case studies similarly the increase of the vulnerability curve with increasing process intensities cannot be observed as clearly as in the original beta model although for low process intensities the data points are located close to the curve of the original beta model for intensities higher than 2 m the degree of loss ranges between 0 05 and 0 4 with one exception if the data of both of the case studies are regarded in relation to the original shape of the model considerable differences become evident fig 5 for both of the case studies process intensities higher than 1 m result in an underestimation of the original model fig 5 upper and lower left with a maximum around intensities of 2 5 m if the calculation is computed with mean process intensities the deviation is naturally less obvious because data get shifted to the left on the x axis with the same value of the degree of loss on the y axis fig 5 upper and lower right however for the dimaro case study an underestimation of around 10 is still detectable for process intensities higher than 1 m this provides evidence on the importance of the process intensity as an explaining variable in contrast the use of different methods to determine the degree of loss seems to have less influence on the results fig 5 upper and lower row an explanation for these results may be associated with the design and architectural characteristics of the buildings or the surroundings due to architectural or structural particularities that are not considered in the beta model these particularities may include differences in the material and design of buildings surroundings that may offer protection walls vegetation or even particularities such as balconies or other protruding parts instead the beta model mirrors the average vulnerability which has been empirically derived from the underlying case studies it is therefore crucial to include such information when we assess the physical vulnerability of the buildings hence the vulnerability index could be a promising approach and the index can be used to supplement loss information given by empirical vulnerability curves 3 2 application and sensitivity analysis of the pvi 3 2 1 application in dimaro according to equation 1 the physical vulnerability index was calculated for the 24 reviewed buildings with the subsequent results the spatial distribution of the pvi is shown in fig 6 the pvi per building is shown in appendix a the validation of the pvi in dimaro is based on the comparison between the pvi of the buildings and the observed degree of loss during the 2018 event from the distribution of the pvi it becomes evident that there is a cluster of buildings with high pvi in the east part of the village buildings with lower pvi are mostly located in the lower part of the valley and buildings with higher pvi are located in proximity to depositions of the 2018 event nevertheless some buildings located on higher ground close to the forest have a low pvi blue colour because they may also be protected by the vegetation around them in the highly exposed cluster of buildings a building with lower pvi orange colour is surrounded and probably also protected by some buildings with higher pvi red colour such so called shielding effects of buildings to neighbouring structures in mountain areas have been also recently reported from laboratory studies by sturm et al 2018a b 3 2 2 application in schallerbach the pvi has been also calculated for all the 21 damaged buildings in schallerbach and its spatial distribution is shown in fig 7 the pvi for each building is given in appendix b the spatial distribution of the pvi shows that there is a cluster of highly vulnerable buildings red colour in the centre of the case study area nevertheless buildings that had direct contact with the flowing water body belong to the second highest vulnerability class orange colour similar to the dimaro case study shielding effects resulting from a protective function of buildings closer to the process area can be observed and buildings that belong to the two lowest pvi classes seem to be protected by a cluster of buildings that are located on higher ground behind them 3 2 3 validation and sensitivity analysis the relationship between the pvi and the degree of loss is demonstrated in fig 8 by four panels the left panels show the pvi for the maximum process intensity and the right panels show the pvi for the mean intensity in all plots it becomes evident that buildings that have experienced a low degree of loss have been also assigned a very low pvi in turn with an increasing pvi the degree of loss is also increasing in all four panels which is consistent with the overall expectation similar to the vulnerability curves the key variable here is the process intensity which is also mirrored in equation 1 accordingly by a high weighting factor moreover the insignificant influence of different methods to calculate the degree of loss on the overall result is evident even though the pvi includes some information on building characteristics which renders it a useful method to complement vulnerability curves which rely on process intensity only some unobserved heterogeneities remain in fig 9 two buildings in schallerbach are shown that represent both a degree of loss of almost 1 violet squares in fig 8 these show different pvi values of 3 3 and 4 6 respectively if the maximum process intensity is considered hence information other than those considered during the calculation of the pvi e g material of construction number of floors wall thickness may also be important to gain full insight into the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed from all these observations it can be assumed that when the maximum process intensity is considered the pvi performs better than when the mean intensity is considered which is in line with the fact that the original weighting was established using maximum process intensity as a basis however as far as the degree of loss is considered the differences are minimal 4 discussion and conclusion for the assessment of physical vulnerability two different methods have been applied to two case studies vulnerability curves and vulnerability indicators the first beta model turned out to overestimate the losses in comparison to similar events that occurred in the past e g fuchs et al 2019a it is clear from fig 4 that the data from dimaro and schalerbach blue and green dots lie significantly lower than the data from past events orange dots this may be attributed to local differences in the housing which reflects on of the main disadvantages of vulnerability curves which is the lack of consideration of the characteristics of the buildings the application of the second approach pvi showed that it may be used to complement the use of vulnerability curves and provide insights on local scale damage patterns e g papathoma köhle et al 2019 for the present study a number of assumptions and limitations have to be pointed out the expression of the process intensity only by using one property deposit height of the process is one of the limitations of the study moreover detailed damage data are not always available partly due to the lack of standardised processes for their collection but also due to time limitations building owners start cleaning and repair damages right after the event finally the amount of available data is still relatively low but with ongoing updating of the database an improvement of the tools and their reliability can be expected however an overall consistency of both methods has been demonstrated leading to the conclusion that vulnerability indices such as the pvi can be used to supplement vulnerability curves during the assessment of vulnerability there was strong evidence in both methods applied that accurate and consistent information on process intensity is a key variable for the assessment of vulnerability whereas differences in the calculation of building values are less important the overall range in the data however is a result of many factors some of them have not been identified in the damage and event documentation underlying the presented case studies consequently to avoid such unobserved heterogeneities there is a strong need to expand the information collected so that the explanatory power of both vulnerability curves and indices can be enhanced specifically we propose the collection of additional information during event and loss documentation such information may include indicators related to the design and architecture of buildings holub et al 2012 schinke et al 2016 the building material and state of maintenance neubert et al 2016 available retrofitting and local structural protection attems et al 2020 rehan 2018 as well as other information on loss characteristics zischg et al 2021 in this way it is possible to update the vulnerability index but also to include local characteristics should the study area not share similar architecture with the areas used for the development of the index it has also been shown that data regarding building characteristics may be collected either through fieldwork or by using photographic documentation or even online tools such as google street map which in turn makes this method also suitable for application in data scarce regions malgwi et al 2020 the majority of the required data is straightforward e g orientation of the building building surroundings etc but some of them are related to the expected processes intensity and need therefore careful evaluation e g height of openings to conclude indicator based methods for the assessment of physical vulnerability are on the rise and can act as a good alternative to the use of vulnerability curves the application showed the reliability of the method and a sensitivity analysis provided valuable support for improved event documentation in more detail according to the results the way the reconstruction value of a building is calculated may be flexible whereas it is obvious that the consideration of the highest intensity of the process leads to more reliable results finally the consideration of additional indicators may be necessary but this requires additional data from buildings that have suffered damage from dynamic flooding tools such as the vulnerability curves and the vulnerability index should be continuously updated and improved since they provide quantitative information regarding the possible loss of future events credit authorship

3576,faced with intensified climate change and ever increasing water demand the groundwater table depth is vital to sustaining terrestrial environments in a country such as china however on a regional scale insufficient research has been conducted on its variability thus far using a land model forced with reanalysis climate data this paper investigates groundwater table depth changes across china for the 1979 2018 period the results show a significant overall reduction in the groundwater table depth in china during the past 40 years without explicit consideration of direct human influence there is an approximately 0 2 m decrease on average but it is approximately 0 5 m in southern china and 0 8 m to the north of 35 n despite a 1 2 m rise in part of this region due to an increasingly wet climate and a topographic water convergence the findings provide a first order pattern of historical groundwater table responses to climate change highlighting inherent links among subsurface surface atmosphere water cycles and worsened terrestrial water availability in china a model evaluation compared with in situ observations has demonstrated the model s ability to realistically portray terrestrial water and energy balances on regional scales as well as the enhancement of their seasonality with incorporated lateral groundwater flow processes this ability gives us reasonable confidence in the simulated trends and spatial variability nonetheless the mean groundwater table still shows large biases relative to observations and the problems of human influence two way interactions between groundwater and surface water and local topographical complexity have yet to be properly addressed in the present study and deserve further research keywords groundwater table depth climate change terrestrial water cycle noah mp era5 reanalysis 1 introduction groundwater the largest available storage of freshwater on earth plays an important role in regulating the global water cycle climate and human activity amanambu et al 2020 gleick 1996 in particular by maintaining water supplies for the soil and surface water bodies shallow groundwater immediately affects regional ecosystems and environments taylor et al 2013 thus with a changing climate the groundwater response may pose far reaching impacts on our future sustainable development the groundwater table depth is a potent indicator of groundwater changes and their effects on surface water and energy processes fan et al 2013 for this reason studying groundwater table depth changes could advance our knowledge of groundwater climate change interactions and help with developing tools to forecast climate change impacts on the development of water stressed regions groundwater accounts for more than 30 of earth s freshwater groundwater exchanges water with surface water bodies and thereby sustains baseflow to rivers lakes and wetlands during dry seasons gleick 1996 globally approximately 22 32 of land area is influenced by shallow groundwater fan et al 2013 thus groundwater largely supports terrestrial ecosystems in addition by providing water for surface evapotranspiration groundwater plays a role in land atmosphere water and energy balances extending the influence on regional atmospheric processes amanambu et al 2020 in turn along with soil water groundwater can retain signals of atmospheric anomalies and feed them back to land atmosphere interaction and regional climate processes barthel and banzhaf 2016 together coupled with surface water and radiation balances and plant physiochemical processes groundwater is an essential component of the climate system and has been studied worldwide amanambu et al 2020 newman et al 2006 zeng et al 2017 across china observations have confirmed the close relationships between groundwater soil water and regional ecosystems wang et al 2013 for example during 2009 2014 the measured soil water at the 0 05 m subsurface followed closely with the fluctuations in groundwater with a mean groundwater table depth of 2 7 m in a river basin in northern china when the groundwater table remains constantly near 5 m the local ecosystems experience their best situations with the largest leaf area index when the groundwater table drops below 6 3 m through soil capillaries and plant roots the groundwater loss into the atmosphere decreases to almost zero niu et al 2016 as the groundwater table falls the degradation of vegetation ecosystems emerges in various basins fan et al 2008 thus suitable groundwater table depths maintain water movement in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and ecosystem functions in dry seasons wang et al 2018 in addition the effects of groundwater table changes on regional climate have been examined in china experiments with the regional climate model demonstrate the tight link between groundwater table dynamics and precipitation variations especially in semiarid and humid china yuan et al 2008 furthermore human activities such as water use largely amplify the effects of groundwater table changes on regional climate xie et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 given the profound associations with ecosystems climates and human activities groundwater table changes have drawn increasing attention due to the scarcity and restrictive sharing policies of observation data observation based studies mainly focus on changes at local scales for instance well observations in hebei province in northern china indicate that the mean groundwater table depth dropped from approximately 7 to 12 m during 1983 1993 and that the decline was nonuniform in the area liu et al 2001 since 2002 the launch of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites has provided a new approach for estimating groundwater changes landerer and swenson 2012 with unprecedented accuracy grace retrievals of terrestrial water storage changes are increasingly used to estimate groundwater changes chen et al 2015 again taking northern china as an example after removing soil moisture variations the grace estimate of groundwater depletion was approximately 0 2 m during 2003 2010 feng et al 2013 despite the indispensability of observations numerical models play a central part in filling data gaps and uncovering long term changes in groundwater especially on regional scales fan 2016 fan et al 2013 within climate models previous land models responsible for land hydrological processes have overlooked groundwater processes and used the free drainage bottom boundary condition dickinson et al 1986 manabe 1969 sellers et al 1986 therefore the interchanges of groundwater with soil water were ignored such schemes are physically unrealistic where and when the groundwater table is shallow to address this deficiency land models have incorporated simplified groundwater representations which describe only the vertical flow of water one such one dimensional scheme was previously used in the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 liang and xie 2001 then the lumped and unconfined scheme and simple groundwater model were developed and used in land models to achieve soil water groundwater exchanges niu et al 2007 yeh and eltahir 2005 with increasing model resolution three dimensional schemes have emerged to represent topography driven lateral flow of groundwater between model grid cells fan et al 2007 york et al 2002 and these models have also begun considering the disturbances from human activities to natural groundwater processes xie et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 as mentioned earlier observational studies and model development have established the foundation for studying groundwater changes throughout recent decades however as climate change has intensified during recent decades how groundwater changes in china remains largely unclear from the perspective of the whole country which is important from the standpoint of understanding and preparing for climate change impacts on the long term availability of regional water resources for this reason the purpose of this paper is to present an overall picture of groundwater changes driven by reanalysis climate change and variability during the past four decades in china to this end the noah multiparameterization noah mp land surface model is first evaluated using well observations of groundwater table depths across china and the effects of lateral flow representation are also assessed and compared to in situ observations in terms of water and surface radiation energy balances then the spatiotemporal changes in groundwater table depths are presented and the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the noah mp land model data and methods for data processing and analyses section 3 presents model evaluations the effects of lateral flow representation and spatiotemporal changes in groundwater table depths across china section 4 discusses the potential mechanisms of groundwater changes as well as the implications for water resource availability finally section 5 concludes this paper 2 model data and methods 2 1 representations of groundwater in the noah mp land model the noah mp land model niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 was developed based on the noah land surface model chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 mahrt and pan 1984 peterslidard et al 1997 by augmenting the alternative representations of biophysical and hydrological processes and the model thereby allows potential ensemble simulations within the same model framework in terms of the processes related to groundwater noah mp has provided five alternative schemes 1 a topography based hydrological model topmodel based scheme with a simple groundwater representation simple groundwater model simgm niu et al 2007 2 a topmodel based scheme with an equilibrium groundwater table process niu et al 2005 3 an original runoff scheme of free drainage 4 the biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme bats runoff scheme of free drainage and 5 a land ecosystem atmosphere feedback leaf model based groundwater scheme with a lateral flow process fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 the simgm referred to as r1 a representation of the scheme for brevity adds an unconfined aquifer below the soil to represent the recharge and discharge processes of terrestrial water storage within the land model as fig 1 in niu et al 2007 1 δ w a q r sb where δwa is the temporal variation in groundwater q is the recharge rate and rsb is the subsurface runoff the recharge rate q is positive as water enters the aquifer and is formulated by darcy s law as follows 2 q k bot z f mic ψ bot z bot z z bot where z is the depth to the groundwater table ψbot and kbot are the matric potential and hydraulic conductivity of the bottom soil layer respectively zbot is the node depth of the bottom layer and fmic is a factor representing the micropore fraction in the bottom layer soil which is introduced to modulate the upward water flow compared with the grace terrestrial water storage change data tapley et al 2004 the variations in modeled groundwater table depths agree well with the observations on various spatial scales the comparisons of soil moisture and evapotranspiration simulations by the r1 groundwater scheme to those by the equilibrium groundwater table and free drainage schemes further show substantial improvements in terrestrial water and energy balances cai et al 2014 liang et al 2019 niu et al 2007 yang et al 2011 to consider the effects of lateral flow on the variations in groundwater a leaf based groundwater scheme with a lateral flow process as well as water exchanges with rivers referred to as the r5 scheme was incorporated in the noah mp model the soil column is extended to the depth of the groundwater table by adding a variable thickness soil layer below the soil column as the groundwater table below the depth of the soil column the variation in groundwater storage δ w a in a grid cell of size δx by δy is formulated as follows 3 δ w a δ x δ y r q r 1 8 q n where r is the flux between the unsaturated soil and the groundwater or net recharge qr is the water exchange between the groundwater and rivers and qn is lateral flow to or from the nth neighbor grid cell to equate the chance of flow in all directions from a grid cell the square grid cells were replaced with octagons of the same areas as r5 to compute the lateral flow of groundwater the flux r is calculated with darcy s law using the groundwater table as the bottom boundary condition the groundwater river water exchange qr behaves in two ways groundwater flowing into rivers or vice versa depending on the elevation reference between the groundwater table and riverbed the water exchanges are calculated in accordance with darcy s law the lateral flow of groundwater qn between the center grid cell and the nth neighboring grid cell is calculated as follows 4 q n w t h h n l where w is the width of the grid cell interface t is the transmissivity h is the groundwater table head hn is the head in the nth adjacent cell and l is the distance between the centers of the two cells here for the octagon grid cells w and l are expressed as 5 w δ x 0 5 t a n π 8 l δ x 2 regarding the flow transmissivity t two cases are considered namely groundwater above or below the 1 5 m depth because of the availability of the soil data fan et al 2007 in the case of a groundwater table above 1 5 m the transmissivity is 6 t t 1 t 2 7 t 1 k m δ z m 8 t 2 k 0 f where m indicates the number of soil layers between the groundwater table and the 1 5 m depth and k is the hydraulic conductivity which decays exponentially with depth as follows 9 k k 0 exp z f where k0 is the value at the bottom layer of the 1 5 m depth zʹ is the depth below 1 5 m and f is an e folding length fan et al 2007 in the case of groundwater below the 1 5 m depth 10 t 2 k 0 f e x p z h 1 5 f where the groundwater table is at a depth of z h 1 5 m and z is the elevation of the land surface in the center grid cell the abovementioned representations and their numerical implementations in models are discussed in detail in the literature fan et al 2007 miguez macho and fan 2012 with the r5 scheme incorporated the noah mp model achieves an extension of the soil column below the groundwater table which takes the role of the saturated boundary condition for soil moisture and exchanges water with the soil layer above and enables the lateral flow of groundwater driven by topography 2 2 reanalysis climate forcing and groundwater simulation configuration to simulate groundwater variations across china the fifth generation reanalysis product of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 hersbach et al 2020 was used as the climate forcings for the noah mp land model the hourly forcing datasets include wind speed air temperature shortwave and longwave radiation precipitation specific humidity surface pressure a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 and time for the 1979 2018 period the parameterization configuration for simulating groundwater with the noah mp model is shown in table 1 according to the evaluations of previous ensemble simulations with multiparameterization options cai et al 2014 liang et al 2019 mocko et al 2021 yang et al 2011 the soil in the noah mp model was defined with four layers of thickness 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m which is the same as in niu et al 2011 and yang et al 2011 the equilibrium groundwater table depths for the r5 scheme were initialized with observation constrained simulations fan et al 2013 and observation based estimations of bedrock depths wei et al 2017 to test the effects of the r5 scheme with the lateral flow of groundwater on the modeled groundwater variations another simulation was conducted with identical forcings and configurations but the r1 groundwater scheme without the lateral flow process since the incorporation of the r1 scheme considerably improved the adequacy of surface water and energy processes in the noah mp model cai et al 2014 liang et al 2019 yang et al 2011 the simulations were run repeatedly for 1979 until groundwater reached equilibrium the difference between two year simulations 0 001 times of the simulation for previous year according to the constraint by yang et al 1995 and cai et al 2014 then it was run continuously for 1979 2018 with hourly forcings 2 3 observations of groundwater table depth soil moisture and sensible and latent heat fluxes the observations of groundwater table depths used to evaluate simulations were taken from the geological environmental monitoring of groundwater level yearbooks of china released by the china institute of geological environmental monitoring over the period from 2005 to 2016 lv et al 2021 the dataset consists of records from 906 monitoring wells across china after data quality control including 858 wells with more than 30 records at different times meeting the statistical requirements of the large sample theory and 167 wells with complete monthly records during the entire period see fig 1 for the geographical distribution to assess the continuous spatial construction of modeled groundwater table variability terrestrial water storage tws anomalies of grace tapley et al 2004 were also used in this study since the launch of grace in 2002 the retrieval algorithms of tws have been continuously improved and save et al 2016 developed a mascon solution with time variable regularization purely derived from grace information the resulting tws anomaly dataset has no north south stripe errors and can be used without further postprocessing the dataset was resampled onto a 0 5 0 5 equiangular grid covering 2002 2016 http www csr utexas edu grace compared with spherical harmonic solutions their applicability is considerably enhanced in terrestrial hydrological investigations save et al 2016 for a detailed grace related technical description the readers are referred to save et al 2016 and the references therein soil moisture observations from the china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjcx were released in the form of relative humidity the percentage of moisture content to the field capacity based on measurements by the oven drying method routine measurements were conducted on the 8th 18th and 28th days of every month excluding rainy days and frozen periods during 1991 2013 according to the completeness of records measurements at 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m were used in the present study the 0 0 4 m soil moisture values were yielded by interpolating the three layer data with weights of the soil layer thicknesses to compare with the model soil moisture mean in the upper two layers 0 0 4 m for the sake of the unavailability of in situ field capacity measurements for those sites the comparisons in section 3 were based on the normalized soil moisture the in situ observations of sensible and latent heat fluxes were taken from two observational networks 1 the chinese flux observation and research network fluxchina conducted flux observations with the eddy covariance method yu et al 2006 after data quality control and postprocessing these measured values can be comparable to the other records from international fluxnet sites yu et al 2006 in the present study publicly available observations for only 9 sites for the 2003 2010 period were used 2 the land atmosphere interaction observation network on the tibetan plateau a high elevation and cold region observation network also performed observations with the eddy covariance method ma et al 2020 the hourly records are available at six sites during 2005 2016 their monthly mean dataset was used in this research the details of the sites are listed in table 2 the dataset was provided by the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn 2 4 methods for data processing and statistics for evaluations and analyses given that in situ observations of groundwater table depths soil moisture and sensible and latent heat fluxes cover various periods with different sites across china to retain their spatiotemporal signature the time series comparisons in section 3 were conducted using the all record integrated data the full set of in situ records was averaged across all sites along their time axes throughout the entire period as were the simulations at the corresponding grid cells in which the observational sites were located the resulting time series may not fully represent the real dynamic of the regional mean of the variable however as a subset of real climate samples it is fairer and more robust to assess the consistency between observations and simulations by taking more spatiotemporal information into account linear trend analyses were conducted using ordinary least squares linear regression the trend coefficients were tested using a t test with the t statistic formulated as follows 11 t r n 2 1 r 2 12 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient n is the sample size and xi and yi are the observation and model output time series with corresponding means of x and y respectively then the probability value p is estimated using a t distribution with n 2 degrees of freedom the trend coefficient is statistically significant as p is less than the specific significance level e g 0 05 the pearson correlation coefficients equation 12 were tested using the same method the significance of the differences between the r5 and r1simulations was tested using the paired sample t test at the p 0 05 level the standard deviations sds were estimated using the following formula 13 sd i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 3 results 3 1 evaluations of groundwater table depth wtd simulations to test the simulations of groundwater table variability by the r5 scheme with lateral flow across china comparisons with in situ observations and grace retrievals were conducted the long term 2005 2016 monthly mean shows that wtds deepen gradually from near the land surface in humid southeastern china to more than 10 m in arid northwestern china fig 1a in alignment with the wet dry gradient of climate moreover driven by topography groundwater converges to lowland areas forming contrasting shallow or deep groundwater tables especially in mountainous regions in comparison with observations fig 1b simulations capture the spatial pattern of the wtd gradient on average despite large shallower biases with 15 7 m as the mean of 906 wells and 2 5 m for the grid cell mean in terms of linear trends over the same period the simulations fig 1c show significant changes in depths across china characterized by rises in southeastern and northeastern china and falls in southwestern northern and northwestern china along with the opposite trends in parts of the respective regions compared with the 167 well observations with complete monthly records for the 2005 2016 period fig 1d the simulations precisely reproduce the opposite trends along 35 north latitude which are downward in the north and upward in the south likewise the tripolar structure visible in grace fig 1e in eastern china is reasonably regenerated in western china however another opposite tripolar structure is not clearly visible for the increasing trends in the simulations along the southwestern periphery of the tibetan plateau at the local scale between time series of 858 wells and corresponding grid cells the correlation coefficients fig 2 a are of significance p 0 05 across 58 wells including 21 of coefficients larger than 0 5 in contrast another 10 of significant coefficients are negative because of the advanced response time of simulations with much shallower mean groundwater tables to climate forcing than that of observations the spatial distribution of the significant correlations covers all parts of the regions where the observations were conducted to minimize the effects of spatial mismatch between in situ measurements and model grid cell means the time series were integrated across all 906 wells and responding grid cells during 2005 2016 fig 2b then through normalization their temporal variability was highlighted further the monthly series showed a correlation with a coefficient of 0 58 which was significant at the p 0 01 level the simulations are in good agreement with both annual cycles and strong fluctuations of the observations furthermore simulations capture the long term decreasing trend in the observations according to linear regressions albeit much smaller in simulations due to the intensified rise in 2016 note that the ranges of spatial dependence of in situ measurements satellite based retrievals and model grid cell means are largely inconsistent the direct anthropogenic effects on groundwater variability contained in the observations are hardly taken into account in the simulations in this study 3 2 groundwater table depth variability over 1979 2018 3 2 1 means trends and variances during 1979 2018 the mean groundwater table depths show a similar spatial structure to that over 2005 2016 fig 3 a fig 1a but deeper depths overall according to the standard deviations fig 3b the variations in wtds are strong in humid southeastern china consistent with those of surface water balances figure not shown strong variations also appear across dry northern china largely following groundwater convergence driven by topography otherwise groundwater table depths show less variation with deepened mean depths there are few variations in extremely arid humid regions such as parts of northwestern and southwestern china regarding long term trends during the past 40 years 1979 2018 the linear trends show significant changes across most regions in china fig 3c characterized by nationwide decreases along with increases in small western areas with the intensified topographic drivers in the west on top of climatic drivers the linear trends clearly increase in the northwest in relation to the southeast during the last 19 years 2000 2018 with intensified climate change shi et al 2019 the regions with significant rising trends expanded not only in western but also east of china the two opposite tripolar structures observed via grace over 2005 2016 fig 1e started emerging in particular the remarkable decreases in the central part of northern china are consistent with the continuously decreasing precipitation and soil moisture li et al 2020 the opposite trends between north and south china are also in phase with the north south dipole pattern of annual precipitation across these regions yang et al 2017 the time series of regional mean depths fig 4 shows that the overall wtd in china decreased by approximately 0 2 m during 1979 2018 according to ordinary least squares linear regression p 0 01 moreover in northern china north of 35 n the wtd decreased increased by 0 8 1 2 m in regions with significant negative positive trends in southern china south of 35 n and east of 100 e the wtd decreased by 0 5 m over the same period the mean depths over the four regions china as a whole north china with negative and positive trend areas and south china with negative trend area are 5 0 3 6 6 1 and 1 6 m in turn in addition to the long term trends wtds display decadal changes in approximately 1990 2000 and 2010 especially in negative trend regions according to the mann kendall test statistics wtds experience significant abrupt changes in the period figures not shown and these changes occur in 1996 across the negative trending southern and northern china and overall in china while those changes lag until 2001 in positive trending regions of northern china moreover the monthly fluctuations decrease with increasing groundwater table depth with a standard deviation of 0 3 m after its trend is removed in southern china and 0 1 m in northern china 3 2 2 seasonality of long term trends the seasonality of wtd variability is largely detectable across china according to the linear trends during 1979 2018 fig 5 although it is negligible with respect to climatological means figures not shown the clearest seasonality appears in southeastern china the falling trends close to 1 m during 1979 2018 of groundwater tables in spring cover the largest area in this region mam from march to may and the area with significant trends p 0 05 contracts to the smallest in summer jja from june to august with the advent of summer monsoon rainfalls ding 1992 in autumn son from september to november the rising trends expand especially in the eastern part despite intensified falling trends in the western part of this region the rising trends expand to the maximum area in winter djf from december to february however they remain nonsignificant p 0 05 across the other parts of china the seasonal changes in the spatial patterns of linear trends are not clear nevertheless groundwater tables tend to rise during summer and autumn in the regions with small groundwater table depths with the intensified variations in wtds after 2000 figs 3 and 4 the regions with increasing trends expand considerably however the seasonal changes in the linear trends of wtds figures not shown are still mainly present in southeastern china the area of increasing trends that emerge in summer increases significantly p 0 05 in autumn in parts of this region in winter increasing trends occur widely along the southeastern coast overall the seasonality of wtds manifests mainly in the regions with small 3 m fig 3 groundwater table depths 3 3 groundwater table depth differences between the two groundwater schemes to examine the uncertainties in wtd changes caused by the groundwater schemes in the land model the simulations by the r5 scheme with the lateral flow process were compared to those by the r1 scheme without the lateral flow process for means and linear trends over 1979 2018 their differences fig 6 show that the spatial patterns simulated by the two schemes are generally similar to each other and reasonably in agreement with those of observations figs 1 and 2 between the two scheme simulated means the differences are clearly characterized by spatial contrast fig 6e there are much deeper groundwater tables greater than7 m by the r5 scheme in dry northwestern china than by the r1 scheme but significantly shallower approximately 1 m tables in humid southeastern china the differences tend to be smaller in the transition zone between dry and wet climates however such a spatial contrast is not manifested in the pattern of their linear trend differences fig 6f due to the much weaker trends in r1 simulations in relation to those by both the r5 and in situ observations fig 1d the large differences between linear trends in wtds by the r5 and r1 schemes are associated with the lateral flow process as well as their definitions of aquafers and are discussed further in section 4 compared with the in situ wtd observations from 858 wells fig 2a the number of significant correlation coefficients p 0 05 various degrees of freedom of the r5 simulations increases by 3 percentage points 59 in relation to those of the r1 simulations 56 the integrated monthly time series of 906 wells fig 1b and corresponding grid cells show considerable differences especially deeper biases in the minimum depths of both simulations despite better performance in r5 simulations fig 7 during 2005 2016 in comparison with observations the correlation of r5 simulations reaches 0 58 p 0 01 which is larger than that of r1 simulations 0 51 because of the improved minima in r5 simulations both linear trends show the same sign as the observational decreasing trend but with less intensity in terms of annual cycles r5 simulations improve the mean amplitude relative to that of r1 simulations especially during the deeper groundwater table months however they both advance the extremes a month for their respective smaller mean depths 3 4 effects of groundwater table depth differences on surface processes 3 4 1 effects on surface water balance soil moisture given the significant differences in wtd simulations caused by the schemes to understand their influence on surface water and energy balances soil moisture and upward energy fluxes were compared between r5 and r1 simulations for soil moisture during 1991 2013 the mean differences fig 8 a b show that the r5 simulations are generally wetter than those by the r1 scheme especially across the regions with shallower groundwater tables and in the lower soil layer 1 2 m the increases in soil moisture are significant p 0 05 across the semiarid and subhumid regions strong increases greater than0 05 m3 m 3 tend to appear in mountainous areas where groundwater tables are shallower in r5 simulations owing to lateral groundwater flow driven by topography moreover in r5 simulations in northern china with deeper groundwater tables soil moisture is generally drier albeit nonsignificant relative to r1 simulations with respect to 808 site observations the number of significant correlation coefficients p 0 05 of r5 simulations increases one percentage point relative to those of r1 simulations fig 8 c d and correspondingly the number increases up to three points for coefficients larger than 0 5 across these sites there are 141 sites in which the coefficients of the r5 simulations are larger than those of the r1 simulations although another 90 sites show weaker correlations compared with the integrated observations fig 9 the r5 simulations show an enhancement of soil moisture relative to r1 simulations with a larger correlation coefficient of 0 76 0 66 for the r1 simulation both have p values 0 01 despite normalized soil moisture due to the unavailable measurements of field capacity they still show that the r5 scheme ameliorates the simulations of wet end soil moisture the annual cycles which might not actually present annual variations in regional soil moisture because of the data from various observational times and sites display that r5 simulations more precisely capture the timing of minimum soil moisture and substantially depress the summer bias 3 4 2 effects on the surface energy balance sensible and latent heat fluxes to examine the effects of groundwater schemes on surface energy balance simulations comparisons were performed for sensible and latent fluxes along with the ground heat flux and bowen ratio between r5 and r1 simulations in the context of in situ observations during 2003 2016 fig 10 the differences show that r5 sensible heat fluxes decrease significantly p 0 05 with maximum decreases close to 15 w m 2 in southeastern china in response to the increases in latent heat fluxes for the increased evapotranspiration available soil water fig 8 moreover the ground heat fluxes increase in humid southeastern china but decrease significantly on the tibetan plateau the partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes namely bowen ratios changes greatly in northern china resulting from the large bowen ratios in these regions overall due to the increased soil moisture in the r5 simulation its energy partitioning transitions to increasing latent heat fluxes in most regions compared with the r1 simulation during the period of 2003 2016 in comparison with the in situ observations of surface energy fluxes across china fig 11 a both latent heat flux simulations are larger than observations approximately 30 on average and r5 simulations are larger than those by r1 simulations the two sensible heat fluxes on the tibetan plateau are also larger than the observations 50 nevertheless r5 simulations capture the peak value of the latent heat flux in july in eastern china and decrease the sensible heat flux closer to observations in both observational networks the larger total fluxes relative to observations fig 11b d may be associated with the ground heat flux partitioning and the incident radiation energy in era5 forcing fields requiring more observations for further investigations 4 discussion driven by climate and topography groundwater table depths across china changed significantly during the past 40 years 1979 2018 with a decrease of approximately 0 2 m on average despite regional increases in northwestern china and on the tibetan plateau the spatial pattern of wtd trends is largely consistent with that of terrestrial water availability in the era5 reanalysis precipitation minus evapotranspiration figure not shown which generally decreases in most of china but increases on the tibetan plateau previous studies indicate that northwestern china has become wetter during the past decades as has soil moisture li and ma 2015 li and ma 2018 peng and zhou 2017 the wetter climate provides water for groundwater convergence by topography on the other hand the increased actual and potential evapotranspiration especially since the 1990 s li et al 2013 su et al 2021 and decreased groundwater recharge with a warming climate reinecke et al 2021 balance the increased precipitation and result in a general decrease in groundwater tables across this region in addition due to the relatively coarse model resolution 0 25 0 25 strong trends appear mainly in the northwestern mountainous regions where climate fueled groundwater changes are amplified by topography driven lateral flow across southern china because of shallow groundwater table depths 1 6 m on average their large annual variations point to enhanced control from climate factors annual variations in precipitation minus evapotranspiration mohan et al 2018 while the effects of annual climate variations in northern china are buffered by the deep groundwater tables in comparison with well observations the simulated groundwater tables are much shallower on average likely for the following reasons first the coarse model resolution in the present study makes the model grid averaged groundwater table much shallower than that measured at well sites because of the steep gradient of the groundwater table with topography fan et al 2013 second groundwater extraction renders a deeper groundwater table than that regulated by only climate and topography due to the lack of explicit representations of human water extraction in the model third in theory groundwater lateral flow qn largely determines deviations of the groundwater table from equilibrium depths equation 4 indicates that the groundwater table head difference between two grids is proportional to qn coarse resolutions tend to reduce head differences and thus reduce qn and favor a rising groundwater table another parameter hydraulic conductivity still lacks observations and the assumption of its uniform decay rate with depth in all aquifers likely leads to biases however model experiments are required to quantitatively elucidate the influence fan et al 2013 fan et al 2007 moreover the equilibrium groundwater table depths initialized in r5 scheme are still subject to large uncertainties because of the scarcity of observational studies fan et al 2013 wei et al 2017 in addition the long term trends of the groundwater table are overall weaker than those of observations in eastern china which has a dense population and a large area of irrigated croplands liu et al 2018 in addition to climate regulated changes in groundwater human influence could amplify the changes in dry years the groundwater table declines on the other hand water extraction increases which intensifies the decline in the groundwater table conversely in wet years decreased water extraction favors groundwater restoration dominated by water replenishment from precipitation the amplified variations partly account for the lower intensity of the simulated trends however for the in phase effects of climate and human drivers the amplified groundwater variations are easier to capture by models even without explicit representations of human activities for example across the well sites with falling groundwater table trends the trend and correlation are both in better agreement between the observations and simulations fig 12 a in contrast over the period of rising groundwater tables driven by natural factors dominantly with less human effects the large observation simulation differences in mean groundwater tables lead to out of phase dynamics of groundwater table depths between observations and simulations and thus weaken the correlation fig 12b the smaller annual variations in normalized simulations are mainly caused by large trends in observations in addition the large differences between linear trends in wtds by the two schemes fig 6f highlight the substantially enhanced trends of the r5 scheme despite being remarkably smaller than those in the observations fig 1d the r5 scheme by adding a soil layer of variable thickness uses soil pore space above the present water table to update the water table depth fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 by contrast the r1 scheme defines an aquifer below the model soil column and use a constant specific yield 0 2 in the regional simulation to convert groundwater recharge into water table depth niu et al 2007 the soil pore space is associated with soil types and together with groundwater lateral flow processes aids in enhancing water table dynamics nevertheless more modeling experiments are required to understand these discrepancies importantly in addition to the above mentioned factors that lead to biases in model groundwater tables the absence of representations of human activities in the model may account for large regional biases in groundwater tables for example in north china the grace based studies show a substantial role of irrigational water use in groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 feng et al 2018 the south to north water diversion in beijing exerts a larger effect on groundwater than that by precipitation change and irrigation water use during 2006 2018 long et al 2020 in the mu us sandyland of northern china ecological restoration dominates the observed groundwater depletion over 2003 2016 zhao et al 2021 these human activities produce more decisive effects than climate does on the regional changes in groundwater table depths nevertheless in this study the land model neglects direct human disturbance and captures only the coarse scale and climate driven pattern of groundwater table changes across china during the past four decades this effort provides first order knowledge of the groundwater response to climate change or climate change impacts on groundwater regarding model evaluations and groundwater scheme comparisons note that in situ observations of terrestrial water and energy process variables indicate their point scale variations namely with limited spatial representativeness especially where mountainous topographic gradients dominate the patterns of the groundwater table fan et al 2013 more importantly those observations are influenced to various degrees by human activities in china such as water diversion extraction and irrigation accordingly the regionally synthesized signal of in situ observations is inherently more consistent with that of model simulations e g fig 2 the enhanced groundwater table and lateral flow processes facilitate advancements in the seasonality of soil moisture and surface energy balances in the model which is consistent with previous studies in various regions cai et al 2014 chang et al 2020 niu et al 2007 regarding the runoff effects of groundwater table changes increases in mean runoff simulated with the r5 scheme appear in wet southeastern china but decreases appear in dry northwestern china in comparison with the simulations using the r1 scheme during 1979 2018 figures not shown however the changes require further assessment to explain for the differences between the two schemes depending on the availability of streamflow measurements for main rivers across wet dry climates in china 5 conclusion groundwater tables are fundamentally important for the environment human habitats and sustainable development they are particularly important in arid and semiarid regions the present study examined groundwater table depth changes with a changing climate in china during the past 40 years 1979 2018 using the noah mp land model forced with era5 reanalysis climate data the groundwater table depths in china changed significantly overall characterized by decreases in most of the region except parts of northwestern china under a changing climate aided by large scale topography there is evidence of seasonal changes in southeastern china where groundwater tables are shallow although decadal fluctuations occurred in most parts of china the long term trends dominated the overall changes in groundwater table depths quantitively there was an approximately 0 2 m decrease on average but it was approximately 0 5 m in southern china and 0 8 m north of 35 n despite a 1 2 m rise in part of this region due to an increasingly wet climate and topographic water convergence these findings highlight the extensive impacts of global warming on terrestrial water cycles and water resources in addition to the usually obvious surface climate and extreme weather changes in groundwater may be well removed from our everyday life but the influence of groundwater changes will be hidden and long lasting these changes will in the longer term put constraints on economic development and survival a model evaluation compared with in situ observations provided reasonable confidence in the simulated trends and variability for the study period the model used was capable of portraying terrestrial water cycles and energy balances on regional scales the inclusion of the lateral flow process of groundwater helped to capture the seasonality of surface water and energy balances it is also noted here that the current simulations have neglected direct human influence and two way interactions between groundwater and surface water and the relatively coarse model resolution would not allow us to resolve the detailed effects of topographical complexity the simulations have captured only the large scale and natural variability of groundwater table depths with the mean groundwater table still strongly biased from observations these problems along with the effects of groundwater table changes on runoff will be addressed in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

3576,faced with intensified climate change and ever increasing water demand the groundwater table depth is vital to sustaining terrestrial environments in a country such as china however on a regional scale insufficient research has been conducted on its variability thus far using a land model forced with reanalysis climate data this paper investigates groundwater table depth changes across china for the 1979 2018 period the results show a significant overall reduction in the groundwater table depth in china during the past 40 years without explicit consideration of direct human influence there is an approximately 0 2 m decrease on average but it is approximately 0 5 m in southern china and 0 8 m to the north of 35 n despite a 1 2 m rise in part of this region due to an increasingly wet climate and a topographic water convergence the findings provide a first order pattern of historical groundwater table responses to climate change highlighting inherent links among subsurface surface atmosphere water cycles and worsened terrestrial water availability in china a model evaluation compared with in situ observations has demonstrated the model s ability to realistically portray terrestrial water and energy balances on regional scales as well as the enhancement of their seasonality with incorporated lateral groundwater flow processes this ability gives us reasonable confidence in the simulated trends and spatial variability nonetheless the mean groundwater table still shows large biases relative to observations and the problems of human influence two way interactions between groundwater and surface water and local topographical complexity have yet to be properly addressed in the present study and deserve further research keywords groundwater table depth climate change terrestrial water cycle noah mp era5 reanalysis 1 introduction groundwater the largest available storage of freshwater on earth plays an important role in regulating the global water cycle climate and human activity amanambu et al 2020 gleick 1996 in particular by maintaining water supplies for the soil and surface water bodies shallow groundwater immediately affects regional ecosystems and environments taylor et al 2013 thus with a changing climate the groundwater response may pose far reaching impacts on our future sustainable development the groundwater table depth is a potent indicator of groundwater changes and their effects on surface water and energy processes fan et al 2013 for this reason studying groundwater table depth changes could advance our knowledge of groundwater climate change interactions and help with developing tools to forecast climate change impacts on the development of water stressed regions groundwater accounts for more than 30 of earth s freshwater groundwater exchanges water with surface water bodies and thereby sustains baseflow to rivers lakes and wetlands during dry seasons gleick 1996 globally approximately 22 32 of land area is influenced by shallow groundwater fan et al 2013 thus groundwater largely supports terrestrial ecosystems in addition by providing water for surface evapotranspiration groundwater plays a role in land atmosphere water and energy balances extending the influence on regional atmospheric processes amanambu et al 2020 in turn along with soil water groundwater can retain signals of atmospheric anomalies and feed them back to land atmosphere interaction and regional climate processes barthel and banzhaf 2016 together coupled with surface water and radiation balances and plant physiochemical processes groundwater is an essential component of the climate system and has been studied worldwide amanambu et al 2020 newman et al 2006 zeng et al 2017 across china observations have confirmed the close relationships between groundwater soil water and regional ecosystems wang et al 2013 for example during 2009 2014 the measured soil water at the 0 05 m subsurface followed closely with the fluctuations in groundwater with a mean groundwater table depth of 2 7 m in a river basin in northern china when the groundwater table remains constantly near 5 m the local ecosystems experience their best situations with the largest leaf area index when the groundwater table drops below 6 3 m through soil capillaries and plant roots the groundwater loss into the atmosphere decreases to almost zero niu et al 2016 as the groundwater table falls the degradation of vegetation ecosystems emerges in various basins fan et al 2008 thus suitable groundwater table depths maintain water movement in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and ecosystem functions in dry seasons wang et al 2018 in addition the effects of groundwater table changes on regional climate have been examined in china experiments with the regional climate model demonstrate the tight link between groundwater table dynamics and precipitation variations especially in semiarid and humid china yuan et al 2008 furthermore human activities such as water use largely amplify the effects of groundwater table changes on regional climate xie et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 given the profound associations with ecosystems climates and human activities groundwater table changes have drawn increasing attention due to the scarcity and restrictive sharing policies of observation data observation based studies mainly focus on changes at local scales for instance well observations in hebei province in northern china indicate that the mean groundwater table depth dropped from approximately 7 to 12 m during 1983 1993 and that the decline was nonuniform in the area liu et al 2001 since 2002 the launch of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites has provided a new approach for estimating groundwater changes landerer and swenson 2012 with unprecedented accuracy grace retrievals of terrestrial water storage changes are increasingly used to estimate groundwater changes chen et al 2015 again taking northern china as an example after removing soil moisture variations the grace estimate of groundwater depletion was approximately 0 2 m during 2003 2010 feng et al 2013 despite the indispensability of observations numerical models play a central part in filling data gaps and uncovering long term changes in groundwater especially on regional scales fan 2016 fan et al 2013 within climate models previous land models responsible for land hydrological processes have overlooked groundwater processes and used the free drainage bottom boundary condition dickinson et al 1986 manabe 1969 sellers et al 1986 therefore the interchanges of groundwater with soil water were ignored such schemes are physically unrealistic where and when the groundwater table is shallow to address this deficiency land models have incorporated simplified groundwater representations which describe only the vertical flow of water one such one dimensional scheme was previously used in the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 liang and xie 2001 then the lumped and unconfined scheme and simple groundwater model were developed and used in land models to achieve soil water groundwater exchanges niu et al 2007 yeh and eltahir 2005 with increasing model resolution three dimensional schemes have emerged to represent topography driven lateral flow of groundwater between model grid cells fan et al 2007 york et al 2002 and these models have also begun considering the disturbances from human activities to natural groundwater processes xie et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 as mentioned earlier observational studies and model development have established the foundation for studying groundwater changes throughout recent decades however as climate change has intensified during recent decades how groundwater changes in china remains largely unclear from the perspective of the whole country which is important from the standpoint of understanding and preparing for climate change impacts on the long term availability of regional water resources for this reason the purpose of this paper is to present an overall picture of groundwater changes driven by reanalysis climate change and variability during the past four decades in china to this end the noah multiparameterization noah mp land surface model is first evaluated using well observations of groundwater table depths across china and the effects of lateral flow representation are also assessed and compared to in situ observations in terms of water and surface radiation energy balances then the spatiotemporal changes in groundwater table depths are presented and the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the noah mp land model data and methods for data processing and analyses section 3 presents model evaluations the effects of lateral flow representation and spatiotemporal changes in groundwater table depths across china section 4 discusses the potential mechanisms of groundwater changes as well as the implications for water resource availability finally section 5 concludes this paper 2 model data and methods 2 1 representations of groundwater in the noah mp land model the noah mp land model niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 was developed based on the noah land surface model chen et al 1996 koren et al 1999 mahrt and pan 1984 peterslidard et al 1997 by augmenting the alternative representations of biophysical and hydrological processes and the model thereby allows potential ensemble simulations within the same model framework in terms of the processes related to groundwater noah mp has provided five alternative schemes 1 a topography based hydrological model topmodel based scheme with a simple groundwater representation simple groundwater model simgm niu et al 2007 2 a topmodel based scheme with an equilibrium groundwater table process niu et al 2005 3 an original runoff scheme of free drainage 4 the biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme bats runoff scheme of free drainage and 5 a land ecosystem atmosphere feedback leaf model based groundwater scheme with a lateral flow process fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 the simgm referred to as r1 a representation of the scheme for brevity adds an unconfined aquifer below the soil to represent the recharge and discharge processes of terrestrial water storage within the land model as fig 1 in niu et al 2007 1 δ w a q r sb where δwa is the temporal variation in groundwater q is the recharge rate and rsb is the subsurface runoff the recharge rate q is positive as water enters the aquifer and is formulated by darcy s law as follows 2 q k bot z f mic ψ bot z bot z z bot where z is the depth to the groundwater table ψbot and kbot are the matric potential and hydraulic conductivity of the bottom soil layer respectively zbot is the node depth of the bottom layer and fmic is a factor representing the micropore fraction in the bottom layer soil which is introduced to modulate the upward water flow compared with the grace terrestrial water storage change data tapley et al 2004 the variations in modeled groundwater table depths agree well with the observations on various spatial scales the comparisons of soil moisture and evapotranspiration simulations by the r1 groundwater scheme to those by the equilibrium groundwater table and free drainage schemes further show substantial improvements in terrestrial water and energy balances cai et al 2014 liang et al 2019 niu et al 2007 yang et al 2011 to consider the effects of lateral flow on the variations in groundwater a leaf based groundwater scheme with a lateral flow process as well as water exchanges with rivers referred to as the r5 scheme was incorporated in the noah mp model the soil column is extended to the depth of the groundwater table by adding a variable thickness soil layer below the soil column as the groundwater table below the depth of the soil column the variation in groundwater storage δ w a in a grid cell of size δx by δy is formulated as follows 3 δ w a δ x δ y r q r 1 8 q n where r is the flux between the unsaturated soil and the groundwater or net recharge qr is the water exchange between the groundwater and rivers and qn is lateral flow to or from the nth neighbor grid cell to equate the chance of flow in all directions from a grid cell the square grid cells were replaced with octagons of the same areas as r5 to compute the lateral flow of groundwater the flux r is calculated with darcy s law using the groundwater table as the bottom boundary condition the groundwater river water exchange qr behaves in two ways groundwater flowing into rivers or vice versa depending on the elevation reference between the groundwater table and riverbed the water exchanges are calculated in accordance with darcy s law the lateral flow of groundwater qn between the center grid cell and the nth neighboring grid cell is calculated as follows 4 q n w t h h n l where w is the width of the grid cell interface t is the transmissivity h is the groundwater table head hn is the head in the nth adjacent cell and l is the distance between the centers of the two cells here for the octagon grid cells w and l are expressed as 5 w δ x 0 5 t a n π 8 l δ x 2 regarding the flow transmissivity t two cases are considered namely groundwater above or below the 1 5 m depth because of the availability of the soil data fan et al 2007 in the case of a groundwater table above 1 5 m the transmissivity is 6 t t 1 t 2 7 t 1 k m δ z m 8 t 2 k 0 f where m indicates the number of soil layers between the groundwater table and the 1 5 m depth and k is the hydraulic conductivity which decays exponentially with depth as follows 9 k k 0 exp z f where k0 is the value at the bottom layer of the 1 5 m depth zʹ is the depth below 1 5 m and f is an e folding length fan et al 2007 in the case of groundwater below the 1 5 m depth 10 t 2 k 0 f e x p z h 1 5 f where the groundwater table is at a depth of z h 1 5 m and z is the elevation of the land surface in the center grid cell the abovementioned representations and their numerical implementations in models are discussed in detail in the literature fan et al 2007 miguez macho and fan 2012 with the r5 scheme incorporated the noah mp model achieves an extension of the soil column below the groundwater table which takes the role of the saturated boundary condition for soil moisture and exchanges water with the soil layer above and enables the lateral flow of groundwater driven by topography 2 2 reanalysis climate forcing and groundwater simulation configuration to simulate groundwater variations across china the fifth generation reanalysis product of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 hersbach et al 2020 was used as the climate forcings for the noah mp land model the hourly forcing datasets include wind speed air temperature shortwave and longwave radiation precipitation specific humidity surface pressure a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 and time for the 1979 2018 period the parameterization configuration for simulating groundwater with the noah mp model is shown in table 1 according to the evaluations of previous ensemble simulations with multiparameterization options cai et al 2014 liang et al 2019 mocko et al 2021 yang et al 2011 the soil in the noah mp model was defined with four layers of thickness 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m which is the same as in niu et al 2011 and yang et al 2011 the equilibrium groundwater table depths for the r5 scheme were initialized with observation constrained simulations fan et al 2013 and observation based estimations of bedrock depths wei et al 2017 to test the effects of the r5 scheme with the lateral flow of groundwater on the modeled groundwater variations another simulation was conducted with identical forcings and configurations but the r1 groundwater scheme without the lateral flow process since the incorporation of the r1 scheme considerably improved the adequacy of surface water and energy processes in the noah mp model cai et al 2014 liang et al 2019 yang et al 2011 the simulations were run repeatedly for 1979 until groundwater reached equilibrium the difference between two year simulations 0 001 times of the simulation for previous year according to the constraint by yang et al 1995 and cai et al 2014 then it was run continuously for 1979 2018 with hourly forcings 2 3 observations of groundwater table depth soil moisture and sensible and latent heat fluxes the observations of groundwater table depths used to evaluate simulations were taken from the geological environmental monitoring of groundwater level yearbooks of china released by the china institute of geological environmental monitoring over the period from 2005 to 2016 lv et al 2021 the dataset consists of records from 906 monitoring wells across china after data quality control including 858 wells with more than 30 records at different times meeting the statistical requirements of the large sample theory and 167 wells with complete monthly records during the entire period see fig 1 for the geographical distribution to assess the continuous spatial construction of modeled groundwater table variability terrestrial water storage tws anomalies of grace tapley et al 2004 were also used in this study since the launch of grace in 2002 the retrieval algorithms of tws have been continuously improved and save et al 2016 developed a mascon solution with time variable regularization purely derived from grace information the resulting tws anomaly dataset has no north south stripe errors and can be used without further postprocessing the dataset was resampled onto a 0 5 0 5 equiangular grid covering 2002 2016 http www csr utexas edu grace compared with spherical harmonic solutions their applicability is considerably enhanced in terrestrial hydrological investigations save et al 2016 for a detailed grace related technical description the readers are referred to save et al 2016 and the references therein soil moisture observations from the china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjcx were released in the form of relative humidity the percentage of moisture content to the field capacity based on measurements by the oven drying method routine measurements were conducted on the 8th 18th and 28th days of every month excluding rainy days and frozen periods during 1991 2013 according to the completeness of records measurements at 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m were used in the present study the 0 0 4 m soil moisture values were yielded by interpolating the three layer data with weights of the soil layer thicknesses to compare with the model soil moisture mean in the upper two layers 0 0 4 m for the sake of the unavailability of in situ field capacity measurements for those sites the comparisons in section 3 were based on the normalized soil moisture the in situ observations of sensible and latent heat fluxes were taken from two observational networks 1 the chinese flux observation and research network fluxchina conducted flux observations with the eddy covariance method yu et al 2006 after data quality control and postprocessing these measured values can be comparable to the other records from international fluxnet sites yu et al 2006 in the present study publicly available observations for only 9 sites for the 2003 2010 period were used 2 the land atmosphere interaction observation network on the tibetan plateau a high elevation and cold region observation network also performed observations with the eddy covariance method ma et al 2020 the hourly records are available at six sites during 2005 2016 their monthly mean dataset was used in this research the details of the sites are listed in table 2 the dataset was provided by the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn 2 4 methods for data processing and statistics for evaluations and analyses given that in situ observations of groundwater table depths soil moisture and sensible and latent heat fluxes cover various periods with different sites across china to retain their spatiotemporal signature the time series comparisons in section 3 were conducted using the all record integrated data the full set of in situ records was averaged across all sites along their time axes throughout the entire period as were the simulations at the corresponding grid cells in which the observational sites were located the resulting time series may not fully represent the real dynamic of the regional mean of the variable however as a subset of real climate samples it is fairer and more robust to assess the consistency between observations and simulations by taking more spatiotemporal information into account linear trend analyses were conducted using ordinary least squares linear regression the trend coefficients were tested using a t test with the t statistic formulated as follows 11 t r n 2 1 r 2 12 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient n is the sample size and xi and yi are the observation and model output time series with corresponding means of x and y respectively then the probability value p is estimated using a t distribution with n 2 degrees of freedom the trend coefficient is statistically significant as p is less than the specific significance level e g 0 05 the pearson correlation coefficients equation 12 were tested using the same method the significance of the differences between the r5 and r1simulations was tested using the paired sample t test at the p 0 05 level the standard deviations sds were estimated using the following formula 13 sd i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 3 results 3 1 evaluations of groundwater table depth wtd simulations to test the simulations of groundwater table variability by the r5 scheme with lateral flow across china comparisons with in situ observations and grace retrievals were conducted the long term 2005 2016 monthly mean shows that wtds deepen gradually from near the land surface in humid southeastern china to more than 10 m in arid northwestern china fig 1a in alignment with the wet dry gradient of climate moreover driven by topography groundwater converges to lowland areas forming contrasting shallow or deep groundwater tables especially in mountainous regions in comparison with observations fig 1b simulations capture the spatial pattern of the wtd gradient on average despite large shallower biases with 15 7 m as the mean of 906 wells and 2 5 m for the grid cell mean in terms of linear trends over the same period the simulations fig 1c show significant changes in depths across china characterized by rises in southeastern and northeastern china and falls in southwestern northern and northwestern china along with the opposite trends in parts of the respective regions compared with the 167 well observations with complete monthly records for the 2005 2016 period fig 1d the simulations precisely reproduce the opposite trends along 35 north latitude which are downward in the north and upward in the south likewise the tripolar structure visible in grace fig 1e in eastern china is reasonably regenerated in western china however another opposite tripolar structure is not clearly visible for the increasing trends in the simulations along the southwestern periphery of the tibetan plateau at the local scale between time series of 858 wells and corresponding grid cells the correlation coefficients fig 2 a are of significance p 0 05 across 58 wells including 21 of coefficients larger than 0 5 in contrast another 10 of significant coefficients are negative because of the advanced response time of simulations with much shallower mean groundwater tables to climate forcing than that of observations the spatial distribution of the significant correlations covers all parts of the regions where the observations were conducted to minimize the effects of spatial mismatch between in situ measurements and model grid cell means the time series were integrated across all 906 wells and responding grid cells during 2005 2016 fig 2b then through normalization their temporal variability was highlighted further the monthly series showed a correlation with a coefficient of 0 58 which was significant at the p 0 01 level the simulations are in good agreement with both annual cycles and strong fluctuations of the observations furthermore simulations capture the long term decreasing trend in the observations according to linear regressions albeit much smaller in simulations due to the intensified rise in 2016 note that the ranges of spatial dependence of in situ measurements satellite based retrievals and model grid cell means are largely inconsistent the direct anthropogenic effects on groundwater variability contained in the observations are hardly taken into account in the simulations in this study 3 2 groundwater table depth variability over 1979 2018 3 2 1 means trends and variances during 1979 2018 the mean groundwater table depths show a similar spatial structure to that over 2005 2016 fig 3 a fig 1a but deeper depths overall according to the standard deviations fig 3b the variations in wtds are strong in humid southeastern china consistent with those of surface water balances figure not shown strong variations also appear across dry northern china largely following groundwater convergence driven by topography otherwise groundwater table depths show less variation with deepened mean depths there are few variations in extremely arid humid regions such as parts of northwestern and southwestern china regarding long term trends during the past 40 years 1979 2018 the linear trends show significant changes across most regions in china fig 3c characterized by nationwide decreases along with increases in small western areas with the intensified topographic drivers in the west on top of climatic drivers the linear trends clearly increase in the northwest in relation to the southeast during the last 19 years 2000 2018 with intensified climate change shi et al 2019 the regions with significant rising trends expanded not only in western but also east of china the two opposite tripolar structures observed via grace over 2005 2016 fig 1e started emerging in particular the remarkable decreases in the central part of northern china are consistent with the continuously decreasing precipitation and soil moisture li et al 2020 the opposite trends between north and south china are also in phase with the north south dipole pattern of annual precipitation across these regions yang et al 2017 the time series of regional mean depths fig 4 shows that the overall wtd in china decreased by approximately 0 2 m during 1979 2018 according to ordinary least squares linear regression p 0 01 moreover in northern china north of 35 n the wtd decreased increased by 0 8 1 2 m in regions with significant negative positive trends in southern china south of 35 n and east of 100 e the wtd decreased by 0 5 m over the same period the mean depths over the four regions china as a whole north china with negative and positive trend areas and south china with negative trend area are 5 0 3 6 6 1 and 1 6 m in turn in addition to the long term trends wtds display decadal changes in approximately 1990 2000 and 2010 especially in negative trend regions according to the mann kendall test statistics wtds experience significant abrupt changes in the period figures not shown and these changes occur in 1996 across the negative trending southern and northern china and overall in china while those changes lag until 2001 in positive trending regions of northern china moreover the monthly fluctuations decrease with increasing groundwater table depth with a standard deviation of 0 3 m after its trend is removed in southern china and 0 1 m in northern china 3 2 2 seasonality of long term trends the seasonality of wtd variability is largely detectable across china according to the linear trends during 1979 2018 fig 5 although it is negligible with respect to climatological means figures not shown the clearest seasonality appears in southeastern china the falling trends close to 1 m during 1979 2018 of groundwater tables in spring cover the largest area in this region mam from march to may and the area with significant trends p 0 05 contracts to the smallest in summer jja from june to august with the advent of summer monsoon rainfalls ding 1992 in autumn son from september to november the rising trends expand especially in the eastern part despite intensified falling trends in the western part of this region the rising trends expand to the maximum area in winter djf from december to february however they remain nonsignificant p 0 05 across the other parts of china the seasonal changes in the spatial patterns of linear trends are not clear nevertheless groundwater tables tend to rise during summer and autumn in the regions with small groundwater table depths with the intensified variations in wtds after 2000 figs 3 and 4 the regions with increasing trends expand considerably however the seasonal changes in the linear trends of wtds figures not shown are still mainly present in southeastern china the area of increasing trends that emerge in summer increases significantly p 0 05 in autumn in parts of this region in winter increasing trends occur widely along the southeastern coast overall the seasonality of wtds manifests mainly in the regions with small 3 m fig 3 groundwater table depths 3 3 groundwater table depth differences between the two groundwater schemes to examine the uncertainties in wtd changes caused by the groundwater schemes in the land model the simulations by the r5 scheme with the lateral flow process were compared to those by the r1 scheme without the lateral flow process for means and linear trends over 1979 2018 their differences fig 6 show that the spatial patterns simulated by the two schemes are generally similar to each other and reasonably in agreement with those of observations figs 1 and 2 between the two scheme simulated means the differences are clearly characterized by spatial contrast fig 6e there are much deeper groundwater tables greater than7 m by the r5 scheme in dry northwestern china than by the r1 scheme but significantly shallower approximately 1 m tables in humid southeastern china the differences tend to be smaller in the transition zone between dry and wet climates however such a spatial contrast is not manifested in the pattern of their linear trend differences fig 6f due to the much weaker trends in r1 simulations in relation to those by both the r5 and in situ observations fig 1d the large differences between linear trends in wtds by the r5 and r1 schemes are associated with the lateral flow process as well as their definitions of aquafers and are discussed further in section 4 compared with the in situ wtd observations from 858 wells fig 2a the number of significant correlation coefficients p 0 05 various degrees of freedom of the r5 simulations increases by 3 percentage points 59 in relation to those of the r1 simulations 56 the integrated monthly time series of 906 wells fig 1b and corresponding grid cells show considerable differences especially deeper biases in the minimum depths of both simulations despite better performance in r5 simulations fig 7 during 2005 2016 in comparison with observations the correlation of r5 simulations reaches 0 58 p 0 01 which is larger than that of r1 simulations 0 51 because of the improved minima in r5 simulations both linear trends show the same sign as the observational decreasing trend but with less intensity in terms of annual cycles r5 simulations improve the mean amplitude relative to that of r1 simulations especially during the deeper groundwater table months however they both advance the extremes a month for their respective smaller mean depths 3 4 effects of groundwater table depth differences on surface processes 3 4 1 effects on surface water balance soil moisture given the significant differences in wtd simulations caused by the schemes to understand their influence on surface water and energy balances soil moisture and upward energy fluxes were compared between r5 and r1 simulations for soil moisture during 1991 2013 the mean differences fig 8 a b show that the r5 simulations are generally wetter than those by the r1 scheme especially across the regions with shallower groundwater tables and in the lower soil layer 1 2 m the increases in soil moisture are significant p 0 05 across the semiarid and subhumid regions strong increases greater than0 05 m3 m 3 tend to appear in mountainous areas where groundwater tables are shallower in r5 simulations owing to lateral groundwater flow driven by topography moreover in r5 simulations in northern china with deeper groundwater tables soil moisture is generally drier albeit nonsignificant relative to r1 simulations with respect to 808 site observations the number of significant correlation coefficients p 0 05 of r5 simulations increases one percentage point relative to those of r1 simulations fig 8 c d and correspondingly the number increases up to three points for coefficients larger than 0 5 across these sites there are 141 sites in which the coefficients of the r5 simulations are larger than those of the r1 simulations although another 90 sites show weaker correlations compared with the integrated observations fig 9 the r5 simulations show an enhancement of soil moisture relative to r1 simulations with a larger correlation coefficient of 0 76 0 66 for the r1 simulation both have p values 0 01 despite normalized soil moisture due to the unavailable measurements of field capacity they still show that the r5 scheme ameliorates the simulations of wet end soil moisture the annual cycles which might not actually present annual variations in regional soil moisture because of the data from various observational times and sites display that r5 simulations more precisely capture the timing of minimum soil moisture and substantially depress the summer bias 3 4 2 effects on the surface energy balance sensible and latent heat fluxes to examine the effects of groundwater schemes on surface energy balance simulations comparisons were performed for sensible and latent fluxes along with the ground heat flux and bowen ratio between r5 and r1 simulations in the context of in situ observations during 2003 2016 fig 10 the differences show that r5 sensible heat fluxes decrease significantly p 0 05 with maximum decreases close to 15 w m 2 in southeastern china in response to the increases in latent heat fluxes for the increased evapotranspiration available soil water fig 8 moreover the ground heat fluxes increase in humid southeastern china but decrease significantly on the tibetan plateau the partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes namely bowen ratios changes greatly in northern china resulting from the large bowen ratios in these regions overall due to the increased soil moisture in the r5 simulation its energy partitioning transitions to increasing latent heat fluxes in most regions compared with the r1 simulation during the period of 2003 2016 in comparison with the in situ observations of surface energy fluxes across china fig 11 a both latent heat flux simulations are larger than observations approximately 30 on average and r5 simulations are larger than those by r1 simulations the two sensible heat fluxes on the tibetan plateau are also larger than the observations 50 nevertheless r5 simulations capture the peak value of the latent heat flux in july in eastern china and decrease the sensible heat flux closer to observations in both observational networks the larger total fluxes relative to observations fig 11b d may be associated with the ground heat flux partitioning and the incident radiation energy in era5 forcing fields requiring more observations for further investigations 4 discussion driven by climate and topography groundwater table depths across china changed significantly during the past 40 years 1979 2018 with a decrease of approximately 0 2 m on average despite regional increases in northwestern china and on the tibetan plateau the spatial pattern of wtd trends is largely consistent with that of terrestrial water availability in the era5 reanalysis precipitation minus evapotranspiration figure not shown which generally decreases in most of china but increases on the tibetan plateau previous studies indicate that northwestern china has become wetter during the past decades as has soil moisture li and ma 2015 li and ma 2018 peng and zhou 2017 the wetter climate provides water for groundwater convergence by topography on the other hand the increased actual and potential evapotranspiration especially since the 1990 s li et al 2013 su et al 2021 and decreased groundwater recharge with a warming climate reinecke et al 2021 balance the increased precipitation and result in a general decrease in groundwater tables across this region in addition due to the relatively coarse model resolution 0 25 0 25 strong trends appear mainly in the northwestern mountainous regions where climate fueled groundwater changes are amplified by topography driven lateral flow across southern china because of shallow groundwater table depths 1 6 m on average their large annual variations point to enhanced control from climate factors annual variations in precipitation minus evapotranspiration mohan et al 2018 while the effects of annual climate variations in northern china are buffered by the deep groundwater tables in comparison with well observations the simulated groundwater tables are much shallower on average likely for the following reasons first the coarse model resolution in the present study makes the model grid averaged groundwater table much shallower than that measured at well sites because of the steep gradient of the groundwater table with topography fan et al 2013 second groundwater extraction renders a deeper groundwater table than that regulated by only climate and topography due to the lack of explicit representations of human water extraction in the model third in theory groundwater lateral flow qn largely determines deviations of the groundwater table from equilibrium depths equation 4 indicates that the groundwater table head difference between two grids is proportional to qn coarse resolutions tend to reduce head differences and thus reduce qn and favor a rising groundwater table another parameter hydraulic conductivity still lacks observations and the assumption of its uniform decay rate with depth in all aquifers likely leads to biases however model experiments are required to quantitatively elucidate the influence fan et al 2013 fan et al 2007 moreover the equilibrium groundwater table depths initialized in r5 scheme are still subject to large uncertainties because of the scarcity of observational studies fan et al 2013 wei et al 2017 in addition the long term trends of the groundwater table are overall weaker than those of observations in eastern china which has a dense population and a large area of irrigated croplands liu et al 2018 in addition to climate regulated changes in groundwater human influence could amplify the changes in dry years the groundwater table declines on the other hand water extraction increases which intensifies the decline in the groundwater table conversely in wet years decreased water extraction favors groundwater restoration dominated by water replenishment from precipitation the amplified variations partly account for the lower intensity of the simulated trends however for the in phase effects of climate and human drivers the amplified groundwater variations are easier to capture by models even without explicit representations of human activities for example across the well sites with falling groundwater table trends the trend and correlation are both in better agreement between the observations and simulations fig 12 a in contrast over the period of rising groundwater tables driven by natural factors dominantly with less human effects the large observation simulation differences in mean groundwater tables lead to out of phase dynamics of groundwater table depths between observations and simulations and thus weaken the correlation fig 12b the smaller annual variations in normalized simulations are mainly caused by large trends in observations in addition the large differences between linear trends in wtds by the two schemes fig 6f highlight the substantially enhanced trends of the r5 scheme despite being remarkably smaller than those in the observations fig 1d the r5 scheme by adding a soil layer of variable thickness uses soil pore space above the present water table to update the water table depth fan et al 2007 miguez macho et al 2007 by contrast the r1 scheme defines an aquifer below the model soil column and use a constant specific yield 0 2 in the regional simulation to convert groundwater recharge into water table depth niu et al 2007 the soil pore space is associated with soil types and together with groundwater lateral flow processes aids in enhancing water table dynamics nevertheless more modeling experiments are required to understand these discrepancies importantly in addition to the above mentioned factors that lead to biases in model groundwater tables the absence of representations of human activities in the model may account for large regional biases in groundwater tables for example in north china the grace based studies show a substantial role of irrigational water use in groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 feng et al 2018 the south to north water diversion in beijing exerts a larger effect on groundwater than that by precipitation change and irrigation water use during 2006 2018 long et al 2020 in the mu us sandyland of northern china ecological restoration dominates the observed groundwater depletion over 2003 2016 zhao et al 2021 these human activities produce more decisive effects than climate does on the regional changes in groundwater table depths nevertheless in this study the land model neglects direct human disturbance and captures only the coarse scale and climate driven pattern of groundwater table changes across china during the past four decades this effort provides first order knowledge of the groundwater response to climate change or climate change impacts on groundwater regarding model evaluations and groundwater scheme comparisons note that in situ observations of terrestrial water and energy process variables indicate their point scale variations namely with limited spatial representativeness especially where mountainous topographic gradients dominate the patterns of the groundwater table fan et al 2013 more importantly those observations are influenced to various degrees by human activities in china such as water diversion extraction and irrigation accordingly the regionally synthesized signal of in situ observations is inherently more consistent with that of model simulations e g fig 2 the enhanced groundwater table and lateral flow processes facilitate advancements in the seasonality of soil moisture and surface energy balances in the model which is consistent with previous studies in various regions cai et al 2014 chang et al 2020 niu et al 2007 regarding the runoff effects of groundwater table changes increases in mean runoff simulated with the r5 scheme appear in wet southeastern china but decreases appear in dry northwestern china in comparison with the simulations using the r1 scheme during 1979 2018 figures not shown however the changes require further assessment to explain for the differences between the two schemes depending on the availability of streamflow measurements for main rivers across wet dry climates in china 5 conclusion groundwater tables are fundamentally important for the environment human habitats and sustainable development they are particularly important in arid and semiarid regions the present study examined groundwater table depth changes with a changing climate in china during the past 40 years 1979 2018 using the noah mp land model forced with era5 reanalysis climate data the groundwater table depths in china changed significantly overall characterized by decreases in most of the region except parts of northwestern china under a changing climate aided by large scale topography there is evidence of seasonal changes in southeastern china where groundwater tables are shallow although decadal fluctuations occurred in most parts of china the long term trends dominated the overall changes in groundwater table depths quantitively there was an approximately 0 2 m decrease on average but it was approximately 0 5 m in southern china and 0 8 m north of 35 n despite a 1 2 m rise in part of this region due to an increasingly wet climate and topographic water convergence these findings highlight the extensive impacts of global warming on terrestrial water cycles and water resources in addition to the usually obvious surface climate and extreme weather changes in groundwater may be well removed from our everyday life but the influence of groundwater changes will be hidden and long lasting these changes will in the longer term put constraints on economic development and survival a model evaluation compared with in situ observations provided reasonable confidence in the simulated trends and variability for the study period the model used was capable of portraying terrestrial water cycles and energy balances on regional scales the inclusion of the lateral flow process of groundwater helped to capture the seasonality of surface water and energy balances it is also noted here that the current simulations have neglected direct human influence and two way interactions between groundwater and surface water and the relatively coarse model resolution would not allow us to resolve the detailed effects of topographical complexity the simulations have captured only the large scale and natural variability of groundwater table depths with the mean groundwater table still strongly biased from observations these problems along with the effects of groundwater table changes on runoff will be addressed in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

3577,preferential flow pf has a faster migration speed and is an important process affecting hydrological geochemical and ecological cycles however the factors that control pf during infiltration are not fully understood especially in the data scarce high and cold mountainous areas where few studies have been focused on pf we selected eight soil moisture observation stations in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin hrb northwest china during the growing season from 2014 to 2019 the soil moisture was monitored every 30 min at 5 depths 5 15 25 40 and 60 cm at each station in order to analyze the occurrence and spatial temporal control of pf in a cold mountainous environment according to the difference in response time of shallower and deeper soil moisture to rainfall infiltration events were classified into pf and matrix flow our results show that the frequency of pf events across all layers of these stations ranged from 0 to 22 28 as depth increased the average pf frequency gradually decreased but the coefficient of variation of pf frequency increased the effect of vegetation on the occurrence of pf was profound because vegetation affects root distribution and fauna activities which affects the occurrence of pf our results also show that the frequency of pf gradually decreases from scrubland to grassland and meadow and barren land low bulk density low residual water content high saturated hydraulic conductivity and high soil organic carbon were found to be conducive to the occurrence of pf in addition we found that pf possessed a high degree of seasonal variability because of its strong dependence on soil moisture rainfall and vegetation conditions high rainfall was conducive to pf occurrence in areas with high sand content low initial soil moisture was conducive to pf occurrence likely due to hydrophobicity whereas high initial soil moisture was conducive to pf occurrence in areas with low sand content overall vegetation soil properties and water conditions seem to jointly affect the factors that occur in spatial temporal of pf and the influence of initial soil moisture on pf varies across different sand content findings of this study reveal the occurrence and control factors of pf which will improve our understanding of water cycling related to the infiltration process recharge process and the runoff generation process at hillslope over the cold mountainous areas keywords preferential flow soil properties hydrophobicity cold mountainous areas land cover 1 introduction preferential flow pf refers to the phenomenon whereby a fluid bypasses most of the matrix when passing through a porous medium and selects a preferred path in order to pass through the medium at a faster speed flury et al 1994 lin 2010 guo and lin 2018 a large number of studies have shown the ubiquity of pf in various landscapes jarvis 2007 koestel and jorda 2014 wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo et al 2018 jarvis 2020 due to the faster migration speed of pf it is considered to be an important factor affecting the hydrological cycle guo et al 2014 2019 soil erosion tao et al 2020 hillslope stability kukemilks et al 2018 wang et al 2019 farmland productivity zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015b and many other geochemical and ecological processes kan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021 a soil moisture sensor network provides a method for long term large scale and continuous monitoring of pf in a natural state ochsner et al 2013 bogena et al 2018 guo et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2018 tang et al 2020 this method has been widely used to study the spatial and temporal variability of pf at a watershed scale demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 many studies have found that the occurrence of pf is affected by various spatial and temporal factors wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 spatial factors influencing pf mainly include vegetation topographic characteristics and soil texture and the hydraulic properties which together provide a flow path for the occurrence of pf wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the most important temporal factors affecting pf are rainfall water input and initial soil moisture wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 gao et al 2019 these factors jointly control the occurrence of pf but the influence of these factors on pf is usually station specific and may even be contradictory under different conditions guo and lin 2018 the influence of control factors on pf varies from site to site guo and lin 2018 for soil porosity intuitively it should be evident that higher soil porosity will enhance pf since macropore is the main path of pf mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 however a high soil porosity denotes that the surface area between the pores and the matrix is large and a large amount of water will penetrate into the matrix which is less conducive to the occurrence of pf jarvis 2007 larsbo et al 2016 many soil properties bulk density bulk saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and soil organic carbon soc related to soil porosity also have similar contradictions in their influence on pf gjettermann et al 1997 jarvis 2007 larsbo et al 2014 2016 gao et al 2018 guo and lin 2018 for example bulk which is related to water transmission and water capacity reflects not only the abundance of macropores but also the density of the matrix material nimmo 2021 hence the relationship between bulk and pf is diverse across different studies koestel et al 2012 2013 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition the influence of soil moisture on pf also varies across different research areas drier soils in areas with high sand content are conducive to the occurrence of pf but pf in other areas is positively correlated with the initial soil moisture guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 overall these factors have different effects on pf at different study areas current researches on pf mainly focus on farmland koestel et al 2013 larsbo et al 2014 2016 and humid mountains or hills wiekenkamp et al 2016 demand et al 2019 guo et al 2019 tang et al 2020 few studies have investigated the occurrence and control of pf in cold mountainous areas li et al 2013 hu et al 2016 in an arid endorheic river basin the water resources of the entire basin mainly originate in the headwater mountainous regions zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2020a pf is of great significance to the hydrological process in such study areas xiao et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 found that pf is the main source of groundwater recharge accounting for 66 4 of the total recharge for grassland in the northern qinghai tibet plateau gao et al 2020b found that the deep soil moisture in the degraded alpine meadow was supplied by pf paquette et al 2018 believed that the pf path is the principal hydrological pathways of headwater catchments in permafrost areas in addition pf is of great significance to the process of snowmelt infiltration into frozen soil stahli et al 1996 mohammed et al 2021 however the mechanism of pf control and occurrence in alpine regions are still poor understanding the occurrence and control of pf is important for understanding the flow process of pf and can improve water resource management therefore the main aim of this study is to identify and compare the occurrence of pf using a soil moisture network in a mountainous area we analyze the effects of spatial factors vegetation and soil characteristics and temporal factors initial soil moisture and rainfall on the occurrence of pf more specifically we attempt to answer the following questions are there any pf control factors that are specific to cold mountainous areas how do these control factors affect pf occurrence in such areas given that the influence of soil properties on pf can be contradictory clarifying the main mechanisms that control the initiation persistence and dynamics in spatial and temporal of pf in the alpine region 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this research was carried out in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin hrb china s second largest inland river basin or terminal lake cheng et al 2014 it is located in the qilian mountains 97 29 101 32 e 37 43 39 39 e on the northern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau and has an area of over 27 103 km2 fig 1 a the study area has a temperate semi arid to semi humid continental monsoon climate and lies at an altitude of 2000 5500 m above sea level according to the observed meteorological data from 1960 to 2012 the average annual temperature ranges from 3 c to 7 c and the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to 700 mm geng et al 2014 due to the high altitude semi arid climate the temperature and precipitation have large temporal and spatial variability within the study area qi and cai 2007 zhang et al 2016 most of the precipitation occurs from june to august accounting for about 65 of the annual precipitation zhang et al 2016 the strong vertical difference in temperature and precipitation has also led to a zonal vegetation distribution consisting of forests alpine meadows grasslands scrublands and sparse vegetation yang et al 2015 tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the main land cover types in the study area are grassland forest water body and barren land fig 1b and the main soil texture categories are silt loam silt and sandy loam usda classification tian et al 2017 2 2 soil moisture network in order to investigate the dynamically changing characteristics of soil moisture in the upstream stream of the hrb under different environmental conditions a long term soil moisture observation network including 32 soil moisture stations was established in july 2013 fig 1a these stations include locations with different land cover forest grassland meadow and barren land and soil types silt loam silt and sandy loam and different altitudes within the upper reaches of the heihe river zhang et al 2017 tian et al 2019 at each station soil pits with a depth of 70 cm were excavated and 5te sensors decagon devices inc pullman usa were inserted horizontally to avoid the impact on vertical water flow at 5 15 25 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface soil moisture was measured at a temporal resolution of 30 min which is sufficient for studying soil hydrological processes in most cases lozano parra et al 2016 tian et al 2019 at the depth where the sensors were installed undisturbed and disturbed soil samples were collected with metal cylinders and zipped bags respectively we attempted to install the sensors at each observation station in vertical arrays but this was not always possible due to the influence of rocks roots and channels therefore there is a slight horizontal deviation relative to the ideal vertical array wiekenkamp et al 2016 after installation the excavated pit was refilled with the original soil and compacted to the initial state layer by layer in order to restore the natural soil matrix structure as much as possible after sensor installation we measured the station related parameters including land cover type slope aspect and rooting depth the collected soil samples were used to determine the key soil properties of each soil moisture observation station including bulk soil porosity k s soc soil water retention curve and soil texture details of the measurement processes of the above soil properties can be found in tian et al 2017 2 3 rainfall and ndvi under normal circumstances high precision rainfall data are obtained through the deployment of ground based meteorological observation stations guo et al 2018 tang et al 2020 but their spatial coverage is limited especially in mountainous areas such stations are scarce and it is more difficult to measure rainfall on a large scale yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015a therefore in order to analyze the impact of rainfall on the occurrence of pf we extracted rainfall data from the reanalysis data set china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd yang et al 2010 he et al 2020 cmfd is china s first near surface meteorological raster dataset with a high temporal and spatial resolution time resolution is 3 h spatial resolution is 0 1 0 1 and it is widely used in china meng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the monthly cumulative rainfall pm of each station was calculated as following 1 p mi i y 2014 i y 2018 p y i in the above equations y is the year i is the month including the may june july august september and october py i is the monthly cumulative rainfall in order to reflect the surface vegetation conditions of our observation stations we extracted the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi during the growing season from 2015 to 2019 except for 2016 from the surface vegetation index data of the qilian mountains and used their maximum values as the ndvi of the corresponding station cihlar et al 1994 huete et al 2002 the time resolution of the data set is 1 month and the spatial resolution is 30 m 30 m both the rainfall data and ndvi are from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn en the monthly average ndvi ndvim of each station was calculated as following 2 ndv i mi ndv i 2015 i n d v i 2017 i n d v i 2018 i n d v i 2019 i 4 in the above equations i is the month ndvi2015 i is the ndvi value for a certain month in 2015 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 soil moisture in a recent review nimmo 2021 concluded that the continuity of the flow path together with the properties and soil moisture of the surrounding matrix material are the main controlling factors of pf to study the temporal spatial control factors of pf in cold mountainous areas we selected a subset of stations with small slope and with different land covers demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 we selected stations with a relatively small k s to ensure a long response time difference between the upper and lower soil layer moisture we also chose stations where the data gap during 2014 to 2019 was 3 months in the end we selected 8 soil moisture stations including those located on scrubland scrub high coverage grassland hcg1 and hcg2 medium coverage grassland mcg1 and mcg2 meadow meadow and barren land barren1 and barren2 the locations and basic characteristics of these soil moisture stations are shown in fig 1 and table 1 we have collected soil moisture data since 2013 with a time resolution of 30 min in addition using the method provided by decagon cobos and chambers 2010 soil specific calibration was performed on each station tian et al 2019 in order to fully restore the soil to its natural state and to eliminate the influence of freeze thaw cycles on soil moisture we selected only the growing seasons in each of the years from 2014 to 2019 from may 1 to october 15 each year liu et al 2015 as the study period prior to subsequent data analysis a detailed data quality control check was performed following the procedures of wiekenkamp et al 2016 and tian et al 2019 the specific steps were 1 outliers were removed using quantitative plausibility checks removing any value beyond the range of 0 90 plus peaks and unreasonable fluctuations of soil moisture 2 through visual data inspection any unreliable data caused by equipment problems such as insufficient battery power was eliminated in order to keep the infiltration events of each layer consistent only periods when sensors in all five layers had recorded an observation were selected for subsequent analysis in addition the monthly average soil moisture in each station profile smmp was also calculated as following 3 s m mpi l 1 5 s m mli l l 1 5 l with 4 s m mli y 2014 i y 2019 i s m yml 6 in the above equations y is the year i is the month smyml is the monthly average soil water content of the l th layer in a certain month of a certain year smmli is the monthly average soil moisture of each layer l is the thickness of the soil layer because the smmp of different stations are very various in order to facilitate the comparison of the monthly changes of the smmp of different stations calculated the ratio of smmp to the average soil moisture content rsmmp of the profile 5 rs m mp s m mp s m ya in the above equations smya is the average soil moisture of the profile during the growing season from 2014 to 2019 2 4 2 determination of the infiltration event according to the definition of infiltration events by tian et al 2019 each infiltration event was determined by establishing its start and end times for a soil moisture sequence if its soil moisture increased continuously the start time of the increase in soil moisture is defined as the starting time ts of the infiltration event and the end time of moisture increase is defined as the end time te of the infiltration event any infiltration events occurring within six hours of one another i e the time interval between the end of the previous event and the start of the next event was 6 h were merged into the same event lozano parra et al 2015 lozano parra et al 2016 tian et al 2019 in order to eliminate any increase in soil moisture caused by sensor errors infiltration events in which the difference in soil moisture between te and ts of the event was 0 3 were removed rosenbaum et al 2010 lozano parra et al 2015 lozano parra et al 2016 finally any soil moisture increases caused by fluctuations in soil temperature were eliminated using temperature corrected soil moisture data following the methodology of saito et al 2013 and kapilaratne and lu 2017 the identification of infiltration events was performed automatically using dedicated matlab scripts we also calculated the soil water storage increment at each depth as follows tian et al 2019 6 sws l t s t e δ θ i j with 7 δ θ i j δ θ i j δ θ i j 0 0 δ θ i j 0 in the above equations sws is the soil water storage increment cm l is the thickness of the soil layer cm δ θ i j δ θ i δ t j δ θ i j δ θ i j is the change of soil moisture vol 2 4 3 event classification after determining the infiltration event of each layer of soil the response time series of the specific location was used to classify the flow behavior pf was defined as non sequential response of the soil moisture that is for the same rainfall the response time of deep soil was faster than that of shallow soil graham and lin 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition due to the high flow velocities of pf it might also result in a sequential response with a very small difference in infiltration event response time hardie et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 demand et al 2019 however there is no uniform and effective method to determine the moving speed of the wet front corresponding to pf hardie et al 2013 demand et al 2019 moreover as the soil moisture was monitored every 30 min and it is impossible to obtain an accurate moving speed of the wet front jin et al 2018 hence we only defined pf events as those with the same response time or non sequential response for deeper and shallower soil infiltration events according to the above principles we can use the soil moisture data of two adjacent layers to determine whether pf occurs between the two layers we can classify four types of response scenarios a layer 1st 2nd the soil moisture response time of the second layer is earlier than or equal to the first layer b layer 2nd 3rd the soil moisture response time of the third layer is earlier than or equal to the second layer c layer 3rd 4th the soil moisture response time of the fourth layer is earlier than or equal to the third layer d layer 4th 5th the soil moisture response time of the fifth layer is earlier than or equal to the fourth layer the classification of all infiltration events was automatically implemented in matlab an example of non sequential response to an infiltration event is shown in fig 2 in addition the frequency of pf events fevent and the proportion of sws of pf events psws can be calculated by taking the ratio of pf events to total infiltration events 8 f event n pf n pf n sf in the above equations npf and nsf are the number of pf events and sequential flow sf events respectively 9 p sws sw s pf sw s pf s w s sf in the above equations swspf and swssf are the total sws of pf events and sequential flow sf events respectively 2 4 4 statistical analysis in this study one way analysis of variance anova or kruskal wallis test methods were used to test the differences in data pf frequency initial soil moisture sand content and rainfall lange et al 2008 specific steps were 1 a homogeneity test was used to determine whether the data satisfied the normal distribution and homogeneity of variance 2 when the variance of the data set satisfied normality and homogeneity anova and a post hoc bonferroni test were used to test the difference between different sets of data if these conditions were not satisfied kruskal wallis anova with a post hoc dunn test were used for analysis the statistics were implemented through spss spss 25 0 spss inc and matlab r2018a the mathworks 3 results 3 1 frequency of pf table 2 shows the total number of infiltration events and the corresponding sws of each layer of the eight selected soil moisture observation stations as well as the number of pf events and their sws combining data from all layers of the eight stations we obtained a total of 2 288 infiltration events with a total sws of 5 404 86 cm from 2014 to 2019 among them there were a total of 216 pf events with a sws of 671 26 cm the fevent and psws were 9 44 and 12 36 respectively on average the sws of a pf event was 3 11 cm and the sws of a sf event was 2 37 cm this showed that the sws of a pf event was greater than a sf event 3 2 discrepancies in pf between layers the proportion of the various types of pf event scenarios outlined above is shown in table 2 the relative frequency of pf in the second layer layer 1 2 is 41 6 in the third layer layer 2 3 is 25 93 in the fourth layer layer 3 4 is 19 44 and in the fifth layer layer 4 5 is 12 96 however the frequency of pf in each layer does not decrease with depth for all stations the frequency of pf at each depth is shown in fig 3 in these soil moisture stations the variability of pf frequency at each depth was high table 3 the standard deviation was highest in layer 4 5 fevent 7 11 psws 11 28 followed by layer 3 4 fevent 7 08 psws 8 77 then layer 1 2 fevent 6 84 psws 8 21 and finally layer 2 3 fevent 6 70 psws 11 17 the variation of standard deviation with depth may be attributed to variations in root systems and soil properties with depth the root penetration depth varies greatly between soil moisture stations scrub greater than 70 cm meadow 10 cm through observation of station profile photos supplementary material fig s1 we found that some stations contain gravel in their deep layer but the distribution of gravel varies among stations macropores produced by roots johnson and lehmann 2006 li et al 2009 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020 and gravel zhao et al 2020 are important paths for pf hence the greater standard deviation of pf in the deeper layers may be attributed to differences in the root system and gravel content of these layers across different stations 3 3 general relevance of pf pf was observed at each station but the relative frequency of pf among these stations the standard deviation of the pf frequency of these station profiles is 5 8 and between different layers table 3 was very variable the variability of pf between different landscape types and even within some stations was high which highlights the heterogeneity of soil over large scales and shows the influence of small scale soil properties on soil infiltration however despite the considerable variability we still find that pf depends on particular spatial and temporal factors which are analyzed below 3 4 spatial controls of pf 3 4 1 land cover at these stations the fevent in the profile and the psws of pf are shown in fig 4 the frequency of pf gradually decreases from scrubland to grassland and meadow and barren land in addition to bare land psws in other stations is greater than fevent indicating that the sws of pf event is greater than sf event in order to quantitatively investigate the influence of vegetation on the occurrence of pf we analyzed the relationship between ndvi and the fevent and found an exponential trend between them fig 5 the fitting results showed that the frequency of pf is positively correlated with ndvi r2 0 242 p 0 01 3 4 2 soil properties in order to explore the influence of soil properties on the occurrence of pf we constructed a scatterplot of soil properties versus the frequency of pf fig 6 results showed that there were four soil properties that were significantly related to pf frequency which were bulk r 0 687 p 0 001 k s r 0 603 p 0 001 soc r 0 676 p 0 001 and residual water content θr r 0 448 p 0 01 our results showed that lower bulk increased the incidence of pf which is due to lower bulk reflecting a larger number of macropores anderson et al 1990 moreover macropores have a large influence on k s bouma 1982 which leads to a significantly positive relationship between k s and pf r 0 603 p 0 001 soc is closely related to soil structure pore volume size distribution and connectivity and hydrophobicity guo and lin 2018 both of which have important effects on the occurrence of pf larsbo et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 and jiang et al 2017 found that the greater the dry density of the soil the greater the θr in fig 6 we also observed a positive correlation between θr and bulk r 0 756 p 0 01 in other words the greater the θr the greater the bulk and less pf will occur 3 5 temporal controls of pf we found that the occurrence of pf is not only controlled by spatial factors but also by time variable factors we analyzed the variation of pf frequency in different seasons fig 7 a our results show that the average relative frequency the ratio between the sum of pf events in a certain month and all pf events of pf in summer jun 20 jul 24 aug 17 is much greater than in other months may 14 sep 9 oct 5 the seasonal variation of pf frequency may be caused by seasonal differences in rainfall vegetation and soil moisture our study area has a temperate semi arid to semi humid continental monsoon climate and more than 65 of the rainfall occurs in summer li et al 2009 fig 7c also shows that the rainfall in summer is much higher than the other seasons seasonal variation in rainfall leads to seasonal differences in vegetation fig 7b and soil moisture fig 7d similarly in summer the soil is wetter rsmmp is higher and the vegetation is more florescent the ndvim is greater the control of vegetation on pf has been described in section 3 4 1 so we do not repeat it here however the influence of initial soil moisture on pf varies between different landscape types the influences of initial soil moisture and rainfall on the occurrence of pf are discussed below in more detail 3 5 1 initial soil moisture we found that in some layers scrub layer 4 5 hcg1 layer 3 4 and layer 4 5 hcg2 layer 3 4 meadow layer 2 3 barren1 layer 2 3 the mean value of the initial soil moisture of pf events was lower than that of sf events fig 8 the initial soil moisture of pf events was higher than that of sf events in the other layers we compared the sand content of the two categories category 1 pf events had higher initial soil moisture than sf events θint pf θint sf category 2 sf events had higher initial soil moisture than pf events θint pf θint sf and found that the sand content of layers with θint pf θint sf was much higher than the sand content of the layers with θint pf θint sf fig 9 3 5 2 rainfall many studies have recognized that the pattern of rainfall is the most important controlling factor of pf graham and lin 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 commonly short duration and high intensity rainfall are conducive to the occurrence of pf while long duration and low intensity rainfall tends to uniformly moisten soil and produce sf guo and lin 2018 given the absence of in situ observations of rainfall in the soil moisture observation network cmfd rainfall data was used to investigate the influence of rainfall on the pf occurrence we calculated the amount of cumulative rainfall the total rainfall of an infiltration event corresponding to all infiltration events at each observation station fig 10 our results showed that the amount of cumulative rainfall of a pf event was significantly greater than that of a sf event p 0 01 which is consistent with previous data larsbo 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 4 discussion 4 1 variability of pf due to the strong heterogeneity of the factors that affect pf guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 pf has high variability among layers and among different observation stations based on the average value of pf of each layer the frequency of pf tends to decrease with an increase in depth fig 4 and table 3 but this rule is not followed at all stations moreover the deep soil properties e g gravel content and root distribution of these stations are quite different hence the frequency of deep pf is more variable many studies have found that abundant roots and gravel are conducive to the occurrence of pf johnson and lehmann 2006 li et al 2009 bogner et al 2010 jia et al 2017 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 we did not accurately measure the distribution of roots and gravel in the profiles of these stations hence we cannot quantitatively describe their impact on the occurrence of pf gjettermann et al 1997 guo and lin 2018 until now most studies on pf have focused on locations with similar physical conditions e g forests with temperate climates demand et al 2019 our research includes landscape types scrubland grassland meadow and barren land other than forests in cold mountainous areas and we find that the pf of these observation stations decreases as the vegetation coverage decreases in our study the occurrence of pf for a single soil moisture profile 2 22 18 73 is different from other studies and the maximum frequency of pf is much lower than in other studies liu and lin 2015 demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 compared with a forest the root systems of the observation stations we chose are sparse which is less conducive to the occurrence of pf in addition vegetation cover affects soc which in turn changes soil hydrophobicity and soil fauna activity affecting the occurrence of pf wyatt et al 2021 moreover the rainfall at our selected stations is also lower gjettermann et al 1997 guo and lin 2018 rainfall is one of the most important factors affecting pf hence pf occurrence at these observation stations is lower wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition the pf frequency of our stations are relatively small which may also be caused by the method we defined pf events the quantification of pf in current research is various liu and lin 2015 defined pf as an event in which at least one deeper probe responds to rainfall input earlier than a shallower soil moisture or an event in which the shallow and deep soil moisture respond sequentially but a soil moisture between them does not respond some studies also defined the event that the wetting front velocity is greater than a certain fixed value experiment measurement hardie et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 or model simulation demand et al 2019 as pf tang et al 2020 defined any event in which soil moisture does not respond sequentially from the surface to the depth as pf in this study only events in which the deeper soil moisture response is earlier than the shallower layer or the shallower and deeper layers respond at the same time were defined as pf the frequency of pf should be considered as a lower bound i e probably underestimated the actual pf occurrence 4 2 the influence of soil properties on pf we found that low bulk low θr high k s and high soc were conducive to the occurrence of pf in this study however these results are different from some previous studies that have reached completely different conclusions koestel et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 larsbo et al 2016 paradelo et al 2016 some previous studies found that low bulk high k s and high soc are not conducive to the occurrence of pf larsbo et al 2014 2016 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 moreover there is a contradiction between the abundance of soil pores and the occurrence of pf on the one hand large pores are an important path for pf and abundant pores are conducive to the occurrence of pf mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 on the other hand abundant pores mean that the contact area between the soil matrix and the outside world is larger hence a larger amount of water can penetrate into the matrix and this is not conducive to the occurrence of pf jarvis 2007 larsbo et al 2016 bulk k s and soc are related to soil pores so their impact on pf can likewise appear contradictory in addition a significant relationship between soil texture and pf was not found in this study although some studies have found that soil texture is an additional important factor affecting pf guo and lin 2018 tang et al 2020 this difference may be caused by our principles of soil moisture stations selection we chose the main soil texture type silt loam of the soil moisture stations which we set up in the same texture of soil the difference between sand silt and clay at different stations is very small so the relationships between sand silt clay and pf frequency at these stations are not significant 4 2 1 bulk bulk has an important influence on water holding capacity and water transmission nimmo 2021 we found that lower bulk increased the incidence of pf which can be attributed to the fact that lower bulk reflects a larger number of macropores koestel et al 2012 studied a large number of breakthrough curves and found that there was a negative correlation between bulk and the strength of preferential transport the average bulk was 1 41 g cm3 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 found that less pf occurs in the soil after compaction the soil bulk became larger however koestel et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 and paradelo et al 2016 found that the strength of preferential transport was directly proportional to bulk in farmland the average bulk was 1 47 g cm3 1 55 g cm3 and 1 39 g cm3 respectively bulk has contradictory effects on occurrence of pf because bulk reflects both the abundance of macropores suggesting more pf when lower and the density of the matrix material suggesting more pf when higher nimmo 2021 we compared bulk with other studies and found that the pf frequency is proportional to bulk at stations with higher bulk koestel et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 while it is inversely proportional at stations with lower bulk koestel et al 2012 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 we infer that this contradiction can be attributed to the existence of a threshold for the impact of bulk on pf occurrence when bulk is below this threshold the pf frequency is inversely proportional to bulk and when bulk is above this threshold the pf frequency is proportional to bulk compaction increased bulk will reduce soil porosity which is unconducive to the occurrence of pf however further compaction will strengthen the continuity of macropores which is conducive to the occurrence of pf jarvis 2007 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 4 2 2 soc soc is closely related to soil structure pore volume size distribution and connectivity guo and lin 2018 kerr and ochsner 2020 jia et al 2020 our study indicated that pf frequency was proportional to the soc fig 7 bundt et al 2001 and hagedorn and bundt 2002 found that the soc concentration in the pf path is 15 75 and 37 46 greater than the concentration in the matrix respectively greater soc enhances fauna activity gjettermann et al 1997 and creates a soil environment conducive to the occurrence of pf arocena et al 2010 guo and lin 2018 rahbeh 2019 found that soil organic matter is positively correlated with pf and low soil organic matter is unconducive to the aggregation and formation of macropores however with a larger soc the flow capacity of micron sized pores in the soil column is increased this prevents flow in the larger pores from being activated thereby significantly reducing the strength of pf ghafoor et al 2013 larsbo et al 2016 this complex relationship between soc and pf may be attributed to soil properties ratio of soc to clay it is not soc but complex soc complex of soc and clay that affects soil structure larsbo et al 2016 rahbeh 2019 and research has shown that the soc clay composite threshold is 0 1 dexter et al 2008 at low soc and clay content e g 0 5 2 soc and 10 20 clay content pf and soc are positively correlated due to the formation of macropores when soc clay approaches or exceeds the composite threshold rahbeh 2019 when the soc content is higher as the soc increases the number of macropores will instead decrease high soc leads to the formation of micron sized pores and these pores lead water to penetrate into the matrix which is unconducive to the occurrence of pf larsbo et al 2016 rahbeh 2019 larsbo et al 2016 also showed that as soc increases soil porosity will peak beyond this peak value if soc continues to increase soil porosity will instead decrease the clay content of our selected observation stations is 8 fig 6 and the complexing of soc and clay will form large macropores a scenario that is conducive to the occurrence of pf 4 2 3 ks k s also relates to water transport because macroscopic pores have a great influence on k s bouma 1982 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 found that k s was proportional to the number of macropores and to the intensity of pf we obtained similar results that is pf frequency was proportional to k s r 0 603 p 0 01 however etana et al 2013 and larsbo et al 2016 found that low k s was conducive to the occurrence of pf other studies performed under near saturation conditions also found that pf was weaker in soil columns with greater porosity larger k s larsbo et al 2014 katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 larsbo et al 2014 suggested that columns with smaller imaged porosity had lower near saturated hydraulic conductivities which presumably resulted in increased water pressures that were sufficient to generate flow in larger but still percolating pores however in cold mountainous areas it is difficult for soil moisture to approach saturation and rainfall is poor hence rainwater preferentially migrates through the large pores in the soil soil with large k s has more macropores and better pore connectivity which is conducive to the occurrence of pf guo and lin 2018 4 3 influence of initial soil moisture on pf the classical assumption of the relationship between pf and initial soil moisture is that higher initial soil moisture is conducive to the occurrence of pf this is due to the fact that higher initial soil moisture should lead to water pressure in the soil matrix approaching or exceeding the threshold water pressure rendering pf more likely to occur under rainfall guo and lin 2018 however the actual relationship between the two is rather complex many studies have found that the effect of initial soil water content on pf varies between different regions demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 we also found that in different soil layers the initial soil water content had different effects on pf fig 9 for soil layers with higher sand content the lower the soil moisture the stronger the hydrophobicity which is conducive to the occurrence of pf however in soils with lower sand content wet soils are more prone to pf combined data indicate that for soils with macropore flow as the main type of pf higher initial soil moisture is conducive to the occurrence of pf while for soils that are susceptible to finger flow such as sandy soil drier precursor conditions are conducive to the occurrence of pf dekker and ritsema 1994 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 5 conclusion we analyzed 2 288 infiltration events at eight soil moisture observation stations in the upper reaches of the hrb in order to investigate the occurrence and controlling factors of pf in mountainous areas pf frequency across all layers of these eight stations ranged from 0 to 22 28 due to differences in the methods for determining pf events the frequency of pf occurrences should be considered as the lower bound pf frequency decreased with increasing depth while pf variability increased with increasing depth the maximum pf frequency of our observation stations was lower than previous studies because we did not select forest stations and rainfall in our study area was low our results showed that spatial parameters land cover and soil properties and temporal factors rainfall and initial soil water content jointly controlled the occurrence of pf the pf frequency in scrubland was the greatest followed by grassland and meadow and finally barren land low bulk low θr high k s and high soc were conducive to the occurrence of pf our results contrast with those in some previous studies these contradictions can be explained by comparing the differences in soil properties and moisture conditions between different climatic regions and locations we infer that there is a threshold for the influence of bulk on pf it has different effects on pf above and below this threshold in cold mountainous areas where soil moisture is difficult to saturate and rainfall input is low soil moisture observation stations with high k s and soc were conducive to the occurrence of pf in addition due to seasonal changes in rainfall vegetation and soil moisture there were also seasonal differences in pf the greater the cumulative rainfall the greater the possibility of pf occurrence however due to the hydrophobicity of dry sand we found that the effect of initial soil water content on pf changed in different locations in areas with high sand content dry soil was conducive to the occurrence of pf while in areas with low sand content the situation was reversed this study shows that the temporal and spatial factors have different effects on pf occurrence in different areas and under different initial conditions future research needs to be carried out in additional contrasting locations in order to better understand the impact of soil properties on pf

3577,preferential flow pf has a faster migration speed and is an important process affecting hydrological geochemical and ecological cycles however the factors that control pf during infiltration are not fully understood especially in the data scarce high and cold mountainous areas where few studies have been focused on pf we selected eight soil moisture observation stations in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin hrb northwest china during the growing season from 2014 to 2019 the soil moisture was monitored every 30 min at 5 depths 5 15 25 40 and 60 cm at each station in order to analyze the occurrence and spatial temporal control of pf in a cold mountainous environment according to the difference in response time of shallower and deeper soil moisture to rainfall infiltration events were classified into pf and matrix flow our results show that the frequency of pf events across all layers of these stations ranged from 0 to 22 28 as depth increased the average pf frequency gradually decreased but the coefficient of variation of pf frequency increased the effect of vegetation on the occurrence of pf was profound because vegetation affects root distribution and fauna activities which affects the occurrence of pf our results also show that the frequency of pf gradually decreases from scrubland to grassland and meadow and barren land low bulk density low residual water content high saturated hydraulic conductivity and high soil organic carbon were found to be conducive to the occurrence of pf in addition we found that pf possessed a high degree of seasonal variability because of its strong dependence on soil moisture rainfall and vegetation conditions high rainfall was conducive to pf occurrence in areas with high sand content low initial soil moisture was conducive to pf occurrence likely due to hydrophobicity whereas high initial soil moisture was conducive to pf occurrence in areas with low sand content overall vegetation soil properties and water conditions seem to jointly affect the factors that occur in spatial temporal of pf and the influence of initial soil moisture on pf varies across different sand content findings of this study reveal the occurrence and control factors of pf which will improve our understanding of water cycling related to the infiltration process recharge process and the runoff generation process at hillslope over the cold mountainous areas keywords preferential flow soil properties hydrophobicity cold mountainous areas land cover 1 introduction preferential flow pf refers to the phenomenon whereby a fluid bypasses most of the matrix when passing through a porous medium and selects a preferred path in order to pass through the medium at a faster speed flury et al 1994 lin 2010 guo and lin 2018 a large number of studies have shown the ubiquity of pf in various landscapes jarvis 2007 koestel and jorda 2014 wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo et al 2018 jarvis 2020 due to the faster migration speed of pf it is considered to be an important factor affecting the hydrological cycle guo et al 2014 2019 soil erosion tao et al 2020 hillslope stability kukemilks et al 2018 wang et al 2019 farmland productivity zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015b and many other geochemical and ecological processes kan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 li et al 2021 a soil moisture sensor network provides a method for long term large scale and continuous monitoring of pf in a natural state ochsner et al 2013 bogena et al 2018 guo et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2018 tang et al 2020 this method has been widely used to study the spatial and temporal variability of pf at a watershed scale demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 many studies have found that the occurrence of pf is affected by various spatial and temporal factors wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 spatial factors influencing pf mainly include vegetation topographic characteristics and soil texture and the hydraulic properties which together provide a flow path for the occurrence of pf wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the most important temporal factors affecting pf are rainfall water input and initial soil moisture wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 gao et al 2019 these factors jointly control the occurrence of pf but the influence of these factors on pf is usually station specific and may even be contradictory under different conditions guo and lin 2018 the influence of control factors on pf varies from site to site guo and lin 2018 for soil porosity intuitively it should be evident that higher soil porosity will enhance pf since macropore is the main path of pf mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 however a high soil porosity denotes that the surface area between the pores and the matrix is large and a large amount of water will penetrate into the matrix which is less conducive to the occurrence of pf jarvis 2007 larsbo et al 2016 many soil properties bulk density bulk saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and soil organic carbon soc related to soil porosity also have similar contradictions in their influence on pf gjettermann et al 1997 jarvis 2007 larsbo et al 2014 2016 gao et al 2018 guo and lin 2018 for example bulk which is related to water transmission and water capacity reflects not only the abundance of macropores but also the density of the matrix material nimmo 2021 hence the relationship between bulk and pf is diverse across different studies koestel et al 2012 2013 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition the influence of soil moisture on pf also varies across different research areas drier soils in areas with high sand content are conducive to the occurrence of pf but pf in other areas is positively correlated with the initial soil moisture guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 overall these factors have different effects on pf at different study areas current researches on pf mainly focus on farmland koestel et al 2013 larsbo et al 2014 2016 and humid mountains or hills wiekenkamp et al 2016 demand et al 2019 guo et al 2019 tang et al 2020 few studies have investigated the occurrence and control of pf in cold mountainous areas li et al 2013 hu et al 2016 in an arid endorheic river basin the water resources of the entire basin mainly originate in the headwater mountainous regions zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2020a pf is of great significance to the hydrological process in such study areas xiao et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 found that pf is the main source of groundwater recharge accounting for 66 4 of the total recharge for grassland in the northern qinghai tibet plateau gao et al 2020b found that the deep soil moisture in the degraded alpine meadow was supplied by pf paquette et al 2018 believed that the pf path is the principal hydrological pathways of headwater catchments in permafrost areas in addition pf is of great significance to the process of snowmelt infiltration into frozen soil stahli et al 1996 mohammed et al 2021 however the mechanism of pf control and occurrence in alpine regions are still poor understanding the occurrence and control of pf is important for understanding the flow process of pf and can improve water resource management therefore the main aim of this study is to identify and compare the occurrence of pf using a soil moisture network in a mountainous area we analyze the effects of spatial factors vegetation and soil characteristics and temporal factors initial soil moisture and rainfall on the occurrence of pf more specifically we attempt to answer the following questions are there any pf control factors that are specific to cold mountainous areas how do these control factors affect pf occurrence in such areas given that the influence of soil properties on pf can be contradictory clarifying the main mechanisms that control the initiation persistence and dynamics in spatial and temporal of pf in the alpine region 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this research was carried out in the upper reaches of the heihe river basin hrb china s second largest inland river basin or terminal lake cheng et al 2014 it is located in the qilian mountains 97 29 101 32 e 37 43 39 39 e on the northern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau and has an area of over 27 103 km2 fig 1 a the study area has a temperate semi arid to semi humid continental monsoon climate and lies at an altitude of 2000 5500 m above sea level according to the observed meteorological data from 1960 to 2012 the average annual temperature ranges from 3 c to 7 c and the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to 700 mm geng et al 2014 due to the high altitude semi arid climate the temperature and precipitation have large temporal and spatial variability within the study area qi and cai 2007 zhang et al 2016 most of the precipitation occurs from june to august accounting for about 65 of the annual precipitation zhang et al 2016 the strong vertical difference in temperature and precipitation has also led to a zonal vegetation distribution consisting of forests alpine meadows grasslands scrublands and sparse vegetation yang et al 2015 tian et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the main land cover types in the study area are grassland forest water body and barren land fig 1b and the main soil texture categories are silt loam silt and sandy loam usda classification tian et al 2017 2 2 soil moisture network in order to investigate the dynamically changing characteristics of soil moisture in the upstream stream of the hrb under different environmental conditions a long term soil moisture observation network including 32 soil moisture stations was established in july 2013 fig 1a these stations include locations with different land cover forest grassland meadow and barren land and soil types silt loam silt and sandy loam and different altitudes within the upper reaches of the heihe river zhang et al 2017 tian et al 2019 at each station soil pits with a depth of 70 cm were excavated and 5te sensors decagon devices inc pullman usa were inserted horizontally to avoid the impact on vertical water flow at 5 15 25 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface soil moisture was measured at a temporal resolution of 30 min which is sufficient for studying soil hydrological processes in most cases lozano parra et al 2016 tian et al 2019 at the depth where the sensors were installed undisturbed and disturbed soil samples were collected with metal cylinders and zipped bags respectively we attempted to install the sensors at each observation station in vertical arrays but this was not always possible due to the influence of rocks roots and channels therefore there is a slight horizontal deviation relative to the ideal vertical array wiekenkamp et al 2016 after installation the excavated pit was refilled with the original soil and compacted to the initial state layer by layer in order to restore the natural soil matrix structure as much as possible after sensor installation we measured the station related parameters including land cover type slope aspect and rooting depth the collected soil samples were used to determine the key soil properties of each soil moisture observation station including bulk soil porosity k s soc soil water retention curve and soil texture details of the measurement processes of the above soil properties can be found in tian et al 2017 2 3 rainfall and ndvi under normal circumstances high precision rainfall data are obtained through the deployment of ground based meteorological observation stations guo et al 2018 tang et al 2020 but their spatial coverage is limited especially in mountainous areas such stations are scarce and it is more difficult to measure rainfall on a large scale yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015a therefore in order to analyze the impact of rainfall on the occurrence of pf we extracted rainfall data from the reanalysis data set china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd yang et al 2010 he et al 2020 cmfd is china s first near surface meteorological raster dataset with a high temporal and spatial resolution time resolution is 3 h spatial resolution is 0 1 0 1 and it is widely used in china meng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the monthly cumulative rainfall pm of each station was calculated as following 1 p mi i y 2014 i y 2018 p y i in the above equations y is the year i is the month including the may june july august september and october py i is the monthly cumulative rainfall in order to reflect the surface vegetation conditions of our observation stations we extracted the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi during the growing season from 2015 to 2019 except for 2016 from the surface vegetation index data of the qilian mountains and used their maximum values as the ndvi of the corresponding station cihlar et al 1994 huete et al 2002 the time resolution of the data set is 1 month and the spatial resolution is 30 m 30 m both the rainfall data and ndvi are from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn en the monthly average ndvi ndvim of each station was calculated as following 2 ndv i mi ndv i 2015 i n d v i 2017 i n d v i 2018 i n d v i 2019 i 4 in the above equations i is the month ndvi2015 i is the ndvi value for a certain month in 2015 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 soil moisture in a recent review nimmo 2021 concluded that the continuity of the flow path together with the properties and soil moisture of the surrounding matrix material are the main controlling factors of pf to study the temporal spatial control factors of pf in cold mountainous areas we selected a subset of stations with small slope and with different land covers demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 we selected stations with a relatively small k s to ensure a long response time difference between the upper and lower soil layer moisture we also chose stations where the data gap during 2014 to 2019 was 3 months in the end we selected 8 soil moisture stations including those located on scrubland scrub high coverage grassland hcg1 and hcg2 medium coverage grassland mcg1 and mcg2 meadow meadow and barren land barren1 and barren2 the locations and basic characteristics of these soil moisture stations are shown in fig 1 and table 1 we have collected soil moisture data since 2013 with a time resolution of 30 min in addition using the method provided by decagon cobos and chambers 2010 soil specific calibration was performed on each station tian et al 2019 in order to fully restore the soil to its natural state and to eliminate the influence of freeze thaw cycles on soil moisture we selected only the growing seasons in each of the years from 2014 to 2019 from may 1 to october 15 each year liu et al 2015 as the study period prior to subsequent data analysis a detailed data quality control check was performed following the procedures of wiekenkamp et al 2016 and tian et al 2019 the specific steps were 1 outliers were removed using quantitative plausibility checks removing any value beyond the range of 0 90 plus peaks and unreasonable fluctuations of soil moisture 2 through visual data inspection any unreliable data caused by equipment problems such as insufficient battery power was eliminated in order to keep the infiltration events of each layer consistent only periods when sensors in all five layers had recorded an observation were selected for subsequent analysis in addition the monthly average soil moisture in each station profile smmp was also calculated as following 3 s m mpi l 1 5 s m mli l l 1 5 l with 4 s m mli y 2014 i y 2019 i s m yml 6 in the above equations y is the year i is the month smyml is the monthly average soil water content of the l th layer in a certain month of a certain year smmli is the monthly average soil moisture of each layer l is the thickness of the soil layer because the smmp of different stations are very various in order to facilitate the comparison of the monthly changes of the smmp of different stations calculated the ratio of smmp to the average soil moisture content rsmmp of the profile 5 rs m mp s m mp s m ya in the above equations smya is the average soil moisture of the profile during the growing season from 2014 to 2019 2 4 2 determination of the infiltration event according to the definition of infiltration events by tian et al 2019 each infiltration event was determined by establishing its start and end times for a soil moisture sequence if its soil moisture increased continuously the start time of the increase in soil moisture is defined as the starting time ts of the infiltration event and the end time of moisture increase is defined as the end time te of the infiltration event any infiltration events occurring within six hours of one another i e the time interval between the end of the previous event and the start of the next event was 6 h were merged into the same event lozano parra et al 2015 lozano parra et al 2016 tian et al 2019 in order to eliminate any increase in soil moisture caused by sensor errors infiltration events in which the difference in soil moisture between te and ts of the event was 0 3 were removed rosenbaum et al 2010 lozano parra et al 2015 lozano parra et al 2016 finally any soil moisture increases caused by fluctuations in soil temperature were eliminated using temperature corrected soil moisture data following the methodology of saito et al 2013 and kapilaratne and lu 2017 the identification of infiltration events was performed automatically using dedicated matlab scripts we also calculated the soil water storage increment at each depth as follows tian et al 2019 6 sws l t s t e δ θ i j with 7 δ θ i j δ θ i j δ θ i j 0 0 δ θ i j 0 in the above equations sws is the soil water storage increment cm l is the thickness of the soil layer cm δ θ i j δ θ i δ t j δ θ i j δ θ i j is the change of soil moisture vol 2 4 3 event classification after determining the infiltration event of each layer of soil the response time series of the specific location was used to classify the flow behavior pf was defined as non sequential response of the soil moisture that is for the same rainfall the response time of deep soil was faster than that of shallow soil graham and lin 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition due to the high flow velocities of pf it might also result in a sequential response with a very small difference in infiltration event response time hardie et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 demand et al 2019 however there is no uniform and effective method to determine the moving speed of the wet front corresponding to pf hardie et al 2013 demand et al 2019 moreover as the soil moisture was monitored every 30 min and it is impossible to obtain an accurate moving speed of the wet front jin et al 2018 hence we only defined pf events as those with the same response time or non sequential response for deeper and shallower soil infiltration events according to the above principles we can use the soil moisture data of two adjacent layers to determine whether pf occurs between the two layers we can classify four types of response scenarios a layer 1st 2nd the soil moisture response time of the second layer is earlier than or equal to the first layer b layer 2nd 3rd the soil moisture response time of the third layer is earlier than or equal to the second layer c layer 3rd 4th the soil moisture response time of the fourth layer is earlier than or equal to the third layer d layer 4th 5th the soil moisture response time of the fifth layer is earlier than or equal to the fourth layer the classification of all infiltration events was automatically implemented in matlab an example of non sequential response to an infiltration event is shown in fig 2 in addition the frequency of pf events fevent and the proportion of sws of pf events psws can be calculated by taking the ratio of pf events to total infiltration events 8 f event n pf n pf n sf in the above equations npf and nsf are the number of pf events and sequential flow sf events respectively 9 p sws sw s pf sw s pf s w s sf in the above equations swspf and swssf are the total sws of pf events and sequential flow sf events respectively 2 4 4 statistical analysis in this study one way analysis of variance anova or kruskal wallis test methods were used to test the differences in data pf frequency initial soil moisture sand content and rainfall lange et al 2008 specific steps were 1 a homogeneity test was used to determine whether the data satisfied the normal distribution and homogeneity of variance 2 when the variance of the data set satisfied normality and homogeneity anova and a post hoc bonferroni test were used to test the difference between different sets of data if these conditions were not satisfied kruskal wallis anova with a post hoc dunn test were used for analysis the statistics were implemented through spss spss 25 0 spss inc and matlab r2018a the mathworks 3 results 3 1 frequency of pf table 2 shows the total number of infiltration events and the corresponding sws of each layer of the eight selected soil moisture observation stations as well as the number of pf events and their sws combining data from all layers of the eight stations we obtained a total of 2 288 infiltration events with a total sws of 5 404 86 cm from 2014 to 2019 among them there were a total of 216 pf events with a sws of 671 26 cm the fevent and psws were 9 44 and 12 36 respectively on average the sws of a pf event was 3 11 cm and the sws of a sf event was 2 37 cm this showed that the sws of a pf event was greater than a sf event 3 2 discrepancies in pf between layers the proportion of the various types of pf event scenarios outlined above is shown in table 2 the relative frequency of pf in the second layer layer 1 2 is 41 6 in the third layer layer 2 3 is 25 93 in the fourth layer layer 3 4 is 19 44 and in the fifth layer layer 4 5 is 12 96 however the frequency of pf in each layer does not decrease with depth for all stations the frequency of pf at each depth is shown in fig 3 in these soil moisture stations the variability of pf frequency at each depth was high table 3 the standard deviation was highest in layer 4 5 fevent 7 11 psws 11 28 followed by layer 3 4 fevent 7 08 psws 8 77 then layer 1 2 fevent 6 84 psws 8 21 and finally layer 2 3 fevent 6 70 psws 11 17 the variation of standard deviation with depth may be attributed to variations in root systems and soil properties with depth the root penetration depth varies greatly between soil moisture stations scrub greater than 70 cm meadow 10 cm through observation of station profile photos supplementary material fig s1 we found that some stations contain gravel in their deep layer but the distribution of gravel varies among stations macropores produced by roots johnson and lehmann 2006 li et al 2009 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020 and gravel zhao et al 2020 are important paths for pf hence the greater standard deviation of pf in the deeper layers may be attributed to differences in the root system and gravel content of these layers across different stations 3 3 general relevance of pf pf was observed at each station but the relative frequency of pf among these stations the standard deviation of the pf frequency of these station profiles is 5 8 and between different layers table 3 was very variable the variability of pf between different landscape types and even within some stations was high which highlights the heterogeneity of soil over large scales and shows the influence of small scale soil properties on soil infiltration however despite the considerable variability we still find that pf depends on particular spatial and temporal factors which are analyzed below 3 4 spatial controls of pf 3 4 1 land cover at these stations the fevent in the profile and the psws of pf are shown in fig 4 the frequency of pf gradually decreases from scrubland to grassland and meadow and barren land in addition to bare land psws in other stations is greater than fevent indicating that the sws of pf event is greater than sf event in order to quantitatively investigate the influence of vegetation on the occurrence of pf we analyzed the relationship between ndvi and the fevent and found an exponential trend between them fig 5 the fitting results showed that the frequency of pf is positively correlated with ndvi r2 0 242 p 0 01 3 4 2 soil properties in order to explore the influence of soil properties on the occurrence of pf we constructed a scatterplot of soil properties versus the frequency of pf fig 6 results showed that there were four soil properties that were significantly related to pf frequency which were bulk r 0 687 p 0 001 k s r 0 603 p 0 001 soc r 0 676 p 0 001 and residual water content θr r 0 448 p 0 01 our results showed that lower bulk increased the incidence of pf which is due to lower bulk reflecting a larger number of macropores anderson et al 1990 moreover macropores have a large influence on k s bouma 1982 which leads to a significantly positive relationship between k s and pf r 0 603 p 0 001 soc is closely related to soil structure pore volume size distribution and connectivity and hydrophobicity guo and lin 2018 both of which have important effects on the occurrence of pf larsbo et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 and jiang et al 2017 found that the greater the dry density of the soil the greater the θr in fig 6 we also observed a positive correlation between θr and bulk r 0 756 p 0 01 in other words the greater the θr the greater the bulk and less pf will occur 3 5 temporal controls of pf we found that the occurrence of pf is not only controlled by spatial factors but also by time variable factors we analyzed the variation of pf frequency in different seasons fig 7 a our results show that the average relative frequency the ratio between the sum of pf events in a certain month and all pf events of pf in summer jun 20 jul 24 aug 17 is much greater than in other months may 14 sep 9 oct 5 the seasonal variation of pf frequency may be caused by seasonal differences in rainfall vegetation and soil moisture our study area has a temperate semi arid to semi humid continental monsoon climate and more than 65 of the rainfall occurs in summer li et al 2009 fig 7c also shows that the rainfall in summer is much higher than the other seasons seasonal variation in rainfall leads to seasonal differences in vegetation fig 7b and soil moisture fig 7d similarly in summer the soil is wetter rsmmp is higher and the vegetation is more florescent the ndvim is greater the control of vegetation on pf has been described in section 3 4 1 so we do not repeat it here however the influence of initial soil moisture on pf varies between different landscape types the influences of initial soil moisture and rainfall on the occurrence of pf are discussed below in more detail 3 5 1 initial soil moisture we found that in some layers scrub layer 4 5 hcg1 layer 3 4 and layer 4 5 hcg2 layer 3 4 meadow layer 2 3 barren1 layer 2 3 the mean value of the initial soil moisture of pf events was lower than that of sf events fig 8 the initial soil moisture of pf events was higher than that of sf events in the other layers we compared the sand content of the two categories category 1 pf events had higher initial soil moisture than sf events θint pf θint sf category 2 sf events had higher initial soil moisture than pf events θint pf θint sf and found that the sand content of layers with θint pf θint sf was much higher than the sand content of the layers with θint pf θint sf fig 9 3 5 2 rainfall many studies have recognized that the pattern of rainfall is the most important controlling factor of pf graham and lin 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 commonly short duration and high intensity rainfall are conducive to the occurrence of pf while long duration and low intensity rainfall tends to uniformly moisten soil and produce sf guo and lin 2018 given the absence of in situ observations of rainfall in the soil moisture observation network cmfd rainfall data was used to investigate the influence of rainfall on the pf occurrence we calculated the amount of cumulative rainfall the total rainfall of an infiltration event corresponding to all infiltration events at each observation station fig 10 our results showed that the amount of cumulative rainfall of a pf event was significantly greater than that of a sf event p 0 01 which is consistent with previous data larsbo 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 4 discussion 4 1 variability of pf due to the strong heterogeneity of the factors that affect pf guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 pf has high variability among layers and among different observation stations based on the average value of pf of each layer the frequency of pf tends to decrease with an increase in depth fig 4 and table 3 but this rule is not followed at all stations moreover the deep soil properties e g gravel content and root distribution of these stations are quite different hence the frequency of deep pf is more variable many studies have found that abundant roots and gravel are conducive to the occurrence of pf johnson and lehmann 2006 li et al 2009 bogner et al 2010 jia et al 2017 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 we did not accurately measure the distribution of roots and gravel in the profiles of these stations hence we cannot quantitatively describe their impact on the occurrence of pf gjettermann et al 1997 guo and lin 2018 until now most studies on pf have focused on locations with similar physical conditions e g forests with temperate climates demand et al 2019 our research includes landscape types scrubland grassland meadow and barren land other than forests in cold mountainous areas and we find that the pf of these observation stations decreases as the vegetation coverage decreases in our study the occurrence of pf for a single soil moisture profile 2 22 18 73 is different from other studies and the maximum frequency of pf is much lower than in other studies liu and lin 2015 demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 compared with a forest the root systems of the observation stations we chose are sparse which is less conducive to the occurrence of pf in addition vegetation cover affects soc which in turn changes soil hydrophobicity and soil fauna activity affecting the occurrence of pf wyatt et al 2021 moreover the rainfall at our selected stations is also lower gjettermann et al 1997 guo and lin 2018 rainfall is one of the most important factors affecting pf hence pf occurrence at these observation stations is lower wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition the pf frequency of our stations are relatively small which may also be caused by the method we defined pf events the quantification of pf in current research is various liu and lin 2015 defined pf as an event in which at least one deeper probe responds to rainfall input earlier than a shallower soil moisture or an event in which the shallow and deep soil moisture respond sequentially but a soil moisture between them does not respond some studies also defined the event that the wetting front velocity is greater than a certain fixed value experiment measurement hardie et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 or model simulation demand et al 2019 as pf tang et al 2020 defined any event in which soil moisture does not respond sequentially from the surface to the depth as pf in this study only events in which the deeper soil moisture response is earlier than the shallower layer or the shallower and deeper layers respond at the same time were defined as pf the frequency of pf should be considered as a lower bound i e probably underestimated the actual pf occurrence 4 2 the influence of soil properties on pf we found that low bulk low θr high k s and high soc were conducive to the occurrence of pf in this study however these results are different from some previous studies that have reached completely different conclusions koestel et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 larsbo et al 2016 paradelo et al 2016 some previous studies found that low bulk high k s and high soc are not conducive to the occurrence of pf larsbo et al 2014 2016 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 moreover there is a contradiction between the abundance of soil pores and the occurrence of pf on the one hand large pores are an important path for pf and abundant pores are conducive to the occurrence of pf mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 on the other hand abundant pores mean that the contact area between the soil matrix and the outside world is larger hence a larger amount of water can penetrate into the matrix and this is not conducive to the occurrence of pf jarvis 2007 larsbo et al 2016 bulk k s and soc are related to soil pores so their impact on pf can likewise appear contradictory in addition a significant relationship between soil texture and pf was not found in this study although some studies have found that soil texture is an additional important factor affecting pf guo and lin 2018 tang et al 2020 this difference may be caused by our principles of soil moisture stations selection we chose the main soil texture type silt loam of the soil moisture stations which we set up in the same texture of soil the difference between sand silt and clay at different stations is very small so the relationships between sand silt clay and pf frequency at these stations are not significant 4 2 1 bulk bulk has an important influence on water holding capacity and water transmission nimmo 2021 we found that lower bulk increased the incidence of pf which can be attributed to the fact that lower bulk reflects a larger number of macropores koestel et al 2012 studied a large number of breakthrough curves and found that there was a negative correlation between bulk and the strength of preferential transport the average bulk was 1 41 g cm3 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 found that less pf occurs in the soil after compaction the soil bulk became larger however koestel et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 and paradelo et al 2016 found that the strength of preferential transport was directly proportional to bulk in farmland the average bulk was 1 47 g cm3 1 55 g cm3 and 1 39 g cm3 respectively bulk has contradictory effects on occurrence of pf because bulk reflects both the abundance of macropores suggesting more pf when lower and the density of the matrix material suggesting more pf when higher nimmo 2021 we compared bulk with other studies and found that the pf frequency is proportional to bulk at stations with higher bulk koestel et al 2013 katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 while it is inversely proportional at stations with lower bulk koestel et al 2012 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 we infer that this contradiction can be attributed to the existence of a threshold for the impact of bulk on pf occurrence when bulk is below this threshold the pf frequency is inversely proportional to bulk and when bulk is above this threshold the pf frequency is proportional to bulk compaction increased bulk will reduce soil porosity which is unconducive to the occurrence of pf however further compaction will strengthen the continuity of macropores which is conducive to the occurrence of pf jarvis 2007 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 4 2 2 soc soc is closely related to soil structure pore volume size distribution and connectivity guo and lin 2018 kerr and ochsner 2020 jia et al 2020 our study indicated that pf frequency was proportional to the soc fig 7 bundt et al 2001 and hagedorn and bundt 2002 found that the soc concentration in the pf path is 15 75 and 37 46 greater than the concentration in the matrix respectively greater soc enhances fauna activity gjettermann et al 1997 and creates a soil environment conducive to the occurrence of pf arocena et al 2010 guo and lin 2018 rahbeh 2019 found that soil organic matter is positively correlated with pf and low soil organic matter is unconducive to the aggregation and formation of macropores however with a larger soc the flow capacity of micron sized pores in the soil column is increased this prevents flow in the larger pores from being activated thereby significantly reducing the strength of pf ghafoor et al 2013 larsbo et al 2016 this complex relationship between soc and pf may be attributed to soil properties ratio of soc to clay it is not soc but complex soc complex of soc and clay that affects soil structure larsbo et al 2016 rahbeh 2019 and research has shown that the soc clay composite threshold is 0 1 dexter et al 2008 at low soc and clay content e g 0 5 2 soc and 10 20 clay content pf and soc are positively correlated due to the formation of macropores when soc clay approaches or exceeds the composite threshold rahbeh 2019 when the soc content is higher as the soc increases the number of macropores will instead decrease high soc leads to the formation of micron sized pores and these pores lead water to penetrate into the matrix which is unconducive to the occurrence of pf larsbo et al 2016 rahbeh 2019 larsbo et al 2016 also showed that as soc increases soil porosity will peak beyond this peak value if soc continues to increase soil porosity will instead decrease the clay content of our selected observation stations is 8 fig 6 and the complexing of soc and clay will form large macropores a scenario that is conducive to the occurrence of pf 4 2 3 ks k s also relates to water transport because macroscopic pores have a great influence on k s bouma 1982 mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 found that k s was proportional to the number of macropores and to the intensity of pf we obtained similar results that is pf frequency was proportional to k s r 0 603 p 0 01 however etana et al 2013 and larsbo et al 2016 found that low k s was conducive to the occurrence of pf other studies performed under near saturation conditions also found that pf was weaker in soil columns with greater porosity larger k s larsbo et al 2014 katuwal et al 2015 paradelo et al 2016 larsbo et al 2014 suggested that columns with smaller imaged porosity had lower near saturated hydraulic conductivities which presumably resulted in increased water pressures that were sufficient to generate flow in larger but still percolating pores however in cold mountainous areas it is difficult for soil moisture to approach saturation and rainfall is poor hence rainwater preferentially migrates through the large pores in the soil soil with large k s has more macropores and better pore connectivity which is conducive to the occurrence of pf guo and lin 2018 4 3 influence of initial soil moisture on pf the classical assumption of the relationship between pf and initial soil moisture is that higher initial soil moisture is conducive to the occurrence of pf this is due to the fact that higher initial soil moisture should lead to water pressure in the soil matrix approaching or exceeding the threshold water pressure rendering pf more likely to occur under rainfall guo and lin 2018 however the actual relationship between the two is rather complex many studies have found that the effect of initial soil water content on pf varies between different regions demand et al 2019 tang et al 2020 we also found that in different soil layers the initial soil water content had different effects on pf fig 9 for soil layers with higher sand content the lower the soil moisture the stronger the hydrophobicity which is conducive to the occurrence of pf however in soils with lower sand content wet soils are more prone to pf combined data indicate that for soils with macropore flow as the main type of pf higher initial soil moisture is conducive to the occurrence of pf while for soils that are susceptible to finger flow such as sandy soil drier precursor conditions are conducive to the occurrence of pf dekker and ritsema 1994 guo and lin 2018 demand et al 2019 5 conclusion we analyzed 2 288 infiltration events at eight soil moisture observation stations in the upper reaches of the hrb in order to investigate the occurrence and controlling factors of pf in mountainous areas pf frequency across all layers of these eight stations ranged from 0 to 22 28 due to differences in the methods for determining pf events the frequency of pf occurrences should be considered as the lower bound pf frequency decreased with increasing depth while pf variability increased with increasing depth the maximum pf frequency of our observation stations was lower than previous studies because we did not select forest stations and rainfall in our study area was low our results showed that spatial parameters land cover and soil properties and temporal factors rainfall and initial soil water content jointly controlled the occurrence of pf the pf frequency in scrubland was the greatest followed by grassland and meadow and finally barren land low bulk low θr high k s and high soc were conducive to the occurrence of pf our results contrast with those in some previous studies these contradictions can be explained by comparing the differences in soil properties and moisture conditions between different climatic regions and locations we infer that there is a threshold for the influence of bulk on pf it has different effects on pf above and below this threshold in cold mountainous areas where soil moisture is difficult to saturate and rainfall input is low soil moisture observation stations with high k s and soc were conducive to the occurrence of pf in addition due to seasonal changes in rainfall vegetation and soil moisture there were also seasonal differences in pf the greater the cumulative rainfall the greater the possibility of pf occurrence however due to the hydrophobicity of dry sand we found that the effect of initial soil water content on pf changed in different locations in areas with high sand content dry soil was conducive to the occurrence of pf while in areas with low sand content the situation was reversed this study shows that the temporal and spatial factors have different effects on pf occurrence in different areas and under different initial conditions future research needs to be carried out in additional contrasting locations in order to better understand the impact of soil properties on pf

was analyzed generally the results demonstrated higher aet values at sites associated with temperate and cropland areas analysis of the contributions of key elements to aet based on bma suggested that rn and gpp were the two most sensitive factors for aet variation over all the selected sites with the exception of rn and gpp ws strongly influenced aet estimations in the wetland and cold regions aet variation in the cropland and grassland regions was significantly affected by sm regardless of landscape type and climate zone rn was the most important variable in each season followed by gpp ws ta and sm ta was found to be important in spring while ws showed a strong influence on aet in winter in terms of prediction performance the mean correlation coefficient and root mean square error rmse of the bma model was 0 92 and 0 49 mm day respectively using more factors with a posterior inclusion probability larger than 0 9 improved the performance of bma overall the strong correlation and low

identifying basins under water stress senay et al 2011 ochege et al 2019 and for predicting the depletion of groundwater resources cao et al 2014 which is considered one of the most pressing global issues anderson et al 2012 since aet is a typical element of complicated surface atmosphere processes and climate systems wang and dickinson 2012 aet variation should be analyzed together with changes in hydrological variables for better application in water management key variables such as gross primary production gpp wind speed ws air temperature ta net radiation rn soil moisture sm precipitation p and air pressure pa are widely known as factors influencing aet variability wang et al 2007 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b liu and yang 2010 qiu et al 2016 yang et al 2013 however the order of importance of these variables varied among previous studies for example rn was the most important variable for deriving aet with the highest correlation values in wang et al 2007 when assessing the evaporation process ta and ws were the main reasons for the change in aet liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b in the north china plain from 1998 2005 liu and yang 2010 indicated that the change in aet from 1961 to 2006 in the yellow river basin was mainly affected by precipitation qiu et al 2016 investigated the impact of soil moisture on latent heat flux directly proportional to aet as soil moisture exhibits dominant control over aet in water limited regions yang et al 2013 found a strong relationship between aet and gpp the gross uptake of carbon dioxide for plant photosynthesis which related to transpiration from the vegetation canopy although these studies have attempted to relate aet variability to changes in different factors the links between these hydrological parameters and aet in different land cover types and climate zones have rarely been discussed together however the importance of these variables has been demonstrated through their contributions to physical aet models wang et al 2007 yao et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2007 predicted aet using rn ta and vegetation index with comparable accuracy yao et al 2013 developed a modified satellite based priestley taylor ms pt model to estimate aet using the rn ta pa and vegetation index zhao et al 2013 summarized physical aet methods using meteorological factors and sm extraction functions in hydrological models yang et al 2013 developed a new model to calculate aet using gpp the large variability of these parameters due to heterogeneous land and atmospheric conditions could result in inaccurate estimates of aet direct calculation of aet based on available empirical equations remains challenging due to the discontinuity or lack of input data regarding some regions sudheer et al 2003 schüttemeyer et al 2007 thus it is important to calculate the response of aet to different hydrological variables in an optimal manner that can be extrapolated to future predictions across different regions to examine the importance of different hydrological variables to aet sensitivity analysis and trend analysis have been widely assessed through statistical models with sensitivity coefficients and regression lines izadifar and elshorbagy 2010 yao et al 2014 djaman et al 2016 however these studies examined the relative importance of hydrological variables to aet mainly based on the range of variation or simple correlation relationships at a single scale without considering seasonal effects thus it is necessary to generate a regression model that can provide not only the importance of all of the inputs but also accurate prediction and model uncertainty at multiple scales bayesian model averaging bma is a popular method for model selection combination and prediction based on estimations of model uncertainty hoeting et al 1999 duan et al 2007 chen et al 2015 specifically the use of bma is appealing for its many advantages in hydrological climate and forest studies duan et al 2007 hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 min et al 2007 qiu et al 2016 the bma has been used to optimize hydrological models with high accuracy duan et al 2007 it has the advantage of forecasting surface air temperature due to the low resulting uncertainties hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 min et al 2007 qiu et al 2016 applied the bma method to predict tree mortality in chinese fir plantations with comparable accuracy in the context of bma applications in evapotranspiration recent studies have mainly focused on reference evapotranspiration et0 and aet forecasts using the bma model estimation of et0 for the future period from 2011 to 2099 was projected from climate factors by xing et al 2014 medina and tian 2020 evaluated the bma model for improving the accuracy of daily and weekly et0 forecasts chia et al 2021 improved et0 estimation by hybridizing three machine learning models however et0 is generally less difficult to estimate using empirical models with climate factors westerhoff 2015 and the training process for bma requires real et0 which is difficult to measure mathematically due to uncertainty in the selection of suitable methods jing et al 2019 therefore there has been growing interest in merging aet from a combination of generalized complementary relationship gcr hao et al 2019a surface energy balance seb sun et al 2019 machine learning and other physical models chen et al 2015 using bma using et0 as input data hao et al 2019a combined bma with gcr models to improve the accuracy of regional aet estimates for china sun et al 2019 found that all bma methods fixed posterior inclusion probability pip and random outperformed seb models for estimating aet in cropland eight satellite based aet models were merged by chen et al 2015 to improve aet prediction using bma despite these potential applications in aet merging work bma s contributions to quantifying the effect of primary hydrological factors on change in aet and linear prediction based on posterior probability have rarely been addressed therefore this study aims to address the seasonal driving mechanism of aet variation and to examine the linear prediction of bma using the concept of pip the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the characteristics of aet and key hydrological factors in four land cover types and three climate zones associated with 12 flux tower sites in northeast asia 2 to quantify the seasonal effects of primary hydrological factors on change in aet using pip from bma 3 to examine bma pip linear regression performance and 4 to determine how these factors affect predictive performance in both the bma training and testing processes overall this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the seasonal driving factors of aet variation under different agrometeorological environments to better understand their implications for hydrological processes in recent climate change situations 2 methods and dataset 2 1 study area covering northeast asia including china korea and japan the study area is characterized by a variety of land cover types with a range of environmental conditions we selected 12 flux tower sites fig 1 from fluxnet2015 http fluxnet fluxdata org data fluxnet2015 dataset and fluxnet ch4 community product https fluxnet org data fluxnet ch4 community product which occupied four different land cover types grassland five sites cn cng cn dan cn du2 cn ham and cn hgu forest three sites cn cha cn din and cn qia wetland two sites cn ha2 and jp bby and cropland two sites jp mse and kr crk the main crop in jp mse and kr crk is paddy rice the selected sites included three climate zones cold seven sites cn cha cn cng cn du2 cn ha2 cn hgu jp bby kr crk polar two sites cn dan and cn ham and temperate three sites cn din cn qia and jp mse based on köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 the detailed geophysical characteristics given in table 1 show strong variation in average annual temperature and precipitation at the selected sites the cn din cn qia and jp mse sites are situated in the temperate zone 13 8 c to 19 6 c and receive more annual precipitation 1 457 to 1 618 mm due to dominant monsoon events the other sites that lie in cold and polar zones had low annual temperature 1 5 c to 11 2 c and precipitation 223 to 1 040 mm 2 2 dataset the observational hydrological variables including daily average values of gpp ws ta rn sm p and pa were obtained from eddy covariance systems at the 12 flux tower sites the variables ws and ta were measured using sonic anemometer thermometers a100r csat3 and rm81000 and temperature probes and sensors hmp45c and wxt510 respectively rn data were collected by net radiometers cnr 1 and cnr2 rainfall was recorded continuously using a tipping bucket rain gauge te 525 and 52203 and weather transmitter wxt510 the top of 5 cm to 10 cm sm was measured by tdr sensors cs615 and cs616 pa was measured by an air pressure transmitter cs105 and wxt510 net ecosystem exchange nee of co2 was measured with an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa then gpp was partitioned from nee using nighttime based reichstein et al 2005 and daytime based lasslop et al 2010 approaches the final gpp was chosen based on the efficiency of the two methods these variables were measured daily over a 30 minute time interval during the specific study period for each site table 1 the webb peerman leuning density correction webb et al 1980 and the marginal distribution sampling method reichstein et al 2005 were used for gap filling and calculation of the datasets before further analysis zhang et al 2007 the kr crk site also employed quality control procedures and statistical corrections kim et al 2016 2 3 bayesian model averaging bma a linear model structure is assumed in bma y is aet in this study and b is a constant with n explanatory variables x the seven hydrological factors in this work which gives 1 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n b a is the regression coefficient of each variable it is the final output of bma that can be used to predict aet bma addresses the problem by considering the linear models for all possible combinations as seven variables were used in this study there are a total of 27 combinations and thus 27 linear models bma calculates each linear model s posterior probability pmp as weight 2 p m i y p y m i p m i j 1 2 7 p y m j p m j p m i y is the pmp of the i th linear model m i p y m i is the marginal likelihood of m i and p m i is the prior probability p m i when the model pmp is calculated from eq 2 the weighted regression coefficient is calculated as 3 p a y i 1 2 7 p a m i y p m i y where p a y is the weighted regression coefficient based on pmp of each linear model after obtaining the model averaging regression coefficient the constant b can be calculated using the training data in this study the inputs of bma are aet y in eqn 1 and seven hydrological factors x in eqn 1 based on previous machine learning hydrology studies anantrasirichai et al 2018 ghasemigoudarzi et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the first half of the data from each site were used for training the other half were used for testing in this study after inputting the forcing data the next step is to specify prior probability because it is an important process when implementing bma hoeting et al 1999 the prior distributions represent the prior belief about model parameters and can influence the model weights given that the amount of prior information is often limited the zellner s uniform model prior zellner 1986 was considered as the choice of prior structures for the regression coefficients in this study then the bma was implemented using the bayesian model sampling bms package zeugner and feldkircher 2015 in r software following a hands on tutorial zeugner 2011 using the bms package the pip and weighted regression coefficient of each hydrological factor were obtained eqn 2 and 3 to understand the importance of inputs and predict aet based on linear model averaging eqn 1 2 4 performance measures correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse were used to measure the performance of the aet models in this study 4 r i 1 n m i m g i g i 1 n m i m 2 i 1 n g i g 2 5 rmse i 1 n m i g i 2 n where g i and m i are the ground based and model based values respectively the subscript i denotes the ith sample n represents the total number of data pairs of the study period and g and m refer to the average value of the measured and model based values respectively 3 results and discussion to quantify the effect of hydrological factors on aet aet characteristics in different climate zones and landcover types are presented in section 3 1 then section 3 2 focuses on investigating interactions among hydrological factors and aet next the contribution and seasonal effects of primary hydrological factors on change in aet are quantified using bma in section 3 3 finally section 3 4 examines bma pip linear regression performance and discusses how these hydrological drivers affect predictive performance in both the bma training and testing processes 3 1 aet variation at flux tower sites fig 2 presents variation in daily aet values estimated at twelve flux towers which represented four different land cover types and three climate zones overall average aet values at the twelve sites ranged from 1 04 to 2 70 mm day with relatively larger values in cropland and temperate zones croplands dominated by irrigated paddy rice achieved higher aet values which is consistent with previous studies jang et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 rice paddy areas are characterized by a relatively wet environment controlled by frequent irrigation song et al 2014 aet in such areas was highly related to water from precipitation or irrigation during dry seasons li and cui 1996 which increases aet because of increased soil water availability mueller et al 2017 the jp mse is a wet cropland site located in a temperate zone with heavy rainfall 1457 0 mm and that is continuously flooded during the irrigation period approximately doy 114 to 225 miyata et al 2005 another paddy rice site kr crk is located in a cold zone with annual rainfall of 1180 9 mm and a shorter irrigation period approximately doy 105 to 176 hwang et al 2020 these two sites had a similar ta of around 12 c table 1 thus similar ranges for aet were found for these sites fig 2 however the maximum value of aet for the two sites was different fig 2 this is because annual precipitation at site jp mse was nearly 300 mm greater than that at site kr crk and the irrigation period of site jp mse 112 days was longer than that of site kr crk 72 days also the maximum value of aet for the two sites was measured during the irrigation period doy 133 and doy 172 respectively therefore the maximum value of aet in site jp mse was larger than that in site kr crk for forest areas average aet at cn qia approximately 1 82 mm day was similar to that at cn din approximately 1 72 mm day this is because the two sites are located in the same climate zone with similar annual temperature and precipitation table 1 for site cn cha aet range was quite similar to that of cn qia and cn din but the mean and median values were the lowest among forest sites due to low annual precipitation and ta in the cold climate zone this was consistent with the finding of lu et al 2020 who suggested that the main factors affecting aet in the cold zone at high latitudes were precipitation and ta also lower aet was detected by yin et al 2013 in the cold region of the northwest tibetan plateau tp where 73 of regions with decreasing precipitation had decreasing aet similarly the aet at grassland sites was low due to low precipitation and ta in cold and polar climate areas de oliveira et al 2018 3 2 correlation among hydrological factors pearson correlation coefficients r were generated to investigate interactions among the above mentioned hydrological parameters fig 3 the average r of the hydrological variables across different land cover types and climate zones and their mean values are shown in fig 3 among the seven parameters in terms of mean r ws and p showed weak correlations with the other variables with average absolute values of r 0 2 sm showed positive correlations to gpp ta rn and p r 0 17 to 0 35 and negative correlations to pa r 0 06 and ws r 0 02 aet appeared to be highly associated with gpp ta and rn r 0 63 to 0 83 the correlation results of factors in each land cover type and climate zone were similar except for pa ta aet gpp and sm pa showed negative correlations to other variables in most of the area fig 3 however a positive correlation between ta and pa was found in wetland and polar areas this is because the cn ham cn hgu and cn ha2 sites in these areas appeared in the tp fig 1 in the plateau region a hydrostatic response to atmospheric warming leads to higher pressure toumi et al 1999 which means higher ta increases pa over the plateau region hence increasing ta increases the vapor pressure deficit then increases aet in tp moore 2012 this anti correlation between pa and ta also explains why positive correlations between pa and aet were only found in this plateau area wetland and polar in fig 3 the correlation between gpp and sm was positive in grassland r 0 46 and cropland r 0 38 while a weak relationship between gpp and sm was found in forest 0 01 and wetland r 0 06 similarly the correlation between aet and sm was low for forest r 0 06 and wetland r 0 01 areas and high for grassland r 0 47 and cropland r 0 40 regions this is because the influence of surface sm on grasses and crops is greater than that on forest vegetation which mainly relies on deep roots to tap sm below the surface jipp et al 1998 this was in line with the findings of previous studies guo et al 2015 stocker et al 2018 for example guo et al 2015 reported that the increment in sm affects the variability of gpp in grassland reducing sm decreased gpp by up to 40 in stocker et al 2018 the r between aet and gpp was the highest in grassland r 0 76 and forest r 0 83 areas while rn was most correlated with aet in wetland r 0 92 and cropland r 0 90 areas in terms of climate zones gpp had the closest relationship with aet in the cold zone while rn was most correlated with aet in polar and temperate zones these findings suggests that correlations among hydrological parameters varied in different land cover types and climate zones which highlights the need to separate the actual effect of each variable on variation and seasonal patterns of aet 3 3 climate driver contributions to aet as a useful ranking measure the pip was used to check how much the data favored inclusion of a variable in regression tsangarides 2004 barbieri and berger 2004 suggested that variables with pip values above 0 5 are important for prediction and a pip value greater than 0 8 was used to determine key factors in previous hydrologic studies achieng and zhu 2019 liu et al 2021 to quantify the contribution of climate drivers to aet the pip of each parameter was estimated using the r package bms fig 4 presents the average pip values of hydrological variables over all selected sites across three different climate zones and four land cover types over northeast asia the higher average pip value of 1 00 indicated that the rn was the most important factor for aet variation followed by gpp 0 98 ws 0 80 sm 0 67 p 0 51 ta 0 46 and pa 0 37 these results indicate that increases in rn gpp ws sm and p led to a strong increase in aet previous findings liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b wang et al 2007 also found that the energy of the aet process was enhanced by higher rn liu et al 2019a b found that rn plays an important role in aet in northwest china which has an arid climate the highest correlation between aet and rn was shown in wang et al 2007 who argued that a formula based on rn has better accuracy than any complicated models in addition all of the low longitude sites exhibited larger amounts of rn i e cn ha2 and cn dan and considerable effects of rn the roles of the other climatic components also varied in accordance with flux tower location and land cover type pip values of gpp across all areas were higher than 0 9 which was similar to that of rn as gpp was highly related to transpiration from the vegetation canopy when gpp was larger aet was higher due to the consequent greater transpiration yang et al 2013 strong effects of ws were found in the cold climate zone pip value is 0 84 and wetland areas pip value is 1 00 in cold and wet areas a small change in wind speed can cause considerable variation in aet because water vapor can be stored as well as transferred by the wind in dry air davarzani et al 2014 it was clear that sm also produced strong effects on aet consistent with zhao et al 2013 who mentioned that aet is a function of water availability in soil that is directly expressed by actual sm similarly aet was more sensitive to sm in cropland pip value is 1 00 because the sm contained in the upper profile was directly connected to the process of soil evaporation verstraeten et al 2008 however sm non significantly contributed to aet changes in forest areas because vegetative transpiration comprised a large portion of aet in terms of p the average pip value in cropland was the lowest although p is one of the factors affecting water availability in soil the negative correlation between sm and p in cropland indicates an impact of irrigation on sm ta is important to the aet process due to its significant contribution to the transfer of heat and vapor lagouarde and mcaneney 1992 the impact of ta appeared to be larger in regions characterized by lower precipitation and colder temperatures this was demonstrated by dai et al 1999 who argued that higher ta during the low precipitation days may increase the sensible heat flux and then decrease the latent heat flux directly proportional to aet pa showed weaker influences on changes of aet compared with other factors the contributions of these variables were offset or counteracted due to their weak correlation with other factors as mentioned in section 3 2 fig 5 shows the average seasonal pip values of seven inputs for each climate zone and land cover type the pip values of all the factors in the cold area were normally higher than those in other climate zones the rn strongly influenced aet estimation in the cold zone except in winter when the wind speed showed a strong influence on aet with the pip of 0 99 instead rn was the most important variable in polar climate area with pip values of 1 in each season because sites under this climate zone were mid latitude mainland sites they were affected by the atmospheric circulation in the tp this region was dry with little rainfall and a long duration of sunshine li et al 2013 there was no clear rainfall seasonality at any sites unlike sm solar radiation was primary factor in all four seasons in the temperate zone the effect of ta on aet in different seasons varied the pip value of ta in spring summer autumn and winter was 0 96 0 80 0 37 and 0 08 respectively there were not big differences between seasonal pip of ta in other climate zones the contribution of p to aet was the smallest for each season in temperate zone due to large and stable precipitation in grassland strong contributions of sm were detected in summer with a pip value of 0 81 the source of water for aet is sm distributed via precipitation sala et al 1992 because most rain falls during the summer at grassland sites also evaporation from soil accounted for more than 70 of aet in these areas hao et al 2019b therefore aet was largely dependent on sm in the rainy season at grassland sites whereas aet variation in the cropland regions was not significantly affected by sm in the summer pip 0 48 in the forest area rn strongly influenced aet estimations for each season and ws had the second greatest impact on aet estimation in autumn and greatest impact in winter due to the large seasonal ws therefore ws had a greater impact on aet than sm for forest and windy areas especially in winter regardless of climate zone and landscape type the average pip value of all selected sites showed that rn was the most important variable in spring summer and autumn ws showed the greatest influence on aet in winter ta and gpp were important to aet in spring and autumn respectively the difference in their contribution mainly depended on the difference in water and energy conditions across regions controlling the response of aet to climatic components as mentioned in stoy et al 2006 overall the results of this study showed that most of the selected variables played key roles in aet in different seasons 3 4 evaluation of bma based aet after processing bma using the training dataset the weighted regression coefficient of each hydrological factor was obtained bma based aet can be estimated using the regression function in table 2 then the performance of bma was examined at the 12 flux tower sites using the daily observed testing dataset for four different land cover types and three climate zones fig 6 shows the time series comparisons of the bma modeled aet with flux tower observations the simulated aet was in agreement with the observed aet across all the sites as shown in fig 6 the observed and simulated patterns are similar except for some slight variations in the peaks due to uncertainty from the linear models the model accurately simulates aet despite the observed training and testing data differing for example in cn dan and cn du2 bma considers the relationship between aet and its related hydrological drivers hence the model consistently produces an accurate simulation despite differences between the training and testing datasets overestimation of aet was found in cn cng during february 2009 for the testing period at the cn hgu site bma underestimated aet from march to august 2016 during the training period and overestimated aet during autumn and winter of the testing period the training period started in may due to missing data while the other sites training processes began in january as we selected half of the data for the training process and half for the testing process the patterns of training and testing aet in cn cng and cn hgu are asymmetrical which may lead to prediction bias in the testing process a bias between the observed and simulated aet was found consistently in the winter season this is because the average pip of each factor in winter is smaller than in other seasons as shown in fig 5 only one factor s pip is larger than 0 8 in winter while three factors pip values are greater than 0 8 in other seasons the greater the number of important factors pip 0 8 used for training the better the accuracy of bma prediction results that can be obtained achieng and zhu 2019 liu et al 2021 the accuracy of the bma model for both training and testing processes was assessed by r and rmse and the average and range are presented in fig 7 generally the bma method predicted aet with r ranging from 0 83 to 0 97 and rmse from 0 32 mm day to 0 67 mm day across different sites in addition the r values of the testing and training processes were similar while the rmse values of the testing process was higher than that of the training process which indicated that bma training performed better than bma testing larger values of r were observed for wetland 0 97 and polar 0 95 areas in contrast smaller r values were found for forest 0 89 and temperate 0 88 areas similarly based on the lower rmse values the bma model was the best in wetland 0 32 mm day and polar 0 37 mm day areas fig 8 shows the impact of the number of important factors pip 0 9 on the predictive performance of bma both training and testing for aet as shown in fig 8 the greater the number of important factors there were in the model the higher the r and the lower the rmse in both training and testing there is an exponential increase in r corresponding to an initial increment of important factors from 2 to 3 conversely by increasing the number of important factors from 4 to 6 a sharp decline in rmse is found thus the model performs better with a greater number of important factors this finding is noteworthy because it implies that in related studies considering factor importance can greatly improve the model accuracy of bma the bma algorithm has the advantages of avoiding models with highly correlated predictors and over fitting models maltritz and molchanov 2013 bma was well suited for application in this study because independent variables were not correlated as described in section 3 2 therefore bma which includes averaging unbiased estimates of several possible models supported by the data hoeting et al 1999 generally performed well across different regions 4 conclusions this study applied a regression model bma to estimate the contributions of key hydrological variables on aet variation at twelve flux tower sites across different land cover types and climate zones in northeast asia generally each of the seven selected climatic parameters gpp ws ta rn sm p and pa responded with a different contribution to aet variation according to the underlying climate zone land cover type and local conditions rn and gpp played important roles in aet variation with strong effects over all of the sites sm also strongly influenced aet estimation for cropland and grassland regions aet variation in forest and cold regions was significantly affected by ws regardless of landscape type rn was the most important variable in each season ta and ws were found to be important in spring and winter respectively the performance of bma for the prediction of aet showed that bma is an efficient and accurate predictive model with low uncertainty especially for wetland and polar regions the average correlation coefficient of the bma model was 0 92 and the mean rmse value of bma was 0 49 mm day bma performed better when using more factors with a pip greater than 0 9 bma can be considered an effective technique to explore aet climate interactions specifically bma appeared to be an advantageous approach for predicting aet for each land cover and climate zone which will be useful for water resource management in regions with high climate variability this study mainly considered climate impacts on aet using fixed hydrological factors on a point scale future studies should explore the impacts of land cover types on aet prediction and expand the bma method to a regional scale using different combinations of hydrological factors credit authorship contribution statement yuefeng hao conceptualization data curation formal analysis

3578,actual evapotranspiration aet is a critical component of hydrological processes accurate estimation of aet variation and its driving hydrological factors is vital for natural hazard adaptation and water resource management this study first used aet observations from fluxnet at 12 flux tower sites representing four different land cover types and three climate zones over northeast asia then the relationships and seasonal patterns among aet and seven hydrological variables of gross primary production gpp wind speed ws air temperature ta net radiation rn soil moisture sm precipitation p and air pressure pa were assessed using bayesian model averaging bma finally the performance of bma was examined at all flux tower sites and the impact of factor importance to predicting performance was analyzed generally the results demonstrated higher aet values at sites associated with temperate and cropland areas analysis of the contributions of key elements to aet based on bma suggested that rn and gpp were the two most sensitive factors for aet variation over all the selected sites with the exception of rn and gpp ws strongly influenced aet estimations in the wetland and cold regions aet variation in the cropland and grassland regions was significantly affected by sm regardless of landscape type and climate zone rn was the most important variable in each season followed by gpp ws ta and sm ta was found to be important in spring while ws showed a strong influence on aet in winter in terms of prediction performance the mean correlation coefficient and root mean square error rmse of the bma model was 0 92 and 0 49 mm day respectively using more factors with a posterior inclusion probability larger than 0 9 improved the performance of bma overall the strong correlation and low error demonstrate that bma is an effective approach to capturing aet and exploring its interaction with climatological anomalies across different regions especially under varied agricultural conditions which could improve crop water management keywords actual evapotranspiration hydrological factors bayesian model averaging northeast asia 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration aet is a critical component of hydrological cycles and water resource management aet refers to the amount of water that released from a land surface into the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration wang and dickinson 2012 studies on aet quantification and its variation based on changes in hydrological conditions are essential for mitigating and adapting to potential natural hazards in order to meet the challenges of food security through better crop water management ko and piccinni 2009 dutta et al 2016 yang et al 2017 aet has been used recently to develop drought indicators such as the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index kim and rhee 2016 and the standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index rehana and monish 2020 which are used to monitor and characterize drought conditions of water and energy limited regions as a useful indicator of the availability of agricultural water and plant water demand sun et al 2018 aet is a major component for identifying basins under water stress senay et al 2011 ochege et al 2019 and for predicting the depletion of groundwater resources cao et al 2014 which is considered one of the most pressing global issues anderson et al 2012 since aet is a typical element of complicated surface atmosphere processes and climate systems wang and dickinson 2012 aet variation should be analyzed together with changes in hydrological variables for better application in water management key variables such as gross primary production gpp wind speed ws air temperature ta net radiation rn soil moisture sm precipitation p and air pressure pa are widely known as factors influencing aet variability wang et al 2007 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b liu and yang 2010 qiu et al 2016 yang et al 2013 however the order of importance of these variables varied among previous studies for example rn was the most important variable for deriving aet with the highest correlation values in wang et al 2007 when assessing the evaporation process ta and ws were the main reasons for the change in aet liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b in the north china plain from 1998 2005 liu and yang 2010 indicated that the change in aet from 1961 to 2006 in the yellow river basin was mainly affected by precipitation qiu et al 2016 investigated the impact of soil moisture on latent heat flux directly proportional to aet as soil moisture exhibits dominant control over aet in water limited regions yang et al 2013 found a strong relationship between aet and gpp the gross uptake of carbon dioxide for plant photosynthesis which related to transpiration from the vegetation canopy although these studies have attempted to relate aet variability to changes in different factors the links between these hydrological parameters and aet in different land cover types and climate zones have rarely been discussed together however the importance of these variables has been demonstrated through their contributions to physical aet models wang et al 2007 yao et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2007 predicted aet using rn ta and vegetation index with comparable accuracy yao et al 2013 developed a modified satellite based priestley taylor ms pt model to estimate aet using the rn ta pa and vegetation index zhao et al 2013 summarized physical aet methods using meteorological factors and sm extraction functions in hydrological models yang et al 2013 developed a new model to calculate aet using gpp the large variability of these parameters due to heterogeneous land and atmospheric conditions could result in inaccurate estimates of aet direct calculation of aet based on available empirical equations remains challenging due to the discontinuity or lack of input data regarding some regions sudheer et al 2003 schüttemeyer et al 2007 thus it is important to calculate the response of aet to different hydrological variables in an optimal manner that can be extrapolated to future predictions across different regions to examine the importance of different hydrological variables to aet sensitivity analysis and trend analysis have been widely assessed through statistical models with sensitivity coefficients and regression lines izadifar and elshorbagy 2010 yao et al 2014 djaman et al 2016 however these studies examined the relative importance of hydrological variables to aet mainly based on the range of variation or simple correlation relationships at a single scale without considering seasonal effects thus it is necessary to generate a regression model that can provide not only the importance of all of the inputs but also accurate prediction and model uncertainty at multiple scales bayesian model averaging bma is a popular method for model selection combination and prediction based on estimations of model uncertainty hoeting et al 1999 duan et al 2007 chen et al 2015 specifically the use of bma is appealing for its many advantages in hydrological climate and forest studies duan et al 2007 hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 min et al 2007 qiu et al 2016 the bma has been used to optimize hydrological models with high accuracy duan et al 2007 it has the advantage of forecasting surface air temperature due to the low resulting uncertainties hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 min et al 2007 qiu et al 2016 applied the bma method to predict tree mortality in chinese fir plantations with comparable accuracy in the context of bma applications in evapotranspiration recent studies have mainly focused on reference evapotranspiration et0 and aet forecasts using the bma model estimation of et0 for the future period from 2011 to 2099 was projected from climate factors by xing et al 2014 medina and tian 2020 evaluated the bma model for improving the accuracy of daily and weekly et0 forecasts chia et al 2021 improved et0 estimation by hybridizing three machine learning models however et0 is generally less difficult to estimate using empirical models with climate factors westerhoff 2015 and the training process for bma requires real et0 which is difficult to measure mathematically due to uncertainty in the selection of suitable methods jing et al 2019 therefore there has been growing interest in merging aet from a combination of generalized complementary relationship gcr hao et al 2019a surface energy balance seb sun et al 2019 machine learning and other physical models chen et al 2015 using bma using et0 as input data hao et al 2019a combined bma with gcr models to improve the accuracy of regional aet estimates for china sun et al 2019 found that all bma methods fixed posterior inclusion probability pip and random outperformed seb models for estimating aet in cropland eight satellite based aet models were merged by chen et al 2015 to improve aet prediction using bma despite these potential applications in aet merging work bma s contributions to quantifying the effect of primary hydrological factors on change in aet and linear prediction based on posterior probability have rarely been addressed therefore this study aims to address the seasonal driving mechanism of aet variation and to examine the linear prediction of bma using the concept of pip the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the characteristics of aet and key hydrological factors in four land cover types and three climate zones associated with 12 flux tower sites in northeast asia 2 to quantify the seasonal effects of primary hydrological factors on change in aet using pip from bma 3 to examine bma pip linear regression performance and 4 to determine how these factors affect predictive performance in both the bma training and testing processes overall this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the seasonal driving factors of aet variation under different agrometeorological environments to better understand their implications for hydrological processes in recent climate change situations 2 methods and dataset 2 1 study area covering northeast asia including china korea and japan the study area is characterized by a variety of land cover types with a range of environmental conditions we selected 12 flux tower sites fig 1 from fluxnet2015 http fluxnet fluxdata org data fluxnet2015 dataset and fluxnet ch4 community product https fluxnet org data fluxnet ch4 community product which occupied four different land cover types grassland five sites cn cng cn dan cn du2 cn ham and cn hgu forest three sites cn cha cn din and cn qia wetland two sites cn ha2 and jp bby and cropland two sites jp mse and kr crk the main crop in jp mse and kr crk is paddy rice the selected sites included three climate zones cold seven sites cn cha cn cng cn du2 cn ha2 cn hgu jp bby kr crk polar two sites cn dan and cn ham and temperate three sites cn din cn qia and jp mse based on köppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 the detailed geophysical characteristics given in table 1 show strong variation in average annual temperature and precipitation at the selected sites the cn din cn qia and jp mse sites are situated in the temperate zone 13 8 c to 19 6 c and receive more annual precipitation 1 457 to 1 618 mm due to dominant monsoon events the other sites that lie in cold and polar zones had low annual temperature 1 5 c to 11 2 c and precipitation 223 to 1 040 mm 2 2 dataset the observational hydrological variables including daily average values of gpp ws ta rn sm p and pa were obtained from eddy covariance systems at the 12 flux tower sites the variables ws and ta were measured using sonic anemometer thermometers a100r csat3 and rm81000 and temperature probes and sensors hmp45c and wxt510 respectively rn data were collected by net radiometers cnr 1 and cnr2 rainfall was recorded continuously using a tipping bucket rain gauge te 525 and 52203 and weather transmitter wxt510 the top of 5 cm to 10 cm sm was measured by tdr sensors cs615 and cs616 pa was measured by an air pressure transmitter cs105 and wxt510 net ecosystem exchange nee of co2 was measured with an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa then gpp was partitioned from nee using nighttime based reichstein et al 2005 and daytime based lasslop et al 2010 approaches the final gpp was chosen based on the efficiency of the two methods these variables were measured daily over a 30 minute time interval during the specific study period for each site table 1 the webb peerman leuning density correction webb et al 1980 and the marginal distribution sampling method reichstein et al 2005 were used for gap filling and calculation of the datasets before further analysis zhang et al 2007 the kr crk site also employed quality control procedures and statistical corrections kim et al 2016 2 3 bayesian model averaging bma a linear model structure is assumed in bma y is aet in this study and b is a constant with n explanatory variables x the seven hydrological factors in this work which gives 1 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n b a is the regression coefficient of each variable it is the final output of bma that can be used to predict aet bma addresses the problem by considering the linear models for all possible combinations as seven variables were used in this study there are a total of 27 combinations and thus 27 linear models bma calculates each linear model s posterior probability pmp as weight 2 p m i y p y m i p m i j 1 2 7 p y m j p m j p m i y is the pmp of the i th linear model m i p y m i is the marginal likelihood of m i and p m i is the prior probability p m i when the model pmp is calculated from eq 2 the weighted regression coefficient is calculated as 3 p a y i 1 2 7 p a m i y p m i y where p a y is the weighted regression coefficient based on pmp of each linear model after obtaining the model averaging regression coefficient the constant b can be calculated using the training data in this study the inputs of bma are aet y in eqn 1 and seven hydrological factors x in eqn 1 based on previous machine learning hydrology studies anantrasirichai et al 2018 ghasemigoudarzi et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the first half of the data from each site were used for training the other half were used for testing in this study after inputting the forcing data the next step is to specify prior probability because it is an important process when implementing bma hoeting et al 1999 the prior distributions represent the prior belief about model parameters and can influence the model weights given that the amount of prior information is often limited the zellner s uniform model prior zellner 1986 was considered as the choice of prior structures for the regression coefficients in this study then the bma was implemented using the bayesian model sampling bms package zeugner and feldkircher 2015 in r software following a hands on tutorial zeugner 2011 using the bms package the pip and weighted regression coefficient of each hydrological factor were obtained eqn 2 and 3 to understand the importance of inputs and predict aet based on linear model averaging eqn 1 2 4 performance measures correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse were used to measure the performance of the aet models in this study 4 r i 1 n m i m g i g i 1 n m i m 2 i 1 n g i g 2 5 rmse i 1 n m i g i 2 n where g i and m i are the ground based and model based values respectively the subscript i denotes the ith sample n represents the total number of data pairs of the study period and g and m refer to the average value of the measured and model based values respectively 3 results and discussion to quantify the effect of hydrological factors on aet aet characteristics in different climate zones and landcover types are presented in section 3 1 then section 3 2 focuses on investigating interactions among hydrological factors and aet next the contribution and seasonal effects of primary hydrological factors on change in aet are quantified using bma in section 3 3 finally section 3 4 examines bma pip linear regression performance and discusses how these hydrological drivers affect predictive performance in both the bma training and testing processes 3 1 aet variation at flux tower sites fig 2 presents variation in daily aet values estimated at twelve flux towers which represented four different land cover types and three climate zones overall average aet values at the twelve sites ranged from 1 04 to 2 70 mm day with relatively larger values in cropland and temperate zones croplands dominated by irrigated paddy rice achieved higher aet values which is consistent with previous studies jang et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 rice paddy areas are characterized by a relatively wet environment controlled by frequent irrigation song et al 2014 aet in such areas was highly related to water from precipitation or irrigation during dry seasons li and cui 1996 which increases aet because of increased soil water availability mueller et al 2017 the jp mse is a wet cropland site located in a temperate zone with heavy rainfall 1457 0 mm and that is continuously flooded during the irrigation period approximately doy 114 to 225 miyata et al 2005 another paddy rice site kr crk is located in a cold zone with annual rainfall of 1180 9 mm and a shorter irrigation period approximately doy 105 to 176 hwang et al 2020 these two sites had a similar ta of around 12 c table 1 thus similar ranges for aet were found for these sites fig 2 however the maximum value of aet for the two sites was different fig 2 this is because annual precipitation at site jp mse was nearly 300 mm greater than that at site kr crk and the irrigation period of site jp mse 112 days was longer than that of site kr crk 72 days also the maximum value of aet for the two sites was measured during the irrigation period doy 133 and doy 172 respectively therefore the maximum value of aet in site jp mse was larger than that in site kr crk for forest areas average aet at cn qia approximately 1 82 mm day was similar to that at cn din approximately 1 72 mm day this is because the two sites are located in the same climate zone with similar annual temperature and precipitation table 1 for site cn cha aet range was quite similar to that of cn qia and cn din but the mean and median values were the lowest among forest sites due to low annual precipitation and ta in the cold climate zone this was consistent with the finding of lu et al 2020 who suggested that the main factors affecting aet in the cold zone at high latitudes were precipitation and ta also lower aet was detected by yin et al 2013 in the cold region of the northwest tibetan plateau tp where 73 of regions with decreasing precipitation had decreasing aet similarly the aet at grassland sites was low due to low precipitation and ta in cold and polar climate areas de oliveira et al 2018 3 2 correlation among hydrological factors pearson correlation coefficients r were generated to investigate interactions among the above mentioned hydrological parameters fig 3 the average r of the hydrological variables across different land cover types and climate zones and their mean values are shown in fig 3 among the seven parameters in terms of mean r ws and p showed weak correlations with the other variables with average absolute values of r 0 2 sm showed positive correlations to gpp ta rn and p r 0 17 to 0 35 and negative correlations to pa r 0 06 and ws r 0 02 aet appeared to be highly associated with gpp ta and rn r 0 63 to 0 83 the correlation results of factors in each land cover type and climate zone were similar except for pa ta aet gpp and sm pa showed negative correlations to other variables in most of the area fig 3 however a positive correlation between ta and pa was found in wetland and polar areas this is because the cn ham cn hgu and cn ha2 sites in these areas appeared in the tp fig 1 in the plateau region a hydrostatic response to atmospheric warming leads to higher pressure toumi et al 1999 which means higher ta increases pa over the plateau region hence increasing ta increases the vapor pressure deficit then increases aet in tp moore 2012 this anti correlation between pa and ta also explains why positive correlations between pa and aet were only found in this plateau area wetland and polar in fig 3 the correlation between gpp and sm was positive in grassland r 0 46 and cropland r 0 38 while a weak relationship between gpp and sm was found in forest 0 01 and wetland r 0 06 similarly the correlation between aet and sm was low for forest r 0 06 and wetland r 0 01 areas and high for grassland r 0 47 and cropland r 0 40 regions this is because the influence of surface sm on grasses and crops is greater than that on forest vegetation which mainly relies on deep roots to tap sm below the surface jipp et al 1998 this was in line with the findings of previous studies guo et al 2015 stocker et al 2018 for example guo et al 2015 reported that the increment in sm affects the variability of gpp in grassland reducing sm decreased gpp by up to 40 in stocker et al 2018 the r between aet and gpp was the highest in grassland r 0 76 and forest r 0 83 areas while rn was most correlated with aet in wetland r 0 92 and cropland r 0 90 areas in terms of climate zones gpp had the closest relationship with aet in the cold zone while rn was most correlated with aet in polar and temperate zones these findings suggests that correlations among hydrological parameters varied in different land cover types and climate zones which highlights the need to separate the actual effect of each variable on variation and seasonal patterns of aet 3 3 climate driver contributions to aet as a useful ranking measure the pip was used to check how much the data favored inclusion of a variable in regression tsangarides 2004 barbieri and berger 2004 suggested that variables with pip values above 0 5 are important for prediction and a pip value greater than 0 8 was used to determine key factors in previous hydrologic studies achieng and zhu 2019 liu et al 2021 to quantify the contribution of climate drivers to aet the pip of each parameter was estimated using the r package bms fig 4 presents the average pip values of hydrological variables over all selected sites across three different climate zones and four land cover types over northeast asia the higher average pip value of 1 00 indicated that the rn was the most important factor for aet variation followed by gpp 0 98 ws 0 80 sm 0 67 p 0 51 ta 0 46 and pa 0 37 these results indicate that increases in rn gpp ws sm and p led to a strong increase in aet previous findings liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b wang et al 2007 also found that the energy of the aet process was enhanced by higher rn liu et al 2019a b found that rn plays an important role in aet in northwest china which has an arid climate the highest correlation between aet and rn was shown in wang et al 2007 who argued that a formula based on rn has better accuracy than any complicated models in addition all of the low longitude sites exhibited larger amounts of rn i e cn ha2 and cn dan and considerable effects of rn the roles of the other climatic components also varied in accordance with flux tower location and land cover type pip values of gpp across all areas were higher than 0 9 which was similar to that of rn as gpp was highly related to transpiration from the vegetation canopy when gpp was larger aet was higher due to the consequent greater transpiration yang et al 2013 strong effects of ws were found in the cold climate zone pip value is 0 84 and wetland areas pip value is 1 00 in cold and wet areas a small change in wind speed can cause considerable variation in aet because water vapor can be stored as well as transferred by the wind in dry air davarzani et al 2014 it was clear that sm also produced strong effects on aet consistent with zhao et al 2013 who mentioned that aet is a function of water availability in soil that is directly expressed by actual sm similarly aet was more sensitive to sm in cropland pip value is 1 00 because the sm contained in the upper profile was directly connected to the process of soil evaporation verstraeten et al 2008 however sm non significantly contributed to aet changes in forest areas because vegetative transpiration comprised a large portion of aet in terms of p the average pip value in cropland was the lowest although p is one of the factors affecting water availability in soil the negative correlation between sm and p in cropland indicates an impact of irrigation on sm ta is important to the aet process due to its significant contribution to the transfer of heat and vapor lagouarde and mcaneney 1992 the impact of ta appeared to be larger in regions characterized by lower precipitation and colder temperatures this was demonstrated by dai et al 1999 who argued that higher ta during the low precipitation days may increase the sensible heat flux and then decrease the latent heat flux directly proportional to aet pa showed weaker influences on changes of aet compared with other factors the contributions of these variables were offset or counteracted due to their weak correlation with other factors as mentioned in section 3 2 fig 5 shows the average seasonal pip values of seven inputs for each climate zone and land cover type the pip values of all the factors in the cold area were normally higher than those in other climate zones the rn strongly influenced aet estimation in the cold zone except in winter when the wind speed showed a strong influence on aet with the pip of 0 99 instead rn was the most important variable in polar climate area with pip values of 1 in each season because sites under this climate zone were mid latitude mainland sites they were affected by the atmospheric circulation in the tp this region was dry with little rainfall and a long duration of sunshine li et al 2013 there was no clear rainfall seasonality at any sites unlike sm solar radiation was primary factor in all four seasons in the temperate zone the effect of ta on aet in different seasons varied the pip value of ta in spring summer autumn and winter was 0 96 0 80 0 37 and 0 08 respectively there were not big differences between seasonal pip of ta in other climate zones the contribution of p to aet was the smallest for each season in temperate zone due to large and stable precipitation in grassland strong contributions of sm were detected in summer with a pip value of 0 81 the source of water for aet is sm distributed via precipitation sala et al 1992 because most rain falls during the summer at grassland sites also evaporation from soil accounted for more than 70 of aet in these areas hao et al 2019b therefore aet was largely dependent on sm in the rainy season at grassland sites whereas aet variation in the cropland regions was not significantly affected by sm in the summer pip 0 48 in the forest area rn strongly influenced aet estimations for each season and ws had the second greatest impact on aet estimation in autumn and greatest impact in winter due to the large seasonal ws therefore ws had a greater impact on aet than sm for forest and windy areas especially in winter regardless of climate zone and landscape type the average pip value of all selected sites showed that rn was the most important variable in spring summer and autumn ws showed the greatest influence on aet in winter ta and gpp were important to aet in spring and autumn respectively the difference in their contribution mainly depended on the difference in water and energy conditions across regions controlling the response of aet to climatic components as mentioned in stoy et al 2006 overall the results of this study showed that most of the selected variables played key roles in aet in different seasons 3 4 evaluation of bma based aet after processing bma using the training dataset the weighted regression coefficient of each hydrological factor was obtained bma based aet can be estimated using the regression function in table 2 then the performance of bma was examined at the 12 flux tower sites using the daily observed testing dataset for four different land cover types and three climate zones fig 6 shows the time series comparisons of the bma modeled aet with flux tower observations the simulated aet was in agreement with the observed aet across all the sites as shown in fig 6 the observed and simulated patterns are similar except for some slight variations in the peaks due to uncertainty from the linear models the model accurately simulates aet despite the observed training and testing data differing for example in cn dan and cn du2 bma considers the relationship between aet and its related hydrological drivers hence the model consistently produces an accurate simulation despite differences between the training and testing datasets overestimation of aet was found in cn cng during february 2009 for the testing period at the cn hgu site bma underestimated aet from march to august 2016 during the training period and overestimated aet during autumn and winter of the testing period the training period started in may due to missing data while the other sites training processes began in january as we selected half of the data for the training process and half for the testing process the patterns of training and testing aet in cn cng and cn hgu are asymmetrical which may lead to prediction bias in the testing process a bias between the observed and simulated aet was found consistently in the winter season this is because the average pip of each factor in winter is smaller than in other seasons as shown in fig 5 only one factor s pip is larger than 0 8 in winter while three factors pip values are greater than 0 8 in other seasons the greater the number of important factors pip 0 8 used for training the better the accuracy of bma prediction results that can be obtained achieng and zhu 2019 liu et al 2021 the accuracy of the bma model for both training and testing processes was assessed by r and rmse and the average and range are presented in fig 7 generally the bma method predicted aet with r ranging from 0 83 to 0 97 and rmse from 0 32 mm day to 0 67 mm day across different sites in addition the r values of the testing and training processes were similar while the rmse values of the testing process was higher than that of the training process which indicated that bma training performed better than bma testing larger values of r were observed for wetland 0 97 and polar 0 95 areas in contrast smaller r values were found for forest 0 89 and temperate 0 88 areas similarly based on the lower rmse values the bma model was the best in wetland 0 32 mm day and polar 0 37 mm day areas fig 8 shows the impact of the number of important factors pip 0 9 on the predictive performance of bma both training and testing for aet as shown in fig 8 the greater the number of important factors there were in the model the higher the r and the lower the rmse in both training and testing there is an exponential increase in r corresponding to an initial increment of important factors from 2 to 3 conversely by increasing the number of important factors from 4 to 6 a sharp decline in rmse is found thus the model performs better with a greater number of important factors this finding is noteworthy because it implies that in related studies considering factor importance can greatly improve the model accuracy of bma the bma algorithm has the advantages of avoiding models with highly correlated predictors and over fitting models maltritz and molchanov 2013 bma was well suited for application in this study because independent variables were not correlated as described in section 3 2 therefore bma which includes averaging unbiased estimates of several possible models supported by the data hoeting et al 1999 generally performed well across different regions 4 conclusions this study applied a regression model bma to estimate the contributions of key hydrological variables on aet variation at twelve flux tower sites across different land cover types and climate zones in northeast asia generally each of the seven selected climatic parameters gpp ws ta rn sm p and pa responded with a different contribution to aet variation according to the underlying climate zone land cover type and local conditions rn and gpp played important roles in aet variation with strong effects over all of the sites sm also strongly influenced aet estimation for cropland and grassland regions aet variation in forest and cold regions was significantly affected by ws regardless of landscape type rn was the most important variable in each season ta and ws were found to be important in spring and winter respectively the performance of bma for the prediction of aet showed that bma is an efficient and accurate predictive model with low uncertainty especially for wetland and polar regions the average correlation coefficient of the bma model was 0 92 and the mean rmse value of bma was 0 49 mm day bma performed better when using more factors with a pip greater than 0 9 bma can be considered an effective technique to explore aet climate interactions specifically bma appeared to be an advantageous approach for predicting aet for each land cover and climate zone which will be useful for water resource management in regions with high climate variability this study mainly considered climate impacts on aet using fixed hydrological factors on a point scale future studies should explore the impacts of land cover types on aet prediction and expand the bma method to a regional scale using different combinations of hydrological factors credit authorship contribution statement yuefeng hao conceptualization data curation formal analysis

3579,fluid transport across the natural tight micro nanometer porous media governs numerous subsurface geological and industrial activities the unsteady state two phase fluid flow at the very initial stage of non wetting phase fluid intrusion governing the hydrocarbon accumulation and co2 geological sequestration process remains uncertain a modified unsteady state pressurization gas displacement experiment incorporating systematic pore structure description combining mercury porosimetry nuclear magnetic resonance and x ray computed tomography is conducted on the tight sandstone cores to investigate the fluid flow behaviors and to uncover their pore scale controls the results indicate that the unsteady state gas water flow deviates from darcy s law in which the threshold for the onset of continuous non wetting phase fluid intrusion istp can be observed and degree of water movement and gas intrusion strongly depend on the injection pressure analyses under circular pore assumption water layer distribution model based on dlvo theory effective flow assumption and overall pore connectivity evaluation suggest that the water movement and gas accessibility increases are dominated by the water displacement in the free water layer zone when injection pressure istp while the criticality of continuous gas intrusion is determined by the water movement in the inner layer of weakly bound water zone located in the narrow parts of the connected pathways especially that in the pores 40 nm but its increment mainly occurs in the out layer of the weakly bound water zone when injection pressure istp distinctions in the distributions and proportions of free and bound water layers in the different connected pore systems lead to the significant variations in the istp water mobility and gas accessibility of tight sandstone the primary reasons for the differences in the static fluid mobility and flow behaviors lay in the differed structural attributes of connected pore systems the narrowing heterogeneity increase and actual flow length increment of the connected pathways will raise the resistance for continuous non wetting phase flow and lead to losses in water mobility accessibility of non wetting phase fluid and flow velocity in the unsteady state two phase fluid flow the high sensitivity of the dynamic fluid flow and gas accessibility to tortuosity of the connected pore system suggests the unsteady state two phase fluid flow behaviors are under the coupled control of pore size complexity and heterogeneity keywords primary gas intrusion unsteady state

tischner et al 2010 understanding the fluid flow mechanism in the tight porous sandstone has direct implications for the resource related or environmental activities bultreys et al 2016 studies on fluid transport phenomenon in the low permeable natural porous media can be dated back to the 1950 s since the publication of darcy s law in 1856 darcy 1856 an exponential function of single phase water flow in tight soil was discovered by swartzendruber 1962a 1962b miller and low 1963 also found deviations of water seepage from darcy s law in low permeability porous media which had been reported as non darcy flow by prada and civan 1999 through their sand pack experiments this was further confirmed by wang et al 2015 and wang and sheng 2017 using a micro flux measuring instrument

linearity at low fluid velocity pre darcy flow in the tight porous media zeng et al 2010 have also confirmed this deviation in the steady state single phase oil displacement in tight sandstone cores

farmani et al 2018 however the low velocity pre darcy flow behavior is obtained from the steady state single phase flow measurements and therefore can be hardly used to describe the low velocity unsteady state two phase fluid flow utff that actually involved in the primary fluid charging or intrusion initial displacement stage of energy resource development primary leakage in contaminant pollution control and beginning of the co2 geological sequestration gavin 2004 dukhan et al 2014 kundu et al 2016 dejam et al 2017b recently the physics governing the multiphase flow in natural porous media have been studied by pore scale displacement experiments but those in tight porous rocks are poorly understood berg et al 2013 blunt 2017 singh et al 2017 spurin et al 2020 moreover the validation of the steady state multiphase flow mechanisms in the unsteady or transient procedures stays unclear especially for the haines jumps snap off or non wetting phase entrapment phenomenon haines 1930 berg et al 2013 singh et al 2017 the fluid flow behaviors for the utff remain to be investigated particularly the onsets of the continuous movement of the saturated wetting phase under the displacement of the other non wetting phase are rarely reported it should be clarified that the onsets of continuous two phase fluid movement under the unsteady state conditions should not be confused with ptpg or tpg involving in the steady state single phase fluid flow or even the breakthrough pressure in the steady state two phase flow pascal 1981 prada and civan 1999 dou et al 2014 wang and sheng 2017 wu et al 2017a appropriate fluid flow regime characterizations come first in the investigation of utff the correlation between the reynolds number re and friction coefficient f is sensitive to flow transitions which has been employed to determine the onsets of pre darcy flow and transitions from linear flow to non darcy flowin literatures zeng and grigg 2006 bağcı et al 2014 kundu et al 2016 muljadi et al 2016 besides the single phase fluid apparent permeability and its relations to the darcy s permeability have been introduced to characterize the onset of non darcy flow in tight porous media muljadi et al 2016 the re versus f and single phase fluid apparent permeability could also be further provided and conducted in the utff prevailing pores scale fluid flow investigations have reported that the macroscopic flow properties of the porous media are controlled by the pore scale fluid flow mechanism meaning the fluid flow behavior is closely related to the microstructure attributes of the porous media tallakstad et al 2009a 2009b armstrong et al 2016 blunt 2017 spurin et al 2020 recent studies have indicated that the intricate pore structures in micro nanometer scale are responsible for the non linear flow phenomenon and presences of evident ptpg and tpg in the tight sandstone or shale wu et al 2017b found new fluid transport phenomenon including the dramatically enhanced or decreased water flow rates in nanochannels with varied hydrophilicity zou et al 2017 and xia et al 2017 have discovered that the non darcy flow in fractured tight rocks has a strong dependence on the attributes of the void spaces and fracture surface roughness which agree well with the study of chen et al 2019 muljadi et al 2016 investigated the effect of pore scale heterogeneity on non darcy flow by means of numerical simulations on a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and estaillades carbonate suggesting that the pore heterogeneity accounts for the early transition away from darcy linearity in tight porous rocks qiao et al 2019 reported that the pore throat configurations of the tight sandstone strongly affect the two phase non linear flow regimes in the natural gas charging process some scholars investigated the effects of microstructure of tight porous rocks on the fluid flow in terms of fluid mobility including fluid saturation movable water ratio and fluid occurrence state liu et al 2021 have discovered the strong correlation between the movable oil films and pore size by conducting x ray computed tomography x μct scanning on the microfluidic chips hui et al 2020 have further indicated that the movable fluid saturation of tight sandstone is primary influenced by the pore throat radii yang and yu 2020 suggested the water movability of shale is determined by pore diameters and the minor pores within the predominant pathways filled by weakly bound water are responsible for the presence of tpg qiao et al 2020b indicated the fluid flow capacity of tight sandstone is determined by the movable porosity contribution from intergranular pores the understandings for the effects of pore structures on the fluid flow in tight porous sandstone are somehow limited one of the reasons lies in the difficulties in the systematic pore system description which can be attributed to the inherent deficiencies of single technique e g mercury intrusion scanning electron microscope x μct and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr in measuring the overall pore structures the other reason lies in the short of investigations on the utff phenomenon ramstad et al 2010 in this paper we conducted an unsteady state two phase fluid flow experiment on the core flooding instruments in which the wetting phase water in the cores is displaced by non wetting gas in order to simulate the initial charging process of natural gas into the tight porous sandstone or primary invasion procedure of co2 into the tight seal to examine the utff phenomenon and to measure its critical features by conducting the integrated nmr pressure controlled mercury intrusion pcp and x μct on the same cores we are able to obtain an overall pore structure description of tight sandstone coupling analyses of the results enable us to uncovering the underlying physics of and effects of pore structure on the unsteady state multiphase flow in tight porous sandstone this work tries to enlighten the understandings for the unsteady state multiphase fluid flow in natural tight porous media and may provide useful insights for the basin scale hydrocarbon accumulation hydrogeological circulation water rock interaction co2 geological sequestration and contaminant pollution control in the tight rocks 2 samples and experiments 2 1 samples nine tight sandstone samples were collected from the permian shanxi formation at depths of 2300 2800 m in the northeastern ordos basin china the basin is the one of the most petroliferous interior basins in china of which the thick fluvial and deltaic feldspathic litharenites and litharenites in the permian unit exhibit great hydrocarbon storage potentials and good development prospects dai et al 2005 xiao et al 2005 yang et al 2005 exploring the utff behaviors and their pore scale controlling factors are of great significance for the understanding of the basin scale hydrocarbon accumulation hydrogeological circulation and water rock interactions it will also provide a guidance for the tight gas recovery enhancement which may enlighten the associated works in the co2 geological sequestration and contaminant pollution control in shale and mudstone the nine cylindrical samples with lengths of 40 60 mm and diameters of 25 mm were drilled perpendicular to the bedding planes of the tight sandstone layers and consistent with the natural gas invasion orientation the helium porosity and klinkenberg corrected permeability were examined by the core lab apparatus cms 300 in the state key laboratory of china university of petroleum beijing cupb in accordance with the standard sy t 5336 2006 of china qiao et al 2021 the labels and detailed information of these samples are listed in table 1 2 2 experiments 2 2 1 unsteady state gas water flow experiment the unsteady state gas water flow experiment of which the saturated wetting phase water is displaced by non wetting gas is performed on the core flooding system cfs the cfs is composed of a fluid injection system with controlled injection pressure of 0 02 70 00 mpa a core holder system with maximum confining pressure of 70 00 mpa a thermostat system with temperature between 20 and 120 c a fluid metering system with accuracies of 0 001 ml min for liquid and 0 01 ml min for gas and an auto data acquisition system controlled by microcomputer fig 1 the gas soap bubble flow meter in the outlet is replaced by a capillary flow meter in order to capture the low water flow rate at the very initial stage two pressure transducers are plugged into the upstream and downstream of the core holder to record the pressures during the flow procedures the confining pressure is at least 2 mpa higher than the injection pressure to eliminate the fracturing risk and gas leakage through the gap between the rubber sleeve and sample prior to the experiments the air in the cores was evacuated by a vacuum pump before they were saturated with cacl2 brine solution with salinity of 50000 mg l that is consistent with the actual formation water condition in the permian shanxi formation the pipelines were vacuumed and were then injected with the cacl2 solution for 24 h before the saturated samples were placed into the core holder the brine solution injection continued for several days to remove the residual air in the system a stepping pressurization method was employed in the unsteady state gas water two phase flow experiment nitrogen was injected into the core with a minimum pressure 0 02 mpa with downstream open to the atmosphere the injection pressure was increased with a step size of 0 02 mpa with each pressure set point being kept for at about 1 2 h the pressure and water flow rate q were recorded since the beginning the experiment ceased when gas bubbles emerged from the outlet 2 2 2 integrated pore structure characterization before commencing the integrated pore structure characterization that includes the x μct nmr and pcp the samples that have underwent the fluid flow experiments were soaked in the deionized water to remove the residual brine and were then dried for 48 h in the drying oven at the temperature of 80 c x μct scanning with a resolution of 3 0 μm a voxel of 30 mm 30 mm 30 mm a voltage of 90 kv a working power of 8 w and an exposure time of 1000 ms was firstly conducted on the pretreated samples using a zeiss xradia versa 510 instrument the pore attributes were derived from the scanning slices that were processed following the processing methodology presented by qiao et al 2020a b 2021 and dong and blunt 2009 non destructive nmr followed the scanning and was conducted on the numag micromr12 025 v nmr spectrometer with a resonance frequency of 11 85 mhz the test had an echo time of 0 15 ms waiting time of 2000 ms echo number of 5000 and scanning times of 32 two times of nmr measurements were conducted before and after centrifugation one hour centrifugation with centrifugal pressure 300 psi under a temperature of 20 c the saturated t2 spectrum and its correlation with centrifuged t2 spectrum provide pore structure information however the conversion of t2 to pore size inevitably depends on the determination of the surface relaxation ratio ρ which must rely on other techniques pcp was performed on the autopore iv 9500 analyzer produced by micromeritics instrument corporation the measurements with highest intrusion pressure of 60 000 psi were performed on the same specimens that have underwent the x μct and nmr examinations the mercury continuously intruded into smaller pore spaces with increasing injection pressure once the injection pressure reached maximum the pressure would gradually decrease the mercury extrusion occurred simultaneously the mercury intrusion curves can be converted to pore size distribution using the capillary model the integration of x μct nmr and pcp enables us to the probe the overall pore structure of the tight sandstone the detailed processing methodology will be introduced in the later section 3 results and discussions 3 1 the utff behavior 3 1 1 utff phenomenon the specialty of the designed unsteady state two phase fluid flow experiment in this investigation lies in the absence of gas flow in the downstream and therefore flow behaviors can only be described by water flow differential pressure between the upstream and downstream δp and water flow rate q are plotted together with experimental time in fig 2 in fig 2 the fluid flow can be divided into two stages according to the sectional variation of q with increasing time and δp in the first stage no continuous gas or water flow occurs inside the cores since q is zero at most of time exhibiting a parallel line close to x axis with little fluctuations the fluctuations in this stage suggest an intermitted water flow from the downstream which is attributed to the displacement of part of free water along with the primary gas intrusion under a small pressure gradient this phenomenon also indicates a discontinuous intermitted two phase flow state in the very initial procedure in the later stage a continuous water flow presents where q increases with δp and time rapidly exhibiting a quasi linear flow curve with low amplitude fluctuations haines jumps it indicates a continuous gas intrusion into the cores the inflection points between the two stages suggest flow transitions from intermitted discontinuous utff to continuous two phase fluid flow inside the cores indicating the existences of criticalities for the formation of continuous utff in the primary non wetting phase fluid intrusion procedure with decreasing permeability the early stage fluctuations of q almost disappear the curve slopes in the later stage become greater and the transition points shift to the right on time axis meaning increases in sealing capability and reductions in accumulation capacity of tight sandstone the low velocity utff behaviors are analogues to the low velocity single phase pre darcy flow in the tight clays and shale fig 3 in which a threshold pressure for the start up of the continuous gas intrusion istp namely the criticality for the transitions of non wetting phase fluid flow from discontinuous to continuous states can be identified according to the relationships and fitting correlations between fluid velocity and pressure gradient in fig 3 the water flow can be described using the following equations which drew on the linear and power law relations between fluid velocity and pressure gradient developed in the pre darcy flow puzyrevskaya 1931 slepicka 1961 siddiqui et al 2016 dejam et al 2017b 1 v 0 i f dp dl d p 0 dl a dp dl m i f dp dl d p 0 dl where v is the water velocity cm s dp dl is the pressure gradient mpa cm d p 0 dl is the threshold pressure gradient namely istp mpa cm a and m are constants m is generally 1 when the fluid flow does not follow the darcy law 3 1 2 fluid flow regimes apparent permeability used to determine the onset of single phase non darcy flow and to reflect the multiphase flow regimes is sensitive to the fluid regime changes javadpour 2009 qiao et al 2019 singh et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 based on the downstream water flow rate the water apparent permeability can be estimated using eq 2 2 k w 0 01 q w u w l a δ p where k w is the water apparent permeability 10 3 μm2 q w is the water flow rate ml s u w is the water viscosity mpa s l is the length of the cylindrical sample cm a is the cross sectional area of the core plug cm2 δ p is the differential pressure between the upstream and downstream mpa the water permeability exhibits a quite similar trend to the variation of q along with the increase of δp and time in which two segments with different trends are identified successively indicating different flow regimes fig 4 a c e g i k m o q the inflection points on the water permeability curves where apparent permeability values start to increase capture the transition of utff regimes inside the cores from which the istp can be precisely determined the istp corresponding to the greatest pressure before water permeability start to increase continuously ranges widely from 0 28 to 4 56 mpa and is negatively correlated with permeability table 2 the ultimate water permeability reflecting the maximum utff flow capacity is in the wide range of 0 04 0 176 md to quantify the dynamic fluid flow capability dffc the ratio of the maximum flow velocity increment and accumulative injection pressure increment namely δv δp is recorded which is in the range of 0 00019 0 0073 cm s mpa generally the ddfc rises with gas permeability however exceptions occur in some samples with high absolute permeability which are probably attributed to the intricate pore structures for a better description of the non darcy or pre darcy flow the permeability based reynolds number rek is generally employed in the porous media with uncertain particle diameters chhabra 2006 comiti et al 2000 durlofsky and brady 1987 farmani et al 2018 which can be expressed in the following equation 3 r ek ρ v k μ where ρ is the fluid density g cm3 v is the fluid velocity cm s k is the gas permeability 10 3 μm2 μ is the fluid viscosity mpa s the carman kozeny friction factor f primarily defined as a function of reynolds number is modified considering the permeability effect farmani et al 2018 which can be described as following 4 f δ p l k ρ v 2 where δ p l is the differential pressure gradient mpa cm the rek vs f plot is useful to identify the transitions between pre darcy flow darcy and non darcy flow generally the f shows a reversed linear correlation with rek in darcy flow the pre darcy flow is characterized by a deviation from the linear correlation at low flow velocity while the deviation at high flow velocity is known as non darcy flow qiao et al 2019 has reported that the relationships between re and f of a single phase fluid can effectively reflect the flow regimes and their transitions in the two phase flow in the gas charging process the plots of rek vs f for the water flow at downstream in the fig 4 exhibit deviations at the extreme low velocity stage and obey negative linear correlations at a relative high flow rate which are quite analogues to the pre darcy flow however we should not confuse them the transition points where the deviations disappear are almost in agreements with the inflection points on the water permeability curve validating the credibility of the determination of the istp fig 4 b d f h j l n p r 3 2 pore structure attributes 3 2 1 experimental results the evenly increasing trends of mercury saturation within the injection pressure range 100 10000 psi and corresponding even psds within the pore diameter of 0 01 10 μm of most of the samples e g s 12 s 15 and s 26 in fig 5 suggest even development of all sizes of pores in tight sandstone the median intrusion pressures p50 and median pore diameters dp50 are in the range of 595 78 1929 44 psi avg 1167 77 psi and 93 74 303 57 nm avg 187 25 nm respectively part of the samples e g s 1 show evident increments in the pressure interval of 0 1 100 psi leading to the evident fraction increases of large sized pores in the size range of 100 1000 μm decreases in p50 222 45 psi and increases in dp50 813 06 nm steeper segments are discovered in the pressure interval of 10000 100000 psi in some other samples e g s 19 resulting in volume fraction increases of tiny pores in the size range of 0 01 0 1 μm fig 5 b the p50s increase sharply to the range of 5048 79 8217 74 psi avg 6633 26 psi and dp50s decrease to 22 01 35 82 nm avg 28 92 nm the wide t2s distributions agree well with the psds measured by pcp and are characterized by different distribution patterns fig 6 a c e g i k m o q with decreasing permeability the patterns of t2s changes from bimodal to unimodal accompanied by the shift of major peaks from 10 to 2 ms simultaneously the amplitudes of the secondary right peaks reduce indicating reductions of the large sized pores amplitude differences between the t2s and t2c are defined as movable signals unimodal distributions are found in the movable signals in the samples with permeability 0 1 md but they become complicated when the permeability 0 1 md to quantify the connective degree of certain sized pores the ratio of movable signal to the saturation signal at certain t2 value is defined as movable proportion fig 6 b d f h j l n p r the movable proportion is positively correlated with t2 i e pore size when the permeability 0 1 md fig 6 b d f h j l but has an extreme complex correlation with it when the permeability 0 1 md fig 6 n p r the pores with t2 100 ms exhibit best connectivity with movable proportions 0 6 most of which are close to 1 in the samples with permeability 0 1 md the connectivity reduces with decreasing pore size of which the pores in the t2 range of 1 100 ms are partly connected with movable proportion between 0 4 and 1 0 while those with t2 1 ms can hardly be connected with most of the proportions 0 1 and close to 0 the connectivity of same sized pores shows a rising trend with increasing permeability notably the presences of negative movable proportion values are attributed to the water redistribution from large sized to small sized pores under the centrifugal force the segmented binary images displaying the pore spatial distribution modelled ball stick skeleton graphs showing the pore throat connection and combination and merged pore throat radii distributions derived from x μct are displayed in fig 7 image descriptions suggest that the connected large sized pores construct the major structure of the pore system while the tiny pores are mostly isolated in space part of them may be connected to the major network but only serve as dead ends fig 7 with decreasing permeability the bulk volumes and connectivity of the major structures reduce owing to the pore size reduction and connection losses the pore throat radii distribution histograms give out quantitative description of the pore connectivity in which the yellow parts represent the connective proportions of the pores of certain size pores with calculated coordination number 0 while the blue parts pores with calculated coordination number 0 are on the opposite the connectivity rises with pore size of which the pores with radii 20 μm are mostly disconnected those of 20 100 μm are partly connected while those with size 100 μm are almost fully connected the same sized pores show connectivity reductions with decrease of permeability particularly in the pores with radii 20 μm however the reliability and applicability of the x μct information are restricted to some extent owing to the resolution effects and representative voxel selection 3 2 2 full range pore size distribution the psds of tight sandstone measured by pcp nmr and x μct are reliable in different size range an accurate acquisition of the full range pore size distribution fpsd depends on the proper integration of multiple methods lai et al 2018b loucks et al 2009 nelson 2009 xiao et al 2017 prior to the merge the t2 signal has to be converted to pore size which relies on the ρ determination that can be calibrated by the relations between the accumulative pore size distribution of pcp and accumulative incremental porosity curve of t2s fig 8 a b the processing method used in the determination of ρ by calibrating the results of pcp and nmr has been thoroughly explained in recent publications which would not be introduced in our paper for simplicity kleinberg 1996 mohnke 2014 torrey 1956 the psds measured by the three methods are plotted together in the same coordinate in fig 8 we can discover that the nmr psds agree well with the pcp psds but show a few differences in the range of 1 100 μm however those of x μct are distinct which are attributed to the scanning resolution of 3 μm fig 8 b e h in the merging process the fpsds should follow the nmr psds in the size range where the psds of nmr and pcp almost coincide generally in the range of 0 001 1 μm because nmr is more credible as it is non destructive the incremental proportions of pores need to be averaged in the range where the psds of nmr and pcp differentiate commonly in the range of 1 10 μm to reduce the potential systematic differences coming to the range of 1 1000 μm all of the three psds present averaging should be conducted on the three psds by taking the sampling influences into account fig 8 b e h the merged fpsds are multimodal in the extreme wide range between 10 nm and 1000 μm showing three peaks at around 0 1 1 and 200 500 μm suggesting a highly complex pore constitute with presences of pores from nanometer to millimeter fig 8 c f i the fpsds vary with decreasing permeability of which the three major peaks become left skewed and amplitudes of the two right peaks reduces evidently indicating the narrowing of the pore and throat spaces all sizes of pores have contributions to the storage spaces for the samples with permeability 0 1md but the nanopores 10 nm 1 μm and micro small pores 1 10 μm dominate the porosities of the samples with permeability 0 1 md 3 2 3 pore connectivity as connected pore space dominates the fluid flow pore connectivity is more crucial in low connectivity tight porous media with complex pore structure but discussions on it are limited due to the difficulties in measurement and quantification as indicated nmr and x μct provide quantitative pore connectivity description information as the connective ratios of pores of certain sizes can be determined by the movable proportions of nmr and obtained by calculating the volume fraction of pores with coordination number 0 in x μct respectively the connective ratio distributions of the two techniques are plotted together in a same coordinate from which piecewise function relations are discovered between the pore size and the ratio fig 9 table 3 the connectivity of the pores in the size range 0 001 0 1 μm generally has positive polynomial correlations with their sizes the plots are fluctuated in the range 0 1 10 μm where two or three polynomial correlations can coexist the segment points of these piecewise functions in this range are generally at 1 0 μm and will be left skewed with permeability reduction the connectivity of the pores 10 0 μm commonly has positive correlations with diameters and connective ratio is generally equal to 1 when diameter 20 0 μm however reverse correlations are discovered in the samples with ultra low permeability e g s 8 and s 25 which may probably attributed the blockage of connected pathways between the large pore voids the connectivity of pores with sizes 100 μm is given out by x μct and generally shows positive polynomial relationships with their diameters and is commonly close to 1 with increasing pore size fig 9 a i notably the connectivity evaluations of nmr and x μct coincide in the pore size rang 10 100 μm however the indirect x μct results are not taken into account as they are strongly affected by the resolution and scanning voxel while the direct nmr measurements are believed to be more credible in this range in comparison the pore connectivity evaluation enables us to figure out the connected fpsds cfpsds by multiplying the volume fractions of certain sized pores on fpsds and connective ratios obtained from the correlations in the piecewise functions in the fig 9 table 3 the cfpsds of most of the tight sandstone samples are characterized by right skewed unimodal distribution patterns in which the high amplitudes on the right of the x axis and low amplitudes in the range 0 1 100 μm suggest the system connectivity is dominated by the pores with sizes 100 μm fig 10 bimodal cfpsd distribution patterns occur in the samples s 6 s 8 and s 25 with two peaks in the range of 0 1 10 μm and 100 1000 μm respectively the connectivity increases in these small sized pores may be attributed to the extra connections provided by the micro fractures to small void spaces as the fluid flow pathway is constructed by the connected pore spaces in terms of fluid flow therefore the key structural parameters are recorded on the basis of the cfpsds the dcmin dc50 and λmax separately referring to the minimum median and maximum connected pore diameters are listed in table 4 the dcmin is between 3 and 129 nm avg 30 26 nm dc50 ranges from 302 5 nm to 283 3 μm avg 70 19 μm and λmax is in the range 120 3 629 61 μm avg 438 59 μm the variations of mean parameter indicate evident differences in the connected flow pathways in tight porous sandstone and the positive correlations between these parameters and permeability suggest that the better connectivity is always favorable for the fluid flow capacity the connected proportion ranges from 0 15 to 0 55 avg 0 33 suggesting low connective degrees and huge connectivity variations of tight porous sandstone 3 2 4 microscopic heterogeneity of the connected pore system pore fractal dimension has been admitted as an effective parameter to describe the complexity and heterogeneity of microstructures the determination of pore fractal dimension using the psds obtained from different techniques has been thoroughly explored and explained according to the fractal principle of which the number of pores with radii r n r has a positive correlation with pore radius r i e n r r d f bale and schmidt 1984 lai et al 2018a mandelbrot 1975 mandelbrot et al 1984 qiao et al 2021 generally the df for pores in certain size range equals to the 3 k where k is the slope of the linear segments on the lg sr vs lg d plots according to the correlation of s r d d max 3 d f that is derived from the fractal principle and relations between n r and pore volume fraction note that the sr is the cumulative volume fraction for the pores with radii r diameter d fig 11 the detailed derivation procedures can refer to the studies of li and horne 2006 lai et al 2018a b and qiao et al 2021 which will not be explained in this work for simplicity the segmented linear plots in fig 11 suggest that the tight porous sandstone is characterized by highly heterogeneous microstructure with common tri fractal structure d1c d2c and d3c rising successively with increasing pore size can be obtained table 4 the d1c for the small sized pores varies widely between 0 13 and 2 04 suggesting that theses pores are not fractal but are intensely heterogeneous d2c for medium sized pores is in a narrow range of 1 48 2 38 and has a greater dimension value close to 2 indicating increases in self similarity and homogeneity while d3c for the large sized pores exhibits very little fluctuations in the range of 2 82 2 97 suggesting a high homogeneity of these pores the davg mean of the d1c d2c and d3c ranges widely from 1 66 to 2 29 indicating significant differences in the microscopic heterogeneities of the connected fluid flow pathways 3 3 insights into the utff in the nano micrometer pore system 3 3 1 relationships between the pore structure and utff the dynamic fluid flow strongly depends on the microstructural attributes of connected pore network especially for the tight porous media with nano micrometer pore size and intense heterogeneity to investigate the effects of the pore structures on the dynamic utff inside it the correlations between the key structural parameters for the connected pore networks and critical parameters for the utff including the istps average fluid velocity obtained by averaging the water flow velocity from the beginning to ending average dffc describing the ratio of total velocity increment to the total injection pressure increment from the beginning δv δp and ultimate water permeability that is the apparent water permeability at the end of utff experiment are explored figs 12 13 these correlations and their correlative coefficients show that increasing pore sizes e g dcmin dc50 and λcmax would reduce the istps and increase the average fluid velocity average dffc and ultimate water permeability figs 12 a c 13 a c while the davg and tortuosity τc exert opposite effects of which τc shows greater impacts than davg figs 12 d e 13 d h according to the correlations in figs 12 and 13 it can be deduced that the narrowing and heterogeneity and actual flow length increases of the connected pathways will increase the flow resistance and result in evident fluid velocity loss of utff in the primary gas charging or intrusion the higher correlation coefficients of the negative correlation between dc50 and istp and those of the positive correlations between dc50 average fluid velocity dffc and ultimate water apparent permeability suggest the average sizes of the flow pathways control the utff in tight porous media figs 12 b 13 a c notably instead of pore size the heterogeneities exert extra controls on the istps of utff in the case of the dc50 10 μm which can be supported by the stronger positive correlations between d1 davg and istps fig 12 a b e the utff in the extreme tight porous sandstone is controlled by the pore geometry and topology in couple supporting by the poorer correlations between davg and istp and better relations between τ and istp fig 12 d e 3 3 2 gas accessibility in the nano micrometer pore systems the gas flow behaviors in the utff could not be determined directly owing to the specialties of the primary gas intrusion or charging process and experiment design in order to investigate the gas accessibilities in the nano micrometer pore systems the water layer theory and effective percolation radius are combined and applied the water layer distribution model stems from the dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory that describes the interactions between the solid surface and aqueous solution employing the disjoining pressure churaev 2003 lebeau and konrad 2010 woodruff and revil 2011 yang and yu 2020 the disjoining pressure is composed of a short range van der waals force long range electrostatic force and structural force under the equilibrium condition which can be expressed as following israelachvili 2015 lebeau and konrad 2010 tuller and or 2003 6 π h π m h π e h π s h 7 π m h a 12 6 π h 3 8 π e h ε 0 ε r 2 π k b t ez 1 h 2 9 π s h k e h λ 10 a 12 a 11 a 22 where π h is the disjoining pressure π m h is the van der walls force π e h is the electrostatic force π s h is the structural force h is the distance from the solid surface and a12 is the hamaker constant for the intersections between solid substrate a11 and water a22 the physical constants used for calculating the interfacial of water tight sandstone interactions are listed in table 5 note that the a11 can be estimated according to the mineral constitutes acquired from xrd results in table 1 and hamaker constants for them the contributions of the three kinds of forces to the disjoining pressure are illustrated in fig 14 e g s 1 s 3 s 6 considering the interfacial forces acting on the water molecules the water in water saturated pores can be divided into four parts in the direction perpendicular to the solid surfaces including the free water layer fw outer layer of weakly bound water obw inner layer of weakly bound water ibw and strongly bound water layer sbw yang and yu 2020 fig 14 a it has been reported that the fw is not subjected to the surface force only existing in the pore zones that exceed the free plane fp the distance from the surface to the fp can has been indicated by debye length in shale approximate 960 nm yang and yu 2020 and is approximate 1509 96 nm estimated by disjoining pressure in our investigation this calculation suggests that the fw can only exist in the centers of the pores with diameters 3020 nm 2fp in tight porous sandstone water in the obw occurring in the pore zones ranging threshold plane tp to fp mainly held by the electrostatic force is less affected by the solid surface and can flow under small pressure gradients the length of solid surface to tp can be obtained by determining the cross point of the electrostatic force and structural force whereby the thickness of the obw can be determined by combining the lengths of fp and tp table 6 the water in the ibw confining between the shear plane sp and tp is controlled by molecular electrostatic and structural forces which is commonly considered to be immovable when the displacement pressure tpg but is potentially movable when the pressure tpg the length of solid surface to sp can be calculated by the cross point of the van der walls force and electrostatic force whereby the thickness of ibw can be determined water in the sbw is strongly absorbed to the solid surface and is particularly immovable whose thickness is confined by the sp ranging from 0 77 to 0 97 nm table 6 the four types of water layers can only coexist in the pores with diameter 2fp where the water flow can occur under a pressure gradient no matter how small it is for the pores with diameters in the range of 2tp 2fp there are extra pressure needs for the water movement however for the pores with sizes between 2sp and 2tp the fluid can flow only when the pressure gradient tpg while the pores with diameters 2sp do not contribute to the fluid flow it can be deduced that the presences of the pores with diameter ranging from 2sp to 2tp in the connected fluid flow pathways result in the existences of tpg in single phase flow and istp for utff and successive water movement in the fw obw and ibw zones are responsible for the increases of the effective radius and apparent permeability in the multiphase fluid flow particularly the fluid flows in obw and ibw zones dominate the effective radius and apparent permeability increases of the continuous single or multi phase flow in tight porous media combining the cfpsds and water layer thicknesses on the basis of the circular pore assumption the distributions of water layers under saturated condition in different sized connected pores can be obtained whereby the ratios for different water layers in certain sized pores can be derived using the eqs 11 14 to describe the potential static fluid mobility in tight porous sandstone fig 15 as shown in fig 15 there are only sbw and ibw exist in the pores with diameters 40 nm generally radii the sum of rsbw and ribw sbw ibw and obw present in the pores with diameters between 40 and 3020 nm while the four types of layers coexist in the pores with diameters 3020 nm the presences of the pores 40 nm in the connected flow pathway result in the existences of the istps in utff 11 r sbw 1 1 sp r 2 12 r ibw 1 sp r 2 i f s p r t p 1 sp r 2 1 tp r 2 i f r t p 13

layers in certain sized pores under saturated state r is the pore radius of certain pore nm the sp tp and fp separately represent the lengths of shear plane threshold plane and free plane nm the ratio of sbw decreases with pore size and becomes minor when the diameter excesses 2tp that of ibw increases with diameter when it 2tp but decreases when diameter 2tp that of obw shows a reversed trend when the size excesses 2fp while that of fw increases with pore size since it appears which dominates the water mobility in the pores with diameters 20000 nm the ratio of potential movable water ibw obw fw representing the maximum static flow mobility in certain sized pores is positively correlated with the permeability while the ratio of the immovable water sbw shows an opposite correlation table 7 to characterize the dynamic variation of gas accessibility in the utff the effective flow radius model is introduced which can be described by the eq 15 carman 1956 civan 2013 wang et al 2015 according to the connected flow pathway identified the equation can be modified to the eq 16 15 r e 8 τ k w φ 16 r ec 8 τ c k w φ c where r e is the effective flow radius τ is the tortuosity k w is the water apparent permeability in the experiments r ec is the effective flow radius of the connected pore system τ c is the tortuosity of the connected pore system φ c is the porosity of the connected pore system according to the features of the utff we make a reasonable assumption that the calculated effective flow radius equals to gas flow radius inside the cores under the equilibrium condition by means of combining the water layer distribution and dynamic changes of effective flow radius the dynamic gas accessibility can be de deduced fig 16 a d initially gas intrudes into the pores with diameters 3020 nm and occupies the fw zone when the applied pressure is far less than istp leading to the water permeability fluctuations in the early stage in this stage no continuous water flow occurs because whole pore systems are not interconnected under the blockage generated from the pores with sizes 40 nm existing between them in this procedure the fw zones may be gradually fully occupied by gas fig 16 a when the applied injection pressure istp the water in ibw zone particularly in the zone of pores 40 nm starts to move where a connected gas flow pathway forms and an effective flow radius appears leading to the continuous water flow in downstream fig 16 b the increasing effective flow radius indicates the enhancement in gas accessibility the increments in the gas ratios in the pore system describing the dynamic gas accessibility variations along with the increase of injection pressure could be determined by integrating the water layer distribution effective gas flow radius and cfpsds the results are shown as histograms in fig 16 a c the gas storage capacity of tight porous sandstone is probably dominated by the fw ratios while the gas accessibility increases happening in the continuous fluid flow procedure mainly originate from the water movement in the obw zone since the water movement in ibw zone is volumetrically minor however the criticalities of gas accessibility increases are determined by the volumetrically minor ibw zone fig 16 the samples with greater istps are generally characterized by worse gas accessibility and lower accessibility increment in utff fig 16 under the ideal circular pore assumption the movement occurrence and distribution of fluids would inevitably associated with the pore attributes the situation presents a picture of extreme in tight porous sandstone with micro nanometer scale pore structures the ratio of immovable fluids namely the ratio of sbw and ratios of potential movable fluids the ratios of ibw and obw are negatively correlated with dc50 while the movable fluid ratio proportion of fw shows a positive correlation with dc50 suggesting the rises in the free fluid mobility with increasing pore sizes of the connected flow pathway fig 17 a d this can be further supported by the negative correlation between the dc50 and sum proportion of sbw and ibw zones where fluid can hardly flow fig 17 g and the positive relationship between dc50 and sum proportion of obw and fw zones where fluid can easily flow fig 17 h the heterogeneity exerts a relative poor effect on the fluid mobility which has a positive correlation with ratio of obw and a negative correlation with that of fw indicating that the heterogeneity increase will lead to reductions in the static fluid mobility fig 17 e f however under the dynamic conditions the dramatic decreases in the correlation coefficients suggest the effects of the pore size and heterogeneity reduce evidently fig 18 a b the strong negative correlation between the τc and gas accessibility suggests the utff in the primary gas intrusion or charging processes are controlled by the pore size complexity and heterogeneity in couple fig 18 c 4 conclusion in this paper an unsteady state two phase flow utff experiment is conducted on the natural tight sandstone to investigate the fluid flow in the primary co2 intrusion and natural gas charging processes the fluid flow behaviors are investigated by experimental analyses combining water layer theory and effective flow radius model and their pore scale controls are discussed by the systematic pore structure characterization the conclusions can be drawn as follow the utff in the primary gas intrusion or charging process is low velocity non linear flow with evident threshold for the onset of the continuous non wetting phase fluid intrusion istp of which flow regime of the wetting phase fluid can be given as v 0 i f d p d l d p 0 d l a d p d l m i f d p d l d p 0 d l the connected pathways for fluid flow in tight sandstone are identified by an innovative pore connectivity evaluation combining nmr and x μct on the basis of systematic pore system characterization the connected pore systems have wide pore size distributions psd between 3 2 nm and 758 20 μm with connectivity dominated by the pores with diameters 100 μm and heterogeneous tri fractal structures with average fractal dimension ranging from 1 66 to 2 29 the connected pore networks vary significantly in tight porous sandstone with minimum pore diameter between 3 and 129 nm median pore diameter ranging from 302 5 nm to 283 3 μm and maximum pore diameter in the range of 120 3 629 61 μm the static fluid mobility evaluation combining water layer theory and connected full range psd suggests high water mobility in the connected pathways with the sum of proportions of free water layer and outer layer of weakly bound water in the range of 71 22 97 66 the istps are probably attributed to the presences of the pores 40 nm in the connected pathways the dynamic gas accessibilities in the utff process are deduced by combining the circular pore assumption effective flow radius variation and water layer distribution under the equilibrium condition gas accessibility is dominated by the water movements in the free water layer zone when injection pressure istp while criticalities for its continuous increases are determined by the water movement in the inner layer of weakly bound water zone in the pores with sizes 40 nm presented in the connected flow pathway but its dynamic increments mainly originate from the water movement in the outer layer of weakly bound water zone during the continuous two phase fluid flow processes the complex structural attributes of connected pore system in the tight porous sandstone exert great impacts on the utff the narrowing and heterogeneity and actual flow length increases of the connected pathways raise the flow resistances and lead to fluid velocity and gas accessibility losses in the utff the differentiated connected pore systems are responsible for the flow behavior and capability differences among tight porous sandstone the high sensitivities of the static fluid mobility and dynamic flow parameters to the tortuosity suggest that the utff flow behaviors are controlled by pore size complexity and heterogeneity in couple this study provides a deep understanding for the unsteady state multiphase flow behaviors in the primary non wetting phase fluid intrusion or charging procedure in the natural tight porous rocks and their pore scale controlling

3579,fluid transport across the natural tight micro nanometer porous media governs numerous subsurface geological and industrial activities the unsteady state two phase fluid flow at the very initial stage of non wetting phase fluid intrusion governing the hydrocarbon accumulation and co2 geological sequestration process remains uncertain a modified unsteady state pressurization gas displacement experiment incorporating systematic pore structure description combining mercury porosimetry nuclear magnetic resonance and x ray computed tomography is conducted on the tight sandstone cores to investigate the fluid flow behaviors and to uncover their pore scale controls the results indicate that the unsteady state gas water flow deviates from darcy s law in which the threshold for the onset of continuous non wetting phase fluid intrusion istp can be observed and degree of water movement and gas intrusion strongly depend on the injection pressure analyses under circular pore assumption water layer distribution model based on dlvo theory effective flow assumption and overall pore connectivity evaluation suggest that the water movement and gas accessibility increases are dominated by the water displacement in the free water layer zone when injection pressure istp while the criticality of continuous gas intrusion is determined by the water movement in the inner layer of weakly bound water zone located in the narrow parts of the connected pathways especially that in the pores 40 nm but its increment mainly occurs in the out layer of the weakly bound water zone when injection pressure istp distinctions in the distributions and proportions of free and bound water layers in the different connected pore systems lead to the significant variations in the istp water mobility and gas accessibility of tight sandstone the primary reasons for the differences in the static fluid mobility and flow behaviors lay in the differed structural attributes of connected pore systems the narrowing heterogeneity increase and actual flow length increment of the connected pathways will raise the resistance for continuous non wetting phase flow and lead to losses in water mobility accessibility of non wetting phase fluid and flow velocity in the unsteady state two phase fluid flow the high sensitivity of the dynamic fluid flow and gas accessibility to tortuosity of the

e g the hydrocarbon accumulation and development co2 geologic sequestration geothermal extraction and contaminant pollution control are governed by the fluid transport through the natural porous media bachu 2000 bickle 2009 blunt 2017 spurin et al 2020 tight sandstone an emerging natural reservoir for the hydrocarbon co2 and geothermal energy attracts research attentions thomas and ward 1972 tischner et al 2010 understanding the fluid flow mechanism in the tight porous sandstone has direct implications for the resource related or environmental activities bultreys et al 2016 studies on fluid transport phenomenon in the low permeable natural porous media can be dated back to the 1950 s since the publication of darcy s law in 1856 darcy 1856 an exponential function of single phase water flow in tight soil was discovered by swartzendruber 1962a 1962b miller and low 1963 also found deviations of water seepage from darcy s law in low permeability porous media which had been reported as non darcy flow by prada and civan 1999 through their sand pack experiments this was further confirmed by wang et al 2015 and wang and sheng 2017 using a micro flux measuring instrument dejam et al 2017a firstly discussed the pre darcy flow in the shale formations in terms of the power law model proposed by hansbo 2001 farmani et al 2018 reported the significance of departure from linearity at low fluid velocity pre darcy flow in the tight porous media zeng et al 2010 have also confirmed this deviation in the steady state single phase oil displacement in tight sandstone cores accordingly the fluid flow in natural tight porous rocks no longer follows the darcy s law and is known as pre darcy flow at low fluid velocity and non darcy flow at high velocity kutiĺek 1972 soni et al 1978 kececioglu and jiang 1994 the pre darcy flow in the tight porous rocks characterized by concave up non linear flow curves with threshold pressure gradients tpg and pseudo threshold pressure gradients ptpg involving in plenty of managements and designs of subsurface processes has been brought to the forefront of current research gavin 2004 pertsin and grunze 2004 dejam et al 2017a b farmani et al 2018 however the low velocity pre darcy flow behavior is obtained from the steady state single phase flow measurements and therefore can be hardly used to describe the low velocity unsteady state two phase fluid flow utff that actually involved in the primary fluid charging or intrusion initial displacement stage of energy resource development primary leakage in contaminant pollution control and beginning of the co2 geological sequestration gavin 2004 dukhan et al 2014 kundu et al 2016 dejam et al 2017b recently the physics governing the multiphase flow in natural porous media have been studied by pore scale displacement experiments but those in tight porous rocks are poorly understood berg et al 2013 blunt 2017 singh et al 2017 spurin et al 2020 moreover the validation of the steady state multiphase flow mechanisms in the unsteady or transient procedures stays unclear especially for the haines jumps snap off or non wetting phase entrapment phenomenon haines 1930 berg et al 2013 singh et al 2017 the fluid flow behaviors for the utff remain to be investigated particularly the onsets of the continuous movement of the saturated wetting phase under the displacement of the other non wetting phase are rarely reported it should be clarified that the onsets of continuous two phase fluid movement under the unsteady state conditions should not be confused with ptpg or tpg involving in the steady state single phase fluid flow or even the breakthrough pressure in the steady state two phase flow pascal 1981 prada and civan 1999 dou et al 2014 wang and sheng 2017 wu et al 2017a appropriate fluid flow regime characterizations come first in the investigation of utff the correlation between the reynolds number re and friction coefficient f is sensitive to flow transitions which has been employed to determine the onsets of pre darcy flow and transitions from linear flow to non darcy flowin literatures zeng and grigg 2006 bağcı et al 2014 kundu et al 2016 muljadi et al 2016 besides the single phase fluid apparent permeability and its relations to the darcy s permeability have been introduced to characterize the onset of non darcy flow in tight porous media muljadi et al 2016 the re versus f and single phase fluid apparent permeability could also be further provided and conducted in the utff prevailing pores scale fluid flow investigations have reported that the macroscopic flow properties of the porous media are controlled by the pore scale fluid flow mechanism meaning the fluid flow behavior is closely related to the microstructure attributes of the porous media tallakstad et al 2009a 2009b armstrong et al 2016 blunt 2017 spurin et al 2020 recent studies have indicated that the intricate pore structures in micro nanometer scale are responsible for the non linear flow phenomenon and presences of evident ptpg and tpg in the tight sandstone or shale wu et al 2017b found new fluid transport phenomenon including the dramatically enhanced or decreased water flow rates in nanochannels with varied hydrophilicity zou et al 2017 and xia et al 2017 have discovered that the non darcy flow in fractured tight rocks has a strong dependence on the attributes of the void spaces and fracture surface roughness which agree well with the study of chen et al 2019 muljadi et al 2016 investigated the effect of pore scale heterogeneity on non darcy flow by means of numerical simulations on a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and estaillades carbonate suggesting that the pore heterogeneity accounts for the early transition away from darcy linearity in tight porous rocks qiao et al 2019 reported that the pore throat configurations of the tight sandstone strongly affect the two phase non linear flow regimes in the natural gas charging process some scholars investigated the effects of microstructure of tight porous rocks on the fluid flow in terms of fluid mobility including fluid saturation movable water ratio and fluid occurrence state liu et al 2021 have discovered the strong correlation between the movable oil films and pore size by conducting x ray computed tomography x μct scanning on the microfluidic chips hui et al 2020 have further indicated that the movable fluid saturation of tight sandstone is primary influenced by the pore throat radii yang and yu 2020 suggested the water movability of shale is determined by pore diameters and the minor pores within the predominant pathways filled by weakly bound water are responsible for the presence of tpg qiao et al 2020b indicated the fluid flow capacity of tight sandstone is determined by the movable porosity contribution from intergranular pores the understandings for the effects of pore structures on the fluid flow in tight porous sandstone are somehow limited one of the reasons lies in the difficulties in the systematic pore system description which can be attributed to the inherent deficiencies of single technique e g mercury intrusion scanning electron microscope x μct and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr in measuring the overall pore structures the other reason lies in the short of investigations on the utff phenomenon ramstad et al 2010 in this paper we conducted an unsteady state two phase fluid flow experiment on the core flooding instruments in which the wetting phase water in the cores is displaced by non wetting gas in order to simulate the initial charging process of natural gas into the tight porous sandstone or primary invasion procedure of co2 into the tight seal to examine the utff phenomenon and to measure its critical features by conducting the integrated nmr pressure controlled mercury intrusion pcp and x μct on the same cores we are able to obtain an overall pore structure description of tight sandstone coupling analyses of the results enable us to uncovering the underlying physics of and effects of pore structure on the unsteady state multiphase flow in tight porous sandstone this work tries to enlighten the understandings for the unsteady state multiphase fluid flow in natural tight porous media and may provide useful insights for the basin scale hydrocarbon accumulation hydrogeological

from the permian shanxi formation at depths of 2300 2800 m in the northeastern ordos basin china the basin is the one of the most petroliferous interior basins in china of which the thick fluvial and deltaic feldspathic litharenites and litharenites in the permian unit exhibit great hydrocarbon storage potentials and good development prospects dai et al 2005 xiao et al 2005 yang et al 2005 exploring the utff behaviors and their pore scale controlling factors are of great significance for the understanding of the basin scale hydrocarbon accumulation hydrogeological circulation and water rock interactions it will also provide a guidance for the tight gas recovery enhancement which may enlighten the associated works in the co2 geological sequestration and contaminant pollution control in shale and mudstone the nine cylindrical samples with lengths of 40 60 mm and diameters of 25 mm were drilled perpendicular to the bedding planes of the tight sandstone layers and consistent with the natural gas invasion orientation the helium porosity and klinkenberg corrected permeability were examined by the core lab apparatus cms 300 in the state key laboratory of china university of petroleum beijing cupb in accordance with the standard sy t 5336 2006 of china qiao et al 2021 the labels and detailed information of these samples are listed in table 1 2 2 experiments 2 2 1 unsteady state gas water flow experiment the unsteady state gas water flow experiment of which the saturated wetting phase water is displaced by non wetting gas is performed on the core flooding system cfs the cfs is composed of a fluid injection system with controlled injection pressure of 0 02 70 00 mpa a core holder system with maximum confining pressure of 70 00 mpa a thermostat system with temperature between 20 and 120 c a fluid metering system with accuracies of 0 001 ml min for liquid and 0 01 ml min for gas and an auto data acquisition system controlled by microcomputer fig 1 the gas soap bubble flow meter in the outlet is replaced by a capillary flow meter in order to capture the low water flow rate at the very initial stage two pressure transducers are plugged into the upstream and downstream of the core holder to record the pressures during the flow procedures the confining pressure is at least 2 mpa higher than the injection pressure to eliminate the fracturing risk and gas leakage through the gap between the rubber sleeve and sample prior to the experiments the air in the cores was evacuated by a vacuum pump before they were saturated with cacl2 brine solution with salinity of 50000 mg l that is consistent with the actual formation water condition in the permian shanxi formation the pipelines were vacuumed and were then injected with the cacl2 solution for 24 h before the saturated samples were placed into the core holder the brine solution injection continued for several days to remove the residual air in the system a stepping pressurization method was employed in the unsteady state gas water two phase flow experiment nitrogen was injected into the core with a minimum pressure 0 02 mpa with downstream open to the atmosphere the injection pressure was increased with a step size of 0 02 mpa with each pressure set point being kept for at about 1 2 h the pressure and water flow rate q were recorded since the beginning the experiment ceased when gas bubbles emerged from the outlet 2 2 2 integrated pore structure characterization before commencing the integrated pore structure characterization that includes the x μct nmr and pcp the samples that have underwent the fluid flow experiments were soaked in the deionized water to remove the residual brine and were then dried for 48 h in the drying oven at the temperature of 80 c x μct scanning with a resolution of 3 0 μm a voxel of 30 mm 30 mm 30 mm a voltage of 90 kv a working power of 8 w and an exposure time of 1000 ms was firstly conducted on the pretreated samples using a zeiss xradia versa 510 instrument the pore attributes were derived from the scanning slices that were processed following the processing methodology presented by qiao et al 2020a b 2021 and dong and blunt 2009 non destructive nmr followed the scanning and was conducted on the numag micromr12 025 v nmr spectrometer with a resonance frequency of 11 85 mhz the test had an echo time of 0 15 ms waiting time of 2000 ms echo number of 5000 and scanning times of 32 two times of nmr measurements were conducted before and after centrifugation one hour centrifugation with centrifugal pressure 300 psi under a temperature of 20 c the saturated t2 spectrum and its correlation with centrifuged t2 spectrum provide pore structure information however the conversion of t2 to pore size inevitably depends on the determination of the surface relaxation ratio ρ which must rely on other techniques pcp was performed on the autopore iv 9500 analyzer produced by micromeritics instrument corporation the measurements with highest intrusion pressure of 60 000 psi were performed on the same specimens that have underwent the x μct and nmr examinations the mercury continuously intruded into smaller pore spaces with increasing injection pressure once the injection pressure reached maximum the pressure would gradually decrease the mercury extrusion occurred simultaneously the mercury intrusion curves can be converted to pore size distribution using the capillary model the integration of x μct nmr and pcp enables us to the probe the overall pore structure of the tight sandstone the detailed processing methodology will be introduced in the later section 3 results and discussions 3 1 the utff behavior 3 1 1 utff phenomenon the specialty of the designed unsteady state two phase fluid flow experiment in this investigation lies in the absence of gas flow in the downstream and therefore flow behaviors can only be described by water flow differential pressure between the upstream and downstream δp and water flow rate q are plotted together with experimental time in fig 2 in fig 2 the fluid flow can be divided into two stages according to the sectional variation of q with increasing time and δp in the first stage no continuous gas or water flow occurs inside the cores since q is zero at most of time exhibiting a parallel line close to x axis with little fluctuations the fluctuations in this stage suggest an intermitted water flow from the downstream which is attributed to the displacement of part of free water along with the primary gas intrusion under a small pressure gradient this phenomenon also indicates a discontinuous intermitted two phase flow state in the very initial procedure in the later stage a continuous water flow presents where q increases with δp and time rapidly exhibiting a quasi linear flow curve with low amplitude fluctuations haines jumps it indicates a continuous gas intrusion into the cores the inflection points between the two stages suggest flow transitions from intermitted discontinuous utff to continuous two phase fluid flow inside the cores indicating the existences of criticalities for the formation of continuous utff in the primary non wetting phase fluid intrusion procedure with decreasing permeability the early stage fluctuations of q almost disappear the curve slopes in the later stage become greater and the transition points shift to the right on time axis meaning increases in sealing capability and reductions in accumulation capacity of tight sandstone the low velocity utff behaviors are analogues to the low velocity single phase pre darcy flow in the tight clays and shale fig 3 in which a threshold pressure for the start up of the continuous gas intrusion istp namely the criticality for the transitions of non wetting phase fluid flow from discontinuous to continuous states can be identified according to the relationships and fitting correlations between fluid velocity and pressure gradient in fig 3 the water flow can be described using the following equations which drew on the linear and power law relations between fluid velocity and pressure gradient developed in the pre darcy flow puzyrevskaya 1931 slepicka 1961 siddiqui et al 2016 dejam et al 2017b 1 v 0 i f dp dl d p 0 dl a dp dl m i f dp dl d p 0 dl where v is the water velocity cm s dp dl is the pressure gradient mpa cm d p 0 dl is the threshold pressure gradient namely istp mpa cm a and m are constants m is generally 1 when the fluid flow does not follow the darcy law 3 1 2 fluid flow regimes apparent permeability used to determine the onset of single phase non darcy flow and to reflect the multiphase flow regimes is sensitive to the fluid regime changes javadpour 2009 qiao et al 2019 singh et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 based on the downstream water flow rate the water apparent permeability can be estimated using eq 2 2 k w 0 01 q w u w l a δ p where k w is the water apparent permeability 10 3 μm2 q w is the water flow rate ml s u w is the water viscosity mpa s l is the length of the cylindrical sample cm a is the cross sectional area of the core plug cm2 δ p is the differential pressure between the upstream and downstream mpa the water permeability exhibits a quite similar trend to the variation of q along with the increase of δp and time in which two segments with different trends are identified successively indicating different flow regimes fig 4 a c e g i k m o q the inflection points on the water permeability curves where apparent permeability values start to increase capture the transition of utff regimes inside the cores from which the istp can be precisely determined the istp corresponding to the greatest pressure before water permeability start to increase continuously ranges widely from 0 28 to 4 56 mpa and is negatively correlated with permeability table 2 the ultimate water permeability reflecting the maximum utff flow capacity is in the wide range of 0 04 0 176 md to quantify the dynamic fluid flow capability dffc the ratio of the maximum flow velocity increment and accumulative injection pressure increment namely δv δp is recorded which is in the range of 0 00019 0 0073 cm s mpa generally the ddfc rises with gas permeability however exceptions occur in some samples with high absolute permeability which are probably attributed to the intricate pore structures for a better description of the non darcy or pre darcy flow the permeability based reynolds number rek is generally employed in the porous media with uncertain particle diameters chhabra 2006 comiti et al 2000 durlofsky and brady 1987 farmani et al 2018 which can be expressed in the following equation 3 r ek ρ v k μ where ρ is the fluid density g cm3 v is the fluid velocity cm s k is the gas permeability 10 3 μm2 μ is the fluid viscosity mpa s the carman kozeny friction factor f primarily defined as a function of reynolds number is modified considering the permeability effect farmani et al 2018 which can be described as following 4 f δ p l k ρ v 2 where δ p l is the differential pressure gradient mpa cm the rek vs f plot is useful to identify the transitions between pre darcy flow darcy and non darcy flow generally the f shows a reversed linear correlation with rek in darcy flow the pre darcy flow is characterized by a deviation from the linear correlation at low flow velocity while the deviation at high flow velocity is known as non darcy flow qiao et al 2019 has reported that the relationships between re and f of a single phase fluid can effectively reflect the flow regimes and their transitions in the two phase flow in the gas charging process the plots of rek vs f for the water flow at downstream in the fig 4 exhibit deviations at the extreme low velocity stage and obey negative linear correlations at a relative high flow rate which are quite analogues to the pre darcy flow however we should not confuse them the transition points where the deviations disappear are almost in agreements with the inflection points on the water permeability curve validating the credibility of the determination of the istp fig 4 b d f h j l n p r 3 2 pore

the pressure interval of 10000 100000 psi in some other samples e g s 19 resulting in volume fraction increases of tiny pores in the size range of 0 01 0 1 μm fig 5 b the p50s increase sharply to the range of 5048 79 8217 74 psi avg 6633 26 psi and dp50s decrease to 22 01 35 82 nm avg 28 92 nm the wide t2s distributions agree well with the psds measured by pcp and are characterized by different distribution patterns fig 6 a c e g i k m o q with decreasing permeability the patterns of t2s changes from bimodal to unimodal accompanied by the shift of major peaks from 10 to 2 ms simultaneously the amplitudes of the secondary right peaks reduce indicating reductions of the large sized pores amplitude differences between the t2s and t2c are defined as movable signals unimodal distributions are found in the movable signals in the samples with permeability 0 1 md but they become complicated when the permeability 0 1 md to quantify the connective degree of certain sized pores the ratio of movable signal to the saturation signal at certain t2 value is defined as movable proportion fig 6 b d f h j l n p r the movable proportion is positively correlated with t2 i e pore size when the permeability 0 1 md fig 6 b d f h j l but has an extreme complex correlation with it when the permeability 0 1 md fig 6 n p r the pores with t2 100 ms exhibit best connectivity with movable proportions 0 6 most of which are close to 1 in the samples with permeability 0 1 md the connectivity reduces with decreasing pore size of which the pores in the t2 range of 1 100 ms are partly connected with movable proportion between 0 4 and 1 0 while those with t2 1 ms can hardly be connected with most of the proportions 0 1 and close to 0 the connectivity of same sized pores shows a rising trend with increasing permeability notably the presences of negative movable proportion values are attributed to the water redistribution from large sized to small sized pores under the centrifugal force the segmented binary images displaying the pore spatial distribution modelled ball stick skeleton graphs showing the pore throat connection and combination and merged pore throat radii distributions derived from x μct are displayed in fig 7 image descriptions suggest that the connected large sized pores construct the major structure of the pore system while the tiny pores are mostly isolated in space part of them may be connected to the major network but only serve as dead ends fig 7 with decreasing permeability the bulk volumes and connectivity of the major structures reduce owing to the pore size reduction and connection losses the pore throat radii distribution histograms give out quantitative description of the pore connectivity in which the yellow parts represent the connective proportions of the pores of certain size pores with calculated coordination number 0 while the blue parts pores with calculated coordination number 0 are on the opposite the connectivity rises with pore size of which the pores with radii 20 μm are mostly disconnected those of 20 100 μm are partly connected while those with size 100 μm are almost fully connected the same sized pores show connectivity reductions with decrease of permeability particularly in the pores with radii 20 μm however the reliability and applicability of the x μct information are restricted to some extent owing to the resolution effects and representative voxel selection 3 2 2 full range pore size distribution the psds of tight sandstone measured by pcp nmr and x μct are reliable in different size range an accurate acquisition of the full range pore size distribution fpsd depends on the proper integration of multiple methods lai et al 2018b loucks et al 2009 nelson 2009 xiao et al 2017 prior to the merge the t2 signal has to be converted to pore size which relies on the ρ determination that can be calibrated by the relations between the accumulative pore size distribution of pcp and accumulative incremental porosity curve of t2s fig 8 a b the processing method used in the determination of ρ by calibrating the results of pcp and nmr has been thoroughly explained in recent publications which would not be introduced in our paper for simplicity kleinberg 1996 mohnke 2014 torrey 1956 the psds measured by the three methods are plotted together in the same coordinate in fig 8 we can discover that the nmr psds agree well with the pcp psds but show a few differences in the range of 1 100 μm however those of x μct are distinct which are attributed to the scanning resolution of 3 μm fig 8 b e h in the merging process the fpsds should follow the nmr psds in the size range where the psds of nmr and pcp almost coincide generally in the range of 0 001 1 μm because nmr is more credible as it is non destructive the incremental proportions of pores need to be averaged in the range where the psds of nmr and pcp differentiate commonly in the range of 1 10 μm to reduce the potential systematic differences coming to the range of 1 1000 μm all of the three psds present averaging should be conducted on the three psds by taking the sampling influences into account fig 8 b e h the merged fpsds are multimodal in the extreme wide range between 10 nm and 1000 μm showing three peaks at around 0 1 1 and 200 500 μm suggesting a highly complex pore constitute with presences of pores from nanometer to millimeter fig 8 c f i the fpsds vary with decreasing permeability of which the three major peaks become left skewed and amplitudes of the two right peaks reduces evidently indicating the narrowing of the pore and throat spaces all sizes of pores have contributions to the storage spaces for the samples with permeability 0 1md but the nanopores 10 nm 1 μm and micro small pores 1 10 μm dominate the porosities of the samples with permeability 0 1 md 3 2 3 pore connectivity as connected pore space dominates the fluid flow pore connectivity is more crucial in low connectivity tight porous media with complex pore structure but discussions on it are limited due to the difficulties in measurement and quantification as indicated nmr and x μct provide quantitative pore connectivity description information as the connective ratios of pores of certain sizes can be determined by the movable proportions of nmr and obtained by calculating the volume fraction of pores with coordination number 0 in x μct respectively the connective ratio distributions of the two techniques are plotted together in a same coordinate from which piecewise function relations are discovered between the pore size and the ratio fig 9 table 3 the connectivity of the pores in the size range 0 001 0 1 μm generally has positive polynomial correlations with their sizes the plots are fluctuated in the range 0 1 10 μm where two or three polynomial correlations can coexist the segment points of these piecewise functions in this range are generally at 1 0 μm and will be left skewed with permeability reduction the connectivity of the pores 10 0 μm commonly has positive correlations with diameters and connective ratio is generally equal to 1 when diameter 20 0 μm however reverse correlations are discovered in the samples with ultra low permeability e g s 8 and s 25 which may probably attributed the blockage of connected pathways between the large pore voids the connectivity of pores with sizes 100 μm is given out by x μct and generally shows positive polynomial relationships with their diameters and is commonly close to 1 with increasing pore size fig 9 a i notably the connectivity evaluations of nmr and x μct coincide in the pore size rang 10 100 μm however the indirect x μct results are not taken into account as they are strongly affected by the resolution and scanning voxel while the direct nmr measurements are believed to be more credible in this range in comparison the pore connectivity evaluation enables us to figure out the connected fpsds cfpsds by multiplying the volume fractions of certain sized pores on fpsds and connective ratios obtained from the correlations in the piecewise functions in the fig 9 table 3 the cfpsds of most of the tight sandstone samples are characterized by right skewed unimodal distribution patterns in which the high amplitudes on the right of the x axis and low amplitudes in the range 0 1 100 μm suggest the system connectivity is dominated by the pores with sizes 100 μm fig 10 bimodal cfpsd distribution patterns occur in the samples s 6 s 8 and s 25 with two peaks in the range of 0 1 10 μm and 100 1000 μm respectively the connectivity increases in these small sized pores may be attributed to the extra connections provided by the micro fractures to small void spaces as the fluid flow pathway is constructed by the connected pore spaces in terms of fluid flow therefore the key structural parameters are recorded on the basis of the cfpsds the dcmin dc50 and λmax separately referring to the minimum median and maximum connected pore diameters are listed in table 4 the dcmin is between 3 and 129 nm avg 30 26 nm dc50 ranges from 302 5 nm to 283 3 μm avg 70 19 μm and λmax is in the range 120 3 629 61 μm avg 438 59 μm the variations of mean parameter indicate evident differences in the connected flow pathways in tight porous sandstone and the positive correlations between these parameters and permeability suggest that the better connectivity is always favorable for the fluid flow capacity the connected proportion ranges from 0 15 to 0 55 avg 0 33 suggesting low connective degrees and huge connectivity variations of tight porous sandstone 3 2 4 microscopic heterogeneity of the connected pore system pore fractal dimension has been admitted as an effective parameter to describe the complexity and heterogeneity of microstructures the determination of pore fractal dimension using the psds obtained from different techniques has been thoroughly explored and explained according to the fractal principle of which the number of pores with radii r n r has a positive correlation with pore radius r i e n r r d f bale and schmidt 1984 lai et al 2018a mandelbrot 1975 mandelbrot et al 1984 qiao et al 2021 generally the df for pores in certain size range equals to the 3 k where k is the slope of the linear segments on the lg sr vs lg d plots according to the correlation of s r d d max 3 d f that is derived from the fractal principle and relations between n r and pore volume fraction note that the sr is the cumulative volume fraction for the pores with radii r diameter d fig 11 the detailed derivation procedures can refer to the studies of li and horne 2006 lai et al 2018a b and qiao et al 2021 which will not be explained in this work for simplicity the segmented linear plots in fig 11 suggest that the tight porous sandstone is characterized by highly heterogeneous microstructure with common tri fractal structure d1c d2c and d3c rising successively with increasing pore size can be obtained table 4 the d1c for the small sized pores varies widely between 0 13 and 2 04 suggesting that theses pores are not fractal but are intensely heterogeneous d2c for medium sized pores is in a narrow range of 1 48 2 38 and has a greater dimension value close to 2 indicating increases in self similarity and homogeneity while d3c for the large sized pores exhibits very little fluctuations in the range of 2 82 2 97 suggesting a high homogeneity of these pores the davg mean of the d1c d2c and d3c ranges widely from 1 66 to 2 29 indicating significant differences in the microscopic heterogeneities of the connected fluid flow pathways 3 3 insights into the utff in the nano micrometer pore system 3 3 1 relationships between the pore structure and utff the dynamic fluid flow strongly depends on the microstructural attributes of connected pore network especially for the tight porous media with nano micrometer pore size and intense heterogeneity to investigate the effects of the pore structures on the dynamic utff inside it the correlations between the key structural parameters for the connected pore networks and critical parameters for the utff including the istps average fluid velocity obtained by averaging the water flow velocity from the beginning to ending average dffc describing the ratio of total velocity increment to the total injection pressure increment from the beginning δv δp and ultimate water permeability that is the apparent water permeability at the end of utff experiment are explored figs 12 13 these correlations and their correlative coefficients show that increasing pore sizes e g dcmin dc50 and λcmax would reduce the istps and increase the average fluid velocity average dffc and ultimate water permeability figs 12 a c 13 a c while the davg and tortuosity τc exert opposite effects of which τc shows greater impacts than davg figs 12 d e 13 d h according to the correlations in figs 12 and 13 it can be deduced that the narrowing and heterogeneity and actual flow length increases of the connected pathways will increase the flow resistance and result in evident fluid velocity loss of utff in the primary gas charging or intrusion the higher correlation coefficients of the negative correlation between dc50 and istp and those of the positive correlations between dc50 average fluid velocity dffc and ultimate water apparent permeability suggest the average sizes of the flow pathways control the utff in tight porous media figs 12 b 13 a c notably instead of pore size the heterogeneities exert extra controls on the istps of utff in the case of the dc50 10 μm which can be supported by the stronger positive correlations between d1 davg and istps fig 12 a b e the utff in the extreme tight porous sandstone is controlled by the pore geometry and topology in couple supporting by the poorer correlations between davg and istp and better relations between τ and istp fig 12 d e 3 3 2 gas accessibility in the nano micrometer pore systems the gas flow behaviors in the utff could not be determined directly owing to the specialties of the primary gas intrusion or charging process and experiment design in order to investigate the gas accessibilities in the nano micrometer pore systems the water layer theory and effective percolation radius are combined and applied the water layer distribution model stems from the dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory that describes the interactions between the solid surface and aqueous solution employing the disjoining pressure churaev 2003 lebeau and konrad 2010 woodruff and revil 2011 yang and yu 2020 the disjoining pressure is composed of a short range van der waals force long range electrostatic force and structural force under the equilibrium condition which can be expressed as following israelachvili 2015 lebeau and konrad 2010 tuller and or 2003 6 π h π m h π e h π s h 7 π m h a 12 6 π h 3 8 π e h ε 0 ε r 2 π k b t ez 1 h 2 9 π s h k e h λ 10 a 12 a 11 a 22 where π h is the disjoining pressure π m h is the van der walls force π e h is the electrostatic force π s h is the structural force h is the distance from the solid surface and a12 is the hamaker constant for the intersections between solid substrate a11 and water a22 the physical constants used for calculating the interfacial of water tight sandstone interactions are listed in table 5 note that the a11 can be estimated according to the mineral constitutes acquired from xrd results in table 1 and hamaker constants for them the contributions of the three kinds of forces to the disjoining pressure are illustrated in fig 14 e g s 1 s 3 s 6 considering the interfacial forces acting on the water molecules the water in water saturated pores can be divided into four parts in the direction perpendicular to the solid surfaces including the free water layer fw outer layer of weakly bound water obw inner layer of weakly bound water ibw and strongly bound water layer sbw yang and yu 2020 fig 14 a it has been reported that the fw is not subjected to the surface force only existing in the pore zones that exceed the free plane fp the distance from the surface to the fp can has been indicated by debye length in shale approximate 960 nm yang and yu 2020 and is approximate 1509 96 nm estimated by disjoining pressure in our investigation this calculation suggests that the fw can only exist in the centers of the pores with diameters 3020 nm 2fp in tight porous sandstone water in the obw occurring in the pore zones ranging threshold plane tp to fp mainly held by the electrostatic force is less affected by the solid surface and can flow under small pressure gradients the length of solid surface to tp can be obtained by determining the cross point of the electrostatic force and structural force whereby the thickness of the obw can be determined by combining the lengths of fp and tp table 6 the water in the ibw confining between the shear plane sp and tp is controlled by molecular electrostatic and structural forces which is commonly considered to be immovable when the displacement pressure tpg but is potentially movable when the pressure tpg the length of solid surface to sp can be calculated by the cross point of the van der walls force and electrostatic force whereby the thickness of ibw can be determined water in the sbw is strongly absorbed to the solid surface and is particularly immovable whose thickness is confined by the sp ranging from 0 77 to 0 97 nm table 6 the four types of water layers can only coexist in the pores with diameter 2fp where the water flow can occur under a pressure gradient no matter how small it is for the pores with diameters in the range of 2tp 2fp there are extra pressure needs for the water movement however for the pores with sizes between 2sp and 2tp the fluid can flow only when the pressure gradient tpg while the pores with diameters 2sp do not contribute to the fluid flow it can be deduced that the presences of the pores with diameter ranging from 2sp to 2tp in the connected fluid flow pathways result in the existences of tpg in single phase flow and istp for utff and successive water movement in the fw obw and ibw zones are responsible for the increases of the effective radius and apparent permeability in the multiphase fluid flow particularly the fluid flows in obw and ibw zones dominate the effective radius and apparent permeability increases of the continuous single or multi phase flow in tight porous media combining the cfpsds and water layer thicknesses on the basis of the circular pore assumption the distributions of water layers under saturated condition in different sized connected pores can be obtained whereby the ratios for different water layers in certain sized pores can be derived using the eqs 11 14 to describe the potential static fluid mobility in tight porous sandstone fig 15 as shown in fig 15 there are only sbw and ibw exist in the pores with diameters 40 nm generally radii the sum of rsbw and ribw sbw ibw and obw present in the pores with diameters between 40 and 3020 nm while the four types of layers coexist in the pores with diameters 3020 nm the presences of the pores 40 nm in the connected flow pathway result in the existences of the istps in utff 11 r sbw 1 1 sp r 2 12 r ibw 1 sp r 2 i f s p r t p 1 sp r 2 1 tp r 2 i f r t p 13 r obw 0 i f r t p 1 tp r 2 i f t p r f p 1 tp r 2 1 fp r 2 i f r f p 14 r fw 0 i f r f p 1 fp r 2 i f r f p where r sbw r ibw r obw and r fw separately refer to the ratios of the sbw ibw obw and fw layers in certain sized pores under saturated state r is the pore radius of certain pore nm the sp tp and fp separately represent the lengths of shear plane threshold plane and free plane nm the ratio of sbw decreases with pore size and becomes minor when the diameter excesses 2tp that of ibw increases with diameter when it 2tp but decreases when diameter 2tp that of obw shows a reversed trend when the size excesses 2fp while that of fw increases with pore size since it appears which dominates the water mobility in the pores with diameters 20000 nm the ratio of potential movable water ibw obw fw representing the maximum static flow mobility in certain sized pores is positively correlated with the permeability while the ratio of the immovable water sbw shows an opposite correlation table 7 to characterize the dynamic variation of gas accessibility in the utff the effective flow radius model is introduced which can be described by the eq 15 carman 1956 civan 2013 wang et al 2015 according to the connected flow pathway identified the equation can be modified to the eq 16 15 r e 8 τ k w φ 16 r ec 8 τ c k w φ c where r e is the effective flow radius τ is the tortuosity k w is the water apparent permeability in the experiments r ec is the effective flow radius of the connected pore system τ c is the tortuosity of the connected pore system φ c is the porosity of the connected pore system according to the features of the utff we make a reasonable assumption that the calculated effective flow radius equals to gas flow radius inside the cores under the equilibrium condition by means of combining the water layer distribution and dynamic changes of effective flow radius the dynamic gas accessibility can be de deduced fig 16 a d initially gas intrudes into the pores with diameters 3020 nm and occupies the fw zone when the applied pressure is far less than istp leading to the water permeability fluctuations in the early stage in this stage no continuous water flow occurs because whole pore systems are not interconnected under the blockage generated from the pores with sizes 40 nm existing between them in this procedure the fw zones may be gradually fully occupied by gas fig 16 a when the applied injection pressure istp the water in ibw zone particularly in the zone of pores 40 nm starts to move where a connected gas flow pathway forms and an effective flow radius appears leading to the continuous water flow in downstream fig 16 b the increasing effective flow radius indicates the enhancement in gas accessibility the increments in the gas ratios in the pore system describing the dynamic gas accessibility variations along with the increase of injection pressure could be determined by integrating the water layer distribution effective gas flow radius and cfpsds the results are shown as histograms in fig 16 a c the gas storage capacity of tight porous sandstone is probably dominated by the fw ratios while the gas accessibility increases happening in the continuous fluid flow procedure mainly originate from the water movement in the obw zone since the water movement in ibw zone is volumetrically minor however the criticalities of gas accessibility increases are determined by the volumetrically minor ibw zone fig 16 the samples with greater istps are generally characterized by worse gas accessibility and lower accessibility increment in utff fig 16 under the ideal circular pore assumption the movement occurrence and distribution of fluids would inevitably associated with the pore attributes the situation presents a picture of extreme in tight porous sandstone with micro nanometer scale pore structures the ratio of immovable fluids namely the ratio of sbw and ratios of potential movable fluids the ratios of ibw and obw are negatively correlated with dc50 while the movable fluid ratio proportion of fw shows a positive correlation with dc50 suggesting the rises in the free fluid mobility with increasing pore sizes of the connected flow pathway fig 17 a d this can be further supported by the negative correlation between the dc50 and sum proportion of sbw and ibw zones where fluid can hardly flow fig 17 g and the positive relationship between dc50 and sum proportion of obw and fw zones where fluid can easily flow fig 17 h the heterogeneity exerts a relative poor effect on the fluid mobility which has a positive correlation with ratio of obw and a negative correlation with that of fw indicating that the heterogeneity increase will lead to reductions in the static fluid mobility fig 17 e f however under the dynamic conditions the dramatic decreases in the correlation coefficients suggest the effects of the pore size and heterogeneity reduce evidently fig 18 a b the strong negative correlation between the τc and gas accessibility suggests the utff in the primary gas intrusion or charging processes are controlled by the pore size complexity and heterogeneity in couple fig 18 c 4 conclusion in this paper an unsteady state two phase flow utff experiment is conducted on the natural tight sandstone to investigate the fluid flow in the primary co2 intrusion and natural gas charging processes the fluid flow behaviors are investigated by experimental analyses combining water layer theory and effective flow radius model and their pore scale controls are discussed by the systematic pore structure characterization the conclusions can be drawn as follow the utff in the primary gas intrusion or charging process is low velocity non linear flow with evident threshold for the onset of the continuous non wetting phase fluid intrusion istp of which flow regime of the wetting phase fluid can be given as v 0 i f d p d l d p 0 d l a d p d l m i f d p d l d p 0 d l the connected pathways for fluid flow in tight sandstone are identified by an innovative pore connectivity evaluation combining nmr and x μct on the basis of systematic pore system characterization the connected pore systems have wide pore size distributions psd between 3 2 nm and 758 20 μm with connectivity dominated by the pores with diameters 100 μm and heterogeneous tri fractal structures with average fractal dimension ranging from 1 66 to 2 29 the connected pore networks vary significantly in tight porous sandstone with minimum pore diameter between 3 and 129 nm median pore diameter ranging from 302 5 nm to 283 3 μm and maximum pore diameter in the range of 120 3 629 61 μm the static fluid mobility evaluation combining water layer theory and connected full range psd suggests high water mobility in the connected pathways with the sum of proportions of free water layer and outer layer of weakly bound water in the range of 71 22 97 66 the istps are probably attributed to the presences of the pores 40 nm in the connected pathways the dynamic gas accessibilities in the utff process are deduced by combining the circular pore assumption effective flow radius variation and water layer distribution under the equilibrium condition gas accessibility is dominated by the water movements in the free water layer zone when injection pressure istp while criticalities for its continuous increases are determined by the water movement in the inner layer of weakly bound water zone in the pores with sizes 40 nm presented in the connected flow pathway but its dynamic increments mainly originate from the water movement in the outer layer of weakly bound water zone during the continuous two phase fluid flow processes the complex structural attributes of connected pore system in the tight porous sandstone exert great impacts on the utff the narrowing and heterogeneity and actual flow length increases of the connected pathways raise the flow resistances and lead to fluid velocity and gas accessibility losses in the utff the differentiated connected pore systems are responsible for the flow behavior and capability differences among tight porous sandstone the high sensitivities of the static fluid mobility and dynamic flow parameters to the tortuosity suggest that the utff flow behaviors are controlled by pore size complexity and heterogeneity in couple this study provides a deep understanding for the unsteady state multiphase flow behaviors in the primary non wetting phase fluid intrusion or charging procedure in the natural tight porous rocks and their pore scale controlling
