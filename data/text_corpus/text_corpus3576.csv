17880,as a commonly used corrosion inhibitor phosphate po4 has a complicated effect on the fate and transport of lead pb in drinking water systems while the formation of pyromorphite has been recognized to be the major driving force of the pb immobilization mechanism the role of adsorption on iron oxides is still not clear this study aims to clarify the contributions of adsorption and precipitation to pb removal in a system containing both iron oxides and po4 a combination of batch experiments x ray absorption spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy was employed to distinguish the adsorbed and precipitated pb species the results indicated that the adsorption of pb on iron oxides still occurred even when the solution was supersaturated to pyromorphite i e 5 mg l p with 0 1 30 mg l pb in 0 01 m nacl solution at neutral ph in the tap water containing 0 92 mg l p and 1 mg l pb adsorption on iron oxides contributed more 62 67 than precipitation 33 38 in terms of pb removal surprisingly the pre formed pyromorphite is transformed to adsorbed species after mixing with iron oxides in water for 24 h the illustration of this transformation is important to understand the immobilization mechanisms and transport behaviors of pb in drinking water systems after the utilization of po4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords lead iron oxides phosphate adsorption precipitation 1 introduction lead pb has been commonly found to be present in drinking water and can result in serious human health problems including intellectual disability abortion and sterility edwards et al 2009 nordberg et al 2014 the main source of pb in drinking water is the corrosion of pb containing products in service lines e g pipes faucets and solders kim and herrera 2010 ng et al 2012 sublet et al 2003 triantafyllidou et al 2015 to prevent the release of pb from pipes phosphate po4 has been widely used as a corrosion inhibitor edwards and mcneill 2002 pieper et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 generally the addition of po4 in drinking water is supposed to form precipitates with pb and therefore reduce the dissolved pb concentration ng et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 in drinking water the particulate pb generally dominates the total pb concentration edwards and mcneill 2002 mcneill and edwards 2004 which occasionally was found to increase after the addition of po4 cartier et al 2013 edwards and mcneill 2002 xie and giammar 2011 due to its importance the transport of particulate pb has also been investigated by exploring the effect of inorganic ions organic materials and ph on the formation and aggregation of lead phosphate particles zhao et al 2018 among possible particulate pb pyromorphite pb5 po4 3cl usually forms rapidly i e within hours in water ma et al 1995 manecki et al 2000 stack et al 2004 and shows a low solubility product constant ksp 10 79 6 resulting in the dissolved pb of less than 0 2 mg l at ph 7 in 1 g l pyromorphite solution flis et al 2011 topolska et al 2016 xie and giammar 2007b zhang and ryan 1999 therefore pyromorphite has been considered as the primary component of the particulate pb zhao et al 2018 on the other hand the iron oxides particles commonly exist in drinking water for example the drinking water containing a high level of pb in the flint water crisis michigan united states showed yellow coloration due to the presence of iron oxides particles pieper et al 2017 nevertheless the possible interactive mechanisms between particulate pb and iron oxides particles or iron pipes in drinking water are still unknown it is also well known that the presence of po4 enhanced pb adsorption on metal oxides pan et al 2007 shi et al 2019 tiberg et al 2013 xie and giammar 2007a zhao et al 2016 the enhanced effect might result from co adsorption which occurs due to the formation of surface ternary complexes or the electrostatic attraction between positively charged pb and negatively charged po4 ions tiberg et al reported the surface ternary complexation of pb and po4 on ferrihydrite under the condition where no pb po4 precipitate was formed tiberg et al 2013 interestingly the modeling work by xie et al indicated that co adsorption might still dominate the pb removal even when the initial pb and po4 concentrations were oversaturated with respect to pyromorphite xie and giammar 2007a conversely zhang et al reported that the adsorbed pb on iron oxides could be transformed to pyromorphite zhang et al 1997 after the addition of po4 similar controversial results were also reported for immobilization of pb in soils containing phosphate while the formation of pyromorphite was recognized as the primary mechanism for pb immobilization in most studies cao et al 2003 2009 ma et al 1995 miretzky and fernandez cirelli 2008 the role of phosphate in the presence of iron oxides still remains unclear chrysochoou et al 2007 zeng et al 2017 therefore the purpose of this study is to explore the fate of pb in systems containing both iron oxides and po4 under pyromorphite supersaturated conditions to achieve this goal two questions need to be answered 1 which is the dominant pb species i e adsorbed or precipitated formed on iron oxides in the presence of po4 and 2 what is the interactive behavior between particulate pb and iron oxides to answer these two questions a quantitative study based on batch experimental data was first established to evaluate the pb species in the solids followed by x ray absorption spectroscopic xas analyses then the po4 species was also investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir overall this study distinguished the adsorbed and precipitated pb species under various conditions providing useful information in understanding the transport and fate of pb in drinking water systems in the presence of po4 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals lead stock solution of 1 g l was prepared by dissolving lead chloride pbcl2 in 1 chloride acid hcl solution po4 stock solution of 1 g l as p p po4 was prepared by dissolving disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 into deionized di water resistivity 18 2 mω cm all chemicals used were reagent grade and purchased from fisher or sigma aldrich united states the iron oxide used was a commercially available adsorbent with the name of bayoxides e33 which was obtained from adedge technologies inc united states iron oxides were sieved and the fraction between 100 and 200 mesh i e with opening sizes of 0 149 mm and 0 074 mm respectively was used for the batch study the pyromorphite was obtained by the following method a solution containing 1 g l pb 1 g l p po4 and 0 1 m nacl was mixed at ph 5 for 24 h and then filtered by a 0 4 μm membrane filter whatman united states the solids pyromorphite were collected and freeze dried under vacuum condition 2 2 an overlook of the methods used in this study in this study we firstly explored the pb species based on the data from batch experiments sections 2 3 and 3 2 for pb removal by iron oxides in the presence of po4 with a broad range of concentrations i e pb ranged from 0 to 300 mg l po4 ranged from 0 to 30 mg l as p in these two sections a method named removal mole ratio rmr was employed in which the mole of removed including both precipitated and adsorbed po4 was plotted against the mole of removed pb and analyzed using the linear regression in this method the slope of the plotted line represents the ratio of the change in removed po4 to the change in removed pb which refers to the mole ratio of p to pb in the removed solids therefore by comparing the slope to the p pb ratio 0 6 in pyromorphite it can be justified if the precipitation of pyromorphite dominates pb removal we then further used the xas spectroscopy to analyze the pb species removed by iron oxides for samples with a relatively low concentrations of pb 1 mg l and p po4 po4 as p 0 0 1 and 1 mg l sections 2 5 and 3 3 for which the rmr method failed to distinguish the pb species moreover to explore the interaction between lead and iron oxides particles the solutions containing pre precipitated lead particles was passed through a cell with pre deposited iron oxides layer in which the ir spectra were collected in real time sections 2 6 and 3 4 the transformation of pb from precipitate to adsorbed species was also studied by electron microscopy analysis sections 2 4 and 3 5 in addition the interactive mechanism i e driving force between particulate pb and iron oxides was investigated by measuring zeta potential of each of them sections 2 4 and 3 4 2 3 batch adsorption tests in this section three water systems were studied i e 0 01 m nacl solutions at ph 5 at ph 7 and tap water 2 3 1 pb removal by po4 in the absence of iron oxides firstly we explored the proportions of pb species in solutions in the presence of varying pb concentrations without iron oxides varying pb concentrations approximately 0 1 120 mg l were added into 0 01 m nacl solutions with 1 mg l p po4 these solutions were mixed at ph 5 0 0 2 or 7 0 0 2 for 24 h and then filtered for the residual dissolved pb and p po4 measurement the p po4 concentration of 1 mg l was used because a similar value is applied in practice for po4 as a corrosion inhibitor mcneill and edwards 2002a similar experiment was also conducted for tap water the tap water was directly collected in stevens james c nicoll jr environmental lab hoboken new jersey united states which has a ph of 7 2 and the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 2 during the mixing process by adding 0 1 or 1 m naoh and hcl solutions the p po4 concentration of this tap water was 0 92 mg l other ion concentrations in the tap water used were 21 mg l calcium 48 mg l sodium 95 mg l chloride and 6 5 mg l sulfate 2 3 2 effect of po4 on pb removal by iron oxides afterwards to investigate the effect of po4 on pb removal in the presence of iron oxides batch experiments were conducted by using solutions with varying pb concentrations from 0 to 300 mg l in the presence of 0 1 5 10 20 or 30 mg l p po4 here the maximum pb concentration of 300 mg l was selected to match the maximum p concentration of 30 mg l due to the mole ratio of 5 3 mass ratio of 10 1 of pb p in pyromorphite meanwhile the 0 mg l of pb was also used to explore the po4 removal by iron oxides in the absence of pb specifically the iron oxide of 0 4 g l was added into 0 01 m nacl solutions with the presence of pb and po4 these solutions were mixed at ph 5 0 0 2 during the mixing process by adding 0 1 or 1 m naoh and hcl solutions similarly the isotherm of pb adsorption on iron oxides in the presence of 5 mg l p po4 was also obtained at ph 7 0 0 2 these batch experiments were conducted at room temperature for 24 h 2 3 3 measurements of p po4 and pb concentrations after the reaction the solutions were filtered by 0 1 μm ptfe syringe filters fisher united states and the filtrate was used for dissolved po4 and pb measurements the p po4 concentrations were measured by a spectrophotometer hach dr6000 united states using the united states environmental protection agency usepa phosver 3 method method 8048 hach which has a detection limit of 0 02 mg l p and an analytical uncertainty of less than 5 the pb concentrations were measured three times by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5100 united states after acidifying samples to ph 1 using hno3 the detection limit of pb measurement is 1 9 μg l and the analytical uncertainty is less than 5 2 4 characterizations of xrd zeta potential and tem the mineralogy of the iron oxides powders was analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd analysis x ray powder diffraction data were recorded on a rigaku ultima iv japan diffractometer at 40 kv 40 ma using cu kα radiation λ 0 1541 nm scans were made in the 2θ range of 5 90 with a step size of 0 01 and a count time of 5 s per step the xrd pattern in fig s1 matches the goethite standard pdf no 29 0713 well zeta potentials of iron oxides pb po4 precipitate and the mixture of iron oxides and pb po4 precipitates in solutions were measured using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instrument united kingdom specifically 0 01 m nacl solutions containing 1 mg l pb and 1 mg l p po4 in the absence and presence of 0 01 g l iron oxides were prepared at ph 5 0 and 7 0 as well as the solutions which only contained 0 01 g l iron oxides after mixing for 24 h at ph 5 0 0 2 or 7 0 0 2 those samples were collected into disposable zeta cells dts 1070 malvern instrument united kingdom for the zeta potential measurement to prepare samples for the transmission electron microscope tem characterization the solutions of 0 01 m nacl containing 1 mg l pb and 1 mg l p po4 were mixed for 1 h followed by the addition of 0 4 g l iron oxides with a continuous mixing for 24 h this experiment was conducted both at ph 5 0 0 2 and 7 0 0 2 then the solids were separated from the suspensions by filtration using 0 4 μm membrane filters whatman united states and freeze dried under vacuum condition these solids were then dispersed into ethanol and dropped onto copper grids for the characterizations by a tem cm20 philips netherlands and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edxs mapping 2 5 xas analysis samples for xas analysis were prepared by mixing 1 mg l pb solutions with 0 4 g l iron oxides in the presence of po4 0 0 1 or 1 mg l as p for 24 h which is similar to the experiments conducted for the isotherm study the ph of the solutions was maintained at 5 0 0 2 or 7 0 0 2 by adding naoh and hcl the 1 mg l pb spiked tap water was also mixed with 0 4 g l iron oxides for 4 or 24 h these solids were also separated by filtration and freeze dried under vacuum conditions the solids were then characterized by pb liii edge 13 035 ev referencing the first maximum of the first derivative of the pb foil spectrum xas the xas spectra were collected at beamline 6 bm at the national synchrotron light source ii nsls ii brookhaven national laboratory united states an energy range of 200 1000 ev relative to the pb liii edge was used to acquire the spectra with a 4 element vortex silicon drift detector the xas spectrum of pyromorphite standard was also collected six to twelve scans were performed for each sample inspected for overall quality and averaged to improve the signal noise ratio the linear combination fitting lcf analysis was conducted using the athena program in the demeter computer package newville 2001 ravel and newville 2005 both x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs data for pb adsorption on iron oxides in the presence of 0 1 or 1 mg l p po4 were analyzed by lcf the xanes lcf fitting ranged from 30 to 100 ev relative to the pb liii edge while the exafs lcf fitting in k space ranged from 2 to 8 å 1 maclean et al 2011 during the lcf fitting no energy shift was allowed and the total weight was constrained to 1 the exafs data were further analyzed using shell by shell fitting based on feff 6 0 which was performed by the athena and artemis programs in the demeter computer package the data analytical procedure was similar to that used in our previous works shi et al 2018b zhang et al 2019a 2019b and the details were provided in the page s11 12 in the supplementary data it is worth to note that the rbkg the value below which the autobk algorithm removes fourier components was set to 1 1 or 1 2 which is about a half of the distance between pb and the nearest oxygen atom 2 3 2 4 å the feff fitting for exafs was performed over a k range from 2 to 10 å 1 and a r range uncorrected from 1 1 or 1 2 to 3 8 å 2 6 in situ flow cell atr ftir analysis to investigate po4 species on iron oxides the ftir spectra of p po4 adsorption on iron oxides under various conditions were collected in real time by in situ flow cell attenuated total reflection atr ftir technique which is similar to our previous studies shi et al 2015b 2018b this technique was performed using a nicolet nexus is50 thermo united states spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride mct detector and an additional horizontal attenuated total reflectance hatr cell pike tech u s a a multibounce znse atr crystal with 45 beveled faces infrared angle of incidence θ was used and the ftir spectra were collected using 256 scans per spectrum at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the iron oxides film on the znse crystal was made by dropping 1 ml of 3 g l iron oxides solutions followed by drying at room temperature then the background solution 0 01 m nacl at ph 5 or 7 were passed through the flow cell at a rate of 0 2 ml min until there was no further change in the ir spectrum then the background spectrum of the absorbance of the znse crystal and the deposited iron oxides with flowing nacl solution was collected after that the working solution 0 01 m nacl containing 1 mg l p po4 with 0 1 or 10 mg l pb at ph 5 or 7 were passed through the cell and the spectra were recorded every 30 min up to 24 h during the experiment these solutions were kept in a 1 l beaker stirred using the magnetic mixer and purged with n2 the second order derivatives were used to locate the peak positions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of po4 on pb removal by goethite fig s2 shows the adsorption isotherms of pb by iron oxides at ph 5 in the presence of 0 30 mg l p po4 implying a significantly enhanced effect of po4 on pb removal it was reported that po4 and pb could form ternary complexes on iron oxides surfaces tiberg et al 2013 which promoted pb removal by iron oxides moreover the adsorption of negatively charged po4 ions on iron oxides could decrease the surface charge of iron oxides and consequently increased the adsorption ability for positively charged pb ions xie and giammar 2007a also po4 and pb could precipitate to pyromorphite which has a very low solubility flis et al 2011 topolska et al 2016 xie and giammar 2007b zhang and ryan 1999 thus one or more of the aforementioned reasons might be responsible for the improved pb removal by ion oxides in the presence of po4 the complexity was confirmed by the experimental results in fig s3 which shows that precipitates are formed when the pb concentration is higher than 0 2 mg l in the presence of 1 mg l p po4 without iron oxides hence it is of vital importance to distinguish the precipitation and co adsorption for further understanding the enhanced mechanism of pb removal by iron oxides in the presence of po4 3 2 exploration of pb species using removal mole ratio method the removal mole ratio rmr method was applied to explore the pb species in the removed solids the removed including both precipitated and adsorbed p po4 was plotted against the removed pb in unit of mole and their correlation was analyzed by a linear regression the slope obtained in the rmr method refers to the mole ratio of the increment of removed p po4 to removed pb therefore the value of the slope can be used to justify if the pb species in the solids is pyromorphite by comparing it with the mole ratio of p po4 to pb in pyromorphite po4 3 pb5 0 6 this phenomenon was confirmed by the value of the slope 0 599 fig 1 a for the solution without the presence of iron oxides in which only precipitation occurred the results shown in fig s2 i e effect of po4 on pb removal by iron oxides were further analyzed using rmr method fig 1b f in the presence of 1 mg l 32 μm p po4 fig 1b the regression line was horizontal which is independent with the increase of removed pb because po4 was completely adsorbed on iron oxides even in the absence of pb on the other hand when the p po4 concentration was 5 30 mg l fig 1c f the lines exhibited two slopes i the rising portion of the line results from the increase of both removed p po4 and pb ii the horizontal portion of the line is a result of the complete removal of po4 the slopes increased from 0 346 to 0 616 with the increase of p po4 from 5 mg l 162 μm figs 1c to 20 mg l 645 μm fig 1e however the slopes stopped increasing after reaching the value of 0 6 0 616 at 20 mg l p po4 and 0 592 at 30 mg l p po4 fig 1e and f hence it is obvious that pb was removed totally by precipitation with phosphate when p po4 concentration was higher than 20 mg l 645 μm on the other hand when p po4 concentration was 5 or 10 mg l both precipitation and adsorption contributed to pb removal at neutral ph 7 0 0 2 the pb species in solutions without the presence of iron oxides is also controlled by the precipitation of pyromorphite as evidenced by the slope of 0 597 fig s4a nevertheless in the presence of iron oxides the slope value decreased to 0 473 fig s4b this value is lower than 0 6 implying that partial pb is in adsorbed species in the tap water containing 0 92 mg l dissolved p po4 spiking 1 mg l pb resulted in a dissolved pb concentration of 0 11 mg l i e after filtered by 0 1 μm ptfe filter showing that the majority of pb in tap water is precipitated species the precipitate is also pyromorphite evidenced by the value of the slope obtained from the rmr analysis 0 613 fig s5 please note that in tap water the phosphate might form apatite or iron phosphate precipitate which also shows significant pb adsorption ability liu and zhao 2007 2013 however the concentration of apatite or iron phosphate particles 1 mg l in this study is much lower than the concentration of iron oxides 0 4 g l therefore the effect from apatite or iron phosphate particles is not comparable to iron oxides in terms of pb removal here 3 3 spectroscopic analysis for pb species 3 3 1 xanes analysis based on the analysis of rmr method both adsorbed and precipitated pb species were found in the solids when initial pb and p concentrations are lower than 10 mg l at ph 5 or 5 mg l at ph 7 it is expected that the percentage of adsorbed pb would increase when p po4 decreased to 1 mg l however rmr is not suitable when p po4 is low because all po4 is adsorbed on iron oxides even in the absence of pb leading to a slope value of 0 fig 1b nevertheless it is important to investigate the pb species on iron oxides in the presence of low p po4 i e lower than 1 mg l because 1 mg l is a commonly used dosage for p po4 as a corrosion inhibitor mcneill and edwards 2002b and also similar to the p po4 concentration in tap water used in this study 0 92 mg l therefore xas was employed to identify the pb species removed by iron oxides when the p po4 was lower than 1 mg l xas is sensitive to the change of the coordination environment of pb and has been widely used for investigating pb species bargar et al 1996 1997a barrett et al 2010 maclean et al 2011 qin et al 2006 strawn and sparks 1999 fig 2 and fig s6 show the xanes spectra and their first derivatives for pb adsorption on iron oxides under different conditions respectively the pyromorphite and pb adsorption on iron oxides in the absence of po4 were also characterized as the standards of only precipitated and adsorbed pb respectively obvious differences were observed between the spectra of only precipitated and adsorbed pb two features shown on the xanes spectra for only adsorbed pb located at 13 051 and 13 092 ev fig 2 shifted to lower energies in only precipitated pb 13 047 and 13 083 ev the shifts of these two features are significant because the differences 4 ev are over ten times higher than the energy step 0 3 ev used for the xanes spectra collection and the edge of the spectra did not shift evidenced by the first derivative xanes spectra shown in fig s6 moreover because most of the pb was removed when the initial pb was only 1 mg l the content of pb in these solids are in a similar range from 2 2 to 2 5 mg g the surface area of the goethite used in this study is reported to be 128 158 m2 g kanematsu et al 2010 naeem et al 2007 which is sufficient to a monolayer pb adsorption of up to 0 5 2 2 mm g 103 450 mg g based on an approximate site density of 2 3 10 1018 sites m2 kanematsu et al 2010 villalobos et al 2001 therefore the shifts of these two features are resulting from the difference between precipitated and adsorbed pb species rather than the change of surface loading i e from monolayer adsorption to multiple layers adsorption these two features were therefore used to distinguish the precipitated and adsorbed pb species at ph 5 0 the position of these two features did not change in the presence of 0 1 mg l p po4 however in the presence of 1 mg l p po4 at ph 5 0 the feature at 13 051 ev shifted to 13 049 ev while the feature at 13 092 ev did not shift this interesting phenomenon suggests that the presence of p po4 at ph 5 0 resulted in a significant change of coordination environment of pb but such a complexation structure is different from pyromorphite on the other hand the features of pb xanes spectra in the presence of p po4 at ph 7 0 were the same as those of precipitated pb implying the majority of pb was precipitated in tap water those two features also shift but the positions 13 049 and 13 087 ev are not the same as those in precipitated pb 13 047 and 13 083 ev suggesting that pb is not completely removed by precipitation in the presence of iron oxides 3 3 2 lcf fitting for xanes and exafs spectra linear combination fitting lcf was conducted to quantitatively analyze the pb species in solids produced in the presence of po4 fig s7a and table s1 samples of pb adsorption on iron oxides in the absence of po4 and pb po4 precipitate of pyromorphite were used to represent the only adsorbed and precipitated pb species respectively the lcf for xanes spectra showed a good quality fit r factor 0 01 chi square 0 05 table s1 fitting results show the existence of both adsorbed and precipitated pb in the presence of po4 the increase in po4 promoted the formation of precipitated pb i e from 29 7 to 53 1 at ph 5 and 54 1 80 7 at ph 7 these values also showed that more precipitated pb was formed at ph 7 than that at ph 5 based on the thermodynamic solubility of pyromorphite shown fig s8 about 3 8 of pb is dissolved in the solution with an initial 1 mg l pb and 1 mg l p po4 at ph 5 whereas only 0 025 of pb is dissolved at ph 7 therefore the more adsorbed pb species observed at ph 5 might be due to the higher solubility of pyromorphite at ph 5 however in the presence of iron oxides the adsorbed pb species 19 3 79 8 accounts for much higher than that in the absence of iron oxides 0 025 3 8 implying the inhibitory effect of iron oxides on the formation of pyromorphite although the p po4 concentration in tap water is as high as 0 92 mg l the precipitated pb species 37 8 41 6 table s1 is much lower than that in 0 01 m nacl solution with 1 mg l p po4 80 7 this result agrees well with the difference in the position shift of features for 0 01 m nacl solution and tap water as mentioned earlier this difference might be due to the lower chloride concentration 95 mg l 0 003 m in tap water than that in 0 01 m nacl solution because chloride is an essential part of pyromorphite pb5 po4 3cl and the presence of cl reduced the dissolved pb concentration by 1 2 orders martínez et al 2004 in addition more co existing ions in tap water might affect the formation of precipitate as was observed in previous studies regarding iron arsenate precipitate peng et al 2017 shi et al 2018a the lcf for exafs in k space was also conducted fig s7b although the fitting results agreed well with those of the xanes lcf within 10 difference table s1 the fitting quality was poor because of the unacceptably high values of r factors 0 14 0 51 and chi squares 0 35 0 78 such a poor fitting quality indicates that the pb complexation mechanism was not a physical mixture of adsorbed and precipitated pb and it suggests a different complexation structure while xanes is usually sensitive to the nearest shell surrounding the pb atom barrett et al 2010 rao and wong 1984 strawn and sparks 1999 exafs could present shell information farther from the center i e second or third shell surrounding the pb atom bargar et al 1997a b barrett et al 2010 cotter howells et al 1994 elzinga et al 2001 tiberg et al 2013 villalobos et al 2005 therefore the fact that the quality of exafs lcf was worse than that of xanes lcf implies that the structural difference between pb on iron oxides in the presence of po4 and pyromorphite mainly occurs in the second or third shell 3 3 3 feff fitting for exafs spectra to further understand the pb complexation structure on iron oxides in the presence of po4 the exafs spectra were analyzed using shell by shell feff fitting the difference between the exafs spectra of adsorbed and precipitated pb is more significant in r space i e imaginary part of fourier transformed ft exafs spectrum fig 3 b pyromorphite has two peaks below 2 5 å uncorrected r on its ft exafs spectrum suggesting various pb o interatomic distances which agreed well with previous exafs studies cotter howells et al 1994 1999 on the other hand only one significant peak appeared below 2 5 å on the ft exafs spectrum for pb adsorption on iron oxides at ph 5 which is different from pb po4 precipitate for samples of pb adsorption on iron oxides ph 7 this second peak appeared when p po4 reached 1 mg l red vertical line shown in fig 3b which can also be seen on the spectra for samples obtained in tap water although this second peak showed same position with pyromorphite the relative peak intensity to the first ft peak is different confirming a structural difference between adsorbed pb on iron oxides in the presence of po4 and pyromorphite feff fittings for these exafs spectra were conducted to explore more structural information fig 3 and table s2 in pyromorphite pb presents with two different coordination environment pb1 and pb2 shown in fig s9 which is degenerated as 0 5 o at 2 37 å 1 5 o at 2 55 å 3 5 o at 2 67 å 1 cl at 3 12 å and 0 5 p at 3 24 å however the fitting results for pyromorphite only reveal two o shells 1 5 and 1 0 o at 2 41 å and 2 63 å respectively and a p shell 0 7 at 3 23 å showing a different profile from the theoretical crystalline structure in pyromorphite such differences were also observed in a previous exafs study ryan et al 2001 and the reason might be the heavy overlaps of these shells and the limitations of the exafs feff fitting for only adsorbed pb a bidentate cn of o 1 8 2 5 mononuclear cn of fe 0 9 1 configuration was obtained at both ph 5 and 7 table s2 in agreement with the previous study by bargar et al 1997b at ph 5 the cn of first o shell increased to 2 7 in the presence of 0 1 and 1 mg l p po4 explaining the difference in xanes spectra the increased cn of the first o shell might result from the complexation between pb and po4 on iron oxides surfaces i e surface ternary complexation which was reported by tiberg et al 2013 a similar structure was also observed for samples in the presence of 0 1 mg l p po4 at ph 7 however when p po4 increased to 1 mg l at ph 7 the pb complexation structure dramatically changed the cn of the first o shell decreased to 1 4 and a second o shell cn 4 2 at 2 58 å appeared meanwhile the third shell was fitted better by p rather than fe fig s10 and table s3 this fashion was similar to that of pyromorphite indicating that the majority of pb in the solids was precipitated in agreement with lcf and feff fittings nevertheless this fashion and pyromorphite showed obvious differences in the cn of second o shell and the bond length of pb o table s2 implying that the formation of precipitate was affected by the presence of iron oxides overall the xanes analysis confirmed the presence of adsorbed pb in the presence of 0 1 or 1 mg l p po4 both at ph 5 and 7 the exafs fitting results revealed a possible formation of surface ternary complexation between pb and po4 on iron oxides surfaces at ph 5 the majority of removed pb was adsorbed species in the presence of 0 1 and 1 mg l p po4 at ph 7 the adsorbed pb and the precipitated pb made up a larger proportion for 0 1 and 1 mg l p po4 respectively 3 4 phosphate species analysis the removed po4 species was investigated by in situ flow cell atr ftir technique fig 4 which has been widely used for analysis of different species of oxyanions arai and sparks 2001 connor and mcquillan 1999 daou et al 2007 hug 1997 kubicki et al 2012 peak et al 1999 reddy et al 2008 ronson and mcquillan 2002 shi et al 2015a solecka et al 2017 tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 even for the protonation of the adsorbed oxyanions shi et al 2015a tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 similar to xas study the po4 adsorbed on iron oxides in the absence of pb was used to represent only adsorbed po4 whereas the pyromorphite was used as only precipitated po4 the final ftir spectra of those samples after 24 h reaction are shown in fig s11 and the analyses of ftir bands are detailed in the page s15 of supplementary data briefly po4 was adsorbed on iron oxides as a bidentate binuclear configuration showing a different ftir spectrum from that of pyromorphite the highest peak positions for only precipitated and only adsorbed po4 located at 970 and 1042 cm 1 respectively therefore the peak intensities at 1042 and 970 cm 1 are used as indicators for the adsorbed and precipitated po4 species respectively for only adsorbed po4 no peak was observed at 970 cm 1 however a broad peak at 970 cm 1 was observed in the presence of 10 mg l pb at both ph 5 0 and 7 0 showing the presence of pyromorphite on iron oxides surfaces it is important to note that the pyromorphite was formed before the solution passed through the flow cell where iron oxides were attached therefore the presence of pyromorphite on iron oxides indicated that pyromorphite can be adsorbed on iron oxides the adsorption of pyromorphite on iron oxides was most likely driven by electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged pyromorphite zeta potential values of 23 4 to 10 9 mv table s4 and positively charged iron oxides zeta potential values of 26 2 35 6 mv the ratio i1042 970 of the intensity of ftir peaks at 1042 i1042 to that at 970 i970 was employed to analyze the relative abundance of the adsorbed and precipitated po4 under different conditions the i1042 970 of the only precipitated po4 was 0 58 fig s11 whereas that of the only adsorbed po4 was 2 1 at ph 5 and 2 5 at ph 7 fig s11 and fig 4 in the presence of pb i1042 970 decreased due to the presence of precipitated po4 interestingly an obvious increase in i1042 970 was observed for the po4 adsorption in the presence of 1 and 10 mg l pb at ph 5 as well as that in the presence of 10 mg l pb at ph 7 however the i1042 970 for po4 adsorption on iron oxides in the absence of pb showed no significant change the first five points were not considered due to the low signal noise ratio at ph 5 and 7 3 5 transformation from precipitated to adsorbed pb species the increasing i1042 970 trend implied a decreasing proportion of precipitated po4 during adsorption suggesting the transformation of po4 from precipitated to adsorbed species after pyromorphite adsorbed on iron oxides the adsorbed pb species accounted for 46 9 at ph 5 and 19 3 at ph 7 at equilibrium under this experimental condition based on the xanes analysis table s1 however prior to the transformation the precipitated pb species accounted for almost 100 resulting in the transformation from precipitated to adsorbed pb species the change in i1042 970 was more significant at ph 5 than at ph 7 suggesting that the transformation was more favorable at ph 5 at ph 7 the change of i1042 970 in the presence of 1 mg l pb is insignificant whereas that in the presence of 10 mg l pb is clear this difference resulted from the high proportion of dissolved po4 90 of total po4 when pb concentration is 1 mg l in which adsorption of dissolved po4 rather than precipitated po4 dominated the adsorption process however the transformation is more significant at ph 5 in which the significant change of i1042 970 was observed the transformation from precipitated to adsorbed pb is more visible in tem images fig 5 shows the tem images of the solids produced by mixing pyromorphite with iron oxides at ph 5 and 7 for 24 h at ph 5 evenly distributed pb and p elements along with fe and o are observed fig 5c f suggesting the presence of the adsorbed pb and p the presence of adsorbed pb on iron oxides surface confirmed the transformation of pb from precipitated to adsorbed species because 1 mg l pb was totally precipitated by the formation of pyromorphite in the presence of 1 mg l p po4 before interacting with the iron oxides i e passing through the cell in contrast pyromorphite particles were clearly captured in the tem image of the solids at ph 7 fig 5b furthermore the edxs mapping results showed a concentrated rather than an even distribution of pb and p elements fig 5i and j which is independent from the distribution of fe and o elements indicating the detection of precipitate therefore the tem edxs characterization results prove that the transformation of pb and po4 from precipitated to adsorbed species is more favorable at ph 5 than that at ph 7 in agreement with the in situ flow cell atr ftir characterization interestingly a previous study implied the adsorbed pb on goethite would be transformed to pyromorphite after the addition of po4 zhang et al 1997 which is different from our observations however in that study po4 was directly added into solution containing dissolved pb in which the pyromorphite could form in solution firstly moreover the p po4 and pb concentrations used in that study were as high as 2 5 10 4 m 7 6 mg l and 3 75 10 4 m 77 6 mg l respectively even so they did not exclude the adsorbed pb species by contrast adsorption was proved to be the dominant mechanism for pb removal based on the surface complexation modeling xie and giammar 2007a study by xie et al in which the pb concentration was 5 10 7 m 0 1 mg l with p po4 ranged from 10 9 to 10 3 m 0 00003 31 mg l our study clearly showed that the precipitated pb species increased with the increasing initial phosphate and pb concentrations therefore the transformation between precipitated and adsorbed pb species correlated with the initial po4 and pb concentrations in addition the transformation is more favorable at acidic conditions which might be due to the higher solubility of pyromorphite at ph 5 the reason might be the faster transformation from pyromorphite to adsorbed pb on iron oxides at ph 5 because of the higher dissolved pb concentration 38 μg l fig s8 at ph 5 than that at ph 7 0 25 μg l 4 conclusions in summary the results gained from this study can answer those two questions asked in the introduction 1 in the tap water with the presence of iron oxides particle and po4 adsorption contributes 58 62 more than precipitation 38 42 for pb removal 2 the negatively charged pb particles majorly pyromorphite can be adsorbed onto the positively charged iron oxides particles such adsorption might be a weak physical adsorption due to the electric attraction but finally leads to a chemical transformation of pb from precipitated to adsorbed species on iron oxides surface after 24 h mixing this transformation is more favorable at acidic condition due to the higher solubility of pyromorphite at ph 5 than ph 7 po4 is commonly used as a corrosion inhibitor in drinking water systems which has further been proved to be a useful method to reduce pb concentrations previously the formation of the pyromorphite has been recognized as the primary pb removal mechanism however this study evidenced that more pb was adsorbed rather than precipitated in tap water with the co existing iron oxides particles and po4 moreover the precipitated pb can be transformed to adsorbed pb on iron oxides surface this study improved our understanding regarding the pb species in drinking water given the fact that the iron oxides particles in drinking water are likely loaded with adsorbed pb distinguishing pb species is also helpful for selection of suitable methodologies i e adsorption or filtration for pb removal meanwhile it has been reported that the pb species and particle size of lead bearing media significantly affect the bioavailability of lead and its absorption by human tissues mushak 1991 therefore the results of this study may also be

17880,as a commonly used corrosion inhibitor phosphate po4 has a complicated effect on the fate and transport of lead pb in drinking water systems while the formation of pyromorphite has been recognized to be the major driving force of the pb immobilization mechanism the role of adsorption on iron oxides is still not clear this study aims to clarify the contributions of adsorption and precipitation to pb removal in a system containing both iron oxides and po4 a combination of batch experiments x ray absorption spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy was employed to distinguish the adsorbed and precipitated pb species the results indicated that the adsorption of pb on iron oxides still occurred even when the solution was supersaturated to pyromorphite i e 5 mg l p with 0 1 30 mg l pb in 0 01 m nacl solution at neutral ph in the tap water containing 0 92 mg l p and 1 mg l pb adsorption on iron oxides contributed more 62 67 than precipitation 33 38 in terms of pb removal surprisingly the pre formed pyromorphite is transformed to adsorbed species after mixing with iron oxides in water for 24 h the illustration of this transformation is important to understand the immobilization mechanisms and transport behaviors of pb in drinking water systems after the utilization of po4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords lead iron oxides phosphate adsorption precipitation 1 introduction lead pb has been commonly found to be present in drinking water and can result in serious human health problems including intellectual disability abortion and sterility edwards et al 2009 nordberg et al 2014 the main source of pb in drinking water is the corrosion of pb containing products in service lines e g pipes faucets and solders kim and herrera 2010 ng et al 2012 sublet et al 2003 triantafyllidou et al 2015 to prevent the release of pb from pipes phosphate po4 has been widely used as a corrosion inhibitor edwards and mcneill 2002 pieper et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 generally the addition of po4 in drinking water is supposed to form precipitates with pb and therefore reduce the dissolved pb concentration ng et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 in drinking water the particulate pb generally dominates the total pb concentration edwards and mcneill 2002 mcneill and edwards 2004 which occasionally was found to increase after the addition of po4 cartier et al 2013 edwards and mcneill 2002 xie and giammar 2011 due to its importance the transport of particulate pb has also been investigated by exploring the effect of inorganic ions organic materials and ph on the formation and aggregation of lead phosphate particles zhao et al 2018 among possible particulate pb pyromorphite pb5 po4 3cl usually forms rapidly i e within hours in water ma et al 1995 manecki et al 2000 stack et al 2004 and shows a low solubility product constant ksp 10 79 6 resulting in the dissolved pb of less than 0 2 mg l at ph 7 in 1 g l pyromorphite solution flis et al 2011 topolska et al 2016 xie and giammar 2007b zhang and ryan 1999 therefore pyromorphite has been considered as the primary component of the particulate pb zhao et al 2018 on the other hand the iron oxides particles commonly exist in drinking water for example the drinking water containing a high level of pb in the flint water crisis michigan united states showed yellow coloration due to the presence of iron oxides particles pieper et al 2017 nevertheless the possible interactive mechanisms between particulate pb and iron oxides particles or iron pipes in drinking water are still unknown it is also well known that the presence of po4 enhanced pb adsorption on metal oxides pan et al 2007 shi et al 2019 tiberg et al 2013 xie and giammar 2007a zhao et al 2016 the enhanced effect might result from co adsorption which occurs due to the formation of surface ternary complexes or the electrostatic attraction between positively charged pb and negatively charged po4 ions tiberg et al reported the surface ternary complexation of pb and po4 on ferrihydrite under the condition where no pb po4 precipitate was formed tiberg et al 2013 interestingly the modeling work by xie et al indicated that co adsorption might still dominate the pb removal even when the initial pb and po4 concentrations were oversaturated with respect to pyromorphite xie and giammar 2007a conversely zhang et al reported that the adsorbed pb on iron oxides could be transformed to pyromorphite zhang et al 1997 after the addition of po4 similar controversial results were also reported for immobilization of pb in soils containing phosphate while the formation of pyromorphite was recognized as the primary mechanism for pb immobilization in most studies cao et al 2003 2009 ma et al 1995 miretzky and fernandez cirelli 2008 the role of phosphate in the presence of iron oxides still remains unclear chrysochoou et al 2007 zeng et al 2017 therefore the purpose of this study is to explore the fate of pb in systems containing both iron oxides and po4 under pyromorphite supersaturated conditions to achieve this goal two questions need to be answered 1 which is the dominant pb species i e adsorbed or precipitated formed on iron oxides in the presence of po4 and 2 what is the interactive behavior between particulate pb and iron oxides to answer these two questions a quantitative study based on batch experimental data was first established to evaluate the pb species in the solids followed by x ray absorption spectroscopic xas analyses then the po4 species was also investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir overall this study distinguished the adsorbed and precipitated pb species under various conditions providing useful information in understanding the transport and fate of pb in drinking water systems in the presence of po4 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals lead stock solution of 1 g l was prepared by dissolving lead chloride pbcl2 in 1 chloride acid hcl solution po4 stock solution of 1 g l as p p po4 was prepared by dissolving disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 into deionized di water resistivity 18 2 mω cm all chemicals used were reagent grade and purchased from fisher or sigma aldrich united states the iron oxide used was a commercially available adsorbent with the name of bayoxides e33 which was obtained from adedge technologies inc united states iron oxides were sieved and the fraction between 100 and 200 mesh i e with opening sizes of 0 149 mm and 0 074 mm respectively was used for the batch study the pyromorphite was obtained by the following method a solution containing 1 g l pb 1 g l p po4 and 0 1 m nacl was mixed at ph 5 for 24 h and then filtered by a 0 4 μm membrane filter whatman united states the solids pyromorphite were collected and freeze dried under vacuum condition 2 2 an overlook of the methods used in this study in this study we firstly explored the pb species based on the data from batch experiments sections 2 3 and 3 2 for pb removal by iron oxides in the presence of po4 with a broad range of concentrations i e pb ranged from 0 to 300 mg l po4 ranged from 0 to 30 mg l as p in these two sections a method named removal mole ratio rmr was employed in which the mole of removed including both precipitated and adsorbed po4 was plotted against the mole of removed pb and analyzed using the linear regression in this method the slope of the plotted line represents the ratio of the change in removed po4 to the change in removed pb which refers to the mole ratio of p to pb in the removed solids therefore by comparing the slope to the p pb ratio 0 6 in pyromorphite it can be justified if the precipitation of pyromorphite dominates pb removal we then further used the xas spectroscopy to analyze the pb species removed by iron oxides for samples with a relatively low concentrations of pb 1 mg l and p po4 po4 as p 0 0 1 and 1 mg l sections 2 5 and 3 3 for which the rmr method failed to distinguish the pb species moreover to explore the interaction between lead and iron oxides particles the solutions containing pre precipitated lead particles was passed through a cell with pre deposited iron oxides layer in which the ir spectra were collected in real time sections 2 6 and 3 4 the transformation of pb from precipitate to adsorbed species was also studied by electron microscopy analysis sections 2 4 and 3 5 in addition the interactive mechanism i e driving force between particulate pb and iron oxides was investigated by measuring zeta potential of each of them sections 2 4 and 3 4 2 3 batch adsorption tests in this section three water systems were studied i e 0 01 m nacl solutions at ph 5 at ph 7 and tap water 2 3 1 pb removal by po4 in the absence of iron oxides firstly we explored the proportions of pb species in solutions in the presence of varying pb concentrations without iron oxides varying pb concentrations approximately 0 1 120 mg l were added into 0 01 m nacl solutions with 1 mg l p po4 these solutions were mixed at ph 5 0 0 2 or 7 0 0 2 for 24 h and then filtered for the residual dissolved pb and p po4 measurement the p po4 concentration of 1 mg l was used because a similar value is applied in practice for po4 as a corrosion inhibitor mcneill and edwards 2002a similar experiment was also conducted for tap water the tap water was directly collected in stevens james c nicoll jr environmental lab hoboken new jersey united states which has a ph of 7 2 and the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 2 during the mixing process by adding 0 1 or 1 m naoh and hcl solutions the p po4 concentration of this tap water was 0 92 mg l other ion concentrations in the tap water used were 21 mg l calcium 48 mg l sodium 95 mg l chloride and 6 5 mg l sulfate 2 3 2 effect of po4 on pb removal by iron oxides afterwards to investigate the effect of po4 on pb removal in the presence of iron oxides batch experiments were conducted by using solutions with varying pb concentrations from 0 to 300 mg l in the presence of 0 1 5 10 20 or 30 mg l p po4 here the maximum pb concentration of 300 mg l was selected to match the maximum p concentration of 30 mg l due to the mole ratio of 5 3 mass ratio of 10 1 of pb p in pyromorphite meanwhile the 0 mg l of pb was also used to explore the po4 removal by iron oxides in the absence of pb specifically the iron oxide of 0 4 g l was added into 0 01 m nacl solutions with the presence of pb and po4 these solutions were mixed at ph 5 0 0 2 during the mixing process by adding 0 1 or 1 m naoh and hcl solutions similarly the isotherm of pb adsorption on iron oxides in the presence of 5 mg l p po4 was also obtained at ph 7 0 0 2 these batch experiments were conducted at room temperature for 24 h 2 3 3 measurements of p po4 and pb concentrations after the reaction the solutions were filtered by 0 1 μm ptfe syringe filters fisher united states and the filtrate was used for dissolved po4 and pb measurements the p po4 concentrations were measured by a spectrophotometer hach dr6000 united states using the united states environmental protection agency usepa phosver 3 method method 8048 hach which has a detection limit of 0 02 mg l p and an analytical uncertainty of less than 5 the pb concentrations were measured three times by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5100 united states after acidifying samples to ph 1 using hno3 the detection limit of pb measurement is 1 9 μg l and the analytical uncertainty is less than 5 2 4 characterizations of xrd zeta potential and tem the mineralogy of the iron oxides powders was analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd analysis x ray powder diffraction data were recorded on a rigaku ultima iv japan diffractometer at 40 kv 40 ma using cu kα radiation λ 0 1541 nm scans were made in the 2θ range of 5 90 with a step size of 0 01 and a count time of 5 s per step the xrd pattern in fig s1 matches the goethite standard pdf no 29 0713 well zeta potentials of iron oxides pb po4 precipitate and the mixture of iron oxides and pb po4 precipitates in solutions were measured using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instrument united kingdom specifically 0 01 m nacl solutions containing 1 mg l pb and 1 mg l p po4 in the absence and presence of 0 01 g l iron oxides were prepared at ph 5 0 and 7 0 as well as the solutions which only contained 0 01 g l iron oxides after mixing for 24 h at ph 5 0 0 2 or 7 0 0 2 those samples were collected into disposable zeta cells dts 1070 malvern instrument united kingdom for the zeta potential measurement to prepare samples for the transmission electron microscope tem characterization the solutions of 0 01 m nacl containing 1 mg l pb and 1 mg l p po4 were mixed for 1 h followed by the addition of 0 4 g l iron oxides with a continuous mixing for 24 h this experiment was conducted both at ph 5 0 0 2 and 7 0 0 2 then the solids were separated from the suspensions by filtration using 0 4 μm membrane filters whatman united states and freeze dried under vacuum condition these solids were then dispersed into ethanol and dropped onto copper grids for the characterizations by a tem cm20 philips netherlands and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edxs mapping 2 5 xas analysis samples for xas analysis were prepared by mixing 1 mg l pb solutions with 0 4 g l iron oxides in the presence of po4 0 0 1 or 1 mg l as p for 24 h which is similar to the experiments conducted for the isotherm study the ph of the solutions was maintained at 5 0 0 2 or 7 0 0 2 by adding naoh and hcl the 1 mg l pb spiked tap water was also mixed with 0 4 g l iron oxides for 4 or 24 h these solids were also separated by filtration and freeze dried under vacuum conditions the solids were then characterized by pb liii edge 13 035 ev referencing the first maximum of the first derivative of the pb foil spectrum xas the xas spectra were collected at beamline 6 bm at the national synchrotron light source ii nsls ii brookhaven national laboratory united states an energy range of 200 1000 ev relative to the pb liii edge was used to acquire the spectra with a 4 element vortex silicon drift detector the xas spectrum of pyromorphite standard was also collected six to twelve scans were performed for each sample inspected for overall quality and averaged to improve the signal noise ratio the linear combination fitting lcf analysis was conducted using the athena program in the demeter computer package newville 2001 ravel and newville 2005 both x ray absorption near edge structure xanes and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs data for pb adsorption on iron oxides in the presence of 0 1 or 1 mg l p po4 were analyzed by lcf the xanes lcf fitting ranged from 30 to 100 ev relative to the pb liii edge while the exafs lcf fitting in k space ranged from 2 to 8 å 1 maclean et al 2011 during the lcf fitting no energy shift was allowed and the total weight was constrained to 1 the exafs data were further analyzed using shell by shell fitting based on feff 6 0 which was performed by the athena and artemis programs in the demeter computer package the data analytical procedure was similar to that used in our previous works shi et al 2018b zhang et al 2019a 2019b and the details were provided in the page s11 12 in the supplementary data it is worth to note that the rbkg the value below which the autobk algorithm removes fourier components was set to 1 1 or 1 2 which is about a half of the distance between pb and the nearest oxygen atom 2 3 2 4 å the feff fitting for exafs was performed over a k range from 2 to 10 å 1 and a r range uncorrected from 1 1 or 1 2 to 3 8 å 2 6 in situ flow cell atr ftir analysis to investigate po4 species on iron oxides the ftir spectra of p po4 adsorption on iron oxides under various conditions were collected in real time by in situ flow cell attenuated total reflection atr ftir technique which is similar to our previous studies shi et al 2015b 2018b this technique was performed using a nicolet nexus is50 thermo united states spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride mct detector and an additional horizontal attenuated total reflectance hatr cell pike tech u s a a multibounce znse atr crystal with 45 beveled faces infrared angle of incidence θ was used and the ftir spectra were collected using 256 scans per spectrum at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the iron oxides film on the znse crystal was made by dropping 1 ml of 3 g l iron oxides solutions followed by drying at room temperature then the background solution 0 01 m nacl at ph 5 or 7 were passed through the flow cell at a rate of 0 2 ml min until there was no further change in the ir spectrum then the background spectrum of the absorbance of the znse crystal and the deposited iron oxides with flowing nacl solution was collected after that the working solution 0 01 m nacl containing 1 mg l p po4 with 0 1 or 10 mg l pb at ph 5 or 7 were passed through the cell and the spectra were recorded every 30 min up to 24 h during the experiment these solutions were kept in a 1 l beaker stirred using the magnetic mixer and purged with n2 the second order derivatives were used to locate the peak positions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of po4 on pb removal by goethite fig s2 shows the adsorption isotherms of pb by iron oxides at ph 5 in the presence of 0 30 mg l p po4 implying a significantly enhanced effect of po4 on pb removal it was reported that po4 and pb could form ternary complexes on iron oxides surfaces tiberg et al 2013 which promoted pb removal by iron oxides moreover the adsorption of negatively charged po4 ions on iron oxides could decrease the surface charge of iron oxides and consequently increased the adsorption ability for positively charged pb ions xie and giammar 2007a also po4 and pb could precipitate to pyromorphite which has a very low solubility flis et al 2011 topolska et al 2016 xie and giammar 2007b zhang and ryan 1999 thus one or more of the aforementioned reasons might be responsible for the improved pb removal by ion oxides in the presence of po4 the complexity was confirmed by the experimental results in fig s3 which shows that precipitates are formed when the pb concentration is higher than 0 2 mg l in the presence of 1 mg l p po4 without iron oxides hence it is of vital importance to distinguish the precipitation and co adsorption for further understanding the enhanced mechanism of pb removal by iron oxides in the presence of po4 3 2 exploration of pb species using removal mole ratio method the removal mole ratio rmr method was applied to explore the pb species in the removed solids the removed including both precipitated and adsorbed p po4 was plotted against the removed pb in unit of mole and their correlation was analyzed by a linear regression the slope obtained in the rmr method refers to the mole ratio of the increment of removed p po4 to removed pb therefore the value of the slope can be used to justify if the pb species in the solids is pyromorphite by comparing it with the mole ratio of p po4 to pb in pyromorphite po4 3 pb5 0 6 this phenomenon was confirmed by the value of the slope 0 599 fig 1 a for the solution without the presence of iron oxides in which only precipitation occurred the results shown in fig s2 i e effect of po4 on pb removal by iron oxides were further analyzed using rmr method fig 1b f in the presence of 1 mg l 32 μm p po4 fig 1b the regression line was horizontal which is independent with the increase of removed pb because po4 was completely adsorbed on iron oxides even in the absence of pb on the other hand when the p po4 concentration was 5 30 mg l fig 1c f the lines exhibited two slopes i the rising portion of the line results from the increase of both removed p po4 and pb ii the horizontal portion of the line is a result of the complete removal of po4 the slopes increased from 0 346 to 0 616 with the increase of p po4 from 5 mg l 162 μm figs 1c to 20 mg l 645 μm fig 1e however the slopes stopped increasing after reaching the value of 0 6 0 616 at 20 mg l p po4 and 0 592 at 30 mg l p po4 fig 1e and f hence it is obvious that pb was removed totally by precipitation with phosphate when p po4 concentration was higher than 20 mg l 645 μm on the other hand when p po4 concentration was 5 or 10 mg l both precipitation and adsorption contributed to pb removal at neutral ph 7 0 0 2 the pb species in solutions without the presence of iron oxides is also controlled by the precipitation of pyromorphite as evidenced by the slope of 0 597 fig s4a nevertheless in the presence of iron oxides the slope value decreased to 0 473 fig s4b this value is lower than 0 6 implying that partial pb is in adsorbed species in the tap water containing 0 92 mg l dissolved p po4 spiking 1 mg l pb resulted in a dissolved pb concentration of 0 11 mg l i e after filtered by 0 1 μm ptfe filter showing that the majority of pb in tap water is precipitated species the precipitate is also pyromorphite evidenced by the value of the slope obtained from the rmr analysis 0 613 fig s5 please note that in tap water the phosphate might form apatite or iron phosphate precipitate which also shows significant pb adsorption ability liu and zhao 2007 2013 however the concentration of apatite or iron phosphate particles 1 mg l in this study is much lower than the concentration of iron oxides 0 4 g l therefore the effect from apatite or iron phosphate particles is not comparable to iron oxides in terms of pb removal here 3 3 spectroscopic analysis for pb species 3 3 1 xanes analysis based on the analysis of rmr method both adsorbed and precipitated pb species were found in the solids when initial pb and p concentrations are lower than 10 mg l at ph 5 or 5 mg l at ph 7 it is expected that the percentage of adsorbed pb would increase when p po4 decreased to 1 mg l however rmr is not suitable when p po4 is low because all po4 is adsorbed on iron oxides even in the absence of pb leading to a slope value of 0 fig 1b nevertheless it is important to investigate the pb species on iron oxides in the presence of low p po4 i e lower than 1 mg l because 1 mg l is a commonly used dosage for p po4 as a corrosion inhibitor mcneill and edwards 2002b and also similar to the p po4 concentration in tap water used in this study 0 92 mg l therefore xas was employed to identify the pb species removed by iron oxides when the p po4 was lower than 1 mg l xas is sensitive to the change of the coordination environment of pb and has been widely used for investigating pb species bargar et al 1996 1997a barrett et al 2010 maclean et al 2011 qin et al 2006 strawn and sparks 1999 fig 2 and fig s6 show the xanes spectra and their first derivatives for pb adsorption on iron oxides under different conditions respectively the pyromorphite and pb adsorption on iron oxides in the absence of po4 were also characterized as the standards of only precipitated and adsorbed pb respectively obvious differences were observed between the spectra of only precipitated and adsorbed pb two features shown on the xanes spectra for only adsorbed pb located at 13 051 and 13 092 ev fig 2 shifted to lower energies in only precipitated pb 13 047 and 13 083 ev the shifts of these two features are significant because the differences 4 ev are over ten times higher than the energy step 0 3 ev used for the xanes spectra collection and the edge of the spectra did not shift evidenced by the first derivative xanes spectra shown in fig s6 moreover because most of the pb was removed when the initial pb was only 1 mg l the content of pb in these solids are in a similar range from 2 2 to 2 5 mg g the surface area of the goethite used in this study is reported to be 128 158 m2 g kanematsu et al 2010 naeem et al 2007 which is sufficient to a monolayer pb adsorption of up to 0 5 2 2 mm g 103 450 mg g based on an approximate site density of 2 3 10 1018 sites m2 kanematsu et al 2010 villalobos et al 2001 therefore the shifts of these two features are resulting from the difference between precipitated and adsorbed pb species rather than the change of surface loading i e from monolayer adsorption to multiple layers adsorption these two features were therefore used to distinguish the precipitated and adsorbed pb species at ph 5 0 the position of these two features did not change in the presence of 0 1 mg l p po4 however in the presence of 1 mg l p po4 at ph 5 0 the feature at 13 051 ev shifted to 13 049 ev while the feature at 13 092 ev did not shift this interesting phenomenon suggests that the presence of p po4 at ph 5 0 resulted in a significant change of coordination environment of pb but such a complexation structure is different from pyromorphite on the other hand the features of pb xanes spectra in the presence of p po4 at ph 7 0 were the same as those of precipitated pb implying the majority of pb was precipitated in tap water those two features also shift but the positions 13 049 and 13 087 ev are not the same as those in precipitated pb 13 047 and 13 083 ev suggesting that pb is not completely removed by precipitation in the presence of iron oxides 3 3 2 lcf fitting for xanes and exafs spectra linear combination fitting lcf was conducted to quantitatively analyze the pb species in solids produced in the presence of po4 fig s7a and table s1 samples of pb adsorption on iron oxides in the absence of po4 and pb po4 precipitate of pyromorphite were used to represent the only adsorbed and precipitated pb species respectively the lcf for xanes spectra showed a good quality fit r factor 0 01 chi square 0 05 table s1 fitting results show the existence of both adsorbed and precipitated pb in the presence of po4 the increase in po4 promoted the formation of precipitated pb i e from 29 7 to 53 1 at ph 5 and 54 1 80 7 at ph 7 these values also showed that more precipitated pb was formed at ph 7 than that at ph 5 based on the thermodynamic solubility of pyromorphite shown fig s8 about 3 8 of pb is dissolved in the solution with an initial 1 mg l pb and 1 mg l p po4 at ph 5 whereas only 0 025 of pb is dissolved at ph 7 therefore the more adsorbed pb species observed at ph 5 might be due to the higher solubility of pyromorphite at ph 5 however in the presence of iron oxides the adsorbed pb species 19 3 79 8 accounts for much higher than that in the absence of iron oxides 0 025 3 8 implying the inhibitory effect of iron oxides on the formation of pyromorphite although the p po4 concentration in tap water is as high as 0 92 mg l the precipitated pb species 37 8 41 6 table s1 is much lower than that in 0 01 m nacl solution with 1 mg l p po4 80 7 this result agrees well with the difference in the position shift of features for 0 01 m nacl solution and tap water as mentioned earlier this difference might be due to the lower chloride concentration 95 mg l 0 003 m in tap water than that in 0 01 m nacl solution because chloride is an essential part of pyromorphite pb5 po4 3cl and the presence of cl reduced the dissolved pb concentration by 1 2 orders martínez et al 2004 in addition more co existing ions in tap water might affect the formation of precipitate as was observed in previous studies regarding iron arsenate precipitate peng et al 2017 shi et al 2018a the lcf for exafs in k space was also conducted fig s7b although the fitting results agreed well with those of the xanes lcf within 10 difference table s1 the fitting quality was poor because of the unacceptably high values of r factors 0 14 0 51 and chi squares 0 35 0 78 such a poor fitting quality indicates that the pb complexation mechanism was not a physical mixture of adsorbed and precipitated pb and it suggests a different complexation structure while xanes is usually sensitive to the nearest shell surrounding the pb atom barrett et al 2010 rao and wong 1984 strawn and sparks 1999 exafs could present shell information farther from the center i e second or third shell surrounding the pb atom bargar et al 1997a b barrett et al 2010 cotter howells et al 1994 elzinga et al 2001 tiberg et al 2013 villalobos et al 2005 therefore the fact that the quality of exafs lcf was worse than that of xanes lcf implies that the structural difference between pb on iron oxides in the presence of po4 and pyromorphite mainly occurs in the second or third shell 3 3 3 feff fitting for exafs spectra to further understand the pb complexation structure on iron oxides in the presence of po4 the exafs spectra were analyzed using shell by shell feff fitting the difference between the exafs spectra of adsorbed and precipitated pb is more significant in r space i e imaginary part of fourier transformed ft exafs spectrum fig 3 b pyromorphite has two peaks below 2 5 å uncorrected r on its ft exafs spectrum suggesting various pb o interatomic distances which agreed well with previous exafs studies cotter howells et al 1994 1999 on the other hand only one significant peak appeared below 2 5 å on the ft exafs spectrum for pb adsorption on iron oxides at ph 5 which is different from pb po4 precipitate for samples of pb adsorption on iron oxides ph 7 this second peak appeared when p po4 reached 1 mg l red vertical line shown in fig 3b which can also be seen on the spectra for samples obtained in tap water although this second peak showed same position with pyromorphite the relative peak intensity to the first ft peak is different confirming a structural difference between adsorbed pb on iron oxides in the presence of po4 and pyromorphite feff fittings for these exafs spectra were conducted to explore more structural information fig 3 and table s2 in pyromorphite pb presents with two different coordination environment pb1 and pb2 shown in fig s9 which is degenerated as 0 5 o at 2 37 å 1 5 o at 2 55 å 3 5 o at 2 67 å 1 cl at 3 12 å and 0 5 p at 3 24 å however the fitting results for pyromorphite only reveal two o shells 1 5 and 1 0 o at 2 41 å and 2 63 å respectively and a p shell 0 7 at 3 23 å showing a different profile from the theoretical crystalline structure in pyromorphite such differences were also observed in a previous exafs study ryan et al 2001 and the reason might be the heavy overlaps of these shells and the limitations of the exafs feff fitting for only adsorbed pb a bidentate cn of o 1 8 2 5 mononuclear cn of fe 0 9 1 configuration was obtained at both ph 5 and 7 table s2 in agreement with the previous study by bargar et al 1997b at ph 5 the cn of first o shell increased to 2 7 in the presence of 0 1 and 1 mg l p po4 explaining the difference in xanes spectra the increased cn of the first o shell might result from the complexation between pb and po4 on iron oxides surfaces i e surface ternary complexation which was reported by tiberg et al 2013 a similar structure was also observed for samples in the presence of 0 1 mg l p po4 at ph 7 however when p po4 increased to 1 mg l at ph 7 the pb complexation structure dramatically changed the cn of the first o shell decreased to 1 4 and a second o shell cn 4 2 at 2 58 å appeared meanwhile the third shell was fitted better by p rather than fe fig s10 and table s3 this fashion was similar to that of pyromorphite indicating that the majority of pb in the solids was precipitated in agreement with lcf and feff fittings nevertheless this fashion and pyromorphite showed obvious differences in the cn of second o shell and the bond length of pb o table s2 implying that the formation of precipitate was affected by the presence of iron oxides overall the xanes analysis confirmed the presence of adsorbed pb in the presence of 0 1 or 1 mg l p po4 both at ph 5 and 7 the exafs fitting results revealed a possible formation of surface ternary complexation between pb and po4 on iron oxides surfaces at ph 5 the majority of removed pb was adsorbed species in the presence of 0 1 and 1 mg l p po4 at ph 7 the adsorbed pb and the precipitated pb made up a larger proportion for 0 1 and 1 mg l p po4 respectively 3 4 phosphate species analysis the removed po4 species was investigated by in situ flow cell atr ftir technique fig 4 which has been widely used for analysis of different species of oxyanions arai and sparks 2001 connor and mcquillan 1999 daou et al 2007 hug 1997 kubicki et al 2012 peak et al 1999 reddy et al 2008 ronson and mcquillan 2002 shi et al 2015a solecka et al 2017 tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 even for the protonation of the adsorbed oxyanions shi et al 2015a tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 similar to xas study the po4 adsorbed on iron oxides in the absence of pb was used to represent only adsorbed po4 whereas the pyromorphite was used as only precipitated po4 the final ftir spectra of those samples after 24 h reaction are shown in fig s11 and the analyses of ftir bands are detailed in the page s15 of supplementary data briefly po4 was adsorbed on iron oxides as a bidentate binuclear configuration showing a different ftir spectrum from that of pyromorphite the highest peak positions for only precipitated and only adsorbed po4 located at 970 and 1042 cm 1 respectively therefore the peak intensities at 1042 and 970 cm 1 are used as indicators for the adsorbed and precipitated po4 species respectively for only adsorbed po4 no peak was observed at 970 cm 1 however a broad peak at 970 cm 1 was observed in the presence of 10 mg l pb at both ph 5 0 and 7 0 showing the presence of pyromorphite on iron oxides surfaces it is important to note that the pyromorphite was formed before the solution passed through the flow cell where iron oxides were attached therefore the presence of pyromorphite on iron oxides indicated that pyromorphite can be adsorbed on iron oxides the adsorption of pyromorphite on iron oxides was most likely driven by electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged pyromorphite zeta potential values of 23 4 to 10 9 mv table s4 and positively charged iron oxides zeta potential values of 26 2 35 6 mv the ratio i1042 970 of the intensity of ftir peaks at 1042 i1042 to that at 970 i970 was employed to analyze the relative abundance of the adsorbed and precipitated po4 under different conditions the i1042 970 of the only precipitated po4 was 0 58 fig s11 whereas that of the only adsorbed po4 was 2 1 at ph 5 and 2 5 at ph 7 fig s11 and fig 4 in the presence of pb i1042 970 decreased due to the presence of precipitated po4 interestingly an obvious increase in i1042 970 was observed for the po4 adsorption in the presence of 1 and 10 mg l pb at ph 5 as well as that in the presence of 10 mg l pb at ph 7 however the i1042 970 for po4 adsorption on iron oxides in the absence of pb showed no significant change the first five points were not considered due to the low signal noise ratio at ph 5 and 7 3 5 transformation from precipitated to adsorbed pb species the increasing i1042 970 trend implied a decreasing proportion of precipitated po4 during adsorption suggesting the transformation of po4 from precipitated to adsorbed species after pyromorphite adsorbed on iron oxides the adsorbed pb species accounted for 46 9 at ph 5 and 19 3 at ph 7 at equilibrium under this experimental condition based on the xanes analysis table s1 however prior to the transformation the precipitated pb species accounted for almost 100 resulting in the transformation from precipitated to adsorbed pb species the change in i1042 970 was more significant at ph 5 than at ph 7 suggesting that the transformation was more favorable at ph 5 at ph 7 the change of i1042 970 in the presence of 1 mg l pb is insignificant whereas that in the presence of 10 mg l pb is clear this difference resulted from the high proportion of dissolved po4 90 of total po4 when pb concentration is 1 mg l in which adsorption of dissolved po4 rather than precipitated po4 dominated the adsorption process however the transformation is more significant at ph 5 in which the significant change of i1042 970 was observed the transformation from precipitated to adsorbed pb is more visible in tem images fig 5 shows the tem images of the solids produced by mixing pyromorphite with iron oxides at ph 5 and 7 for 24 h at ph 5 evenly distributed pb and p elements along with fe and o are observed fig 5c f suggesting the presence of the adsorbed pb and p the presence of adsorbed pb on iron oxides surface confirmed the transformation of pb from precipitated to adsorbed species because 1 mg l pb was totally precipitated by the formation of pyromorphite in the presence of 1 mg l p po4 before interacting with the iron oxides i e passing through the cell in contrast pyromorphite particles were clearly captured in the tem image of the solids at ph 7 fig 5b furthermore the edxs mapping results showed a concentrated rather than an even distribution of pb and p elements fig 5i and j which is independent from the distribution of fe and o elements indicating the detection of precipitate therefore the tem edxs characterization results prove that the transformation of pb and po4 from precipitated to adsorbed species is more favorable at ph 5 than that at ph 7 in agreement with the in situ flow cell atr ftir characterization interestingly a previous study implied the adsorbed pb on goethite would be transformed to pyromorphite after the addition of po4 zhang et al 1997 which is different from our observations however in that study po4 was directly added into solution containing dissolved pb in which the pyromorphite could form in solution firstly moreover the p po4 and pb concentrations used in that study were as high as 2 5 10 4 m 7 6 mg l and 3 75 10 4 m 77 6 mg l respectively even so they did not exclude the adsorbed pb species by contrast adsorption was proved to be the dominant mechanism for pb removal based on the surface complexation modeling xie and giammar 2007a study by xie et al in which the pb concentration was 5 10 7 m 0 1 mg l with p po4 ranged from 10 9 to 10 3 m 0 00003 31 mg l our study clearly showed that the precipitated pb species increased with the increasing initial phosphate and pb concentrations therefore the transformation between precipitated and adsorbed pb species correlated with the initial po4 and pb concentrations in addition the transformation is more favorable at acidic conditions which might be due to the higher solubility of pyromorphite at ph 5 the reason might be the faster transformation from pyromorphite to adsorbed pb on iron oxides at ph 5 because of the higher dissolved pb concentration 38 μg l fig s8 at ph 5 than that at ph 7 0 25 μg l 4 conclusions in summary the results gained from this study can answer those two questions asked in the introduction 1 in the tap water with the presence of iron oxides particle and po4 adsorption contributes 58 62 more than precipitation 38 42 for pb removal 2 the negatively charged pb particles majorly pyromorphite can be adsorbed onto the positively charged iron oxides particles such adsorption might be a weak physical adsorption due to the electric attraction but finally leads to a chemical transformation of pb from precipitated to adsorbed species on iron oxides surface after 24 h mixing this transformation is more favorable at acidic condition due to the higher solubility of pyromorphite at ph 5 than ph 7 po4 is commonly used as a corrosion inhibitor in drinking water systems which has further been proved to be a useful method to reduce pb concentrations previously the formation of the pyromorphite has been recognized as the primary pb removal mechanism however this study evidenced that more pb was adsorbed rather than precipitated in tap water with the co existing iron oxides particles and po4 moreover the precipitated pb can be transformed to adsorbed pb on iron oxides surface this study improved our understanding regarding the pb species in drinking water given the fact that the iron oxides particles in drinking water are likely loaded with adsorbed pb distinguishing pb species is also helpful for selection of suitable methodologies i e adsorption or filtration for pb removal meanwhile it has been reported that the pb species and particle size of lead bearing media significantly affect the bioavailability of lead and its absorption by human tissues mushak 1991 therefore the results of this study may also be

17881,recent reports on the occurrence and contribution of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in marine inland water and soil systems have greatly improved our understanding of the global nitrogen n cycle this also promoted the investigation of the role and ecological features of dnra in anthropogenic ecosystems however so far the use of dnra in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are one of the most common and largest biotechnologically artificial water ecosystems has not been investigated accordingly this study focused on the abundance activity community structure and diversity of dnra bacteria in full scale wwtps dnra bacteria were detected in all treatment units in six tested municipal wwtps even in aerobic zones dissolved oxygen 2 mg l 1 although the relative abundance of dnra bacteria 0 2 4 0 was less than that of denitrifying bacteria 0 7 10 1 among all investigated samples the abundance of dnra bacteria still reaches 109 gene copies g 1 however 15n isotope tracing indicated that the potential dnra rates were significantly lower 0 4 2 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 than those of denitrification 9 5 15 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 but higher than anammox rate 0 3 1 3 nmol n g 1 h 1 the dnra bacterial community structure was primarily affected by temperature gradient despite the treatment process high throughput sequencing analysis targeting the dnra nrfa gene showed that nitrospira accounted for the largest proportion of nrfa genes among all samples 6 2 36 3 followed by brocadia 5 9 22 1 network analysis further indicated that nitrospira played an important role in both the dnra bacterial community and entire bacterial community in municipal wwtps these results suggest that the ecological habitats of dnra bacteria in anthropogenic ecosystems were far more abundant than previously assumed however the contribution to n transformation by the widespread dnra was not significant in traditional municipal wwtps graphical abstract image 1

fundamental element cycles in biogeochemistry nitrate no3 as a stable final oxidation state product is involved in most reactive processes during the microbial n cycle including no3 assimilation no3 dissimilatory reduction and nitrite oxidation kraft et al 2011 in contrast to oxygen respiration no3 respiration yields energy for the network of the assimilatory and respiratory n pathways in the absence of o2 thus exerting an essential role in the provision of n sources greenhouse gas emissions n2o and public health no2 jetten 2008 kraft et al 2011 2014 the no3 reduction process produces not only nitrogen gas n2 but also ammonium nh4 which is referred to as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process at present studies about dnra focus on marine systems estuarine sediments or soil systems dnra can be ubiquitously detected in various natural and anthropogenic ecosystems at all levels of substrate concentrations in both marine and soil systems yin et al 2002 risgaard

2015 cao et al 2016 however there are rare reports about dnra bacteria in the sewage treatment ecosystem as the largest biotechnological application worldwide and the most common artificial water ecosystem municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps play a significant role in global n cycle most municipal wwtps mainly apply denitrification process to remove no2 and no3 from wastewater which increases the by product of nitrous oxide n2o accounting for approximately 1 3 of the total n2o emission ipcc 2001 although anammox bacteria can be extensively found in municipal wwtps they contribute less than 10 to n2 production wang et al 2015 in denitrification and anammox processes no3 is microbially converted to n2 and n pollution is permanently removed from wastewater in contrast in dnra process the generated nh4 is the end product rather than n2 the produced nh4 will either be fed back to the treatment system which would affect the design and operation of the municipal wwtps or enter the water body where it will accelerate the eutrophication groffman et al 2000 hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 until now anammox and denitrification in municipal wwtps have been intensively studied the occurrence abundance activity community structure and contribution of dnra may play a crucial role in the global n cycle balance and n flux calculation however there are no related research about them accordingly this study investigated the distribution contribution and microbial mechanism of dnra in various full scale municipal wwtps across china a total of eight treatment units from six municipal wwtps with different treatment processes treatment capacities operation modes properties of wastewater and activated sludge and operation temperatures were investigated by using molecular and 15n isotope tracing techniques furthermore high throughput sequencing and co occurring network approach were applied to investigate the interspecies relationships between dnra bacteria nitrate

including influent wastewater activated sludge temperature gradient 5 0 to 25 c mean annual temperature overall triplicate activated sludge about 30 50 l was directly collected from each sampling unit at the operating conditions separately stored at sterile plastic barrels and immediately transported to the laboratory within 1 16 h upon arrival at the laboratory the activated sludges and wastewater were separated through 0 45 μm sterile filters after that a portion of each activated sludge was used to determine the dnra denitrification and anammox rates as soon as possible while the rest was used for chemical and molecular analysis the wastewater was further filtered through 0 22 μm mixed cellulose esters microfiltration membranes mf millipore billerica ma usa to remove biological

the cd 1 and copper nitrite reductase nirs and nirk functional genes respectively the total bacteria were quantified with the primers 8f and eub338 ir which are specific for the 16s rrna gene juretschko et al 1998 these specific genes were amplified via the fluorescent dye sybr green approach on an abi prism 7500 sequence detection system applied biosystems usa the q pcr assays were conducted with a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl sybr premix ex taq takara dalian china 4 pmol primers and 0 5 1 μg dna template the protocol steps were set for 10 min at 94 c followed by 30 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 c 45 s at annealing temperature and 20 s at 72 c table s1 melting curves were generated after each assay to evaluate the specificity of amplification ten fold serial dilutions of a known copy number of the plasmid dnas were subjected to qpcr to obtain an external standard curve the amplification efficiencies were 95 103 avg 97 the correlation coefficients r 2 were all above 0

nrfa gene was performed with the primers nrfa f2aw and nrfa r1 in a c1000tm thermal cycler biorad usa positive clones were sequenced using an abi 3730xl automated sequencer applied biosystems usa due to the multiple copies of dnra nrfa gene in the same genome and the different but overlapping primers operational taxonomic units otus 97 nucleotide similarity were used to the diversity analysis instead of the amplicon sequence variants asvs callahan et al 2017 phylogenetic trees were constructed via neighbor joining nj with the jukes cantor correction using mega 4 package tamura et al 2007 supplementary methods for high throughput sequencing analysis the nrfa gene and bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the barcode attached primers nrfa f2aw nrfa r1 and 341f 806r herlemann et al

screened by removing low quality sequences de replication and discarding singletons and chimeras using both trimmomatic and flash software the obtained sequences were normalized to 160 000 and 23 680 random sequences for dnra nrfa gene and bacterial 16s rrna gene per sample using usearch software otus rarefaction curves and α diversity indexes were generated at 97 similarity with qiime and mothur software table s2 fig s2 taxonomy for each otu was assigned via the rdp classifier against silva databases for bacterial 16s rrna gene and a local alignment basic local alignment search tool blast for dnra nrfa gene raw sequence reads were deposited into the genbank database under the accession numbers srp158889 and srp158890 for dnra nrfa gene and bacterial 16s rrna gene respectively phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmens analysis was conducted using the otu matrix based on the power law model the intra and inter specific networks were conducted among dnra nrfa gene and other co occurring bacterial 16s rrna gene in municipal wwtps respectively in the networks a module is a group of otus nodes that had higher connections among themselves but much fewer connected with otus outside the group the different roles of a specific node in the pmens were identified using both the within module connectivity zi and the among module connectivity pi with thresholds of 2 5 and 0 62 respectively deng et al 2012 in the network the nodes at the periphery represent specialists the module hubs and connectors refer to generalists and the network hubs refer to super generalists 2 5 potential rates of dnra anammox and denitrification by 15n tracer technique activated sludges approximately 0 3 g vss were transferred to several 12 0 ml glass vials exetainer labco uk filled with ar purged and filtered wastewater by 0 22 μm sterile membranes at in situ wastewater temperature table 1 three parallel assays were conducted for each activated sludge the resulting slurries first had to be pre incubated for less than 8 h under anaerobic conditions to deplete residual nox and o2 in the incubation vials as described by risgaard petersen et al 2003 and lam et al 2009 after that approximately 50 μl of ar purged 15nh4cl 99 16 15n treatment i 15nh4cl na15no3 99 19 15n treatment ii and na15no3 treatment iii solutions were injected through the septa of each vial to reach the in situ concentration the three treatments were used as a control experiment conformation experiment for anammox and quantification experiment for the potential rate of each nitrate reduction process respectively the mixed sludges were anaerobically incubated at in situ wastewater temperature and stopped at each defined interval 0 1 2 4 6 and 8 h by adding 200 μl of a 7 m zncl2 solution respectively the potential rate of dnra no3 nh4 was assessed by tracking the 15nh4 production rate measured after conversion to n2 alkaline hypobromite 200 μl was used to oxidize the produced 15nh4 to 30n2 completely during more than 12 h incubation lam et al 2009 yin et al 2014 for anammox and denitrification processes the potential rates were pre calculated using the produced 29n2 and 30n2 the produced 29n2 or 30n2 were measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometers irms gasbench ii mat253 bremen germany with 0 05 internal precision and 0 1 0 5 external precision in addition we also tested the efficiency of alkaline hypobromite as oxidizing agents for nh4 to n2 using a 700 mhz high resolution nmr spectrometer avance iii bruker switzerland for nh4 conversation and highly sensitive irms for n2 determination fig s3 finally the potential rates of all processes were further corrected using the average 15nh4 f a and 15no3 f n fraction as described by song et al 2016 tables s3 and s4 with the detection limit rate of 0 001 nmol n g 1 h 1 2 6 statistical analysis general statistical analysis was conducted with the statistical product and service solutions 18 0 software spss inc usa pearson correlation was used to evaluate the correlations between variables anova was adopted to evaluate the temperature groups and within group differences among microbial activities and their roles were assessed with a post hoc lsd nsk test upgma and principal co ordinates analysis pcoa were conducted to visualize the beta diversity of dnra bacterial communities in municipal wwtps using hemi and mothur software respectively in this study all statistical differences were set at α 0 05 significance level p 0 05 the figures were drawn with origin 7 5 software 3 results 3 1 occurrence and abundance of dnra bacteria in various wwtps twenty positive clones of dnra bacterial nrfa gene were randomly selected and sequenced from each sludge sample a total of 160 positive nrfa gene sequences were divided into 55 representative otus 97 nucleotide identity phylogenetic analysis showed that dnra bacteria presented in all municipal wwtps fig s5 qpcr assay showed that the abundances of dnra bacterial nrfa gene ranged from 2 96 108 to 3 95 109 copies g 1 vss accounting for 0 6 15 0 of the total bacteria bacterial 16s rrna gene 2 64 1010 1 03 1011 copies g 1 fig 1 correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between dnra bacterial nrfa gene abundance with cod r 0 820 p 0 013 and tn r 0 721 p 0 044 at wwtps influent wastewater fig s6 the proportion of dnra bacteria to the total bacteria nrfa 16s rrna was negatively correlated to bod r 0 850 p 0 007 cod r 0 837 p 0 010 and tn r 0 763 p 0 028 of influent wastewater and tn r 0 715 p 0 046 of activated sludge the abundance of nirk and nirs genes involved in denitrification process ranged from 2 64 107 to 1 19 109 copies g 1 vss and from 3 00 108 to 2 40 109 copies g 1 vss respectively denitrifier nirk gene had a positive correlation with tc tn r 0 727 p 0 041 of activated sludge denitrifier nirs gene was negatively correlated to ss r 0 782 p 0 022 tc r 0 715 p 0 046 and tn r 0 732 p 0 043 of the activated sludge fig s6 the relative abundances of total denitrifying bacteria 0 7 10 1 were significantly higher than those of dnra bacteria 0 2 4 0 among all investigated samples anova p 0 030 fig 1 these results clearly demonstrated that denitrifying bacteria dominated over dnra bacteria as nitrate reducers in municipal wwtps the abundance of anammox hzsb genes ranged from 5 03 106 to 4 37 108 copies g 1 vss 0 01 1 65 of total bacteria in municipal wwtps which were significantly lower than those of dnra bacteria paired t test p 0 01 and denitrifiers p 0 011 for nirk and p 0 002 for nirs fig 1 anammox bacteria had an insignificant correlation with the properties of wastewater and activated sludge fig s6 these results clearly demonstrated that anammox bacteria were widespread but took only a small portion of the nitrate reducers in municipal wwtps 3 2 potential rates and the role of dnra in municipal wwtps the potential rates of dnra denitrification and anammox of activated sludge were measured via 15n stable isotope tracer technique fig 2 figs s3 and s4 importantly for the potential rate of dnra we also tested the efficiency of alkaline hypobromite oxidizing the 15nh4 produced by dnra to 30n2 fig s3 there are two key steps i chemical oxidation and ii n2 measurement related to the recovery efficiency results showed i the oxidation efficiency of 15nh4 to 30n2 was over 92 6 by using the high resolution nmr spectrometer and ii the recovery efficiency of 15nh4 to 30n2 averaged to around 90 2 by using irms the high recovery efficiency could avoid the underestimation and ensure the accuracy of the potential rate of dnra as much as possible the potential rates of dnra ranged from 0 37 nmol n g 1 h 1 in hb to 2 11 nmol n g 1 h 1 in gz with the contribution to the total nitrate reduction of 3 5 15 9 the potential rates were below 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 in cc 0 77 nmol n g 1 h 1 and hb 0 37 nmol n g 1 h 1 with relatively low contributions to total nitrate reduction 7 3 which were located in the lower temperature areas among the investigated wwtps overall the highest potential rates of dnra were detected in areas with higher temperature such as gz cq and yx and their contributions were averaged to 12 3 2 6 similar to dnra the highest potential rates of both denitrification and anammox occurred in wwtps with higher temperature denitrification in gz 15 69 nmol n g 1 h 1 and anammox in cq 1 45 nmol n g 1 h 1 and decreased gradually with decreasing temperature to the lowest wwtps in hb 9 91 and 0 28 nmol n g 1 h 1 respectively however the contribution of denitrification to total nitrate reduction 77 7 93 9 increased with temperature while the contribution via anammox 2 7 8 0 showed the opposite trends pearson correlation analysis also showed that the potential rates of dnra r 0 887 p 0 003 anammox r 0 935 p 0 001 and denitrification r 0 762 p 0 028 significantly positively correlated with temperature fig s6 the potential rates of denitrification in municipal wwtps were all significantly higher than the potential rates of dnra t test p 0 001 and anammox t test p 0 0005 these results indicated denitrification was still the main contributor to no3 reduction in municipal wwtps while both dnra and anammox played limited roles 3 3 community composition and diversity of dnra bacterial nrfa gene the community composition of dnra bacteria in municipal wwtps was investigated using a high throughput sequencing approach targeting dnra nrfa gene fig 3 the representative otus with the highest relative abundance were divided into 10 phylum and 30 genera fig 3a fig s7 a table s2 overall nitrospira was one of the most abundant dnra genera about 6 2 36 3 avg 22 3 of the total genera among all wwtps followed by brocadia avg 13 3 anaeromyxobacter 13 1 geothrix 9 0 haliangium 7 8 and hyalangium 6 8 the dominating genera varied among the eight activated sludges in high temperature wwtps cq and gz anaeromyxobacter were the dominating genera 15 50 and 38 05 respectively followed by brocadia 11 5 and 18 3 respectively and geothrix 9 1 and 13 5 respectively in mesothermal wwtps bj 1 2 and 3 nitrospira had the highest relative abundance 30 7 36 3 in low temperature wwtps hb and cc gethrix and lacunisphaera accounted for the highest proportions 21 9 and 16 7 respectively of bacteria both upgma and pcoa showed that dnra bacterial community in municipal wwtps were clustered into three clusters along the temperature gradient low temperature cluster cc and hb mesothermal temperature cluster bj 1 2 and 3 and high temperature cluster cq and gz fig 3a b at otu level heatmap analysis also showed similar clustering of dnra bacterial community fig s7 a this indicates that dnra microbial community structure was mainly affected by the temperature but not by the treatment process and properties of wastewater and activated sludge 3 4 co occurrence patterns and intraspecific mechanism of dnra bacterial community the ecological network of dnra bacteria was constructed at the otu level to explore the potential intraspecific mechanism of dnra bacterial community fig 4 a table s4 a total of 8 joint modules with 7 nodes were isolated from the other modules that were relatively small 2 3 nodes the size of modules varied with 2 51 nodes the largest intermediate node was annotated as genus nitrospira otu9429 while the largest central node was brocadia otu9607 in module 2 among the total 691 links associations between one to one node the positive connection links were 72 7 503 691 which were much stronger than negative links 27 3 in the network the zi pi plot showed that most nodes were peripherals 98 and no node was in network hubs fig 4 b three key connectors were nitrospira otu7180 haliangium otu206 and brocadia otu8187 furthermore two nodes belonged to module hubs nitrospira otu4845 and geothrix otu1599 the most abundant nitrospira was the key connector and also the module hub in the intraspecific network of the dnra bacterial community in municipal wwtps 3 5 bacterial community and interspecies mechanism between dnra and other microbes to further explore the potential correlation between dnra bacteria and other co occurrence bacteria high throughput sequencing was performed targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene heatmap analysis showed that 17 2 of total bacteria belonged to denitrifying bacteria and were distributed in 14 genera moreover seven genera belonged to dnra bacteria accounting for 5 3 of the total bacteria anammox bacteria only took up a small portion of total bacteria 0 005 in the municipal wwtps fig 5 a fig s7 b c table s5 the bacterial interspecies mechanism of dnra bacteria and other co occurrence microbes were explored via network analysis fig 5 b table s4 all 50 nodes annotated to 35 genera were classified into only one module with 822 connection lines associations sharing nearly equal numbers between positive 50 2 and negative 48 8 in addition there were 87 lines 87 822 10 6 connected dnra bacteria showing negative lines of up to 71 3 furthermore dnra bacteria nitrospira denitrifiers acinetobacter and other co occurring bacteria macellibacteroides sulfuritalea cloacibacterium and clostridium sensu stricto 13 had the maximum node degree 39 and were identified as key genera nitrospira was positively correlated with sulfuritalea but showed a negative correlation with the other four genera above all nitrospira played a key role in the total bacterial community 4 discussion n pollutants in sewage are primarily removed by aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrification and anaerobic nitrate reduction denitrification although no3 reduction is also conducted in dnra process the end product is nh4 therefore the occurrence of dnra process in municipal wwtps is not conducive to n pollutants removal from the wastewater while it only changes the existing form of n pollutants groffman et al 2000 hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 which has not been reported in full scale municipal wwtps this study was the first attempt to report the occurrence contribution and microbial mechanism of dnra process in full scale municipal wwtps these findings revealed that although dnra process is widespread in the municipal wwtps with very limited contribution on no3 reduction additionally it also provided new information on the no3 reduction and n cycle in anthropogenic ecosystems dnra was usually considered to be significant only in peripheral environments recently several observations reported dnra process occurred under different oxygenic conditions roberts et al 2014 song et al 2014 bonaglia et al 2016 moreover in aerobic conditions the specific cellular activity 0 38 4 56 fmol n d 1 wang et al 2018 was also higher than in previously reported anaerobic environments 0 22 0 23 fmol n d 1 song et al 2014 in the present study the activated sludges were collected from traditional single sludge systems under an intermittent anoxic aerobic environment besides dnra were also observed in various aerobic environments and in alternating aerobic and anoxic environments however the potential rates of dnra process in the six investigated municipal wwtps were quite low below 2 61 nmol n g 1 h 1 measured by the 15n combined with chemical conversion method these were significantly lower than samples in freshwater systems 23 6 nmol n g 1 h 1 tobias et al 2001 250 406 nmol g 1 h 1 nogaro and burgin 2014 marine systems 1704 4 402 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 cao et al 2016 10 3 29 8 nmol n g 1 h 1 hardison et al 2015 and soil systems 3 24 4 46 nmol n g 1 h 1 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2017 the low potential rate of dnra was detected in municipal wwtps which may be attributed to two reasons firstly nh4 as the end product of dnra process was an important factor for the driving force of this biochemical reaction based on the principle of reaction kinetics in the soil the dnra process is also widespread but plays important roles in the soil ecosystems due to the preferential utilization of nh4 by plants and nh4 loss caused by large amounts of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa yin et al 2002 pettridge et al 2006 shan et al 2016 however in urban sewage treatment systems nh4 is available in excess due to the continuous input of large amounts of influent nh4 in the wastewater thus excessive nh4 would inhibit the driving force of the dnra process to product nh4 in municipal wwtps secondly no3 the substrate of dnra bacteria is the next preferred terminal electron acceptor after o2 under oxygen depleted conditions no3 participates in the supply of nitrite and plays a key role as the main electron acceptor for respiration however in urban sewage treatment systems significant aeration is performed and the do is maintained above 2 0 mg l 1 in the aeration tank wang et al 2015 consequently the no3 reduction process is not required as a driving force for the reaction furthermore the denitrifying bacteria showed stronger competition for substrates than dnra microbes in wwtps in general dnra has an advantage over denitrification in no3 limiting conditions because the former can accept eight electrons per no3 molecule versus five for denitrifier tiedje 1988 jørgensen 1989 kraft et al 2014 however de brabandere et al 2015 reported the relative importance of dnra positively correlated with no3 concentration at the bottom water in an anoxic fjord basin similarly in this study the level of no3 was also relatively high and it was not a growth limiting factor different studies demonstrated that dnra was mainly affected by c n ratio risgaard petersen et al 2003 chen et al 2015 shan et al 2016 c n ratio in the influent of municipal sewage treatment plants in china is mostly low wang et al 2015 which is more conducive to denitrifying bacteria roberts et al 2014 van den berg et al 2015 shan et al 2016 the 16s rrna high throughput and qpcr analysis suggest that the relative and absolute abundance of denitrifying bacteria in the sludge were higher than those of dnra bacteria in addition sulfur s containing compounds are a common pollutant in the urban water management system pikaar et al 2014 and free sulfides hydrogen sulfide h2s and sulfide ion s2 are identified as the potential electron donor during the no3 reduction process lu et al 2013 caffrey et al 2019 recent study reported that dnra bacteria were only active under high sulfide condition in a chronically hypoxic basin while anammox was insignificantly changed and denitrification was inhibited caffrey et al 2019 lu et al 2013 also reported there is an obvious competition between s and c driven dnra pathways thus interactions among free sulfide and no3 reduction processes should be explored in the future in this study samples were collected in summer the warmest time of the year the highest absolute abundance and relative abundance of dnra bacteria was both found in gz samples at higher temperatures the average monthly temperature was 29 2 c and the highest rate of dnra process was also detected in gz additionally previous studies also showed that temperature was positively correlated to the rate of dnra during the warmest months of the year the rate of dnra reached the highest values jäntti et al 2011 the optimum temperature of dnra bacteria was 30 c in the mixed flora of the pearl river estuary shan et al 2016 and dnra could be almost completely inhibited when temperatures were lower than 10 c ribas et al 2015 in contrast recent studies showed that dnra accounted for a substantial portion of total no3 reduction even when temperature was lower than 10 c in sediments from a subarctic sea bonaglia et al 2017 and the temperate rivers mean annual temperature 4 7 c li et al 2019 therefore it is predictable that dnra bacteria would be low activity yet still contribute to no3 reduction at low temperatures the abundance of the functional gene nrfa exceeded the 109 level despite their low activity in municipal wwtps as indicated by nrfa gene sequencing the community structure further showed that there were at least 120 co occurring nitrospira strains in the various tested conditions regardless of the temperature oxygen concentration substrate loadings and operating conditions suggesting that the nrfa gene was widespread and had a stable coexistence in nitrospira lineages with their high abundance in the natural environment daims et al 2015 gruber dorninger et al 2015 ushiki et al 2017 network analyses showed that nitrospira was the most important taxon not only in dnra bacterial community but also in the total bacterial community indicating that nitrospira may exert a more complex microbial ecology function daims et al 2015 ushiki et al 2017 this could be attributed to the diversity of nitrospira metabolic processes nitrospira has been generally known as a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers performing nitrite oxidation or complete ammonium oxidation process instead of dnra process daims et al 2015 ushiki et al 2017 daims and wagner 2018 hence the high abundance of genus nitrospira did not increase the dnra rate the discovery of anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 processes indicates that the microbial nitrate reduction does not only include dnra and the denitrification processes previous studies conducted by our group also showed that anammox is widely distributed in municipal wwtps wang et al 2015 however the obtained anammox rate was only 0 08 1 20 nmol n g 1 h 1 which was consistent with the low level of dnra rate found in this study and both were much lower than those of denitrification brocadia is defined as an anammox bacterium with dnra function only under nh4 limiting environments kartal et al 2008 however ammonia is not a limiting factor in the sewage treatment system consequently the high abundance of the nrfa gene in brocadia is also not related to the no3 reduction rate previous studies on global surface aerobic soils have also reported that damo processes were unlikely to occur in aerobic environments zhu et al 2018 furthermore no literature is available on damo in sewage treatment plants therefore damo process may play an extremely limited role in the traditional nitrification denitrification wwtps in summary it can be concluded that denitrification is the primary process for no3 reduction and n removal in municipal wwtps 5 conclusions the occurrence population structure abundance activity and contribution to no3 reduction of dnra in full scale municipal wwtps via the traditional nitrification denitrification route were investigated using molecular and isotopic tracing techniques the key findings are listed in the following the abundance of dnra bacterial nrfa gene ranged from 2 96 108 to 3 95 109 copies g 1 the relative abundance of dnra 0 18 3 94 was less than that of denitrifying bacteria 0 68 10 06 in all samples but higher than that of anammox bacteria 0 01 1 65 similarity to the abundance results the potential rates of dnra below 2 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 were significantly lower than those of the denitrification rate 9 5 15 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 but higher than those of anammox rate 0 3 1 3 nmol n g 1 h 1 the highest rates via the three processes all increased with temperature the ecological habitats of dnra bacteria in anthropogenic ecosystems were found to be far more abundant than previously assumed however the contribution of n transformation by dnra was not significant in traditional municipal wwtps high throughput sequencing analysis showed that nitrospira accounted for the largest proportion of the nrfa gene 6 2 36 3 network analysis also showed that nitrospira played an important role not only in the dnra bacterial community but also in the total bacterial community in municipal wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17881,recent reports on the occurrence and contribution of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in marine inland water and soil systems have greatly improved our understanding of the global nitrogen n cycle this also promoted the investigation of the role and ecological features of dnra in anthropogenic ecosystems however so far the use of dnra in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are one of the most common and largest biotechnologically artificial water ecosystems has not been investigated accordingly this study focused on the abundance activity community structure and diversity of dnra bacteria in full scale wwtps dnra bacteria were detected in all treatment units in six tested municipal wwtps even in aerobic zones dissolved oxygen 2 mg l 1 although the relative abundance of dnra bacteria 0 2 4 0 was less than that of denitrifying bacteria 0 7 10 1 among all investigated samples the abundance of dnra bacteria still reaches 109 gene copies g 1 however 15n isotope tracing indicated that the potential dnra rates were significantly lower 0 4 2 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 than those of denitrification 9 5 15 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 but higher than anammox rate 0 3 1 3 nmol n g 1 h 1 the dnra bacterial community structure was primarily affected by temperature gradient despite the treatment process high throughput sequencing analysis targeting the dnra nrfa gene showed that nitrospira accounted for the largest proportion of nrfa genes among all samples 6 2 36 3 followed by brocadia 5 9 22 1 network analysis further indicated that nitrospira played an important role in both the dnra bacterial community and entire bacterial community in municipal wwtps these results suggest that the ecological habitats of dnra bacteria in anthropogenic ecosystems were far more abundant than previously assumed however the contribution to n transformation by the widespread dnra was not significant in traditional municipal wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra denitrification anammox nitrospira no3 reduction municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 introduction nitrogen n cycle is one of the fundamental element cycles in biogeochemistry nitrate no3 as a stable final oxidation state product is involved in most reactive processes during the microbial n cycle including no3 assimilation no3 dissimilatory reduction and nitrite oxidation kraft et al 2011 in contrast to oxygen respiration no3 respiration yields energy for the network of the assimilatory and respiratory n pathways in the absence of o2 thus exerting an essential role in the provision of n sources greenhouse gas emissions n2o and public health no2 jetten 2008 kraft et al 2011 2014 the no3 reduction process produces not only nitrogen gas n2 but also ammonium nh4 which is referred to as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process at present studies about dnra focus on marine systems estuarine sediments or soil systems dnra can be ubiquitously detected in various natural and anthropogenic ecosystems at all levels of substrate concentrations in both marine and soil systems yin et al 2002 risgaard petersen et al 2003 scott et al 2008 sgouridis et al 2011 roberts et al 2014 chen et al 2015 tsukuda et al 2015 shan et al 2016 jahangir et al 2017 in marine systems dnra coupled with ammonia oxidation drives anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which was considered as an additional or alternative n loss pathway in marine sediments jensen et al 2011 salk et al 2017 in paddy soils dnra also substantially contributed up to 18 of the total n conservation shan et al 2016 the factors affecting dnra including oxygen c n ratio organic carbon no3 concentration sulfide concentration ph and temperature in the oceans estuaries sediments and soil environments have been investigated in detail welsh et al 2001 dunn et al 2013 nogaro and burgin 2014 azzoni et al 2015 brin 2015 decleyre et al 2015 cao et al 2016 however there are rare reports about dnra bacteria in the sewage treatment ecosystem as the largest biotechnological application worldwide and the most common artificial water ecosystem municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps play a significant role in global n cycle most municipal wwtps mainly apply denitrification process to remove no2 and no3 from wastewater which increases the by product of nitrous oxide n2o accounting for approximately 1 3 of the total n2o emission ipcc 2001 although anammox bacteria can be extensively found in municipal wwtps they contribute less than 10 to n2 production wang et al 2015 in denitrification and anammox processes no3 is microbially converted to n2 and n pollution is permanently removed from wastewater in contrast in dnra process the generated nh4 is the end product rather than n2 the produced nh4 will either be fed back to the treatment system which would affect the design and operation of the municipal wwtps or enter the water body where it will accelerate the eutrophication groffman et al 2000 hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 until now anammox and denitrification in municipal wwtps have been intensively studied the occurrence abundance activity community structure and contribution of dnra may play a crucial role in the global n cycle balance and n flux calculation however there are no related research about them accordingly this study investigated the distribution contribution and microbial mechanism of dnra in various full scale municipal wwtps across china a total of eight treatment units from six municipal wwtps with different treatment processes treatment capacities operation modes properties of wastewater and activated sludge and operation temperatures were investigated by using molecular and 15n isotope tracing techniques furthermore high throughput sequencing and co occurring network approach were applied to investigate the interspecies relationships between dnra bacteria nitrate competitors anammox and denitrifiers and other co occurring bacteria 2 material and methods 2 1 municipal wwtps and samples a total of eight treatment units were selected to collect activated sludge

including influent wastewater activated sludge temperature gradient 5 0 to 25 c mean annual temperature overall triplicate activated sludge about 30 50 l was directly collected from each sampling unit at the operating conditions separately stored at sterile plastic barrels and immediately transported to the laboratory within 1 16 h upon arrival at the laboratory the activated sludges and wastewater were separated through 0 45 μm sterile filters after that a portion of each activated sludge was used to determine the dnra denitrification and anammox rates as soon as possible while the rest was used for chemical and molecular analysis the wastewater was further filtered through 0 22 μm mixed cellulose esters microfiltration membranes mf millipore billerica ma usa to remove biological

conducted with a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl sybr premix ex taq takara dalian china 4 pmol primers and 0 5 1 μg dna template the protocol steps were set for 10 min at 94 c followed by 30 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 c 45 s at annealing temperature and 20 s at 72 c table s1 melting curves were generated after each assay to evaluate the specificity of amplification ten fold serial dilutions of a known copy number of the plasmid dnas were subjected to qpcr to obtain an external standard curve the amplification efficiencies were 95 103 avg 97 the correlation coefficients r 2 were all above 0 98 and the detection limit was 1 00 103 copies g 1 all samples and standard curves were assessed in triplicate 2 4 cloning illumina sequencing and ecological network analysis the pcr cloning of the nrfa gene was performed with the primers nrfa f2aw and nrfa r1 in a c1000tm thermal cycler biorad usa positive clones were sequenced using an abi 3730xl automated sequencer applied biosystems usa due to the multiple copies of dnra nrfa gene in the same genome and the different but overlapping primers operational taxonomic units otus 97 nucleotide similarity were used to the diversity analysis instead of the amplicon sequence variants asvs callahan et al 2017 phylogenetic trees were constructed via neighbor joining nj with the jukes cantor correction using mega 4 package tamura et al 2007 supplementary methods for high throughput sequencing analysis the nrfa gene and bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the barcode attached primers nrfa f2aw nrfa r1 and 341f 806r herlemann et al 2011 using an abi geneamp 9700 abi usa respectively table s1 the sequencing of positive amplicons was conducted on an illumina miseq pe250 platform 2 250 bp illumina san diego usa the readings were screened by removing low quality sequences de replication and discarding singletons and chimeras using both trimmomatic and flash software the obtained sequences were normalized to 160 000 and 23 680 random sequences for dnra nrfa gene and bacterial 16s rrna gene per sample using usearch software otus rarefaction curves and α diversity indexes were generated at 97 similarity with qiime and mothur software table s2 fig s2 taxonomy for each otu was assigned via the rdp classifier against silva databases for bacterial 16s rrna gene and a local alignment basic local alignment search tool blast for dnra nrfa gene raw sequence reads were deposited into the genbank database under the accession numbers srp158889 and srp158890 for dnra nrfa gene and bacterial 16s rrna gene respectively phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmens analysis was conducted using the otu matrix based on the power law model the intra and inter specific networks were conducted among dnra nrfa gene and other co occurring bacterial 16s rrna gene in municipal wwtps respectively in the networks a module is a group of otus nodes that had higher connections among themselves but much fewer connected with otus outside the group the different roles of a specific node in the pmens were identified using both the within module connectivity zi and the among module connectivity pi with thresholds of 2 5 and 0 62 respectively deng et al 2012 in the network the nodes at the periphery represent specialists the module hubs and connectors refer to generalists and the network hubs refer to super generalists 2 5 potential rates of dnra anammox and denitrification by 15n tracer technique activated sludges approximately 0 3 g vss were transferred to several 12 0 ml glass vials exetainer labco uk filled with ar purged and filtered wastewater by 0 22 μm sterile membranes at in situ wastewater temperature table 1 three parallel assays were conducted for each activated sludge the resulting slurries first had to be pre incubated for less than 8 h under anaerobic conditions to deplete residual nox and o2 in the incubation vials as described by risgaard petersen et al 2003 and lam et al 2009 after that approximately 50 μl of ar purged 15nh4cl 99 16 15n treatment i 15nh4cl na15no3 99 19 15n treatment ii and na15no3 treatment iii solutions were injected through the septa of each vial to reach the in situ concentration the three treatments were used as a control experiment conformation experiment for anammox and quantification experiment for the potential rate of each nitrate reduction process respectively the mixed sludges were anaerobically incubated at in situ wastewater temperature and stopped at each defined interval 0 1 2 4 6 and 8 h by adding 200 μl of a 7 m zncl2 solution respectively the potential rate of dnra no3 nh4 was assessed by tracking the 15nh4 production rate measured after conversion to n2 alkaline hypobromite 200 μl was used to oxidize the produced 15nh4 to 30n2 completely during more than 12 h incubation lam et al 2009 yin et al 2014 for anammox and denitrification processes the potential rates were pre calculated using the produced 29n2 and 30n2 the produced 29n2 or 30n2 were measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometers irms gasbench ii mat253 bremen germany with 0 05 internal precision and 0 1 0 5 external precision in addition we also tested the efficiency of alkaline hypobromite as oxidizing agents for nh4 to n2 using a 700 mhz high resolution nmr spectrometer avance iii bruker switzerland for nh4 conversation and highly sensitive irms for n2 determination fig s3 finally the potential rates of all processes were further corrected using the average 15nh4 f a and 15no3 f n fraction as described by song et al 2016 tables s3 and s4 with the detection limit rate of 0 001 nmol n g 1 h 1 2 6 statistical analysis general statistical analysis was conducted with the statistical product and service solutions 18 0 software spss inc usa pearson correlation was used to evaluate the correlations between variables anova was adopted to evaluate the temperature groups and within group differences among microbial activities and their roles were assessed with a post hoc lsd nsk test upgma and principal co ordinates analysis pcoa were conducted to visualize the beta diversity of dnra bacterial communities in municipal wwtps using hemi and mothur software respectively in this study all statistical differences were set at α 0 05 significance level p 0 05 the figures were drawn with origin 7 5 software 3 results 3 1 occurrence and abundance of dnra bacteria in various wwtps twenty positive clones of dnra bacterial nrfa gene were randomly selected and sequenced from each sludge sample a total of 160 positive nrfa gene sequences were divided into 55 representative otus 97 nucleotide identity phylogenetic analysis showed that dnra bacteria presented in all municipal wwtps fig s5 qpcr assay showed that the abundances of dnra bacterial nrfa gene ranged from 2 96 108 to 3 95 109 copies g 1 vss accounting for 0 6 15 0 of the total bacteria bacterial 16s rrna gene 2 64 1010 1 03 1011 copies g 1 fig 1 correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between dnra bacterial nrfa gene abundance with cod r 0 820 p 0 013 and tn r 0 721 p 0 044 at wwtps influent wastewater fig s6 the proportion of dnra bacteria to the total bacteria nrfa 16s rrna was negatively correlated to bod r 0 850 p 0 007 cod r 0 837 p 0 010 and tn r 0 763 p 0 028 of influent wastewater and tn r 0 715 p 0 046 of activated sludge the abundance of nirk and nirs genes involved in denitrification process ranged from 2 64 107 to 1 19 109 copies g 1 vss and from 3 00 108 to 2 40 109 copies g 1 vss respectively denitrifier nirk gene had a positive correlation with tc tn r 0 727 p 0 041 of activated sludge denitrifier nirs gene was negatively correlated to ss r 0 782 p 0 022 tc r 0 715 p 0 046 and tn r 0 732 p 0 043 of the activated sludge fig s6 the relative abundances of total denitrifying bacteria 0 7 10 1 were significantly higher than those of dnra bacteria 0 2 4 0 among all investigated samples anova p 0 030 fig 1 these results clearly demonstrated that denitrifying bacteria dominated over dnra bacteria as nitrate reducers in municipal wwtps the abundance of anammox hzsb genes ranged from 5 03 106 to 4 37 108 copies g 1 vss 0 01 1 65 of total bacteria in municipal wwtps which were significantly lower than those of dnra bacteria paired t test p 0 01 and denitrifiers p 0 011 for nirk and p 0 002 for nirs fig 1 anammox bacteria had an insignificant correlation with the properties of wastewater and activated sludge fig s6 these results clearly demonstrated that anammox bacteria were widespread but took only a small portion of the nitrate reducers in municipal wwtps 3 2 potential rates and the role of dnra in municipal wwtps the potential rates of dnra denitrification and anammox of activated sludge were measured via 15n stable isotope tracer technique fig 2 figs s3 and s4 importantly for the potential rate of dnra we also tested the efficiency of alkaline hypobromite oxidizing the 15nh4 produced by dnra to 30n2 fig s3 there are two key steps i chemical oxidation and ii n2 measurement related to the recovery efficiency results showed i the oxidation efficiency of 15nh4 to 30n2 was over 92 6 by using the high resolution nmr spectrometer and ii the recovery efficiency of 15nh4 to 30n2 averaged to around 90 2 by using irms the high recovery efficiency could avoid the underestimation and ensure the accuracy of the potential rate of dnra as much as possible the potential rates of dnra ranged from 0 37 nmol n g 1 h 1 in hb to 2 11 nmol n g 1 h 1 in gz with the contribution to the total nitrate reduction of 3 5 15 9 the potential rates were below 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 in cc 0 77 nmol n g 1 h 1 and hb 0 37 nmol n g 1 h 1 with relatively low contributions to total nitrate reduction 7 3 which were located in the lower temperature areas among the investigated wwtps overall the highest potential rates of dnra were detected in areas with higher temperature such as gz cq and yx and their contributions were averaged to 12 3 2 6 similar to dnra the highest potential rates of both denitrification and anammox occurred in wwtps with higher temperature denitrification in gz 15 69 nmol n g 1 h 1 and anammox in cq 1 45 nmol n g 1 h 1 and decreased gradually with decreasing temperature to the lowest wwtps in hb 9 91 and 0 28 nmol n g 1 h 1 respectively however the contribution of denitrification to total nitrate reduction 77 7 93 9 increased with temperature while the contribution via anammox 2 7 8 0 showed the opposite trends pearson correlation analysis also showed that the potential rates of dnra r 0 887 p 0 003 anammox r 0 935 p 0 001 and denitrification r 0 762 p 0 028 significantly positively correlated with temperature fig s6 the potential rates of denitrification in municipal wwtps were all significantly higher than the potential rates of dnra t test p 0 001 and anammox t test p 0 0005 these results indicated denitrification was still the main contributor to no3 reduction in municipal wwtps while both dnra and anammox played limited roles 3 3 community composition and diversity of dnra bacterial nrfa gene the community composition of dnra bacteria in municipal wwtps was investigated using a high throughput sequencing approach targeting dnra nrfa gene fig 3 the representative otus with the highest relative abundance were divided into 10 phylum and 30 genera fig 3a fig s7 a table s2 overall nitrospira was one of the most abundant dnra genera about 6 2 36 3 avg 22 3 of the total genera among all wwtps followed by brocadia avg 13 3 anaeromyxobacter 13 1 geothrix 9 0 haliangium 7 8 and hyalangium 6 8 the dominating genera varied among the eight activated sludges in high temperature wwtps cq and gz anaeromyxobacter were the dominating genera 15 50 and 38 05 respectively followed by brocadia 11 5 and 18 3 respectively and geothrix 9 1 and 13 5 respectively in mesothermal wwtps bj 1 2 and 3 nitrospira had the highest relative abundance 30 7 36 3 in low temperature wwtps hb and cc gethrix and lacunisphaera accounted for the highest proportions 21 9 and 16 7 respectively of bacteria both upgma and pcoa showed that dnra bacterial community in municipal wwtps were clustered into three clusters along the temperature gradient low temperature cluster cc and hb mesothermal temperature cluster bj 1 2 and 3 and high temperature cluster cq and gz fig 3a b at otu level heatmap analysis also showed similar clustering of dnra bacterial community fig s7 a this indicates that dnra microbial community structure was mainly affected by the temperature but not by the treatment process and properties of wastewater and activated sludge 3 4 co occurrence patterns and intraspecific mechanism of dnra bacterial community the ecological network of dnra bacteria was constructed at the otu level to explore the potential intraspecific mechanism of dnra bacterial community fig 4 a table s4 a total of 8 joint modules with 7 nodes were isolated from the other modules that were relatively small 2 3 nodes the size of modules varied with 2 51 nodes the largest intermediate node was annotated as genus nitrospira otu9429 while the largest central node was brocadia otu9607 in module 2 among the total 691 links associations between one to one node the positive connection links were 72 7 503 691 which were much stronger than negative links 27 3 in the network the zi pi plot showed that most nodes were peripherals 98 and no node was in network hubs fig 4 b three key connectors were nitrospira otu7180 haliangium otu206 and brocadia otu8187 furthermore two nodes belonged to module hubs nitrospira otu4845 and geothrix otu1599 the most abundant nitrospira was the key connector and also the module hub in the intraspecific network of the dnra bacterial community in municipal wwtps 3 5 bacterial community and interspecies mechanism between dnra and other microbes to further explore the potential correlation between dnra bacteria and other co occurrence bacteria high throughput sequencing was performed targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene heatmap analysis showed that 17 2 of total bacteria belonged to denitrifying bacteria and were distributed in 14 genera moreover seven genera belonged to dnra bacteria accounting for 5 3 of the total bacteria anammox bacteria only took up a small portion of total bacteria 0 005 in the municipal wwtps fig 5 a fig s7 b c table s5 the bacterial interspecies mechanism of dnra bacteria and other co occurrence microbes were explored via network analysis fig 5 b table s4 all 50 nodes annotated to 35 genera were classified into only one module with 822 connection lines associations sharing nearly equal numbers between positive 50 2 and negative 48 8 in addition there were 87 lines 87 822 10 6 connected dnra bacteria showing negative lines of up to 71 3 furthermore dnra bacteria nitrospira denitrifiers acinetobacter and other co occurring bacteria macellibacteroides sulfuritalea cloacibacterium and clostridium sensu stricto 13 had the maximum node degree 39 and were identified as key genera nitrospira was positively correlated with sulfuritalea but showed a negative correlation with the other four genera above all nitrospira played a key role in the total bacterial community 4 discussion n pollutants in sewage are primarily removed by aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrification and anaerobic nitrate reduction denitrification although no3 reduction is also conducted in dnra process the end product is nh4 therefore the occurrence of dnra process in municipal wwtps is not conducive to n pollutants removal from the wastewater while it only changes the existing form of n pollutants groffman et al 2000 hefting et al 2006 wang et al 2006 which has not been reported in full scale municipal wwtps this study was the first attempt to report the occurrence contribution and microbial mechanism of dnra process in full scale municipal wwtps these findings revealed that although dnra process is widespread in the municipal wwtps with very limited contribution on no3 reduction additionally it also provided new information on the no3 reduction and n cycle in anthropogenic ecosystems dnra was usually considered to be significant only in peripheral environments recently several observations reported dnra process occurred under different oxygenic conditions roberts et al 2014 song et al 2014 bonaglia et al 2016 moreover in aerobic conditions the specific cellular activity 0 38 4 56 fmol n d 1 wang et al 2018 was also higher than in previously reported anaerobic environments 0 22 0 23 fmol n d 1 song et al 2014 in the present study the activated sludges were collected from traditional single sludge systems under an intermittent anoxic aerobic environment besides dnra were also observed in various aerobic environments and in alternating aerobic and anoxic environments however the potential rates of dnra process in the six investigated municipal wwtps were quite low below 2 61 nmol n g 1 h 1 measured by the 15n combined with chemical conversion method these were significantly lower than samples in freshwater systems 23 6 nmol n g 1 h 1 tobias et al 2001 250 406 nmol g 1 h 1 nogaro and burgin 2014 marine systems 1704 4 402 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 cao et al 2016 10 3 29 8 nmol n g 1 h 1 hardison et al 2015 and soil systems 3 24 4 46 nmol n g 1 h 1 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2017 the low potential rate of dnra was detected in municipal wwtps which may be attributed to two reasons firstly nh4 as the end product of dnra process was an important factor for the driving force of this biochemical reaction based on the principle of reaction kinetics in the soil the dnra process is also widespread but plays important roles in the soil ecosystems due to the preferential utilization of nh4 by plants and nh4 loss caused by large amounts of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa yin et al 2002 pettridge et al 2006 shan et al 2016 however in urban sewage treatment systems nh4 is available in excess due to the continuous input of large amounts of influent nh4 in the wastewater thus excessive nh4 would inhibit the driving force of the dnra process to product nh4 in municipal wwtps secondly no3 the substrate of dnra bacteria is the next preferred terminal electron acceptor after o2 under oxygen depleted conditions no3 participates in the supply of nitrite and plays a key role as the main electron acceptor for respiration however in urban sewage treatment systems significant aeration is performed and the do is maintained above 2 0 mg l 1 in the aeration tank wang et al 2015 consequently the no3 reduction process is not required as a driving force for the reaction furthermore the denitrifying bacteria showed stronger competition for substrates than dnra microbes in wwtps in general dnra has an advantage over denitrification in no3 limiting conditions because the former can accept eight electrons per no3 molecule versus five for denitrifier tiedje 1988 jørgensen 1989 kraft et al 2014 however de brabandere et al 2015 reported the relative importance of dnra positively correlated with no3 concentration at the bottom water in an anoxic fjord basin similarly in this study the level of no3 was also relatively high and it was not a growth limiting factor different studies demonstrated that dnra was mainly affected by c n ratio risgaard petersen et al 2003 chen et al 2015 shan et al 2016 c n ratio in the influent of municipal sewage treatment plants in china is mostly low wang et al 2015 which is more conducive to denitrifying bacteria roberts et al 2014 van den berg et al 2015 shan et al 2016 the 16s rrna high throughput and qpcr analysis suggest that the relative and absolute abundance of denitrifying bacteria in the sludge were higher than those of dnra bacteria in addition sulfur s containing compounds are a common pollutant in the urban water management system pikaar et al 2014 and free sulfides hydrogen sulfide h2s and sulfide ion s2 are identified as the potential electron donor during the no3 reduction process lu et al 2013 caffrey et al 2019 recent study reported that dnra bacteria were only active under high sulfide condition in a chronically hypoxic basin while anammox was insignificantly changed and denitrification was inhibited caffrey et al 2019 lu et al 2013 also reported there is an obvious competition between s and c driven dnra pathways thus interactions among free sulfide and no3 reduction processes should be explored in the future in this study samples were collected in summer the warmest time of the year the highest absolute abundance and relative abundance of dnra bacteria was both found in gz samples at higher temperatures the average monthly temperature was 29 2 c and the highest rate of dnra process was also detected in gz additionally previous studies also showed that temperature was positively correlated to the rate of dnra during the warmest months of the year the rate of dnra reached the highest values jäntti et al 2011 the optimum temperature of dnra bacteria was 30 c in the mixed flora of the pearl river estuary shan et al 2016 and dnra could be almost completely inhibited when temperatures were lower than 10 c ribas et al 2015 in contrast recent studies showed that dnra accounted for a substantial portion of total no3 reduction even when temperature was lower than 10 c in sediments from a subarctic sea bonaglia et al 2017 and the temperate rivers mean annual temperature 4 7 c li et al 2019 therefore it is predictable that dnra bacteria would be low activity yet still contribute to no3 reduction at low temperatures the abundance of the functional gene nrfa exceeded the 109 level despite their low activity in municipal wwtps as indicated by nrfa gene sequencing the community structure further showed that there were at least 120 co occurring nitrospira strains in the various tested conditions regardless of the temperature oxygen concentration substrate loadings and operating conditions suggesting that the nrfa gene was widespread and had a stable coexistence in nitrospira lineages with their high abundance in the natural environment daims et al 2015 gruber dorninger et al 2015 ushiki et al 2017 network analyses showed that nitrospira was the most important taxon not only in dnra bacterial community but also in the total bacterial community indicating that nitrospira may exert a more complex microbial ecology function daims et al 2015 ushiki et al 2017 this could be attributed to the diversity of nitrospira metabolic processes nitrospira has been generally known as a globally distributed group of nitrite oxidizers performing nitrite oxidation or complete ammonium oxidation process instead of dnra process daims et al 2015 ushiki et al 2017 daims and wagner 2018 hence the high abundance of genus nitrospira did not increase the dnra rate the discovery of anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 processes indicates that the microbial nitrate reduction does not only include dnra and the denitrification processes previous studies conducted by our group also showed that anammox is widely distributed in municipal wwtps wang et al 2015 however the obtained anammox rate was only 0 08 1 20 nmol n g 1 h 1 which was consistent with the low level of dnra rate found in this study and both were much lower than those of denitrification brocadia is defined as an anammox bacterium with dnra function only under nh4 limiting environments kartal et al 2008 however ammonia is not a limiting factor in the sewage treatment system consequently the high abundance of the nrfa gene in brocadia is also not related to the no3 reduction rate previous studies on global surface aerobic soils have also reported that damo processes were unlikely to occur in aerobic environments zhu et al 2018 furthermore no literature is available on damo in sewage treatment plants therefore damo process may play an extremely limited role in the traditional nitrification denitrification wwtps in summary it can be concluded that denitrification is the primary process for no3 reduction and n removal in municipal wwtps 5 conclusions the occurrence population structure abundance activity and contribution to no3 reduction of dnra in full scale municipal wwtps via the traditional nitrification denitrification route were investigated using molecular and isotopic tracing techniques the key findings are listed in the following the abundance of dnra bacterial nrfa gene ranged from 2 96 108 to 3 95 109 copies g 1 the relative abundance of dnra 0 18 3 94 was less than that of denitrifying bacteria 0 68 10 06 in all samples but higher than that of anammox bacteria 0 01 1 65 similarity to the abundance results the potential rates of dnra below 2 1 nmol n g 1 h 1 were significantly lower than those of the denitrification rate 9 5 15 7 nmol n g 1 h 1 but higher than those of anammox rate 0 3 1 3 nmol n g 1 h 1 the highest rates via the three processes all increased with temperature the ecological habitats of dnra bacteria in anthropogenic ecosystems were found to be far more abundant than previously assumed however the contribution of n transformation by dnra was not significant in traditional municipal wwtps high throughput sequencing analysis showed that nitrospira accounted for the largest proportion of the nrfa gene 6 2 36 3 network analysis also showed that nitrospira played an important role not only in the dnra bacterial community but also in the total bacterial community in municipal wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17882,novel magnetic ag rf fe3o4 core satellite mcs nanocomposites were prepared through in situ photoreduction upon bridging fe iii and ag via hydroxyl groups in resorcinol formaldehyde rf resin by virtue of the coordination effect the catalytic activity of mcs nanocomposites was evaluated based on catalytic 4 nitrophenol 4 np reduction with nabh4 as the reducing agent it was noteworthy that the mcs 3 was beneficial to obtain a superior reaction rate constant of 2 27 min 1 and a tof up to 72 7 h 1 moreover the mcs could be easily recovered by applying an external magnetic field and was reused for five times without significantly decrease in catalytic activity kinetic and thermodynamic study revealed that catalytic 4 np reduction using mcs nanocatalysts obeyed the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism and was controlled by the diffusion rate of substrates overall the immobilization of ultra fine ag nanoparticles and the extremely negative potentials around mcs nanocomposites which were effective for the diffusion of reactants synergistically accelerated the catalytic reduction reactions graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrophenol reduction silver nanoparticles magnetic nanocomposite core satellite structure kinetic and thermodynamic study 1 introduction in recent years nanotechnology has been developed rapidly in catalysis optoelectronics biomedicine and other fields nobel metal nanoparticles nps have attracted extensive attention because of their unique reduction potentials ma et al 2017 due to the quantum confinement effect negative fermi potential and surface plasmon resonance spr zhang et al 2015 therefore metal nanoparticles have been used as catalysts for many electron transfer reactions among these noble metal nps silver nps have been widely studied in heterogeneous catalysis of various organic and inorganic reactions rosen et al 2015 by controlling the size shape composition and structure of ag nps it is extraordinarily beneficial to tune their properties in related catalytic reductive applications in other words nanocomposites immobilized with smaller ag nps are predominant in acquiring higher activity because of the higher surface to volume ratio and more negative redox potential which helps accelerate the transfer of electrons from the nps surface to the reactants zhang et al 2009 2012 aromatic nitro compounds such as nitrophenol isomers and homologues are well known as a class of the priority pollutants because of their toxicity non biodegradability carcinogenicity and high persistence in the environment saha et

aquatic organisms and indirectly cause a variety of health problems to human beings guo et al 2019 li et al 2017 sahiner et al 2010 unfortunately it is difficult to efficiently remove the soluble stable nitrophenols through conventional wastewater treatment process oturan et al 2000 the reduction of nitrophenols aided with effective catalysts could not only provide an alternative for the remove of nitrophenols to lower the environmental risk but also yield the products of aminophenols which are essential in pharmaceutical industries gu et al 2018 li et al 2012 the 4 np reduction reaction is a six electron transfer process using sodium borohydride nabh4 as a reductant and conducted at room temperature and is verified to be a process that produces only 4 aminophenol without any side product therefore it is universally accepted to be a model reaction for evaluating the catalytic efficiency of metal nps zeng et al 2010 in order to solve the problem of agglomeration of smaller ag nps related to their high surface energy hu et al 2015 ag nps have been loaded onto various supports such as metal oxides carbon materials and polymers liao et al 2019 choi et al 2010 beier et al 2009 however these catalysts are usually required to be recovered from liquid solution by tedious and time consuming centrifugation redistribution cycles resulting in poor recovery and decreased reuse ability of catalysts the magnetic technology usually appears as a carrier with a magnetic core has been developed as an effective separation considering the advantages of fast highly efficient and economical operation jiang et al 2011 the ag nps is usually grown on carriers through chemical reduction photoinduction electrochemistry ultrasonic assisted method solvothermal reaction template synthesis and so on tanaka et al 2009 manivannan et al 2012 photoreduction of ag has been proved to be a green and alternative way for the immobilization of ag nps on to the matrix of the nanocomposites whereas the widely used chemical reduction methods generally involve hazardous reducing agents for the deposition of ag nps on the supports xiao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 in this study a series of novel magnetic ag rf fe3o4 core satellite mcs nanocomposites were prepared by in situ photoreduction of ag on the resorcinol formaldehyde rf resin shell with a magnetic fe3o4 core the morphology size distribution and crystallinity of ag nps were studied by means of x ray diffraction scanning electron microscope transmission electron microscope saturation magnetization analysis and nitrogen adsorption desorption test the catalytic activity of the mcs was evaluated using the model reduction of 4 np to 4 aminophenol 4 ap the reduction mechanism was proposed according to the

2320 2350 candela for 4 h finally the mcs nanocomposites with various ag loadings were prepared after washing and vacuum drying at 60 c for 3 h and reported henceforth as mcs x x 1 2 3 and 4 2 3 catalytic study of mcs nanocomposites the catalytic activity of as prepared mcs x nanocomposites was evaluated by the catalytic hydrogenation reactions of nitrophenols 50 ml of freshly prepared nabh4 solution 0 5 m was mixed with 50 ml of 20 mg l 1 4 nitrophenol under mechanical stirring then 10 mg of mcs x was added into the mixture to initiate the reaction to monitor the reaction progress 3 ml supernatant was sampled and the absorbance was monitored using a uv 2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan over a scanning range of 250 550 nm the reduction of nitrophenol isomers and homologues was carried out referring to the above procedure and only the 4 np was substituted with isomers and homologues the catalytic stability and reusability of mcs nanocomposites were measured by five

analyses of the as obtained catalysts were performed by transmission electron microscopy tem and high resolution tem hrtem the tem and hrtem images were taken with a jeol jem 2010 fei tecnai g20 field emission microscope jeol tokyo japan operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv the crystal structure was characterized by x ray powder diffraction by using a panalytical x pert pro diffractometer cu radiation λ 0 154 nm operated at 40 kv and 40 ma panalytical holland the scanning range was between 10 and 90 2 θ with a step size of 0 02 the brunauer emmett teller method and the barrett joyner halenda analysis were applied to determine the surface area and pore diameter based on the data obtained from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms carried out on a micromeritics asap 2460 thermogravimetric analyses tga were performed under n2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 by using an sdt q600 thermogravimetric analyzer the ag content in the mcs nanocomposites was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes shimadzu icp 7510 the saturation magnetization of mcs x was measured using a squid vsm mpms 3 quantum design usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed on a thermo fisher escalab 250xi spectrometer with al kα x ray source 15 kv 10 ma zeta potential was determined using a brookhaven s nanobrook omni instrument 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mcs nanocomposites the formation of specific groups on the rf was confirmed according to the ft ir analysis as shown in fig s1 and table s1 as demonstrated in scheme 1 it is speculated that the coating of rf resins will provide functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl groups for the electrostatic binding of ag the ag will hence be reduced to ag nanoparticles through in situ photoreduction the products crystallinity was investigated through powder xrd measurements and the typical xrd patterns were shown in fig 1 it was demonstrated that the rf resin shell coated by sol gel method did not affect the characteristic diffraction peaks of fe3o4 the high and sharp peaks indicated that the as prepared fe3o4 and silver particles were well crystallized in comparison with the xrd pattern of rf fe3o4 that only showed a magnetite structure feature at 30 3 2 2 0 35 7 3 1 1 43 4 4 0 0 53 7 4 2 2 57 1 5 1 1 and 62 9 4 4 0 jcpds no 19 0629 the mcs nanocomposites displayed four sharp diffraction peaks at 38 3 1 1 1 44 5 2 0 0 64 6 2 2 0 and 77 5 3 1 1 which were ascribed to diffractions of face center cubic fcc ag nanostructures jcpds 04 0783 kulkarni and bhanage 2014 xu et al 2013 the complete reduction of ag ions under light exposure was demonstrated since no diffraction peaks from other impurities were detected stronger intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to ag nps were observed with higher ag loading the elemental analysis carried out on icp aes showed that the weight percentages wt of ag in the prepared mcs 1 mcs 2 mcs 3 and mcs 4 were 0 79 1 71 4 13 and 4 11 wt respectively indicating a saturated loading of ag contents at rf resin surfaces when the addition of agno3 was increased to 20 mmol xps analyses as shown in fig 2 were studied to investigate phase compositions and oxidation valence states of the samples as well as to precisely distinguish the formation of ag fe3o4 and γ fe2o3 it was clear that well fitted curves of the fe 2p in the xps map matched the typical magnetite phase and the undiscovered fe 2p vibration satellite peak suggested the absence of γ fe2o3 moreover the silver chemical state and surface components were also investigated by xps the 6 1 ev difference between the ag 3d3 2 and ag 3d5 2 binding energies was in agreement with the standard binding energies of metallic silver and no peak of ag2o or ago was discovered which is consistent with the xrd results sem and hrtem were conducted to analyze the microstructure and distribution of loaded ag nps fig 3 a shows the sem image of as prepared mcs 3 in which spherical silver nps were observed to be well dispersed at surfaces of rf shells whereas the fe3o4 magnetic core was wrapped in the rf shell as demonstrated in the tem image inset of fig 3a besides ag nps with a diameter of ca 10 nm were discovered to be attached to the surface of rf coated magnetic nanocarrier the crystal plane spacing of 0 235 nm fig 3b was assigned to the 1 1 1 crystal plane of ag0 nps which is the basal plane for ag single crystals viana et al 2013 lin et al 2009 matching well with the xrd data the space fringes of the core detected according to the hrtem image fig 3c well matched with the 1 1 1 plane of the fe3o4 chen et al 2015 the rf provided a large number of active sites which were beneficial for the uniform growth and distribution of silver nanoparticles thus leading to the formation of ultra fine ag nps by contrast to those prepared from reduction methods with nabh4 mao et al 2015 chiou et al 2013 the magnetic property of fe3o4 rf fe3o4 and mcs 3 nanocomposites were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer at ambient temperature although rf coating might cause a significant decrease in magnetization as prepared samples still showed a sufficiently high saturation magnetization of 31 0 emu g 1 as shown in fig 4 allowing the fast magnetic separation of mcs nanocomposites in aqueous solutions in practical applications the nanocomposites could be easily recovered under external magnetic field within seconds the inset of fig 4 the internal pore structures and surface areas of rf fe3o4 and mcs x 1 2 3 and 4 were determined via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig s2 and table s2 all samples displayed typical type iv adsorption desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop suggesting the existence of mesopores in the samples the decrease in surface areas and pore volumes were attributed to the deposition of small silver nanoparticles at surfaces of the rf resin that could partially block the pores and channels the relatively large specific surface area was expected to provide abundant active sites and adsorption interface for the catalytic reduction of nitrophenols jiang et al 2013 thermogravimetric analysis tga results indicated that all mcs nanocomposites maintained good thermal stability fig s3 the gradual weight loss was mainly attributed to the decomposition of the rf resin shell at higher temperature 3 2 catalytic reduction of nitrophenols 3 2 1 catalytic reduction of 4 np the catalytic reduction of 4 np in the presence of nabh4 in water at room temperature was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the catalytic activity of mcs nanocomposite the absorbance characteristics detected using uv vis spectrophotometer for 4 np shifted from 317 nm to 400 nm immediately after the addition of nabh4 due to the formation of 4 nitrophenolate ions under alkaline conditions ye et al 2016 gupta et al 2014 corresponding to a visual color change from light yellow to dark yellow fig 5 a displayed the typical evolution of uv vis spectra with time using mcs 3 as the catalyst reduction reactions could be monitored easily from the time dependent absorbance which showed successive decreases in peak intensity at 400 nm and a concomitant development of a new peak at 300 nm belonging to the 4 ap products gangula et al 2011 in addition the color of reactants changed gradually from dark yellow to colorless and characteristics at 400 nm could no longer be detected after 4 min at 288 k effects of the thermodynamically favorable reduction of 4 np with or without the aid of the as prepared catalysts were shown in fig 5b no significant changes in uv vis characteristics were detected without the catalyst or nabh4 even after more than 90 min meanwhile it should be noted that the ag content played an important role in catalytic 4 np reduction as demonstrated in fig 5b the efficiency of 4 np reduction increased from ca 40 to ca 98 when the ag content in the catalysts rose from 0 79 mcs 1 to 4 13 mcs 3 the catalytic effects tended to be stable as the silver loading 4 11 in mcs 4 was almost saturated on catalyst surfaces effects of the reductant nabh4 and catalyst dosage were examined and results were shown in figs s4 and s5 reaction rates were nearly unchanged when nabh4 dosages increased from 0 3 to 0 7 mol l 1 the excessive nabh4 was hydrolyzed to generate h2 bubbles that contributed to the effective diffusion as well as the reduction process it could be concluded from fig s5 that the catalytic activity was significantly affected with the increasing dosages of catalysts from 0 to 0 1 g l 1 the reaction rate reached relatively constant afterwards the increase of catalyst dosages was helpful in providing more active sites for the contact of substrates and accelerated the transfer of electrons however continual increase the catalyst would no longer enhancing the reaction rate with the decrease of tof from 72 7 h 1 to 37 1 h 1 instead 3 2 2 kinetics and thermodynamics of 4 np reduction the 4 np reduction could be considered as a pseudo first order reaction with an excessive use of nabh4 as illustrated by the correlation coefficients i e r2 0 99 as shown in table s3 under this circumstance the 4 np reduction rate can be independent from the concentration of nabh4 hernandez gordillo et al 2014 and the rate constant k was calculated according to eq 1 fig 6 shows the ln ct c0 versus reaction time for 4 np reduction calculated values of pseudo first order rate constants k were listed in the inset table it is apparent that the catalytic activity of mcs gradually enhanced with the increase of ag content increased amount of ag nps was believed to provide more catalytically active sites and consequently accelerate reduction processes of note the catalytic reduction of 4 np over the mcs 3 showed the highest rate constant of 0 93 min 1 it was noticeable that the rate constant of 4 np reduction in the presence of mcs 3 was higher than many ag au and alloy based catalysts documented in the literatures as listed in table 1 k values of the mcs 3 were approximately 4 5 12 and 23 times those of the ni au kcc 1 le et al 2014 au graphene li et al 2012 and ag guo et al 2016 catalysts respectively the k was then normalized to the concentration of ag according to eq 5 deriving knor to reveal the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalyst the results showed that the mcs 3 exhibited a superior catalytic efficiency with a tof 72 7 h 1 and a significantly higher knor value 91 5 s 1 g 1 at room temperature 298 k in comparison with other ag au and pt based nanocomposites as listed in table 1 the apparent activation energy ea could be estimated from the arrhenius equation according to eq 2 zeng et al 2010 kalekar et al 2013 the catalytic reduction of 4 np was studied at five different temperatures 288 293 298 303 and 308 k a plot of ln ct c0 versus t shows a linear correlation for 4 np reduction and the kapp was estimated to be 0 93 min 1 1 43 min 1 2 27 min 1 2 64 min 1 and 3 44 min 1 respectively as indicated in fig 7 a over mcs catalysts the ea was then determined by the plot of ln k vs 1 t and the value of 47 7 kj mol 1 was calculated from the slop ea r 3 3 catalytic stability the nanocomposite with the highest catalytic activity i e mcs 3 was selected to determine its stability over multiple reaction cycles after each cycle the catalyst was collected by external magnetic field and rinsed with up water for three times before the next run it was clear that the mcs 3 maintained good stability with a slight decrease of 7 1 in catalytic efficiency after five cycles as shown in fig 8 a which indicated the catalyst was stable and efficient and could well satisfy the practical requirements especially for commercial and industrial applications gratzel and frank 1982 furthermore recovered catalysts were characterized by xrd and tem to investigate the possible alteration in their crystallization and morphology after five cycles the metallic state of ag was preserved as confirmed by xrd pattern fig 8b and the ag nanoparticles with similar sizes ca 10 nm were also uniformly distributed on the surface of the rf fe3o4 as confirmed by tem inset of fig 8b however a small amount 1 1 of ag leached to the solution after five runs of catalytic reactions as revealed by icp aes analysis which was attributed to the slight decrease in catalytic activity therefore it was concluded that the presence of the rf shell was efficient as bonding agents to stabilize the nanoparticles from aggregation and leaching 3 4 catalytic reduction of isomers and homologues of 4 np the mcs 3 nanocatalyst was further used in the reduction of 4 np isomers and homologues to identify the impacts of substituent groups to the catalytic activity gupta et al 2014 li et al 2011 shi et al 2013 as shown in fig 9 s6 and table 2 the mcs 3 contact system has significant catalytic activity and reduction rate for nitrophenols and the catalytic rate follows the order 2 np 4 np 3 np the results obtained from the catalytic reduction of 4 np homologues revealed that rate constants decreased greatly with the insertion of either electron withdrawing or electron donating substituent groups on the position of 4 np among these homologues the introduction of an electron withdrawing group induced a relatively faster catalytic rate than that of an electron donating group and the reduction rate exhibited a positive correlation with the electron withdrawing ability of substituent groups the catalytic reduction rate followed the order 2 bromo 4 nitrophenol 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol 2 fluoro 4 nitrophenol 3 5 catalytic reduction mechanism the catalytic reduction of 4 np to 4 ap is an electron transfer process the rate of electron transfer at catalyst surfaces can be influenced by the diffusion of 4 np to ag nps surfaces interfacial electron transfer and the detachment of 4 ap from surfaces zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2011 zeta potentials of mcs nanocomposites with various loadings of ag were introduced to understand the charge distribution at surfaces of these nanocomposites and negative potentials were discovered for all mcs nanocomposites especially for mcs 3 that with the highest ag loading as shown in fig s7 in addition the reduction rate decreased with the increase of 4 np concentrations as shown in fig s8 therefore the ag rf fe3o4 catalyzed reduction process should obey the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism narayanan and devaki 2015 compared to recent studies the ea in this current system was similar with those of other silver based nanocomposites cao et al 2017 aditya et al 2015 this was an implication that active sites for 4 np reduction located on ag nps however the pre exponential factor for the mcs 3 was 4 48 108 whereas the corresponding values for catalysts reported in literatures cao et al 2017 wu et al 2018 was about 3 89 108 and 3 48 105 this strongly indicated that the difference in the reaction rate was derived from the variation in the number of active sites meanwhile the significantly higher reaction rate of the mcs can be ascribed to the abundance in active ag sites at catalyst surfaces xie et al 2009 the enhancement in reduction activity and stability of mcs 3 nanocomposites could be ascribed to synergetic effects of the ease of the access to the active sites the rapid transformation of electrons and the restricted aggregation of the ag nps zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 zhu and xu 2016 on the surface of the rf fe3o4 magnetic core support as depicted in scheme 2 ag nps supported on the rf fe3o4 can function as the electron mediator between 4 ap oxidant and bh4 reductant gratzel and frank 1982 tang et al 2010 wunder et al 2011 and the electron transfer occurs via ag nps in addition the carbons make up the rf resin are very reactive electrophiles which tend to attract electrons between the ag nps and the shell meanwhile the 4 np with relatively positive charge around no bond due to the π π stacking interactions is easily diffused to the negatively charged surface of the catalysts and thus results in efficient contact between them the existence of surplus electrons added to the rf shell facilitates the uptake of electrons by the absorbed 4 np molecules leading to the production of 4 ap the 4 ap with a pair of electrons is easily detached from the surface of the catalyst and refreshed for the creation of free surfaces for following cycles of catalytic reactions suchomel et al 2018 4 conclusions in summary a magnetic rf fe3o4 core shell carrier was designed to provide strong binding sites for ag ions by which ultra fine ag nps with narrow size distribution could be in situ photoreduced and immobilized on the magnetic carriers to form core satellite mcs nanocomposites with superior catalytic activity for 4 np reduction the apparent kinetic rate constant k was obtained through pseudo first order kinetic model reached 2 27 min 1 at room temperature the mcs nanocomposites could be easily separated from the reaction media by means of an external magnet and reused five times without significant loss of catalytic activity the reduction obeys the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism and is a diffusion controlled process the dispersion of uniform small sized ag nps which leads to extremely negative zeta potentials and offers abundant active sites for effective contact and fast interfacial electron transfer is responsible for the excellent catalytic performance the superior performance for the reduction of nitrophenol isomers and homologues makes the mcs nanocomposites potentially promising for practical applications

17882,novel magnetic ag rf fe3o4 core satellite mcs nanocomposites were prepared through in situ photoreduction upon bridging fe iii and ag via hydroxyl groups in resorcinol formaldehyde rf resin by virtue of the coordination effect the catalytic activity of mcs nanocomposites was evaluated based on catalytic 4 nitrophenol 4 np reduction with nabh4 as the reducing agent it was noteworthy that the mcs 3 was beneficial to obtain a superior reaction rate constant of 2 27 min 1 and a tof up to 72 7 h 1 moreover the mcs could be easily recovered by applying an external magnetic field and was reused for five times without significantly decrease in catalytic activity kinetic and thermodynamic study revealed that catalytic 4 np reduction using mcs nanocatalysts obeyed the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism and was controlled by the diffusion rate of substrates overall the immobilization of ultra fine ag nanoparticles and the extremely negative potentials around mcs nanocomposites which were effective for the diffusion of reactants synergistically accelerated the catalytic reduction reactions graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrophenol reduction silver nanoparticles magnetic nanocomposite core satellite structure kinetic and thermodynamic study 1 introduction in recent years nanotechnology has been developed rapidly in catalysis optoelectronics biomedicine and other fields nobel metal nanoparticles nps have attracted extensive attention because of their unique reduction potentials ma et al 2017 due to the quantum confinement effect negative fermi potential and surface plasmon resonance spr zhang et al 2015 therefore metal nanoparticles have been used as catalysts for many electron transfer reactions among these noble metal nps silver nps have been widely studied in heterogeneous catalysis of various organic and inorganic reactions rosen et al 2015 by controlling the size shape composition and structure of ag nps it is extraordinarily beneficial to tune their properties in related catalytic reductive applications in other words nanocomposites immobilized with smaller ag nps are predominant in acquiring higher activity because of the higher surface to volume ratio and more negative redox potential which helps accelerate the transfer of electrons from the nps surface to the reactants zhang et al 2009 2012 aromatic nitro compounds such as nitrophenol isomers and homologues are well known as a class of the priority pollutants because of their toxicity non biodegradability carcinogenicity and high persistence in the environment saha et al 2010 herves et al 2012 the 4 nitrophenol 4 np is an intermediate that is widely used in pesticides pharmaceutical drugs and dyes industry untreated nitrophenol disposal would directly poison the aquatic organisms and indirectly cause a variety of health problems to human beings guo et al 2019 li et al 2017 sahiner et al 2010 unfortunately it is difficult to efficiently remove the soluble stable nitrophenols through conventional wastewater treatment process oturan et al 2000 the reduction of nitrophenols aided with effective catalysts could not only provide an alternative for the remove of nitrophenols to lower the environmental risk but also yield the products of aminophenols which are essential in pharmaceutical industries gu et al 2018 li et al 2012 the 4 np reduction reaction is a six electron transfer process using sodium borohydride nabh4 as a reductant and conducted at room temperature and is verified to be a process that produces only 4 aminophenol without any side product therefore it is universally accepted to be a model reaction for evaluating the catalytic efficiency of metal nps zeng et al 2010 in order to solve the problem of agglomeration of smaller ag nps related to their high surface energy hu et al 2015 ag nps have been loaded onto various supports such as metal oxides carbon materials and polymers liao et al 2019 choi et al 2010 beier et al 2009 however these catalysts are usually required to be recovered from liquid solution by tedious and time consuming centrifugation redistribution cycles resulting in poor recovery and decreased reuse ability of catalysts the magnetic technology usually appears as a carrier with a magnetic core has been developed as an effective separation considering the advantages of fast highly efficient and economical operation jiang et al 2011 the ag nps is usually grown on carriers through chemical reduction photoinduction electrochemistry ultrasonic assisted method solvothermal reaction template synthesis and so on tanaka et al 2009 manivannan et al 2012 photoreduction of ag has been proved to be a green and alternative way for the immobilization of ag nps on to the matrix of the nanocomposites whereas the widely used chemical reduction methods generally involve hazardous reducing agents for the deposition of ag nps on the supports xiao et al 2018 hu et al 2019 in this study a series of novel magnetic ag rf fe3o4 core satellite mcs nanocomposites were prepared by in situ photoreduction of ag on the resorcinol formaldehyde rf resin shell with a magnetic fe3o4 core the morphology size distribution and crystallinity of ag nps were studied by means of x ray diffraction scanning electron microscope transmission electron microscope saturation magnetization analysis and nitrogen adsorption desorption test the catalytic activity of the mcs was evaluated using the model reduction of 4 np to 4 aminophenol 4 ap the reduction mechanism was proposed according to the kinetic and thermodynamic results the reduction of nitrophenol isomers and homologues was finally assessed to verify the applicability of mcs nanocomposites 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals fecl3

thermogravimetric analyses tga were performed under n2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 by using an sdt q600 thermogravimetric analyzer the ag content in the mcs nanocomposites was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes shimadzu icp 7510 the saturation magnetization of mcs x was measured using a squid vsm mpms 3 quantum design usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed on a thermo fisher escalab 250xi spectrometer with al kα x ray source 15 kv 10 ma zeta potential was determined using a brookhaven s nanobrook omni instrument 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mcs nanocomposites the formation of specific groups on the rf was confirmed according to the ft ir analysis as shown in fig s1 and table s1 as demonstrated in scheme 1 it is speculated that the coating of rf resins will provide functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl groups for the electrostatic binding of ag the ag will hence be reduced to ag nanoparticles through in situ photoreduction the products crystallinity was investigated through powder xrd measurements and the typical xrd patterns were shown in fig 1 it was demonstrated that the rf resin shell coated by sol gel method did not affect the characteristic diffraction peaks of fe3o4 the high and sharp peaks indicated that the as prepared fe3o4 and silver particles were well crystallized in comparison with the xrd pattern of rf fe3o4 that only showed a magnetite structure feature at 30 3 2 2 0 35 7 3 1 1 43 4 4 0 0 53 7 4 2 2 57 1 5 1 1 and 62 9 4 4 0 jcpds no 19 0629 the mcs nanocomposites displayed four sharp diffraction peaks at 38 3 1 1 1 44 5 2 0 0 64 6 2 2 0 and 77 5 3 1 1 which were ascribed to diffractions of face center cubic fcc ag nanostructures jcpds 04 0783 kulkarni and bhanage 2014 xu et al 2013 the complete reduction of ag ions under light exposure was demonstrated since no diffraction peaks from other impurities were detected stronger intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to ag nps were observed with higher ag loading the elemental analysis carried out on icp aes showed that the weight percentages wt of ag in the prepared mcs 1 mcs 2 mcs 3 and mcs 4 were 0 79 1 71 4 13 and 4 11 wt respectively indicating a saturated loading of ag contents at rf resin surfaces when the addition of agno3 was increased to 20 mmol xps analyses as shown in fig 2 were studied to investigate phase compositions and oxidation valence states of the samples as well as to precisely distinguish the formation of ag fe3o4 and γ fe2o3 it was clear that well fitted curves of the fe 2p in the xps map matched the typical magnetite phase and the undiscovered fe 2p vibration satellite peak suggested the absence of γ fe2o3 moreover the silver chemical state and surface components were also investigated by xps the 6 1 ev difference between the ag 3d3 2 and ag 3d5 2 binding energies was in agreement with the standard binding energies of metallic silver and no peak of ag2o or ago was discovered which is consistent with the xrd results sem and hrtem were conducted to analyze the microstructure and distribution of loaded ag nps fig 3 a shows the sem image of as prepared mcs 3 in which spherical silver nps were observed to be well dispersed at surfaces of rf shells whereas the fe3o4 magnetic core was wrapped in the rf shell as demonstrated in the tem image inset of fig 3a besides ag nps with a diameter of ca 10 nm were discovered to be attached to the surface of rf coated magnetic nanocarrier the crystal plane spacing of 0 235 nm fig 3b was assigned to the 1 1 1 crystal plane of ag0 nps which is the basal plane for ag single crystals viana et al 2013 lin et al 2009 matching well with the xrd data the space fringes of the core detected according to the hrtem image fig 3c well matched with the 1 1 1 plane of the fe3o4 chen et al 2015 the rf provided a large number of active sites which were beneficial for the uniform growth and distribution of silver nanoparticles thus leading to the formation of ultra fine ag nps by contrast to those prepared from reduction methods with nabh4 mao et al 2015 chiou et al 2013 the magnetic property of fe3o4 rf fe3o4 and mcs 3 nanocomposites were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer at ambient temperature although rf coating might cause a significant decrease in magnetization as prepared samples still showed a sufficiently high saturation magnetization of 31 0 emu g 1 as shown in fig 4 allowing the fast magnetic separation of mcs nanocomposites in aqueous solutions in practical applications the nanocomposites could be easily recovered under external magnetic field within seconds the inset of fig 4 the internal pore structures and surface areas of rf fe3o4 and mcs x 1 2 3 and 4 were determined via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms as shown in fig s2 and table s2 all samples displayed typical type iv adsorption desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop suggesting the existence of mesopores in the samples the decrease in surface areas and pore volumes were attributed to the deposition of small silver nanoparticles at surfaces of the rf resin that could partially block the pores and channels the relatively large specific surface area was expected to provide abundant active sites and adsorption interface for the catalytic reduction of nitrophenols jiang et al 2013 thermogravimetric analysis tga results indicated that all mcs nanocomposites maintained good thermal stability fig s3 the gradual weight loss was mainly attributed to the decomposition of the rf resin shell at higher temperature 3 2 catalytic reduction of nitrophenols 3 2 1 catalytic reduction of 4 np the catalytic reduction of 4 np in the presence of nabh4 in water at room temperature was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the catalytic activity of mcs nanocomposite the absorbance characteristics detected using uv vis spectrophotometer for 4 np shifted from 317 nm to 400 nm immediately after the addition of nabh4 due to the formation of 4 nitrophenolate ions under alkaline conditions ye et al 2016 gupta et al 2014 corresponding to a visual color change from light yellow to dark yellow fig 5 a displayed the typical evolution of uv vis spectra with time using mcs 3 as the catalyst reduction reactions could be monitored easily from the time dependent absorbance which showed successive decreases in peak intensity at 400 nm and a concomitant development of a new peak at 300 nm belonging to the 4 ap products gangula et al 2011 in addition the color of reactants changed gradually from dark yellow to colorless and characteristics at 400 nm could no longer be detected after 4 min at 288 k effects of the thermodynamically favorable reduction of 4 np with or without the aid of the as prepared catalysts were shown in fig 5b no significant changes in uv vis characteristics were detected without the catalyst or nabh4 even after more than 90 min meanwhile it should be noted that the ag content played an important role in catalytic 4 np reduction as demonstrated in fig 5b the efficiency of 4 np reduction increased from ca 40 to ca 98 when the ag content in the catalysts rose from 0 79 mcs 1 to 4 13 mcs 3 the catalytic effects tended to be stable as the silver loading 4 11 in mcs 4 was almost saturated on catalyst surfaces effects of the reductant nabh4 and catalyst dosage were examined and results were shown in figs s4 and s5 reaction rates were nearly unchanged when nabh4 dosages increased from 0 3 to 0 7 mol l 1 the excessive nabh4 was hydrolyzed to generate h2 bubbles that contributed to the effective diffusion as well as the reduction process it could be concluded from fig s5 that the catalytic activity was significantly affected with the increasing dosages of catalysts from 0 to 0 1 g l 1 the reaction rate reached relatively constant afterwards the increase of catalyst dosages was helpful in providing more active sites for the contact of substrates and accelerated the transfer of electrons however continual increase the catalyst would no longer enhancing the reaction rate with the decrease of tof from 72 7 h 1 to 37 1 h 1 instead 3 2 2 kinetics and thermodynamics of 4 np reduction the 4 np reduction could be considered as a pseudo first order reaction with an excessive use of nabh4 as illustrated by the correlation coefficients i e r2 0 99 as shown in table s3 under this circumstance the 4 np reduction rate can be independent from the concentration of nabh4 hernandez gordillo et al 2014 and the rate constant k was calculated according to eq 1 fig 6 shows the ln ct c0 versus reaction time for 4 np reduction calculated values of pseudo first order rate constants k were listed in the inset table it is apparent that the catalytic activity of mcs gradually enhanced with the increase of ag content increased amount of ag nps was believed to provide more catalytically active sites and consequently accelerate reduction processes of note the catalytic reduction of 4 np over the mcs 3 showed the highest rate constant of 0 93 min 1 it was noticeable that the rate constant of 4 np reduction in the presence of mcs 3 was higher than many ag au and alloy based catalysts documented in the literatures as listed in table 1 k values of the mcs 3 were approximately 4 5 12 and 23 times those of the ni au kcc 1 le et al 2014 au graphene li et al 2012 and ag guo et al 2016 catalysts respectively the k was then normalized to the concentration of ag according to eq 5 deriving knor to reveal the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalyst the results showed that the mcs 3 exhibited a superior catalytic efficiency with a tof 72 7 h 1 and a significantly higher knor value 91 5 s 1 g 1 at room temperature 298 k in comparison with other ag au and pt based nanocomposites as listed in table 1 the apparent activation energy ea could be estimated from the arrhenius equation according to eq 2 zeng et al 2010 kalekar et al 2013 the catalytic reduction of 4 np was studied at five different temperatures 288 293 298 303 and 308 k a plot of ln ct c0 versus t shows a linear correlation for 4 np reduction and the kapp was estimated to be 0 93 min 1 1 43 min 1 2 27 min 1 2 64 min 1 and 3 44 min 1 respectively as indicated in fig 7 a over mcs catalysts the ea was then determined by the plot of ln k vs 1 t and the value of 47 7 kj mol 1 was calculated from the slop ea r 3 3 catalytic stability the nanocomposite with the highest catalytic activity i e mcs 3 was selected to determine its stability over multiple reaction cycles after each cycle the catalyst was collected by external magnetic field and rinsed with up water for three times before the next run it was clear that the mcs 3 maintained good stability with a slight decrease of 7 1 in catalytic efficiency after five cycles as shown in fig 8 a which indicated the catalyst was stable and efficient and could well satisfy the practical requirements especially for commercial and industrial applications gratzel and frank 1982 furthermore recovered catalysts were characterized by xrd and tem to investigate the possible alteration in their crystallization and morphology after five cycles the metallic state of ag was preserved as confirmed by xrd pattern fig 8b and the ag nanoparticles with similar sizes ca 10 nm were also uniformly distributed on the surface of the rf fe3o4 as confirmed by tem inset of fig 8b however a small amount 1 1 of ag leached to the solution after five runs of catalytic reactions as revealed by icp aes analysis which was attributed to the slight decrease in catalytic activity therefore it was concluded that the presence of the rf shell was efficient as bonding agents to stabilize the nanoparticles from aggregation and leaching 3 4 catalytic reduction of isomers and homologues of 4 np the mcs 3 nanocatalyst was further used in the reduction of 4 np isomers and homologues to identify the impacts of substituent groups to the catalytic activity gupta et al 2014 li et al 2011 shi et al 2013 as shown in fig 9 s6 and table 2 the mcs 3 contact system has significant catalytic activity and reduction rate for nitrophenols and the catalytic rate follows the order 2 np 4 np 3 np the results obtained from the catalytic reduction of 4 np homologues revealed that rate constants decreased greatly with the insertion of either electron withdrawing or electron donating substituent groups on the position of 4 np among these homologues the introduction of an electron withdrawing group induced a relatively faster catalytic rate than that of an electron donating group and the reduction rate exhibited a positive correlation with the electron withdrawing ability of substituent groups the catalytic reduction rate followed the order 2 bromo 4 nitrophenol 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol 2 fluoro 4 nitrophenol 3 5 catalytic reduction mechanism the catalytic reduction of 4 np to 4 ap is an electron transfer process the rate of electron transfer at catalyst surfaces can be influenced by the diffusion of 4 np to ag nps surfaces interfacial electron transfer and the detachment of 4 ap from surfaces zhang et al 2012 jiang et al 2011 zeta potentials of mcs nanocomposites with various loadings of ag were introduced to understand the charge distribution at surfaces of these nanocomposites and negative potentials were discovered for all mcs nanocomposites especially for mcs 3 that with the highest ag loading as shown in fig s7 in addition the reduction rate decreased with the increase of 4 np concentrations as shown in fig s8 therefore the ag rf fe3o4 catalyzed reduction process should obey the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism narayanan and devaki 2015 compared to recent studies the ea in this current system was similar with those of other silver based nanocomposites cao et al 2017 aditya et al 2015 this was an implication that active sites for 4 np reduction located on ag nps however the pre exponential factor for the mcs 3 was 4 48 108 whereas the corresponding values for catalysts reported in literatures cao et al 2017 wu et al 2018 was about 3 89 108 and 3 48 105 this strongly indicated that the difference in the reaction rate was derived from the variation in the number of active sites meanwhile the significantly higher reaction rate of the mcs can be ascribed to the abundance in active ag sites at catalyst surfaces xie et al 2009 the enhancement in reduction activity and stability of mcs 3 nanocomposites could be ascribed to synergetic effects of the ease of the access to the active sites the rapid transformation of electrons and the restricted aggregation of the ag nps zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 zhu and xu 2016 on the surface of the rf fe3o4 magnetic core support as depicted in scheme 2 ag nps supported on the rf fe3o4 can function as the electron mediator between 4 ap oxidant and bh4 reductant gratzel and frank 1982 tang et al 2010 wunder et al 2011 and the electron transfer occurs via ag nps in addition the carbons make up the rf resin are very reactive electrophiles which tend to attract electrons between the ag nps and the shell meanwhile the 4 np with relatively positive charge around no bond due to the π π stacking interactions is easily diffused to the negatively charged surface of the catalysts and thus results in efficient contact between them the existence of surplus electrons added to the rf shell facilitates the uptake of electrons by the absorbed 4 np molecules leading to the production of 4 ap the 4 ap with a pair of electrons is easily detached from the surface of the catalyst and refreshed for the creation of free surfaces for following cycles of catalytic reactions suchomel et al 2018 4 conclusions in summary a magnetic rf fe3o4 core shell carrier was designed to provide strong binding sites for ag ions by which ultra fine ag nps with narrow size distribution could be in situ photoreduced and immobilized on the magnetic carriers to form core satellite mcs nanocomposites with superior catalytic activity for 4 np reduction the apparent kinetic rate constant k was obtained through pseudo first order kinetic model reached 2 27 min 1 at room temperature the mcs nanocomposites could be easily separated from the reaction media by means of an external magnet and reused five times without significant loss of catalytic activity the reduction obeys the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism and is a diffusion controlled process the dispersion of uniform small sized ag nps which leads to extremely negative zeta potentials and offers abundant active sites for effective contact and fast interfacial electron transfer is responsible for the excellent catalytic performance the superior performance for the reduction of nitrophenol isomers and homologues makes the mcs nanocomposites potentially promising for practical applications

17883,globally increasing concerns have been raised on the high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in conventional municipal wastewater treatment processes over the past decades in this study a self sustaining synergetic microalgal bacterial granular sludge process was thus developed to address these challenges the results showed that the microalgal bacterial granular sludge process was capable of removing 92 69 96 84 and 87 16 of influent organics ammonia and phosphorus under non aeration conditions over a short time of 6 h the effluent could meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards in many countries worldwide a tight synergetic interrelationship effect between microalgae and bacteria in granules was essential for such excellent process performance the stoichiometric and functional genes analyses further revealed that most of organic matter and nutrients were removed through microalgal and bacterial assimilations moreover it was found that there existed a desirable distribution of functional species of microalgae and bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules which appeared to be essential for the self sustaining synergetic reactions and stability of microalgal bacterial granules consequently this work may offer a promising engineering alternative with great potential to achieve energy efficient and environmentally sustainable municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment microalgal bacterial granules stoichiometric analysis synergistic reactions environmental sustainability 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has been developed for municipal wastewater treatment for more than 100 years van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however increasing critiques have been raised with respect to its high energy consumption and substantial greenhouse gas ghg emissions shahabadi et al 2009 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it had been reported that nearly 3 4 of the national electricity i e 15 gw was consumed by wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the united states wang et al 2018 moreover as one of the largest ghg emitters wwtps contributed to about 0 77 gt co2 equivalent co2e in 2010 accounting for nearly 1 6 of global ghg emissions i e 49 gt co2e edenhofer 2015 while non co2 ghg e g methane and nitrous oxide were responsible for about 5 of global emissions li et al 2015 obviously the design and operation of current wastewater treatment processes appear to be against united nations sustainable development goals united nations 2015 the microalgal bacterial process has attracted increasing attention for its lower energy demand cost effectiveness and potential resource recovery olguín 2012 quijano et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 unlike the cas process microalgal bacterial process works on the self synchronized microalgal photosynthesis and bacterial respiration in this process microalgae can effectively assimilate carbon dioxide and nutrients to generate oxygen which is in turn utilized by bacteria for organics oxidation to produce carbon dioxide ramanan et al 2016 su et al 2011 i e less or even no external oxygen supply is needed as such microalgal bacterial process appears more energy efficient than the aerated cas process in which aeration can account for 40 60 of the total energy input of wwtps gikas 2017 luo et al 2019 cao 2011 on the other hand it has been widely accepted that microalgae are capable of capturing carbon dioxide to biomass laurens et al 2017 hepburn et al 2019 while produced biomass can be harvested as a feedstock for production of energy and high value substances e g biodiesel pigments and fertilizers hu et al 2017 quijano et al 2017 it appears that microalgal bacterial based technology can be reasonably considered as an alternative for environmentally sustainable wastewater treatment it should also be noted that biomass harvesting is still a bottleneck for microalgal bacterial process treating wastewater due to the poor settleability of biomass hu et al 2017 quijano et al 2017 moreover stable and reliable performance is difficult to achieve in microalgal bacterial process due to a long reaction time of days required arcila and buitrón 2017 and low nutrient removal efficiency of less than 50 70 abouhend et al 2018 huang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 in most microalgal bacterial processes aeration is still needed for improving the pollutants removal huang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 which actually compromises the benefit of this process therefore this study aimed to develop an innovative microalgal bacterial granular sludge process for municipal wastewater treatment it was shown that there existed a highly synergetic reaction between microalgae and bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules which was essential for achieving superior and stable removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus under non aerated condition the working mechanisms of the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process were further illustrated in terms of reaction stoichiometry microbial community and functional genes analyses it is expected that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process could offer a feasible engineering solution for achieving the energy efficient and environmentally sustainable municipal wastewater treatment while shedding light on future developmental direction of global wastewater industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater with the following composition was

synthetic wastewater described above were exposed to the light emitting diode led light at a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 200 10 μ mol m2 s under aerobic conditions after one month of cultivation microalgal bacterial granules were gradually matured with a typical green color and an average size of 1 30 mm the harvested mature microalgal bacterial granules were used in subsequent experiments 2 3 experimental setup the experiments were conducted with mature microalgal bacterial granules in a glass reactor of 60 ml with a height diameter ratio of 2 equipped with a fiber optic

nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total phosphorus tp suspended solids ss volatile suspended solids vss and svi5 were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 solution ph was measured by a thermo scientific orion star a111 ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of microalgal bacterial granular sludge process it was observed in fig 1 a that 92 69 0 84 of influent cod was removed with the effluent cod concentration of 18 32 2 09 mg l over 6 h concurrently 96 84 0 43 and 84 10 0 73 of influent nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were removed with average effluent concentrations being below 1 0 and 5 0 mg l respectively fig 1b and c while the total phosphorus tp concentration was reduced to 0 37 0 04 mg l corresponding to 87 16 1 32 of tp removal fig 1d obviously these performances achieved within 6 h were significantly superior to those reported in the literature abouhend et al 2018 arcila and buitrón 2017 huang et al 2015 moreover it should also be noted that the reaction time reported in previous studies was as long as 0 75 10 days vis à vis 6 h realized in this study on the other hand the nitrate and nitrite concentrations were found to be as low as 0 84 mg l and 0 40 mg l and the effluent turbidity fell into a range of 0 9 3 7 ntu these together clearly suggested that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process exhibited great potential for high efficient municipal wastewater treatment currently more and more stringent effluent discharge standards have been implemented in many countries due to increasing concern on public health and environmental risk for example the effluent discharge standards in china have been gradually migrated to class iv for effluent discharged to surface water bodies meeb 2012 meeb 2015 in view of water quality the effluent from the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process was able to meet the stringent discharge standards in many countries table 1 consequently it is reasonable to consider that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process can offer an alternative approach for current municipal wastewater treatment 3 2 synergistic algal bacterial reactions in microalgal bacterial granules in the microalgal bacterial granular sludge process do was generated by microalgae while utilized by aerobic bacteria i e do could serve as a key link between photosynthetic and heterotrophic reactions fig 1e showed the do concentration profile in one typical cycle which could be divided into do absent and do rich phases namely phase i and ii in phase i do concentration of nearly zero indeed reflected tightly coupled microalgal photosynthesis and bacterial respiration i e the oxygen produced by microalgae was fully utilized by bacteria which in turn produced carbon dioxide for microalgae in the microalgal bacterial granules the observed do accumulation in phase ii might be attributed to the continuous utilization of dissolved inorganic carbon in the culture media through microalgal photosynthesis with releasing of oxygen which could not be further consumed by bacteria after soluble organic carbon was exhausted in phase i as more than 90 of cod nh4 n tn and tp were removed in phase i while no methane and carbon dioxide could be detected in the gas phase this clearly suggested a strongly synergized phototrophic heterotrophic reaction realized by co existing microalgae and bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules in fact in such a biologically synergetic process aeration was no longer needed this in turn suggested that the aeration associated energy input could be totally saved equivalent to 40 60 of the total energy demand of wwtps gikas 2017 luo et al 2019 moreover as carbon dioxide generated from bio oxidation of soluble cod was fully utilized by microalgae in microalgal bacterial granules there would be no emission of carbon dioxide to the environment consequently it is reasonable to consider that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process would be more energy efficient and environmentally sustainable for treating municipal wastewater 3 3 stoichiometric analysis the elemental composition of microalgal bacterial granules was determined it was found that microalgal bacterial granules contained 49 65 of carbon 6 54 of hydrogen 25 39 of oxygen 9 62 of nitrogen and 1 30 of phosphorus by mass according to which the empirical formula of microalgal bacterial granules could be estimated to be c5h7 9o1 9n0 85p0 05 which indeed was found to be between the elemental compositions of microalgae and bacteria i e c5h8 9o1 8n0 6 for microalgae and c5h7o2n for mixed culture bacteria rittmann and mccarty 2012 furthermore according to the nitrogen balance the mass distribution of microalgae against bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules was determined to be around 3 5 as analyzed above an excellent synergy between microalgae and bacteria was successfully established in microalgal bacterial granules therefore it is reasonable to consider that the observed removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus by microalgal bacterial granules could be attributed to microbial assimilation instead of dissimilation as gaseous carbon dioxide and nitrogen were not detectable as the end metabolic products in the system according to the empirical formula of microalgal bacterial granules the overall microalgal bacterial assimilation reaction could be described as follows with acetate as an organic carbon source 1 50ch3coo 17nh4 h2po4

accordingly accounting for 79 4 4 63 and 98 8 5 93 of total ammonia and phosphorus removal these results in turn confirmed that microbial assimilation was the principal mechanism for the observed removal of toc n and p by microalgal bacterial granules to further determine the contributions of microalgae and bacteria to the observed removal of toc n and p the respective synthetic reactions for bacteria eq 2 and microalgae eq 3 were constructed as follows 2 5ch3coo 5o2 nh4 4h 5co2 8h2o c5h7o2n 3 5co2 0 6nh4 3 55h2o 5 875o2 0 6h c5h8 9o1 8n0 6 it appeared from fig 2 that about 49 of toc was removed through bacterial assimilation while 59 and 25 of nitrogen were removed by bacteria and microalgae respectively with the total nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 it had been reported that the phosphorus contents in bacteria and microalgae varied significantly in different species some microalgae especially cyanobacteria were able to synthesize poly p as the phosphorus reserve li and dittrich 2019 zhang et al 2015 as such the observed phosphorus removal in the microalgal bacterial granular sludge process could be attributed to both cellular synthesis and poly p accumulation 3 4 microbial community and functional genes analysis the microbial community analysis by pacbio s sequencing showed that the prokaryotic community had much higher abundance and richness than the eukaryotic community as indicated by alpha diversity indices table s1 detail information on phylum class order family genus and species levels was presented in fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3a pantanalinema rosaneae was the most abundant microalgal specie which was responsible for uptaking carbon dioxide and nutrients while producing oxygen through the photosynthetic reactions in fact the abundant pantanalinema rosaneae was in line with the growth of filamentous cyanobacteria observed in the outer layer of microalgal bacterial granules fig 4b the eukaryotic microalgae e g chlorophyta was also detected which mainly existed in the inner layer of microalgal bacterial granules helping to strengthen the granule structure and settleability arcila and buitrón 2017 tiron et al 2017 thauera phenylacetica was the most abundant bacterial specie found in microalgal bacterial granules in fact many heterotrophic bacteria that belonged to the genus of thauera were versatile for uptaking organic substrates thomsen et al 2007 moreover thauera is a well known denitrifier associated with almost all kinds of denitrifying functions e g hydrogen oxidizing autotrophic denitrification mao et al 2013 aerobic denitrification ji et al 2015 and partial denitrification du et al 2019 hence the observed heterotrophic nitrogen removal via n2 could be ascribed to thauera phenylacetica on the other hand fimbriimonas ginsengisoli was the second abundant bacteria which was strictly aerobic and could utilize various carbon sources im et al 2012 thus they might be responsible for the conversion of organic matters to co2 for microalgae as for phosphorus removal pantanalinema rosaneae was the main contributor followed by chlorophyta fig s2 evidenced the existence of poly p in filamentous cells of pantanalinema rosaneae indeed leptolyngbya the family of pantanalinema had the ability to accumulate poly p zhang et al 2015 in this study genes were categorized into three clusters by gene ontology go analysis i e biological process cellular component and molecular function cellular component related genes with the gene number of 50572 were found to be the most abundant accounting for 54 65 of the total genes indicating that assimilation reactions in microalgal bacterial granules were highly active further analysis by cazy annotation revealed that the carbohydrate or cod degradation related enzymes including glycosyl transferases glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate binding modules fig s3 were abundant in addition the abundance of genes related to ammonium transporter was high while genes related to ammonia oxidation were low fig 5 a relatively high amount of denitrification related genes e g nar nir nor and nos further confirmed the predominance of denitrifier i e thauera which was also supported by the above pacbio s sequencing analysis however due to the very low abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrification related genes e g amo and hao nitrite or nitrate could unlikely be produced in large as discussed above moreover the light would have an inhibitory effect on denitrification due to the photo oxidation of cytochrome c barak et al 1998 which is an intermediate electron carrier to denitrification enzymes ji et al 2015 hence nitrogen removal through nitrification denitrification appeared negligible in this study as for the functional genes for phosphorus removal a high abundance of polyphosphate kinase ppk gene sequence k00937 with a copy number of 2550 indicated that paos could play an essential role in the observed phosphorus removal in fact these results provided genetic support for microbial assimilation being the main removal pathways of organic matter n and p in microalgal bacterial granules this finding was different from previous reports in which nitrification and denitrification were supposed to be a main pathway of nitrogen removal abouhend et al 2018 arcila and buitrón 2017 based on the above analyses the working mechanisms of the microalgal bacterial granular sludge process were put forward for the observed removal of organic matter and nutrients the microalgal bacterial granules were found to have a microalgae abundant outer layer and a bacteria rich inner layer fig 4 along which the respective concentration gradients of oxygen carbon dioxide and nutrients were established as illustrated in fig 4a the green outer layer with abundant pantanalinema rosaneae was primarily responsible for photosynthesis with the production of oxygen meanwhile aerobic heterotrophic bacteria situated in the outer layer of granule e g fimbriimonas ginsengisoli could produce carbon dioxide for photosynthesis by pantanalinema rosaneae in the presence of organic matter fig 4b as such most cod n and p were utilized by different heterotrophic microorganisms in the granule while generating carbon dioxide for microalgae as discussed above nitrogen and phosphorus were mainly utilized through microbial assimilation while thauera phenylacetica and pantanalinema rosaneae could further contribute to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus via denitrification and poly p accumulation respectively 4 conclusions in this study an innovative microalgal bacterial granular sludge process was developed with the aim of improving energy efficiency while reducing greenhouse gas emissions for municipal wastewater treatment it was demonstrated that 92 69 96 84 and 87 16 of influent organics ammonia and phosphorus could be removed in this process respectively over a short time of 6 h without aeration such superior process performances could be attributed to the synergetic reactions between microalgae and bacteria co existing in microalgal bacterial granules the

17883,globally increasing concerns have been raised on the high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in conventional municipal wastewater treatment processes over the past decades in this study a self sustaining synergetic microalgal bacterial granular sludge process was thus developed to address these challenges the results showed that the microalgal bacterial granular sludge process was capable of removing 92 69 96 84 and 87 16 of influent organics ammonia and phosphorus under non aeration conditions over a short time of 6 h the effluent could meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards in many countries worldwide a tight synergetic interrelationship effect between microalgae and bacteria in granules was essential for such excellent process performance the stoichiometric and functional genes analyses further revealed that most of organic matter and nutrients were removed through microalgal and bacterial assimilations moreover it was found that there existed a desirable distribution of functional species of microalgae and bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules which appeared to be essential for the self sustaining synergetic reactions and stability of microalgal bacterial granules consequently this work may offer a promising engineering alternative with great potential to achieve energy efficient and environmentally sustainable municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment microalgal bacterial granules stoichiometric analysis synergistic reactions environmental sustainability 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has been developed for municipal wastewater treatment for more than 100 years van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however increasing critiques have been raised with respect to its high energy consumption and substantial greenhouse gas ghg emissions shahabadi et al 2009 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 it had been reported that nearly 3 4 of the national electricity i e 15 gw was consumed by wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the united states wang et al 2018 moreover as one of the largest ghg emitters wwtps contributed to about 0 77 gt co2 equivalent co2e in 2010 accounting for nearly 1 6 of global ghg emissions i e 49 gt co2e edenhofer 2015 while non co2 ghg e g methane and nitrous oxide were responsible for about 5 of global emissions li et al 2015 obviously the design and operation of current wastewater treatment processes appear to be against united nations sustainable development goals united nations 2015 the microalgal bacterial process has attracted increasing attention for its lower energy demand cost effectiveness and potential resource recovery olguín 2012 quijano et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 unlike the cas process microalgal bacterial process works on the self synchronized microalgal photosynthesis and bacterial respiration in this process microalgae can effectively assimilate carbon dioxide and nutrients to generate oxygen which is in turn utilized by bacteria for organics oxidation to produce carbon dioxide ramanan et al 2016 su et al 2011 i e less or even no external oxygen supply is needed as such microalgal bacterial process appears more energy efficient than the aerated cas process in which aeration can account for 40 60 of the total energy input of wwtps gikas 2017 luo et al 2019 cao 2011 on the other hand it has been widely accepted that microalgae are capable of capturing carbon dioxide to biomass laurens et al 2017 hepburn et al 2019 while produced biomass can be harvested as a feedstock for production of energy and high value substances e g biodiesel pigments and fertilizers hu et al 2017 quijano et al 2017 it appears that microalgal bacterial based technology can be reasonably considered as an alternative for environmentally sustainable wastewater treatment it should also be noted that biomass harvesting is still a bottleneck for microalgal bacterial process treating wastewater due to the poor settleability of biomass hu et al 2017 quijano et al 2017 moreover stable and reliable performance is difficult to achieve in microalgal bacterial process due to a long reaction time of days required arcila and buitrón 2017 and low nutrient removal efficiency of less than 50 70 abouhend et al 2018 huang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 in most microalgal bacterial processes aeration is still needed for improving the pollutants removal huang et al 2015 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 which actually compromises the benefit of this process therefore this study aimed to develop an innovative microalgal bacterial granular sludge process for municipal wastewater treatment it was shown that there existed a highly synergetic reaction between microalgae and bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules which was essential for achieving superior and stable removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus under non aerated condition the working mechanisms of the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process were further illustrated in terms of reaction stoichiometry microbial community and functional genes analyses it is expected that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process could offer a feasible engineering solution for achieving the energy efficient and environmentally sustainable municipal wastewater treatment while shedding light on future developmental direction of global wastewater industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater with the following composition was

synthetic wastewater described above were exposed to the light emitting diode led light at a photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd of 200 10 μ mol m2 s under aerobic conditions after one month of cultivation microalgal bacterial granules were gradually matured with a typical green color and an average size of 1 30 mm the harvested mature microalgal bacterial granules were used in subsequent experiments 2 3 experimental setup the experiments were conducted with mature microalgal bacterial granules in a glass reactor of 60 ml with a height diameter ratio of 2 equipped with a fiber optic

solution ph was measured by a thermo scientific orion star a111 ph meter 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of microalgal bacterial granular sludge process it was observed in fig 1 a that 92 69 0 84 of influent cod was removed with the effluent cod concentration of 18 32 2 09 mg l over 6 h concurrently 96 84 0 43 and 84 10 0 73 of influent nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were removed with average effluent concentrations being below 1 0 and 5 0 mg l respectively fig 1b and c while the total phosphorus tp concentration was reduced to 0 37 0 04 mg l corresponding to 87 16 1 32 of tp removal fig 1d obviously these performances achieved within 6 h were significantly superior to those reported in the literature abouhend et al 2018 arcila and buitrón 2017 huang et al 2015 moreover it should also be noted that the reaction time reported in previous studies was as long as 0 75 10 days vis à vis 6 h realized in this study on the other hand the nitrate and nitrite concentrations were found to be as low as 0 84 mg l and 0 40 mg l and the effluent turbidity fell into a range of 0 9 3 7 ntu these together clearly suggested that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process exhibited great potential for high efficient municipal wastewater treatment currently more and more stringent effluent discharge standards have been implemented in many countries due to increasing concern on public health and environmental risk for example the effluent discharge standards in china have been gradually migrated to class iv for effluent discharged to surface water bodies meeb 2012 meeb 2015 in view of water quality the effluent from the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process was able to meet the stringent discharge standards in many countries table 1 consequently it is reasonable to consider that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process can offer an alternative approach for current municipal wastewater treatment 3 2 synergistic algal bacterial reactions in microalgal bacterial granules in the microalgal bacterial granular sludge process do was generated by microalgae while utilized by aerobic bacteria i e do could serve as a key link between photosynthetic and heterotrophic reactions fig 1e showed the do concentration profile in one typical cycle which could be divided into do absent and do rich phases namely phase i and ii in phase i do concentration of nearly zero indeed reflected tightly coupled microalgal photosynthesis and bacterial respiration i e the oxygen produced by microalgae was fully utilized by bacteria which in turn produced carbon dioxide for microalgae in the microalgal bacterial granules the observed do accumulation in phase ii might be attributed to the continuous utilization of dissolved inorganic carbon in the culture media through microalgal photosynthesis with releasing of oxygen which could not be further consumed by bacteria after soluble organic carbon was exhausted in phase i as more than 90 of cod nh4 n tn and tp were removed in phase i while no methane and carbon dioxide could be detected in the gas phase this clearly suggested a strongly synergized phototrophic heterotrophic reaction realized by co existing microalgae and bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules in fact in such a biologically synergetic process aeration was no longer needed this in turn suggested that the aeration associated energy input could be totally saved equivalent to 40 60 of the total energy demand of wwtps gikas 2017 luo et al 2019 moreover as carbon dioxide generated from bio oxidation of soluble cod was fully utilized by microalgae in microalgal bacterial granules there would be no emission of carbon dioxide to the environment consequently it is reasonable to consider that the proposed microalgal bacterial granular sludge process would be more energy efficient and environmentally sustainable for treating municipal wastewater 3 3 stoichiometric analysis the elemental composition of microalgal bacterial granules was determined it was found that microalgal bacterial granules contained 49 65 of carbon 6 54 of hydrogen 25 39 of oxygen 9 62 of nitrogen and 1 30 of phosphorus by mass according to which the empirical formula of microalgal bacterial granules could be estimated to be c5h7 9o1 9n0 85p0 05 which indeed was found to be between the elemental compositions of microalgae and bacteria i e c5h8 9o1 8n0 6 for microalgae and c5h7o2n for mixed culture bacteria rittmann and mccarty 2012 furthermore according to the nitrogen balance the mass distribution of microalgae against bacteria in microalgal bacterial granules was determined to be around 3 5 as analyzed above an excellent synergy between microalgae and bacteria was successfully established in microalgal bacterial granules therefore it is reasonable to consider that the observed removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus by microalgal bacterial granules could be attributed to microbial assimilation instead of dissimilation as gaseous carbon dioxide and nitrogen were not detectable as the end metabolic products in the system according to the empirical formula of microalgal bacterial granules the overall microalgal bacterial assimilation reaction could be described as follows with acetate as an organic carbon source 1 50ch3coo 17nh4 h2po4

accordingly accounting for 79 4 4 63 and 98 8 5 93 of total ammonia and phosphorus removal these results in turn confirmed that microbial assimilation was the principal mechanism for the observed removal of toc n and p by microalgal bacterial granules to further determine the contributions of microalgae and bacteria to the observed removal of toc n and p the respective synthetic reactions for bacteria eq 2 and microalgae eq 3 were constructed as follows 2 5ch3coo 5o2 nh4 4h 5co2 8h2o c5h7o2n 3 5co2 0 6nh4 3 55h2o 5 875o2 0 6h c5h8 9o1 8n0 6 it appeared from fig 2 that about 49 of toc was removed through bacterial assimilation while 59 and 25 of nitrogen were removed by bacteria and microalgae respectively with the total nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 it had been reported that the

suggesting a difference in the chemical load depending on pellet history i e adsorbed contaminants for beached pellets vs additives for virgin pellets reports have underlined the importance to consider the diversity of chemicals used during plastic manufacturing and those adsorbed once plastics enter the environment all of which could play a role in toxicity the level of fishing and aquaculture activity is known to contribute significantly to the amount of plastic waste discharged into the ocean hinojosa and thiel 2009 w c li et al 2016a in french polynesia fp pearl oyster aquaculture is a specific source of plastics andréfouët et al 2014 indeed the economic decline of pearl farming in the 2000s left behind it the vestiges of intense activity as many concessions later closed and the associated rearing structures were abandoned added to this a common practice on operational pearl farms is to dispose of inoperative farming structures by scuttling them at the bottom of lagoons the inventory carried out by andréfouët et al 2014 in the lagoon of ahe fp where pearl oysters are cultured revealed large quantities of collectors ropes buoys and nylon ties all of these rearing structures essentially made of synthetic materials are accumulating over time in lagoons and may fragment and weather this situation is worsened by the semi enclosed environments of some of these lagoons which could favour mp accumulation andréfouët et al 2014 a recent laboratory experiment conducted by gardon et al 2018 highlighted the impact of commercial virgin micro ps polystyrene microbeads on energy balance and gametogenesis of the pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera and pointed out the need to differentiate physical and chemical effects so as to better understand the risk in order to go further estimating the effects of local scenario for coastal organisms will be necessary to assess risks here associated with the presence and ageing of pearl farming structures in polynesian lagoons experimental work is a first step which opens up questions on the field to ultimately alert and support decision in this study we conducted experiments to evaluate the toxicity of leachates obtained from new and aged plastic farming gear on embryo larval development of the pearl oyster p margaritifera focussing on non ingestion pathways and therefore the effects mediated through chemicals leaching into the water embryos of p margaritifera were exposed to leachates from spat collectors and synthetic rope two types of farming gear that oysters encounter in the field in this context we performed large scale chemical screening on the plastic gear and plastic leachates used for the toxicological assay in order to identify the major contaminants in fractions of both new

though the presence of plastic products with the leachate seems to be an important factor when assessing plastic toxicity nobre et al 2015 gandara e silva et al 2016 we used leachate alone in order to focus on chemical toxicity and avoid confounding factors in this experiment lithner et al 2009 2012 bejgarn et al 2015 an embryo toxicity test was performed according to the astm guideline e724 98

transformed by the arcsine square root function before statistical analysis normality and homoscedasticity were tested with shapiro wilk and levene s tests respectively data complying with the conditions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variance were analysed using a two way parametric anova to test the differences in variables between factors i e treatment and leachate concentration whenever necessary a tukey s post hoc test was used to determine the significant differences between the averages of each group when assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were not met we used the two way non parametric scheirer ray hare srh anova with interaction to avoid ranking comparison dunn s test was used on pooled factors in order to determine the significant

results performed on larval stages at 48 h are given in table s11 4 discussion 4 1 phthalates desorption from plastic gear leachate screening provided information on the chemicals associated with plastic collector and rope that desorbed into the surrounding media although some chemicals identified on these plastic samples appeared below the detection and or quantification limit pahs and additives were successfully quantified in leachates in addition to the detection and quantification of pcbs pesticides and pbdes levels of pahs pesticides pbdes and phthalates quantified in the control with no plastic gear added indicated an existing contamination of seawater employed in this experiment and or during sample preparation and chemical analyses laboratory plastic this result underline the difficulties of studying unknown and most of the time unidentifiable chemical composition of plastic leachates zimmermann et al 2019 indeed it is well recognised that minimizing external contamination by ubiquitous plasticizers and other chemicals is a real challenge in biomonitoring studies ye et al 2013 composition of natural seawater at global scale is subject to an irreversible modification by a multitude of organic pollutants at ultra trace levels dachs and méjanelle 2010 using quality control blanks or samples to assess potential contamination during analysis and the accuracy of measurements is difficult since their contamination is a quasi systematic phenomenon taylor 1981 fankhauser noti and grob 2007 besides anthropogenic organic chemicals introduced in the marine environment dachs and méjanelle 2010 several reports have investigated and pointed out potential sources of contamination such as indoor air alcock et al 1994 fankhauser noti and grob 2007 solvents including water reagents experimental apparatus and protection equipment for sample preparation in laboratory environment e g gloves sjödin et al 2004 ye et al 2013 thus because contamination affecting quality control samples cannot be avoided completely the concentration of samples should be adjusted by substracting the contribution from the quality control ye et al 2013 as we did here nonetheless we note that for some molecules the contamination should be present at least at the same concentration or above in the leachate treatments however the leachate results showed lower levels of pesticides except for a 120 pbdes and phthalates only for a 24 and a 120 than the control suggesting that we cannot exclude a potential adsorption of these chemicals by mps lee et al 2014 used for leachate preparation despite control contamination a real difference in chemical composition of new and aged plastic leachates was detected concerning pahs and pesticides families pahs such as benzo a pyrene bap chrysene and pesticides as σ and γ hexachlorocyclohexane hch chlorpyrifos and σ endosulfan were quantified in higher levels from 2 to 20 times higher in the a 120 treatment indicating a potential adsorption of these chemicals in the marine environment teuten et al 2009 lee et al 2014 furthermore additives especially phthalates represented the highest levels of quantified chemicals in leachates with a major part attributable to dmp and a lesser part to dep however their concentration levels are under estimated since the total phthalate concentration does not consider dbp deha and dehp i e the most abundant phthalates in plastic samples because they are ubiquitous laboratory contaminants fankhauser noti and grob 2007 comparing the concentrations of phthalates between leachates about 12 21 times more phthalates were leached from new than from aged plastic gear after 24 h 6681 and 539 ng l 1 respectively and 120 h 9077 and 430 ng l 1 respectively incubation regarding the results of plastic screenings phthalates were twice as abundant in new than in aged synthetic rope 282 and 108 μg g 1 respectively making a distinction between new and aged spat collectors 109 and 103 μg g 1 respectively suggesting a higher propensity for synthetic rope to leach into the surrounding environment similarly the higher load of some pahs and additives dbp deha and dehp irgafos 168 in the new synthetic rope compared with the aged one suggest a potential release of these compounds into seawater during their use in pearl farming lagoons hermabessiere et al 2017 this trend is less obvious concerning spat collector if we consider the difference in total additive concentration between new and aged farming gear as relative to what is leached into the surrounding environment we can consider an additive leaching of 6 3 μg g 1 and 184 μg g 1 from the spat collector and synthetic rope respectively this difference in leaching concentration highlights a difference in leaching properties of additives between the two main types of plastic used in pearl farming which is about 30 times greater from the synthetic rope pe than from the spat collector pp this divergence could be linked to the nature of polymer h x li et al 2016b and to the types and concentrations of additives themselves varying between polymers and between plastic gears further information on leaching properties was obtained from the assessment of leachates over time depending on the chemical compound we generally quantified higher levels in leachates after 120 h than after 24 h incubation for example results obtained on new leachates revealed a dmp concentration from 5000 to 7500 ng l 1 in n 24 and n 120 respectively similarly γ hch concentration in leachates from aged plastics varied from 2 2 to 29 7 ng l 1 in a 24 and a 120 respectively for sorption of chemicals onto plastic an increase over time was observed until equilibrium was reached at 24 48 h for some organic pollutants absorbed by pe floating in seawater bakir et al 2014a other studies determined a longer period from 200 h until more than 20 days to reach equilibration for organic pollutants being absorbed by pe and pp karapanagioti and klontza 2008 romera castillo et al 2018 in our study increasing chemical concentrations according to the leaching time of plastic suggest an enhanced desorption specific to compounds and physico chemical conditions bakir et al 2014b it would be interesting to conduct further experiments to assess the concentration of chemicals over a longer period of time weeks and months and obtain a standard range of desorption of these gears our chemical analyses support the complexity of studying the chemical aspects of plastic debris indeed the composition of plastic products is generally unknown since polymer manufacturers are not required to disclose the ingredients of their products bolgar et al 2015 it is also challenging to determine an exhaustive plastic composition by current analytical methodologies to assess their presence and amounts within plastics and associated leachates bolgar et al 2015 our work provides the first information about the chemical compounds associated with plastic gear used in pearl farming with 26 compounds identified as pahs and additives of which eight were leached particularly phthalates as with many plastic additives phthalates are not chemically bonded to the polymer matrix and are hence easily dissolved in water clara et al 2010 once released from the polymer matrix phthalates and other identified chemicals may become available for uptake by living organisms and could cause a range of effects such as endocrine disruption that may cause adverse reproductive and developmental effects teuten et al 2009 hermabessiere et al 2017 4 2 plastic leachates impair embryo larval development in the pearl oyster given these chemical analyses it is likely that the observed toxicity may be a result of the interaction of contaminants present in a complex mixture of chemicals leached from plastic gear compared to the control teuten et al 2009 engler 2012 the high percentage of mortality 90 100 occurring in embryos after 24 h exposure to leachates from new and aged farming gear at 100 g l 1 suggests a chemical toxicity of desorbed compounds embryo mortality was observed with the exposure of brown mussel embryos to leachate from beached pellets 0 2 ml of pellets ml 1 up to 100 dead or abnormal embryos gandara e silva et al 2016 in our data significant sub lethal effects appeared at lowest concentrations after 48 h exposure to n 24 59 at 10 g l 1 and n 120 60 86 at all leachate concentrations highlighting a higher toxicity from n 120 and more broadly from new plastic gear this difference in toxicity between leachates from new and aged plastic could be discussed regards to the difference in phthalate concentrations 6142 and 8647 ng l 1 in new plastic leachates after 24 h and 120 h incubation respectively some studies that assessed the toxicity of leachates from new plastic materials to aquatic organisms lithner et al 2009 2012 nobre et al 2015 bejgarn et al 2015 h x li et al 2016b gandara e silva et al 2016 corroborate the hypothesis that additives are responsible for the toxicity we observed on oyster embryo mortality for example nobre et al 2015 revealed higher anomalous embryonic development in the sea urchin lytechinus variegatus exposed to leachates from virgin pellets 66 5 than from beached pellets 4 8 an acute toxicity of leachates from 11 newly bought plastic products was also demonstrated on d magna causing mortality with a 48 h ec50 ranging from 2 to 235 g plastic l 1 lithner et al 2012 although the marked difference in toxicity between new and aged plastic leachates was likely caused by additives from the new plastic gear toxicity occurred in both types of plastic leachates and seems to be linked to specific compounds indeed significant impairment of p margaritifera embryo larval development was observed in a 24 and a 120 at 100 g l 1 compared with the control no effect while the latter had a concentration of phthalates five times higher i e 2314 ng l 1 than in a 24 and a 120 539 and 430 ng l 1 respectively this suggests that 1 such a concentration of phthalates does not necessarily lead to toxic effects at least here for the pearl oyster early life stages and or 2 that other compounds either as additives or adsorbed chemicals are responsible for the observed toxicity toxicity from new plastic leachates is likely due to plastic additives as these plastic gears had not been exposed to potential contaminants in situ in contrast to the aged ones for the aged gears the toxicity of their leachates seems to be linked to absorbed pahs and pesticides from the environment toxic compounds such as bap chrysene σ and γ hch chlorpyrifos and σ endosulfan fitzhugh et al 1964 paul et al 2013 menezes et al 2017 kopjar et al 2018 were present in smaller quantities down to completely absent in the control and leachates obtained from new plastics compared to aged ones for example bap is a priority pollutant ue 2008 us epa 2014 used as a reference pah in ecotoxicology banni et al 2017 bap can be found throughout the marine environment and has been reported to cause oxidative stress endocrine disruption and genotoxic effects in mussels gómez mendikute and cajaraville 2003 banni et al 2017 furthermore sauter and steele 1972 also demonstrated that γ hch 1 0 and 10 ppm in feed a widely used organochlorine pesticide significantly reduced hatchability egg shell thickness and production and increased embryonic mortality in the chicken thus the presence of bap and hchs in aged plastic leachates may have among other contaminants contributed to the alteration of the embryo larval development in the pearl oyster however hchs were also reported to have hormesis effect as demonstrated with α hch a biproduct in the manufacture of γ hch when given at a low dose can protect against dna damage and cytotoxic effects induced by subsequent exposures at a much higher dose fukushima et al 2005 the theory of hormesis has been defined as a dose response relationship in which there is biological activation at low doses but an inhibition at high doses and vice versa calabrese 2002 interestingly the presence of γ hch in aged leachates ranging from 2 2 to 29 7 ng l 1 especially in a 120 20 times greater than n 24 and n 120 could have led to hormesis type effect on embryo development as observed with complex variation between conditions slightly higher in aged 91 97 from both a 24 and a 120 than in new 62 82 from both n 24 and n 120 plastic leachates at 0 1 1 and 10 g l 1 the control being intermediate 83 this trend is similar to the in vitro embryo development in mouse showing a slightly higher number of intact embryos and blastocystes after an exposition to γ hch at 3 6 μg ml 1 compared to control before a significant dose dependent decrease at 7 2 14 5 and 29 μg ml 1 alm et al 1996 in our study this hormesis hypothesis may explain the rapid development of trocophore larvae to d stage occurred in a 120 at 100 g l 1 furthermore the polymer nature of plastic gear also seems to play an important role in the toxicity we observed and has been demonstrated in previous studies lithner et al 2012 observed that leachate from new consumer products made of pp showed no toxicity to d magna while leachate from pe gear appeared toxic 48 h ec50 at 17 24 g of plastic l 1 similarly h x li et al 2016b observed that the leachates from pp showed low toxicity to the barnacle a amphitrite with a low effect on both larval survival 87 97 and settlement 10 28 but pe was more toxic 77 96 and 0 4 respectively to this species in our study synthetic rope made of pe and additives measured in leachates that seemed essentially to be coming from it could be the major source of the toxicity we observed it would therefore be interesting to further assess the toxicity of leachates from synthetic rope pe and spat collector pp separately so as to be able to dissociate the toxicities associated to each plastic type overall toxicity assessment could be improved by individually testing identified chemicals at the measured concentrations on pearl oyster embryos in order to be able to dissociate singular implication of analytes in the toxicity we observed types of gear and polymer play therefore a major role in toxicity demphasizing the needs of testing plastics that animals mostly encounter in the wild as we did here 4 3 environmental implications in pearl farming lagoons our work adds further information to the growing literature on the toxicity of plastics to aquatic organisms especially through their associated leachates dissolved in seawater we demonstrated experimentally that plastic pearl farming gear can impair embryonic development in the pearl oyster and it should be considered in an environmental context that synthetic ropes and spat collectors come into close contact with early life stage of p margaritifera as a consequence of plastic accumulation in pearl farming lagoons leaching chemicals especially additives could represent an increasing ecotoxicological risk for marine organisms hermabessiere et al 2017 although much higher desorption times are expected for plastic farming gear in farming atolls this in vitro study revealed high toxicity of leachates from both new and aged farming gears on embryo larval development of p margaratifera as higher leaching times may likely release wider variety and higher quantity of toxic chemicals at least for aged platics there is a need to assess deeply effects and extend this question to productive polynesian lagoons therefore even if chemical analyses and concentrations of leachates tested may be difficult to interpret from an ecological point of view the screening of plastics provides relevant toxicity information considering the very limited concentrations of phthalates in aged plastic leachates and the relatively short time of desorption tested here our study shows their non covalent association with the polymer matrix and therefore their potentially important desorption into seawater and natural environment in the venda region of south africa it was shown that plastic pollution caused river water pollution by phthalates at levels ranging from 0 16 to 10 17 mg l 1 fatoki et al 2010 given the increase of both operational and derelict farming gear in pearl farming lagoons their accumulation could lead to a significant contamination by additives including phthalates considering a 200 m long collecting station rearing line composed of spat collectors 39 kg and synthetic ropes 135 kg our estimated leaching of phthalates i e 6 3 μg g 1 and 184 μg g 1 respectively can hypothesized that a collecting station may release at least 25 g of phthalates during its use about 3 5 years indeed it would have been relevant to know the age of the aged plastics used here to refine this estimate the curve of desorption over time and the environmental factors knowing that aging is driven by many environmental factors extrapolating these data to the semi enclosed lagoon of takapoto 14 37 39 s 145 12 18 w fp containing approximately 562 tons of rearing lines may represent 80 kg of potentially leached and or leachable phthalates excluding leaching from other plastic gear such as buoys nylon ties grids and baskets i e a phthalates contamination of 60 ng l 1 considering the volume of the lagoon i e 1 4 km3 rougerie 1979 compared to our experiment this overall assessment would amount to a mean leachate concentration ranging from 0 1 to 1 g l 1 however the toxic hazard associated with the leaching of phthalates should be considered contaminated hotspots indeed despite progressive leaching seawater dilution and potential photo and biodegradation over time on the lagoon scale future research should perform chemical analyses of in situ seawater using passive sensors to identify chronic contamination in a relevant and practical way and test if accumulation areas of derelict plastic gear and rearing areas are becoming hotspots of phthalate desorption our results wholly suggest that the plastic gear used in the pearl farming industry could release significant amounts of hazardous chemicals that may affect steps of pearl oyster reproduction especially oyster spat settlement 5 conclusion this in vitro study shows that p margaritifera embryo larval development is affected by plastic leachates obtained from plastic pearl farming gear that are closely interrelated with the early life stages of the pearl oyster operational and derelict areas of pearl farming activity might be hotspots of chemicals raising the question of in situ effects on cultivated oysters and other organisms on a more global scale the present study may alarm on the possible deleterious effects of aquaculture and fishing gears on marine life highlighting the need to give greater consideration to the end of life of plastic materials used at sea it represents a preliminary step to evaluate the impact of mps from plastic pearl farming gear on the pearl oyster considering the biological changes caused by the mps per se chemicals incorporated into onto the mps or both declaration

environment accumulates with potentially detrimental effects on the lagoon ecosystem and pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera a species of ecological commercial and social value here we tested the effects of leachates from new n and aged a plastic pearl farming gear spat collector and synthetic rope obtained after 24 h and 120 h incubation on the embryo larval development of the pearl oyster using an in vitro assay embryos were exposed for 24 h and 48 h to a negative control 0 and the leachate from 0 1 1 10 and 100 g of plastic l 1 after 24 h exposure to leachate at 100 g l 1 effects were observed on embryo development 38 to 60 of formed larvae and mortality 72 to 82 chemical analyses of plastic gear indicated the presence of 26 compounds consisting of organic contaminants pahs and additives mainly phthalates screening of leachates demonstrated that these compounds leach into the surrounding seawater with an additional detection of pesticides higher levels of phthalates were measured in leachates obtained from new 6 7 9 1 μg l 1 than from aged 0 4 0 5 μg l 1 plastics which could be part of the explanation of the clear difference in toxicity observed after 48 h exposure at lower concentrations 0 1 10 g l 1 associated with mortality ranging from 26 to 86 and 17 28 respectively overall this study suggests that plastic gear used in the pearl farming industry releases

suggesting a difference in the chemical load depending on pellet history i e adsorbed contaminants for beached pellets vs additives for virgin pellets reports have underlined the importance to consider the diversity of chemicals used during plastic manufacturing and those adsorbed once plastics enter the environment all of which could play a role in toxicity the level of fishing and aquaculture activity is known to contribute significantly to the amount of plastic waste discharged into the ocean hinojosa and thiel 2009 w c li et al 2016a in french polynesia fp pearl oyster aquaculture is a specific source of plastics andréfouët et al 2014 indeed the economic decline of pearl farming in the 2000s left behind it the vestiges of intense activity as many concessions later closed and the associated rearing structures were abandoned added to this a common practice on operational pearl farms is to dispose of inoperative farming structures by scuttling them at the bottom of lagoons the inventory carried out by andréfouët et al 2014 in the lagoon of ahe fp where pearl oysters are cultured revealed large quantities of collectors ropes buoys and nylon ties all of these rearing structures essentially made of synthetic materials are accumulating over time in lagoons and may fragment and weather this situation is worsened by the semi enclosed environments of some of these lagoons which could favour mp accumulation andréfouët et al 2014 a recent laboratory experiment conducted by gardon et al 2018 highlighted the impact of commercial virgin micro ps polystyrene microbeads on energy balance and gametogenesis of the pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera and pointed out the need to differentiate physical and chemical effects so as to better understand the risk in order to go further estimating the effects of local scenario for coastal organisms will be necessary to assess risks here associated with the presence and ageing of pearl farming structures in polynesian lagoons experimental work is a first step which opens up questions on the field to ultimately alert and support decision in this study we conducted experiments to evaluate the toxicity of leachates obtained from new and aged plastic farming gear on embryo larval development of the pearl oyster p margaritifera focussing on non ingestion pathways and therefore the effects mediated through chemicals leaching into the water embryos of p margaritifera were exposed to leachates from spat collectors and synthetic rope two types of farming gear that oysters encounter in the field in this context we performed large scale chemical screening on the plastic gear and plastic leachates used for the toxicological assay in order to identify the major contaminants in fractions of both new and aged gear 2 materials and methods 2 1 plastic selection based on andréfouët et al 2014 our study focused on the most abundant plastic debris collected in fp pearl farming atoll lagoons

results performed on larval stages at 48 h are given in table s11 4 discussion 4 1 phthalates desorption from plastic gear leachate screening provided information on the chemicals associated with plastic collector and rope that desorbed into the surrounding media although some chemicals identified on these plastic samples appeared below the detection and or quantification limit pahs and additives were successfully quantified in leachates in addition to the detection and quantification of pcbs pesticides and pbdes levels of pahs pesticides pbdes and phthalates quantified in the control with no plastic gear added indicated an existing contamination of seawater employed in this experiment and or during sample preparation and chemical analyses laboratory plastic this result underline the difficulties of studying unknown and most of the time unidentifiable chemical composition of plastic leachates zimmermann et al 2019 indeed it is well recognised that minimizing external contamination by ubiquitous plasticizers and other chemicals is a real challenge in biomonitoring studies ye et al 2013 composition of natural seawater at global scale is subject to an irreversible modification by a multitude of organic pollutants at ultra trace levels dachs and méjanelle 2010 using quality control blanks or samples to assess potential contamination during analysis and the accuracy of measurements is difficult since their contamination is a quasi systematic phenomenon taylor 1981 fankhauser noti and grob 2007 besides anthropogenic organic chemicals introduced in the marine environment dachs and méjanelle 2010 several reports have investigated and pointed out potential sources of contamination such as indoor air alcock et al 1994 fankhauser noti and grob 2007 solvents including water reagents experimental apparatus and protection equipment for sample preparation in laboratory environment e g gloves sjödin et al 2004 ye et al 2013 thus because contamination affecting quality control samples cannot be avoided completely the concentration of samples should be adjusted by substracting the contribution from the quality control ye et al 2013 as we did here nonetheless we note that for some molecules the contamination should be present at least at the same concentration or above in the leachate treatments however the leachate results showed lower levels of pesticides except for a 120 pbdes and phthalates only for a 24 and a 120 than the control suggesting that we cannot exclude a potential adsorption of these chemicals by mps lee et al 2014 used for leachate preparation despite control contamination a real difference in chemical composition of new and aged plastic leachates was detected concerning pahs and pesticides families pahs such as benzo a pyrene bap chrysene and pesticides as σ and γ hexachlorocyclohexane hch chlorpyrifos and σ endosulfan were quantified in higher levels from 2 to 20 times higher in the a 120 treatment indicating a potential adsorption of these chemicals in the marine environment teuten et al 2009 lee et al 2014 furthermore additives especially phthalates represented the highest levels of quantified chemicals in leachates with a major part attributable to dmp and a lesser part to dep however their concentration levels are under estimated since the total phthalate concentration does not consider dbp deha and dehp i e the most abundant phthalates in plastic samples because they are ubiquitous laboratory contaminants fankhauser noti and grob 2007 comparing the concentrations of phthalates between leachates about 12 21 times more phthalates were leached from new than from aged plastic gear after 24 h 6681 and 539 ng l 1 respectively and 120 h 9077 and 430 ng l 1 respectively incubation regarding the results of plastic screenings phthalates were twice as abundant in new than in aged synthetic rope 282 and 108 μg g 1 respectively making a distinction between new and aged spat collectors 109 and 103 μg g 1 respectively suggesting a higher propensity for synthetic rope to leach into the surrounding environment similarly the higher load of some pahs and additives dbp deha and dehp irgafos 168 in the new synthetic rope compared with the aged one suggest a potential release of these compounds into seawater during their use in pearl farming lagoons hermabessiere et al 2017 this trend is less obvious concerning spat collector if we consider the difference in total additive concentration between new and aged farming gear as relative to what is leached into the surrounding environment we can consider an additive leaching of 6 3 μg g 1 and 184 μg g 1 from the spat collector and synthetic rope respectively this difference in leaching concentration highlights a difference in leaching properties of additives between the two main types of plastic used in pearl farming which is about 30 times greater from the synthetic rope pe than from the spat collector pp this divergence could be linked to the nature of polymer h x li et al 2016b and to the types and concentrations of additives themselves varying between polymers and between plastic gears further information on leaching properties was obtained from the assessment of leachates over time depending on the chemical compound we generally quantified higher levels in leachates after 120 h than after 24 h incubation for example results obtained on new leachates revealed a dmp concentration from 5000 to 7500 ng l 1 in n 24 and n 120 respectively similarly γ hch concentration in leachates from aged plastics varied from 2 2 to 29 7 ng l 1 in a 24 and a 120 respectively for sorption of chemicals onto plastic an increase over time was observed until equilibrium was reached at 24 48 h for some organic pollutants absorbed by pe floating in seawater bakir et al 2014a other studies determined a longer period from 200 h until more than 20 days to reach equilibration for organic pollutants being absorbed by pe and pp karapanagioti and klontza 2008 romera castillo et al 2018 in our study increasing chemical concentrations according to the leaching time of plastic suggest an enhanced desorption specific to compounds and physico chemical conditions bakir et al 2014b it would be interesting to conduct further experiments to assess the concentration of chemicals over a longer period of time weeks and months and obtain a standard range of desorption of these gears our chemical analyses support the complexity of studying the chemical aspects of plastic debris indeed the composition of plastic products is generally unknown since polymer manufacturers are not required to disclose the ingredients of their products bolgar et al 2015 it is also challenging to determine an exhaustive plastic composition by current analytical methodologies to assess their presence and amounts within plastics and associated leachates bolgar et al 2015 our work provides the first information about the chemical compounds associated with plastic gear used in pearl farming with 26 compounds identified as pahs and additives of which eight were leached particularly phthalates as with many plastic additives phthalates are not chemically bonded to the polymer matrix and are hence easily dissolved in water clara et al 2010 once released from the polymer matrix phthalates and other identified chemicals may become available for uptake by living organisms and could cause a range of effects such as endocrine disruption that may cause adverse reproductive and developmental effects teuten et al 2009 hermabessiere et al 2017 4 2 plastic leachates impair embryo larval development in the pearl oyster given these chemical analyses it is likely that the observed toxicity may be a result of the interaction of contaminants present in a complex mixture of chemicals leached from plastic gear compared to the control teuten et al 2009 engler 2012 the high percentage of mortality 90 100 occurring in embryos after 24 h exposure to leachates from new and aged farming gear at 100 g l 1 suggests a chemical toxicity of desorbed compounds embryo mortality was observed with the exposure of brown mussel embryos to leachate from beached pellets 0 2 ml of pellets ml 1 up to 100 dead or abnormal embryos gandara e silva et al 2016 in our data significant sub lethal effects appeared at lowest concentrations after 48 h exposure to n 24 59 at 10 g l 1 and n 120 60 86 at all leachate concentrations highlighting a higher toxicity from n 120 and more broadly from new plastic gear this difference in toxicity between leachates from new and aged plastic could be discussed regards to the difference in phthalate concentrations 6142 and 8647 ng l 1 in new plastic leachates after 24 h and 120 h incubation respectively some studies that assessed the toxicity of leachates from new plastic materials to aquatic organisms lithner et al 2009 2012 nobre et al 2015 bejgarn et al 2015 h x li et al 2016b gandara e silva et al 2016 corroborate the hypothesis that additives are responsible for the toxicity we observed on oyster embryo mortality for example nobre et al 2015 revealed higher anomalous embryonic development in the sea urchin lytechinus variegatus exposed to leachates from virgin pellets 66 5 than from beached pellets 4 8 an acute toxicity of leachates from 11 newly bought plastic products was also demonstrated on d magna causing mortality with a 48 h ec50 ranging from 2 to 235 g plastic l 1 lithner et al 2012 although the marked difference in toxicity between new and aged plastic leachates was likely caused by additives from the new plastic gear toxicity occurred in both types of plastic leachates and seems to be linked to specific compounds indeed significant impairment of p margaritifera embryo larval development was observed in a 24 and a 120 at 100 g l 1 compared with the control no effect while the latter had a concentration of phthalates five times higher i e 2314 ng l 1 than in a 24 and a 120 539 and 430 ng l 1 respectively this suggests that 1 such a concentration of phthalates does not necessarily lead to toxic effects at least here for the pearl oyster early life stages and or 2 that other compounds either as additives or adsorbed chemicals are responsible for the observed toxicity toxicity from new plastic leachates is likely due to plastic additives as these plastic gears had not been exposed to potential contaminants in situ in contrast to the aged ones for the aged gears the toxicity of their leachates seems to be linked to absorbed pahs and pesticides from the environment toxic compounds such as bap chrysene σ and γ hch chlorpyrifos and σ endosulfan fitzhugh et al 1964 paul et al 2013 menezes et al 2017 kopjar et al 2018 were present in smaller quantities down to completely absent in the control and leachates obtained from new plastics compared to aged ones for example bap is a priority pollutant ue 2008 us epa 2014 used as a reference pah in ecotoxicology banni et al 2017 bap can be found throughout the marine environment and has been reported to cause oxidative stress endocrine disruption and genotoxic effects in mussels gómez mendikute and cajaraville 2003 banni et al 2017 furthermore sauter and steele 1972 also demonstrated that γ hch 1 0 and 10 ppm in feed a widely used organochlorine pesticide significantly reduced hatchability egg shell thickness and production and increased embryonic mortality in the chicken thus the presence of bap and hchs in aged plastic leachates may have among other contaminants contributed to the alteration of the embryo larval development in the pearl oyster however hchs were also reported to have hormesis effect as demonstrated with α hch a biproduct in the manufacture of γ hch when given at a low dose can protect against dna damage and cytotoxic effects induced by subsequent exposures at a much higher dose fukushima et al 2005 the theory of hormesis has been defined as a dose response relationship in which there is biological activation at low doses but an inhibition at high doses and vice versa calabrese 2002 interestingly the presence of γ hch in aged leachates ranging from 2 2 to 29 7 ng l 1 especially in a 120 20 times greater than n 24 and n 120 could have led to hormesis type effect on embryo development as observed with complex variation between conditions slightly higher in aged 91 97 from both a 24 and a 120 than in new 62 82 from both n 24 and n 120 plastic leachates at 0 1 1 and 10 g l 1 the control being intermediate 83 this trend is similar to the in vitro embryo development in mouse showing a slightly higher number of intact embryos and blastocystes after an exposition to γ hch at 3 6 μg ml 1 compared to control before a significant dose dependent decrease at 7 2 14 5 and 29 μg ml 1 alm et al 1996 in our study this hormesis hypothesis may explain the rapid development of trocophore larvae to d stage occurred in a 120 at 100 g l 1 furthermore the polymer nature of plastic gear also seems to play an important role in the toxicity we observed and has been demonstrated in previous studies lithner et al 2012 observed that leachate from new consumer products made of pp showed no toxicity to d magna while leachate from pe gear appeared toxic 48 h ec50 at 17 24 g of plastic l 1 similarly h x li et al 2016b observed that the leachates from pp showed low toxicity to the barnacle a amphitrite with a low effect on both larval survival 87 97 and settlement 10 28 but pe was more toxic 77 96 and 0 4 respectively to this species in our study synthetic rope made of pe and additives measured in leachates that seemed essentially to be coming from it could be the major source of the toxicity we observed it would therefore be interesting to further assess the toxicity of leachates from synthetic rope pe and spat collector pp separately so as to be able to dissociate the toxicities associated to each plastic type overall toxicity assessment could be improved by individually testing identified chemicals at the measured concentrations on pearl oyster embryos in order to be able to dissociate singular implication of analytes in the toxicity we observed types of gear and polymer play therefore a major role in toxicity demphasizing the needs of testing plastics that animals mostly encounter in the wild as we did here 4 3 environmental implications in pearl farming lagoons our work adds further information to the growing literature on the toxicity of plastics to aquatic organisms especially through their associated leachates dissolved in seawater we demonstrated experimentally that plastic pearl farming gear can impair embryonic development in the pearl oyster and it should be considered in an environmental context that synthetic ropes and spat collectors come into close contact with early life stage of p margaritifera as a consequence of plastic accumulation in pearl farming lagoons leaching chemicals especially additives could represent an increasing ecotoxicological risk for marine organisms hermabessiere et al 2017 although much higher desorption times are expected for plastic farming gear in farming atolls this in vitro study revealed high toxicity of leachates from both new and aged farming gears on embryo larval development of p margaratifera as higher leaching times may likely release wider variety and higher quantity of toxic chemicals at least for aged platics there is a need to assess deeply effects and extend this question to productive polynesian lagoons therefore even if chemical analyses and concentrations of leachates tested may be difficult to interpret from an ecological point of view the screening of plastics provides relevant toxicity information considering the very limited concentrations of phthalates in aged plastic leachates and the relatively short time of desorption tested here our study shows their non covalent association with the polymer matrix and therefore their potentially important desorption into seawater and natural environment in the venda region of south africa it was shown that plastic pollution caused river water pollution by phthalates at levels ranging from 0 16 to 10 17 mg l 1 fatoki et al 2010 given the increase of both operational and derelict farming gear in pearl farming lagoons their accumulation could lead to a significant contamination by additives including phthalates considering a 200 m long collecting station rearing line composed of spat collectors 39 kg and synthetic ropes 135 kg our estimated leaching of phthalates i e 6 3 μg g 1 and 184 μg g 1 respectively can hypothesized that a collecting station may release at least 25 g of phthalates during its use about 3 5 years indeed it would have been relevant to know the age of the aged plastics used here to refine this estimate the curve of desorption over time and the environmental factors knowing that aging is driven by many environmental factors extrapolating these data to the semi enclosed lagoon of takapoto 14 37 39 s 145 12 18 w fp containing approximately 562 tons of rearing lines may represent 80 kg of potentially leached and or leachable phthalates excluding leaching from other plastic gear such as buoys nylon ties grids and baskets i e a phthalates contamination of 60 ng l 1 considering the volume of the lagoon i e 1 4 km3 rougerie 1979 compared to our experiment this overall assessment would amount to a mean leachate concentration ranging from 0 1 to 1 g l 1 however the toxic hazard associated with the leaching of phthalates should be considered contaminated hotspots indeed despite progressive leaching seawater dilution and potential photo and biodegradation over time on the lagoon scale future research should perform chemical analyses of in situ seawater using passive sensors to identify chronic contamination in a relevant and practical way and test if accumulation areas of derelict plastic gear and rearing areas are becoming hotspots of phthalate desorption our results wholly suggest that the plastic gear used in the pearl farming industry could release significant amounts of hazardous chemicals that may affect steps of pearl oyster reproduction especially oyster spat settlement 5 conclusion this in vitro study shows that p margaritifera embryo larval development is affected by plastic leachates obtained from plastic pearl farming gear that are closely interrelated with the early life stages of the pearl oyster operational and derelict areas of pearl farming activity might be hotspots of chemicals raising the question of in situ effects on cultivated oysters and other organisms on a more global scale the present study may alarm on the possible deleterious effects of aquaculture and fishing gears on marine life highlighting the need to give greater consideration to the end of life of plastic materials used at sea it represents a preliminary step to evaluate the impact of mps from plastic pearl farming gear on the pearl oyster considering the biological changes caused by the mps per se chemicals incorporated into onto the mps or both declaration
