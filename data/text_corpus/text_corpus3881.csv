19405,some pharmaceutical conjugates can be excreted into wastewaters at levels rivalling those of the parent compounds however little is known about this potential reservoir of pharmaceuticals to aquatic systems we evaluated the occurrence and distribution of four different classes of pharmaceuticals and their metabolite conjugates in a wastewater treatment plant over four months aqueous and suspended solids fractions of primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent along with return activated sludge and waste activated sludge were assessed the only conjugate not found in the final effluent was acetaminophen sulfate moreover thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide were the only compounds quantified in the suspended solids in the final effluent propranolol propranolol sulfate thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide all had no significant decreases in concentration going through the wastewater treatment process from primary to final effluent however there were significant decreases observed for acetaminophen 99 8 sulfamethoxazole 71 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole 59 and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide 79 the mean sem mass loadings in the aqueous fraction of the final effluent for each compound ranged from 0 84 0 2 g d for thyroxine to 45 3 4 2 g d for acetaminophen at least as much conjugate was released into receiving waters if not more 1 6 0 2 g d for thyroxine glucuronide to 18 5 4 5 g d for sulfamethoxazole glucuronide and 61 2 9 6 g d for n acetyl sulfamethoxazole additionally the mean loading of thyroxine was 0 29 0 025 g day and thyroxine glucuronide 1 8 0 59 g day in the suspended solids this equates to 26 of total thyroxine and 53 of total thyroxine glucuronide associated with suspended particulate matter that reaches receiving waters this study reflects the importance of including phase ii conjugates in assessing overall compound load of pharmaceutical discharge from wastewaters and also that substantial amounts of such contaminants are associated with wastewater solids when drugs are in the pg l to μg l range keywords pharmaceutical metabolite conjugate wastewater treatment plant thyroid hormone beta blocker sulfonamide 1 introduction various transformation processes can occur within the body that change ingested pharmaceuticals into a more water soluble form in preparation for excretion the extent of pharmaceutical biotransformation is dependent on various epigenetic factors of individuals by phase i endogenous monooxygenases and mixed function cytochrome p 450 enzymes into more hydrophilic excretory products subsequent to this various enzymes e g udp glucuronosyl transferase nakanishi et al 2012 and sulfotransferase alherz et al 2017 can attach hydrophilic moieties such as glucuronic acid sulfate and acetyl groups hays 2009 walle et al 1985 wang and gardinali 2014 to phase i products to create phase ii conjugates excreted drugs both unchanged and biotransformed enter wastewater treatment facilities where the effects of various treatment processes could attenuate or augment their respective concentrations as well bonvin et al 2013 hamid and eskicioglu 2012 kumar et al 2012 noedler et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 until recently environmental quantitation of drugs was typically concerned with their unchanged state i e parent compound and some various phase i metabolites however simultaneous quantitation of a more thorough picture of both parent and conjugated forms across multiple classes of drugs has generally not been conducted with the noted exceptions of estrogens d ascenzo et al 2003 hutchins et al 2007 reddy et al 2005 tso and aga 2010 androgens badoud et al 2011 jantti et al 2010 and recent work on lamotrigine and its glucuronide bollmann et al 2016 zonja et al 2016 it is possible that significant amounts of pharmaceutical conjugates rivalling or even exceeding the parent compounds are surviving wastewater treatment in both the aqueous and suspended solid phases and directly entering receiving waters bollmann et al 2016 brown and wong 2016 subedi and kannan 2014 svahn and bjorklund 2015 zonja et al 2016 sorption to both suspended particulate martinez hernandez et al 2016 and dissolved organic matter guo et al 2017 martinez hernandez et al 2014 svahn and bjorklund 2015 could contribute to the environmental persistence of metabolite conjugates moreover chemical sorption to solids has been considered to be a major factor in the protection from various biotic and abiotic transformation mechanisms e g photolysis hydrolysis polesel et al 2016 schwarzenbach 2003 although conjugates are presumed to be quite hydrophilic based on lesser log kow values complexations and or hydrophobic interactions can occur that necessitate quantitation of conjugates in the solid phase thus it is important to quantify drugs and conjugates in the solid phase that could potentially desorb in the environment and elicit toxic effects on non target organisms toxicological effects on non target organisms could arise either directly by exposure to the conjugate majewsky et al 2014 or indirectly via deconjugation back into the parent drug by microbial enzymes e g glucuronidases sulfatases derived from the microflora resident in the human gut and by those found within the wastewater treatment process kumar et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 zonja et al 2016 hydrolysis of these conjugates is mainly governed by ph and temperature of the surroundings in addition to the nature of the bond between the conjugated moiety and the parent compound sanchez and kauffman 2010 e g glucuronidation to a phenolic or aliphatic hydroxide vs carboxylic acid shipkova et al 2003 the persistence of parent drugs through the wastewater treatment process is compound specific baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 brown et al 2015 lajeunesse et al 2012 metcalfe et al 2010 polesel et al 2016 sabourin et al 2009 and it is plausible that the persistence of conjugates may be also brown and wong 2016 zonja et al 2016 the compounds in this study were chosen based on the high usage of the parent pharmaceutical and the potential for conjugate persistence based on their structures thus there is sufficient evidence that significant masses of labile potentially toxic conjugates are surviving wastewater treatment and are not being considered in monitoring or risk assessment analyses however data is lacking the aim of this study was to use developed analytical frameworks in both aqueous brown and wong 2016 and solid phases brown and wong 2017 for the extraction and quantitation of drugs and their respective major conjugates and determine their distribution within a major municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp we hypothesise that significant compound specific levels of conjugates would be present in the primary clarifier and that microbial activity during wastewater treatment would change the concentrations brown and wong 2017 and relative proportions of both parent and conjugate compounds we also provide an assessment of the mass loadings within the final effluent to estimate the amount reaching major surface waters receiving

them in the water fractions throughout the treatment plant across all four classes of pharmaceuticals three separate trends became evident first acetaminophen compounds showed significant differences after the primary clarifier 99 8 change in concentration second propranolol and thyroxine compounds showed no significant difference throughout the wwtp process third sulfamethoxazole compounds showed a moderate significant difference 59 79 from primary to final effluent 3 1 1 rapid concentration decreases of acetaminophen compounds in the first trend acetaminophen fig 1 a showed a dramatic significant difference from primary to mixed liquor p 0 0001 from a mean of 186 to 0 51 μg l subsequently there was no significant change between mixed liquor secondary and final effluent means of 0 51 0 39 and 0 32 μg l respectively acetaminophen sulfate fig 1a also showed significant differences from primary to mixed liquor p 0 0001 with means from 83 7 μg l to loq for all subsequent stages of treatment these observations indicate both acetaminophen and acetaminophen sulfate are sufficiently labile such that aerobic biodegradation was most likely a major mechanism for removal of these chemicals aymerich et al 2016 krah et al 2016 overall a 99 8 decrease in acetaminophen concentrations was observed from primary to final effluent petrie et al 2016 also reported 99 removal from crude to final effluent with concentrations of 138 and 1 5 μg l respectively in agreement with our findings 3 1 2 no decrease in concentrations of propranolol and thyroxine compounds in the second trend both propranolol and propranolol sulfate fig 1b showed no significant difference throughout the treatment process 4 hydroxypropranolol is a major human metabolite for propranolol brown and wong 2016 partani et al 2009 and as such it is most likely expected to yield phase ii conjugates propranolol sulfate and 4 hydroxypropranolol glucuronide walle et al 1985 levels of propranolol throughout the wwtp were 0 038 0 045 0 042 and 0 041 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively propranolol concentrations have been reported within wwtps to range from 0 001 to 0 5 μg l brown et al 2015 subedi and kannan 2015 our propranolol concentrations are also consistent within a factor of three and with similar resistance to removal with those of petrie et al 2016 who reported primary and final effluent concentrations of 0 12 μg l in both stages of treatment maurer et al 2007 reviewed 43 german wwtp occurrences of propranolol and reported varying concentrations found in both influent and effluent waters with concentrations varying from 0 010 to 0 17 μg l nevertheless our results are within that range moreover those authors demonstrated highly variable removal rates of propranolol ranging from 0 to 96 maurer et al 2007 levels of propranolol sulfate in our current study were 0 048 0 030 0 041 and 0 040 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively considering this sole sulfate conjugate alone the total concentration of propranolol species analysed throughout the wwtp and of those entering receiving waters is effectively doubled this is a minimum calculation and excludes metabolites and conjugates for which we had no authentic standards and did not quantify thus conjugates can make up a significant reservoir of drugs in the wastewater environment and by extension the aquatic environment to which wastewaters discharge conjugates surviving wastewater treatment is consistent with previous findings of estrogen conjugates at comparable proportions to their parent compounds as propranolol sulfate in the present study bollmann et al 2016 brown and wong 2015 d ascenzo et al 2003 hutchins et al 2007 shrestha et al 2012 zonja et al 2016 moreover lamotrigine glucuronide has been seen at concentrations up to 50 times that of the parent during wastewater treatment also resulting in ng l levels in surface water zonja et al 2016 as with the propranolol compounds thyroxine demonstrated a similar persistence throughout the wwtp in that no process seemed to result in a net augmentation or decrease in concentrations as with propranolol there is no evidence to suggest that deconjugation of thyroxine glucuronide macleod and wong 2010 is occurring at a rate to increase levels of thyroxine within the residence time of the wwtp process as such there can be multiple transformation mechanisms simultaneously occurring on both parent and conjugate as with propranolol above average levels of thyroxine fig 1d were 0 0079 0 0069 0 0063 and 0 0060 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively levels of thyroxine glucuronide fig 1d were 0 007 0 012 0 014 and 0 011 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively the total concentration of both thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide together was approximately 3 times greater than that of thyroxine alone thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide were quantified at the same concentration range as propranolol in the several ng l range thus it appeared as though thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide much like propranolol and propranolol sulfate were resistant to abiotic and biotic transformation processes there was no evidence to suggest that deconjugation of propranolol sulfate was occurring at a rate great enough to indicate a significant increase in propranolol throughout the treatment process however it is plausible that there are multiple mechanisms occurring simultaneously that may effectively cancel each other out i e degradation of propranolol while deconjugation of propranolol sulfate is occurring 3 1 3 moderate concentration decreases of sulfamethoxazole in the third trend there were moderate decreases in concentrations 59 79 of sulfamethoxazole compounds from primary to final effluent levels of sulfamethoxazole fig 1c were 1 31 0 23 0 43 and 0 38 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively petrie et al 2016 previously reported concentrations of sulfamethoxazole of 0 11 and 0 048 μg l in the primary and final effluent respectively these values are an order of magnitude lesser than this study however of important note is the similar removal of 58 in comparison to the 71 in this study levels of n acetyl sulfamethoxazole fig 1c were 0 98 0 22 0 34 and 0 40 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively levels of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide fig 1c were 0 50 0 13 0 13 0 10 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively sulfamethoxazole n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide all reflect a significant difference from primary to mixed liquor p 0 0001 indicating that aerobic biotransformation is most likely a major process subsequent to the mixed liquor there is no significant change of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide there is a slight significant increase of sulfamethoxazole p 0 0001 from 0 23 to 0 43 μg l and n acetyl sulfamethoxazole p 0 0419 from 0 22 to 0 34 μg l from mixed liquor to secondary then no further significant change these slight increases cannot be directly correlated to the removal of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide because there was no corresponding decrease in concentration of that conjugate nevertheless the total mass for these sulfamethoxazole compounds throughout the treatment process is approximately double that of sulfamethoxazole alone wang and gardinali 2014 used high resolution orbitrap in ms ms mode in combination with isotopically labeled sulfamethoxazole d4 as a surrogate for n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide pseudo quantitation and found in reclaimed water 2 85 1 37 1 98 1 41 and 2 86 1 53 μg l for sulfamethoxazole n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide respectively attenuation of n acetyl sulfamethoxazole in other wastewaters has been observed gobel et al 2005 kovalova et al 2012 suggesting but not proving deconjugation may nonetheless exist in wwtps in addition to the one we studied several caveats are apparent when comparing data from the literature to our current study wwtp concentrations of sulfamethoxazole would be population dependent in usage and concentrations would be dependent on cumulative wwtp treatments e g aerobic reaction during secondary treatment tertiary treatment etc and associated hydraulic retention times moreover the use of surrogates for quantitation as opposed to using identical isotopically labeled standards to compensate for matrix effects for the individual compounds as we do here would affect accuracy of measurement as noted our calculated concentrations minimum values and excludes metabolites and conjugates for which we had no authentic standards and did not quantify thus conjugates can make up a significant reservoir of drugs in the wastewater environment and by extension the aquatic environment to which wastewaters discharge 3 1 4 uv treatment effect on concentrations overall it was apparent that regardless of compound class or conjugate type there was no data to support removal or transformation during the tertiary uv treatment process this is not particularly surprising given the short uv residence times i e a few seconds in combination with the ubiquity of molecules e g dna rna proteins that absorb light 300 nm and the amount of dissolved and suspended particulate organic matter present within the wastewater system for example with an average flow rate of 165 ml day approximately 1900 l of wastewater flows by the uv treatment bulbs every second thus uv treatment had no significant difference on the concentrations of all analytes all ns p 0 05 as can be seen in fig 1 a d between secondary treatment and final effluent 3 2 solid phase 3 2 1 scope of findings and predicted levels the scope of analysis for our set of conjugates and pharmaceuticals was limited to what was extracted in situ sorption isotherms were not performed and specific removal mechanisms cannot be conclusively identified however sorptive tendencies were outlined in light of the mass of analytes associated with the suspended solids low levels of suspended particulate matter table s1 in the secondary clarifier and final effluent means of 14 mg l and 16 mg l respectively resulted in concentrations below the loq in these stages for many compounds given the moderate logkow values fig s2 and logdow values ph 7 4 table s4 for the classes of compounds analysed both propranolol logkow 3 5 logdow 1 26 and thyroxine logkow 4 1 logdow 3 58 may be associated with solid matter figueroa diva et al 2010 petrie et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2014 but sulfamethoxazole less so logkow 0 89 logdow 0 56 hyland et al 2012 calculated a linear free energy relationship lfer based on experimental evidence of numerous pharmaceuticals neutral basic and acidic and compared to other known lfers they determined that given the high degree of organic matter in wwtp sludge that the lfer eqn 9 26a reported by schwarzenbach 2003 gave a more realistic approximation for logkd logkioc 0 74 logkow 0 15 thus using logkow the predicted calculated kd values l kg were 550 propranolol 6 5 sulfamethoxazole and 1500 thyroxine using logdow values calculated at ph 7 the predicted calculated kd values were 8 9 propranolol 0 04 sulfamethoxazole and 630 thyroxine thus using eqn 9 11 reported by schwarzenbach 2003 in conjunction with the kd values and measured mass of suspended solids per litre of primary wastewater table s1 predictions of aqueous fractions were calculated 94 0 propranolol 100 0 sulfamethoxazole 93 4 thyroxine therefore we predicted the vast majority of the parent compounds to be in the dissolved fraction of the primary wastewater however we saw marked greater amounts in the sorbed phase as outlined in 3 4 below thus these predicted aqueous fraction values can be considered a maximum for cationic species given electrostatic attractions with negatively charged organic matter moieties 3 2 2 compound specific sorption for propranolol fig 2 a levels fell below the loq in the secondary and final effluent with this caveat in mind there were no significant differences p 0 6783 among primary mixed liquor return activated sludge ras and waste activated sludge was means 0 0518 0 0447 0 0496 and 0 0306 μg g solids dry weight respectively sulfamethoxazole demonstrated a similar distribution to propranolol with sulfamethoxazole levels in the final effluent loq fig 2b there were no significant differences p 0 2669 among primary mixed liquor secondary ras and was means 0 153 0 0445 0 0467 0 0460 and 0 0281 μg g solids dry weight respectively the range of kd for sulfonamides is reported to be 0 27 256 l kg gobel et al 2005 and thus a major proportion is expected in the aqueous phase with some amounts associated with the solids wegst uhrich et al 2014 based on this kd range the predicted total sulfamethoxazole loaded on solids in wastewater ww would range from 0 031 to 30 ng l ww 0 0038 3 6 ng l ww and 0 0043 4 1 ng l ww for primary secondary and final effluent respectively based on the low levels of suspended solids means 116 mg l in primary 14 2 mg l in secondary and 16 1 mg l in final effluent it was previously reported that the proportion of sorbed sulfonamides is likely not affected by the presence of increased negatively charged particles and that sorption of sulfamethoxazole is driven by organic content srinivasan et al 2014 thus indicating that sulfonamides sorb primarily via hydrophobic interactions within a wwtp environment and not cation bridging or other surface complexations due to the presence of significant amounts of organic matter however further mechanistic possibilities are explored below in the kd distribution summary sorbed thyroxine fig 2c also showed no significant differences p 0 5161 across primary mixed liquor secondary final effluent ras and was means 0 0567 0 0656 0 100 0 111 0 0103 and 0 0433 μg g solids dry weight respectively a similar distribution for thyroxine glucuronide fig 2c was observed with no significant differences p 0 9415 across primary mixed liquor secondary final effluent ras and was means 0 0546 0 0221 0 282 0 698 0 0210 and 0 0236 μg g solids dry weight respectively 3 3 temporal and hydrodynamic trends there was no obvious or statistically significant trend to indicate that acetaminophen propranolol sulfamethoxazole or thyroxine compounds exhibit temporal correlations over the four month timeframe december 2017 to march 2018 this intuitively makes sense given that these drugs are most likely prescribed and consumed year round with the potential exception of elevated sulfamethoxazole usage during cold flu season given the logistical constraint of the samples being collected and analysed only during the winter months there is no way to compare these values to another season e g summer however there was evidence fig s3 to suggest a very mild inverse correlation of flow rate to concentration for all compounds except acetaminophen sulfate upon linear regression of all concentrations determined in the primary clarifier all compounds showed poor r2 values ranging from 0 027 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole to 0 30 propranolol sulfate none of the slopes were significantly different from zero propranolol did show a significant deviation from 0 r2 0 54 p 0 010 and all regressions displayed negative slopes suggesting that as flow rate increased concentrations mildly decreased in fact at the beginning of the study nov 29 2016 the flow rate dramatically increased to 361 ml day mean 165 ml day due to the first melt of the first major autumnal snowfall in winnipeg the only compounds detected in the primary clarifier above the loq were sulfamethoxazole 0 56 μg l and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide 0 28 μg l fig s3 these were the lowest concentrations quantified during the study suggesting that increased flow rate through the wwtp yielded lesser concentrations due to dilution 3 4 in situ solid water distribution solid water distribution coefficients kd were calculated by dividing c s in suspended solids by c w in the primary clarifier table s4 this stage was chosen to maximise the concentrations of pharmaceutical and thus yield a representative distribution prior to transformation by the wwtp processes in general logkd values table s4 seemed to increase as logkow increased sulfamethoxazole 2 07 propranolol 3 14 thyroxine 3 86 and thyroxine glucuronide 3 89 the noted exception was thyroxine glucuronide which had a similar sorptive tendency as the parent thyroxine even though the logkow 2 65 vs 4 15 is lesser based on the lfer noted above schwarzenbach 2003 the estimates for logkd table s4 were sulfamethoxazole 0 81 propranolol 2 74 thyroxine 3 18 and thyroxine glucuronide 2 11 for sulfamethoxazole this implies that there could be mechanisms occurring e g inner and or outer sphere complexation electrostatic interactions that aid in the retention of the glucuronide in addition to the hydrophobic interactions the values for propranolol and thyroxine seem to be in agreement with what others found hyland et al 2012 although changes in speciation occur as ph changes when logdow values were used in the lfer the comparisons to the measured values exhibited greater variation table s4 therefore it appears that in a wwtp environment the sorption of these pharmaceuticals can generally be predicted by the hydrophobic interactions of the neutral species given the significant amount of organic matter in the solid phase thereby limiting the importance of site specific reactivity of these compounds in contrast to our data that suggested hydrophobicity as the dominant sorption mechanism in a wwtp environment sorption processes in addition to hydrophobicity may become more important upon release to receiving waters where sediments and fluvial soils lesser oc become more relevant jung et al 2013 found in n and o biochar experiments that the adsorption affinity for sulfamethoxazole increased significantly with increasing ph but decreased sharply at ph values above the pka this difference occurs because electronic coupling influences the adsorptive interaction with each adsorbent the strong electron withdrawing sulfonamide group repulsed π electron acceptor rich aromatic ring s on adsorbents resulting in inhibition of π π electron donor acceptor interactions jung et al 2013 the more polar n biochar promoted binding throughout the acidic range of ph especially by hydrogen bonding due to more oxygen containing groups the ionic forms of sulfamethoxazole promoted multiple layering due to the hydrogen bonding capabilities of the oxygen containing groups of both sorbate and sorbent especially n biochar jung et al 2013 when lesser amounts of oxygen and hydrogen groups were seen lesser degrees of layering occurred in contrast srinivasan et al 2014 concluded that sorption of sulfamethoxazole to six different dairy farm soils was dependent primarily upon organic content i e increased organic content oc yielded increased sorbed concentrations however as greater oc was found in these soils greater cation exchange capacity and specific surface area was also found thus mechanistic sorption could not be verified aside from covalent bonding that could occur through inner sphere complexation outer sphere complexes can be important as well yet more transient and reversible if outer sphere electrostatic attractions are such that sorbate and sorbent associate at a minimum distance of one water molecule apart stumm and morgan 1996 lian et al 2014 and teixido et al 2011 found that negative charge assisted hydrogen bonding cahb seemed to play a dominant role in sorption of sulfamethoxazole if the pka of the sorbent surface e g oxyl groups is similar to the pka of the sorbate then significant cahb can occur lian et al 2014 thus as the ph of the system approaches that of sulfamethoxazole pka2 5 57 this rare yet strong phenomenon becomes more important 3 5 final effluent mass loadings and apparent net removal with these chemical distributions and the wwtp metadata in hand it was important to estimate the final effluent mass loading of each compound into the fluvial receiving waters fig 3 what is important to note for all calculations both aqueous and suspended solids was the fact that defined units of water were not followed throughout the treatment plant primarily for logistical reasons the north main wwtp services approximately half a million people daily and extensive daily routine analytical chemistry protocols are conducted we were not afforded the opportunity to follow a specific packet of water based on hydraulic retention times hrt in order to isolate temporospatial variables for concentrations of pharmaceuticals majewsky et al 2011 using a fractionated approach regarding hrts results in several complications majewsky et al 2013 ort et al 2010 for which some solutions exist baalbaki et al 2016 majewsky et al 2011 however based on the good precision of the concentrations afforded via our lc ms ms quantification methods and their demonstrated accuracy brown and wong 2016 2017 it could be assumed that the levels we saw are representative based on the impacts of wwtp processes these compounds have a continuous input on a daily basis regardless of seasonal or temporospatial variation thus as a first estimation concentrations can be viewed as fairly accurate representations of this wwtps and possibly others using return activated sludge aerobic reaction and uv tertiary treatment processes if logistically possible it would have been of great value to follow a specific unit of water using the aforementioned techniques however our sampling regime was restricted by the availability of wwtp operator personnel and on total volumes of composite samples available i e samples were afforded based on the remainder of composites not needed for wwtp daily analytical protocols in summary the only compound not quantified in the final effluent was acetaminophen sulfate propranolol propranolol sulfate thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide all had no significant decreases in concentration throughout the wastewater treatment process from primary to final effluent the mean sem of mass loadings calculated in the aqueous fraction of the final effluent for each compound were in g day fig 3 acetaminophen 45 3 4 2 propranolol 6 0 0 5 propranolol sulfate 5 9 0 3 sulfamethoxazole 62 2 4 6 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole 61 2 9 6 sulfamethoxazole glucuronide 18 5 4 3 thyroxine 0 84 0 2 and thyroxine glucuronide 1 6 0 2 of important note are the mean sem masses of thyroxine 0 29 0 025 g day and thyroxine glucuronide 1 8 0 59 g day these values equate to 26 of total thyroxine and 53 of total thyroxine glucuronide reaching the red river receiving waters being associated with suspended particulate matter this significant particle bound proportion is comparable with the pharmacological literature that reported circulating t4 thyroxine bound to serum carrier proteins especially thyroxine binding globulin and thyroxine binding prealbumin to a great extent 99 murkin 1982 moreover it has been reported that only 0 02 of thyroxine is considered bioavailable welsh and soldin 2016 namely the amount of thyroxine in a free soluble form it is important to note that bacteria in the lower intestine jejunum and ileum possess glucuronidases which results in very little thyroxine glucuronide being excreted via the feces hays 2009 svanfelt et al 2010 thus thyroxine glucuronide potentially found in a wastewater environment would most likely be sorbed to suspended particulate matter from the aqueous phase and this is what we expected hence excreted thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide maintain strong affinities for the hydrophobic solids within the wwtp in comparison subedi and kannan 2015 reported 56 1 of total propranolol sorbed to suspended particulate matter and a total load of 12 6 mg day 1000 inhabitants in the current study winnipeg has approximately 700 000 inhabitants and the north main wwtp services approximately 70 of the population therefore based on approximately 500 000 inhabitants and similar usage patterns as albany ny a mass loading of 6 3 g day would be expected using the estimation by subedi et al the current study calculated a mean of 6 0 g day loaded into the red river albeit with all propranolol in the aqueous phase ostensibly due to the aforementioned lesser amounts of suspended solids present in the final effluent resulting in levels loq studies have been conducted at the various stages of wwtps to elucidate the most effective areas of removal for pharmaceuticals aymerich et al 2016 reported influent and effluent concentrations for acetaminophen at 18 5 and 0 031 μg l sulfamethoxazole at 0 36 and 0 18 μg l and n acetyl sulfamethoxazole at 0 19 and lod respectively these corresponded to removal rates of 99 8 acetaminophen 50 sulfamethoxazole and 99 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole krah et al 2016 reported that within a 4 h hrt using basic lysates of extracted native enzymes from activated sludge acetaminophen was completely removed 99 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole partially removed 59 and sulfamethoxazole increased by approximately 23 ostensibly due in part to deconjugation of n acetyl sulfamethoxazole the former results are compare well with our observed overall decreases in concentrations of 99 8 acetaminophen and 59 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole however a decrease in 71 sulfamethoxazole was found in this study indicating a simultaneous increase in biodegradation of conjugates with the parent this result suggests that for these compounds aerobic biodegradation seems to be the dominant mechanism of removal outside a wastewater environment martinez hernandez et al 2016 found that in sorption experiments of acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole to various soils quantification was problematic as only 20 acetaminophen remained after 48 h when microorganisms were present compared to 10 removal with sorption alone with autoclaved soil moreover 20 removal was found for sulfamethoxazole under both sorption conditions with or without microbial degradation thus biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole within a wwtp environment is greater than that found in a terrestrial one 4 conclusions overall there were significant decreases in the concentrations of acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole compounds but also persistence of propranolol and thyroxine compounds throughout the wwtp the mass loadings throughout the wwtp necessitated that both aqueous and solid concentrations be taken into account comparable final effluent concentrations of propranolol sulfate n acetyl sulfamethoxazole sulfamethoxazole glucuronide and thyroxine glucuronide were released if not more than their respective parent this study reflects the importance of including phase ii conjugates in assessing overall compound load of pharmaceutical discharge from wastewaters and also that substantial amounts of such contaminants are associated with wastewater solids when drugs are in the pg l to μg l range however generalisations to other classes of pharmaceuticals cannot be concluded based on the scarcity of monitoring data and

19405,some pharmaceutical conjugates can be excreted into wastewaters at levels rivalling those of the parent compounds however little is known about this potential reservoir of pharmaceuticals to aquatic systems we evaluated the occurrence and distribution of four different classes of pharmaceuticals and their metabolite conjugates in a wastewater treatment plant over four months aqueous and suspended solids fractions of primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent along with return activated sludge and waste activated sludge were assessed the only conjugate not found in the final effluent was acetaminophen sulfate moreover thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide were the only compounds quantified in the suspended solids in the final effluent propranolol propranolol sulfate thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide all had no significant decreases in concentration going through the wastewater treatment process from primary to final effluent however there were significant decreases observed for acetaminophen 99 8 sulfamethoxazole 71 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole 59 and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide 79 the mean sem mass loadings in the aqueous fraction of the final effluent for each compound ranged from 0 84 0 2 g d for thyroxine to 45 3 4 2 g d for acetaminophen at least as much conjugate was released into receiving waters if not more 1 6 0 2 g d for thyroxine glucuronide to 18 5 4 5 g d for sulfamethoxazole glucuronide and 61 2 9 6 g d for n acetyl sulfamethoxazole additionally the mean loading of thyroxine was 0 29 0 025 g day and thyroxine glucuronide 1 8 0 59 g day in the suspended solids this equates to 26 of total thyroxine and 53 of total thyroxine glucuronide associated with suspended particulate matter that reaches receiving waters this study reflects the importance of including phase ii conjugates in assessing overall compound load of pharmaceutical discharge from wastewaters and also that substantial amounts of such contaminants are

introduction various transformation processes can occur within the body that change ingested pharmaceuticals into a more water soluble form in preparation for excretion the extent of pharmaceutical biotransformation is dependent on various epigenetic factors of individuals by phase i endogenous monooxygenases and mixed function cytochrome p 450 enzymes into more hydrophilic excretory products subsequent to this various enzymes e g udp glucuronosyl transferase nakanishi et al 2012 and sulfotransferase alherz et al 2017 can attach hydrophilic moieties such as glucuronic acid sulfate and

al 2012 zheng et al 2013 until recently environmental quantitation of drugs was typically concerned with their unchanged state i e parent compound and some various phase i metabolites however simultaneous quantitation of a more thorough picture of both parent and conjugated forms across multiple classes of drugs has generally not been conducted with the noted exceptions of estrogens d ascenzo et al 2003 hutchins et al 2007 reddy et al 2005 tso and aga 2010 androgens badoud et al 2011 jantti et al 2010 and recent work on lamotrigine and its glucuronide bollmann et al 2016 zonja et al 2016 it is possible that significant amounts of pharmaceutical conjugates rivalling or even exceeding the parent compounds are surviving wastewater treatment in both the aqueous and suspended solid phases and directly entering receiving waters bollmann et al 2016 brown and wong 2016 subedi and kannan 2014 svahn and bjorklund 2015 zonja et al 2016 sorption to both suspended particulate martinez hernandez et al 2016 and dissolved organic matter guo et al 2017 martinez hernandez et al 2014 svahn and bjorklund 2015 could contribute to the environmental persistence of metabolite conjugates moreover chemical sorption to solids has been considered to be a major factor in the protection from various biotic and abiotic transformation mechanisms e g photolysis hydrolysis polesel et al 2016 schwarzenbach 2003 although conjugates are presumed to be quite hydrophilic based on lesser log kow values complexations and or hydrophobic interactions can occur that necessitate quantitation of conjugates in the solid phase thus it is important to quantify drugs and conjugates in the solid phase that could potentially desorb in the environment and elicit toxic effects on non target organisms toxicological effects on non target organisms could arise either directly by exposure to the conjugate majewsky et al 2014 or indirectly via deconjugation back into the parent drug by microbial enzymes e g glucuronidases sulfatases derived from the microflora resident in the human gut and by those found within the wastewater treatment process kumar et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 zonja et al 2016 hydrolysis of these conjugates is mainly governed by ph and temperature of the surroundings in addition to the nature of the bond between the conjugated moiety and the parent compound sanchez and kauffman 2010 e g glucuronidation to a phenolic or aliphatic hydroxide vs carboxylic acid shipkova et al 2003 the persistence of parent drugs through the wastewater treatment process is compound specific baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 brown et al 2015 lajeunesse et al 2012 metcalfe et al 2010 polesel et al 2016 sabourin et al 2009 and it is plausible that the persistence of conjugates may be also brown and wong 2016 zonja et al 2016 the compounds in this study were chosen based on the high usage of the parent pharmaceutical and the potential for conjugate persistence based on their structures thus there is sufficient evidence that significant masses of labile potentially toxic conjugates are surviving wastewater treatment and are not being considered in monitoring or risk assessment analyses however data is lacking the aim of this study was to use developed analytical frameworks in both aqueous brown and wong 2016 and solid phases brown and wong 2017 for the extraction and quantitation of drugs and their respective major conjugates and determine their distribution within a major municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp we hypothesise that significant compound specific levels of conjugates would be present in the primary clarifier and that microbial activity during wastewater treatment would change the concentrations brown and wong 2017 and relative proportions of both parent and conjugate compounds we also provide an assessment of the mass loadings within the final effluent to estimate the amount reaching major surface waters receiving

them in the water fractions throughout the treatment plant across all four classes of pharmaceuticals three separate trends became evident first acetaminophen compounds showed significant differences after the primary clarifier 99 8 change in concentration second propranolol and thyroxine compounds showed no significant difference throughout the wwtp process third sulfamethoxazole compounds showed a moderate significant difference 59 79 from primary to final effluent 3 1 1 rapid concentration decreases of acetaminophen compounds in the first trend acetaminophen fig 1 a showed a dramatic significant difference from primary to mixed liquor p 0 0001 from a mean of 186 to 0 51 μg l subsequently there was no significant change between mixed liquor secondary and final effluent means of 0 51 0 39 and 0 32 μg l respectively acetaminophen sulfate fig 1a also showed significant differences from primary to mixed liquor p 0 0001 with means from 83 7 μg l to loq for all subsequent stages of treatment these observations indicate both acetaminophen and acetaminophen sulfate are sufficiently labile such that aerobic biodegradation was most likely a major mechanism for removal of these chemicals aymerich et al 2016 krah et al 2016 overall a 99 8 decrease in acetaminophen concentrations was observed from primary to final effluent petrie et al 2016 also reported 99 removal from crude to final effluent with concentrations of 138 and 1 5 μg l respectively in agreement with our findings 3 1 2 no decrease in concentrations of propranolol and thyroxine compounds in the second trend both propranolol and propranolol sulfate fig 1b showed no significant difference throughout the treatment process 4 hydroxypropranolol is a major human metabolite for propranolol brown and wong 2016 partani et al 2009 and as such it is most likely expected to yield phase ii conjugates propranolol sulfate and 4 hydroxypropranolol glucuronide walle et al 1985 levels of propranolol throughout the wwtp were 0 038 0 045 0 042 and 0 041 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively propranolol concentrations have been reported within wwtps to range from 0 001 to 0 5 μg l brown et al 2015 subedi and kannan 2015 our propranolol concentrations are also consistent within a factor of three and with similar resistance to removal with those of petrie et al 2016 who reported primary and final effluent concentrations of 0 12 μg l in both stages of treatment maurer et al 2007 reviewed 43 german wwtp occurrences of propranolol and reported varying concentrations found in both influent and effluent waters with concentrations varying from 0 010 to 0 17 μg l nevertheless our results are within that range moreover those authors demonstrated highly variable removal rates of propranolol ranging from 0 to 96 maurer et al 2007 levels of propranolol sulfate in our current study were 0 048 0 030 0 041 and 0 040 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively considering this sole sulfate conjugate alone the total concentration of propranolol species analysed throughout the wwtp and of those entering receiving waters is effectively doubled this is a minimum calculation and excludes metabolites and conjugates for which we had no authentic standards and did not quantify thus conjugates can make up a significant reservoir of drugs in the wastewater environment and by extension the aquatic environment to which wastewaters discharge conjugates surviving wastewater treatment is consistent with previous findings of estrogen conjugates at comparable proportions to their parent compounds as propranolol sulfate in the present study bollmann et al 2016 brown and wong 2015 d ascenzo et al 2003 hutchins et al 2007 shrestha et al 2012 zonja et al 2016 moreover lamotrigine glucuronide has been seen at concentrations up to 50 times that of the parent during wastewater treatment also resulting in ng l levels in surface water zonja et al 2016 as with the propranolol compounds thyroxine demonstrated a similar persistence throughout the wwtp in that no process seemed to result in a net augmentation or decrease in concentrations as with propranolol there is no evidence to suggest that deconjugation of thyroxine glucuronide macleod and wong 2010 is occurring at a rate to increase levels of thyroxine within the residence time of the wwtp process as such there can be multiple transformation mechanisms simultaneously occurring on both parent and conjugate as with propranolol above average levels of thyroxine fig 1d were 0 0079 0 0069 0 0063 and 0 0060 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively levels of thyroxine glucuronide fig 1d were 0 007 0 012 0 014 and 0 011 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively the total concentration of both thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide together was approximately 3 times greater than that of thyroxine alone thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide were quantified at the same concentration range as propranolol in the several ng l range thus it appeared as though thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide much like propranolol and propranolol sulfate were resistant to abiotic and biotic transformation processes there was no evidence to suggest that deconjugation of propranolol sulfate was occurring at a rate great enough to indicate a significant increase in propranolol throughout the treatment process however it is plausible that there are multiple mechanisms occurring simultaneously that may effectively cancel each other out i e degradation of propranolol while deconjugation of propranolol sulfate is occurring 3 1 3 moderate concentration decreases of sulfamethoxazole in the third trend there were moderate decreases in concentrations 59 79 of sulfamethoxazole compounds from primary to final effluent levels of sulfamethoxazole fig 1c were 1 31 0 23 0 43 and 0 38 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively petrie et al 2016 previously reported concentrations of sulfamethoxazole of 0 11 and 0 048 μg l in the primary and final effluent respectively these values are an order of magnitude lesser than this study however of important note is the similar removal of 58 in comparison to the 71 in this study levels of n acetyl sulfamethoxazole fig 1c were 0 98 0 22 0 34 and 0 40 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively levels of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide fig 1c were 0 50 0 13 0 13 0 10 μg l for the primary mixed liquor secondary and final effluent respectively sulfamethoxazole n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide all reflect a significant difference from primary to mixed liquor p 0 0001 indicating that aerobic biotransformation is most likely a major process subsequent to the mixed liquor there is no significant change of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide there is a slight significant increase of sulfamethoxazole p 0 0001 from 0 23 to 0 43 μg l and n acetyl sulfamethoxazole p 0 0419 from 0 22 to 0 34 μg l from mixed liquor to secondary then no further significant change these slight increases cannot be directly correlated to the removal of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide because there was no corresponding decrease in concentration of that conjugate nevertheless the total mass for these sulfamethoxazole compounds throughout the treatment process is approximately double that of sulfamethoxazole alone wang and gardinali 2014 used high resolution orbitrap in ms ms mode in combination with isotopically labeled sulfamethoxazole d4 as a surrogate for n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide pseudo quantitation and found in reclaimed water 2 85 1 37 1 98 1 41 and 2 86 1 53 μg l for sulfamethoxazole n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide respectively attenuation of n acetyl sulfamethoxazole in other wastewaters has been observed gobel et al 2005 kovalova et al 2012 suggesting but not proving deconjugation may nonetheless exist in wwtps in addition to the one we studied several caveats are apparent when comparing data from the literature to our current study wwtp concentrations of sulfamethoxazole would be population dependent in usage and concentrations would be dependent on cumulative wwtp treatments e g aerobic reaction during secondary treatment tertiary treatment etc and associated hydraulic retention times moreover the use of surrogates for quantitation as opposed to using identical isotopically labeled standards to compensate for matrix effects for the individual compounds as we do here would affect accuracy of measurement as noted our calculated concentrations minimum values and excludes metabolites and conjugates for which we had no authentic standards and did not quantify thus conjugates can make up a significant reservoir of drugs in the wastewater environment and by extension the aquatic environment to which wastewaters discharge 3 1 4 uv treatment effect on concentrations overall it was apparent that regardless of compound class or conjugate type there was no data to support removal or transformation during the tertiary uv treatment process this is not particularly surprising given the short uv residence times i e a few seconds in combination with the ubiquity of molecules e g dna rna proteins that absorb light 300 nm and the amount of dissolved and suspended particulate organic matter present within the wastewater system for example with an average flow rate of 165 ml day approximately 1900 l of wastewater flows by the uv treatment bulbs every second thus uv treatment had no significant difference on the concentrations of all analytes all ns p 0 05 as can be seen in fig 1 a d between secondary treatment and final effluent 3 2 solid phase 3 2 1 scope of findings and predicted levels the scope of analysis for our set of conjugates and pharmaceuticals was limited to what was extracted in situ sorption isotherms were not performed and specific removal mechanisms cannot be conclusively identified however sorptive tendencies were outlined in light of the mass of analytes associated with the suspended solids low levels of suspended particulate matter table s1 in the secondary clarifier and final effluent means of 14 mg l and 16 mg l respectively resulted in concentrations below the loq in these stages for many compounds given the moderate logkow values fig s2 and logdow values ph 7 4 table s4 for the classes of compounds analysed both propranolol logkow 3 5 logdow 1 26 and thyroxine logkow 4 1 logdow 3 58 may be associated with solid matter figueroa diva et al 2010 petrie et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2014 but sulfamethoxazole less so logkow 0 89 logdow 0 56 hyland et al 2012 calculated a linear free energy relationship lfer based on experimental evidence of numerous pharmaceuticals neutral basic and acidic and compared to other known lfers they determined that given the high degree of organic matter in wwtp sludge that the lfer eqn 9 26a reported by schwarzenbach 2003 gave a more realistic approximation for logkd logkioc 0 74 logkow 0 15 thus using logkow the predicted calculated kd values l kg were 550 propranolol 6 5 sulfamethoxazole and 1500 thyroxine using logdow values calculated at ph 7 the predicted calculated kd values were 8 9 propranolol 0 04 sulfamethoxazole and 630 thyroxine thus using eqn 9 11 reported by schwarzenbach 2003 in conjunction with the kd values and measured mass of suspended solids per litre of primary wastewater table s1 predictions of aqueous fractions were calculated 94 0 propranolol 100 0 sulfamethoxazole 93 4 thyroxine therefore we predicted the vast majority of the parent compounds to be in the dissolved fraction of the primary wastewater however we saw marked greater amounts in the sorbed phase as outlined in 3 4 below thus these predicted aqueous fraction values can be considered a maximum for cationic species given electrostatic attractions with negatively charged organic matter moieties 3 2 2 compound specific sorption for propranolol fig 2 a levels fell below the loq in the secondary and final effluent with this caveat in mind there were no significant differences p 0 6783 among primary mixed liquor return activated sludge ras and waste activated sludge was means 0 0518 0 0447 0 0496 and 0 0306 μg g solids dry weight respectively sulfamethoxazole demonstrated a similar distribution to propranolol with sulfamethoxazole levels in the final effluent loq fig 2b there were no significant differences p 0 2669 among primary mixed liquor secondary ras and was means 0 153 0 0445 0 0467 0 0460 and 0 0281 μg g solids dry weight respectively the range of kd for sulfonamides is reported to be 0 27 256 l kg gobel et al 2005 and thus a major proportion is expected in the aqueous phase with some amounts associated with the solids wegst uhrich et al 2014 based on this kd range the predicted total sulfamethoxazole loaded on solids in wastewater ww would range from 0 031 to 30 ng l ww 0 0038 3 6 ng l ww and 0 0043 4 1 ng l ww for primary secondary and final effluent respectively based on the low levels of suspended solids means 116 mg l in primary 14 2 mg l in secondary and 16 1 mg l in final effluent it was previously reported that the proportion of sorbed sulfonamides is likely not affected by the presence of increased negatively charged particles and that sorption of sulfamethoxazole is driven by organic content srinivasan et al 2014 thus indicating that sulfonamides sorb primarily via hydrophobic interactions within a wwtp environment and not cation bridging or other surface complexations due to the presence of significant amounts of organic matter however further mechanistic possibilities are explored below in the kd distribution summary sorbed thyroxine fig 2c also showed no significant differences p 0 5161 across primary mixed liquor secondary final effluent ras and was means 0 0567 0 0656 0 100 0 111 0 0103 and 0 0433 μg g solids dry weight respectively a similar distribution for thyroxine glucuronide fig 2c was observed with no significant differences p 0 9415 across primary mixed liquor secondary final effluent ras and was means 0 0546 0 0221 0 282 0 698 0 0210 and 0 0236 μg g solids dry weight respectively 3 3 temporal and hydrodynamic trends there was no obvious or statistically significant trend to indicate that acetaminophen propranolol sulfamethoxazole or thyroxine compounds exhibit temporal correlations over the four month timeframe december 2017 to march 2018 this intuitively makes sense given that these drugs are most likely prescribed and consumed year round with the potential exception of elevated sulfamethoxazole usage during cold flu season given the logistical constraint of the samples being collected and analysed only during the winter months there is no way to compare these values to another season e g summer however there was evidence fig s3 to suggest a very mild inverse correlation of flow rate to concentration for all compounds except acetaminophen sulfate upon linear regression of all concentrations determined in the primary clarifier all compounds showed poor r2 values ranging from 0 027 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole to 0 30 propranolol sulfate none of the slopes were significantly different from zero propranolol did show a significant deviation from 0 r2 0 54 p 0 010 and all regressions displayed negative slopes suggesting that as flow rate increased concentrations mildly decreased in fact at the beginning of the study nov 29 2016 the flow rate dramatically increased to 361 ml day mean 165 ml day due to the first melt of the first major autumnal snowfall in winnipeg the only compounds detected in the primary clarifier above the loq were sulfamethoxazole 0 56 μg l and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide 0 28 μg l fig s3 these were the lowest concentrations quantified during the study suggesting that increased flow rate through the wwtp yielded lesser concentrations due to dilution 3 4 in situ solid water distribution solid water distribution coefficients kd were calculated by dividing c s in suspended solids by c w in the primary clarifier table s4 this stage was chosen to maximise the concentrations of pharmaceutical and thus yield a representative distribution prior to transformation by the wwtp processes in general logkd values table s4 seemed to increase as logkow increased sulfamethoxazole 2 07 propranolol 3 14 thyroxine 3 86 and thyroxine glucuronide 3 89 the noted exception was thyroxine glucuronide which had a similar sorptive tendency as the parent thyroxine even though the logkow 2 65 vs 4 15 is lesser based on the lfer noted above schwarzenbach 2003 the estimates for logkd table s4 were sulfamethoxazole 0 81 propranolol 2 74 thyroxine 3 18 and thyroxine glucuronide 2 11 for sulfamethoxazole this implies that there could be mechanisms occurring e g inner and or outer sphere complexation electrostatic interactions that aid in the retention of the glucuronide in addition to the hydrophobic interactions the values for propranolol and thyroxine seem to be in agreement with what others found hyland et al 2012 although changes in speciation occur as ph changes when logdow values were used in the lfer the comparisons to the measured values exhibited greater variation table s4 therefore it appears that in a wwtp environment the sorption of these pharmaceuticals can generally be predicted by the hydrophobic interactions of the neutral species given the significant amount of organic matter in the solid phase thereby limiting the importance of site specific reactivity of these compounds in contrast to our data that suggested hydrophobicity as the dominant sorption mechanism in a wwtp environment sorption processes in addition to hydrophobicity may become more important upon release to receiving waters where sediments and fluvial soils lesser oc become more relevant jung et al 2013 found in n and o biochar experiments that the adsorption affinity for sulfamethoxazole increased significantly with increasing ph but decreased sharply at ph values above the pka this difference occurs because electronic coupling influences the adsorptive interaction with each adsorbent the strong electron withdrawing sulfonamide group repulsed π electron acceptor rich aromatic ring s on adsorbents resulting in inhibition of π π electron donor acceptor interactions jung et al 2013 the more polar n biochar promoted binding throughout the acidic range of ph especially by hydrogen bonding due to more oxygen containing groups the ionic forms of sulfamethoxazole promoted multiple layering due to the hydrogen bonding capabilities of the oxygen containing groups of both sorbate and sorbent especially n biochar jung et al 2013 when lesser amounts of oxygen and hydrogen groups were seen lesser degrees of layering occurred in contrast srinivasan et al 2014 concluded that sorption of sulfamethoxazole to six different dairy farm soils was dependent primarily upon organic content i e increased organic content oc yielded increased sorbed concentrations however as greater oc was found in these soils greater cation exchange capacity and specific surface area was also found thus mechanistic sorption could not be verified aside from covalent bonding that could occur through inner sphere complexation outer sphere complexes can be important as well yet more transient and reversible if outer sphere electrostatic attractions are such that sorbate and sorbent associate at a minimum distance of one water molecule apart stumm and morgan 1996 lian et al 2014 and teixido et al 2011 found that negative charge assisted hydrogen bonding cahb seemed to play a dominant role in sorption of sulfamethoxazole if the pka of the sorbent surface e g oxyl groups is similar to the pka of the sorbate then significant cahb can occur lian et al 2014 thus as the ph of the system approaches that of sulfamethoxazole pka2 5 57 this rare yet strong phenomenon becomes more important 3 5 final effluent mass loadings and apparent net removal with these chemical distributions and the wwtp metadata in hand it was important to estimate the final effluent mass loading of each compound into the fluvial receiving waters fig 3 what is important to note for all calculations both aqueous and suspended solids was the fact that defined units of water were not followed throughout the treatment plant primarily for logistical reasons the north main wwtp services approximately half a million people daily and extensive daily routine analytical chemistry protocols are conducted we were not afforded the opportunity to follow a specific packet of water based on hydraulic retention times hrt in order to isolate temporospatial variables for concentrations of pharmaceuticals majewsky et al 2011 using a fractionated approach regarding hrts results in several complications majewsky et al 2013 ort et al 2010 for which some solutions exist baalbaki et al 2016 majewsky et al 2011 however based on the good precision of the concentrations afforded via our lc ms ms quantification methods and their demonstrated accuracy brown and wong 2016 2017 it could be assumed that the levels we saw are representative based on the impacts of wwtp processes these compounds have a continuous input on a daily basis regardless of seasonal or temporospatial variation thus as a first estimation concentrations can be viewed as fairly accurate representations of this wwtps and possibly others using return activated sludge aerobic reaction and uv tertiary treatment processes if logistically possible it would have been of great value to follow a specific unit of water using the aforementioned techniques however our sampling regime was restricted by the availability of wwtp operator personnel and on total volumes of composite samples available i e samples were afforded based on the remainder of composites not needed for wwtp daily analytical protocols in summary the only compound not quantified in the final effluent was acetaminophen sulfate propranolol propranolol sulfate thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide all had no significant decreases in concentration throughout the wastewater treatment process from primary to final effluent the mean sem of mass loadings calculated in the aqueous fraction of the final effluent for each compound were in g day fig 3 acetaminophen 45 3 4 2 propranolol 6 0 0 5 propranolol sulfate 5 9 0 3 sulfamethoxazole 62 2 4 6 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole 61 2 9 6 sulfamethoxazole glucuronide 18 5 4 3 thyroxine 0 84 0 2 and thyroxine glucuronide 1 6 0 2 of important note are the mean sem masses of thyroxine 0 29 0 025 g day and thyroxine glucuronide 1 8 0 59 g day these values equate to 26 of total thyroxine and 53 of total thyroxine glucuronide reaching the red river receiving waters being associated with suspended particulate matter this significant particle bound proportion is comparable with the pharmacological literature that reported circulating t4 thyroxine bound to serum carrier proteins especially thyroxine binding globulin and thyroxine binding prealbumin to a great extent 99 murkin 1982 moreover it has been reported that only 0 02 of thyroxine is considered bioavailable welsh and soldin 2016 namely the amount of thyroxine in a free soluble form it is important to note that bacteria in the lower intestine jejunum and ileum possess glucuronidases which results in very little thyroxine glucuronide being excreted via the feces hays 2009 svanfelt et al 2010 thus thyroxine glucuronide potentially found in a wastewater environment would most likely be sorbed to suspended particulate matter from the aqueous phase and this is what we expected hence excreted thyroxine and thyroxine glucuronide maintain strong affinities for the hydrophobic solids within the wwtp in comparison subedi and kannan 2015 reported 56 1 of total propranolol sorbed to suspended particulate matter and a total load of 12 6 mg day 1000 inhabitants in the current study winnipeg has approximately 700 000 inhabitants and the north main wwtp services approximately 70 of the population therefore based on approximately 500 000 inhabitants and similar usage patterns as albany ny a mass loading of 6 3 g day would be expected using the estimation by subedi et al the current study calculated a mean of 6 0 g day loaded into the red river albeit with all propranolol in the aqueous phase ostensibly due to the aforementioned lesser amounts of suspended solids present in the final effluent resulting in levels loq studies have been conducted at the various stages of wwtps to elucidate the most effective areas of removal for pharmaceuticals aymerich et al 2016 reported influent and effluent concentrations for acetaminophen at 18 5 and 0 031 μg l sulfamethoxazole at 0 36 and 0 18 μg l and n acetyl sulfamethoxazole at 0 19 and lod respectively these corresponded to removal rates of 99 8 acetaminophen 50 sulfamethoxazole and 99 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole krah et al 2016 reported that within a 4 h hrt using basic lysates of extracted native enzymes from activated sludge acetaminophen was completely removed 99 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole partially removed 59 and sulfamethoxazole increased by approximately 23 ostensibly due in part to deconjugation of n acetyl sulfamethoxazole the former results are compare well with our observed overall decreases in concentrations of 99 8 acetaminophen and 59 n acetyl sulfamethoxazole however a decrease in 71 sulfamethoxazole was found in this study indicating a simultaneous increase in biodegradation of conjugates with the parent this result suggests that for these compounds aerobic biodegradation seems to be the dominant mechanism of removal outside a wastewater environment martinez hernandez et al 2016 found that in sorption experiments of acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole to various soils quantification was problematic as only 20 acetaminophen remained after 48 h when microorganisms were present compared to 10 removal with sorption alone with autoclaved soil moreover 20 removal was found for sulfamethoxazole under both sorption conditions with or without microbial degradation thus biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole within a wwtp environment is greater than that found in a terrestrial one 4 conclusions overall there were significant decreases in the concentrations of acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole compounds but also persistence of propranolol and thyroxine compounds throughout the wwtp the mass loadings throughout the wwtp necessitated that both aqueous and solid concentrations be taken into account comparable final effluent concentrations of propranolol sulfate n acetyl sulfamethoxazole sulfamethoxazole glucuronide and thyroxine glucuronide were released if not more than their respective parent this study reflects the importance of including phase ii conjugates in assessing overall compound load of pharmaceutical discharge from wastewaters and also that substantial amounts of such contaminants are associated with wastewater solids when drugs are in the pg l to μg l range however generalisations to other classes of pharmaceuticals cannot be concluded based on the scarcity of monitoring data and

19406,sulfide prevails in both industrial and municipal waste streams and is one of the most troublesome issues with waste handling various technologies and strategies have been developed and used to deal with sulfide for decades among which biological means make up a considerable portion due to their low operation requirements and flexibility sulfur bacteria play a vital role in these biotechnologies in this article conventional biological approaches dealing with sulfide and functional microorganisms are systematically reviewed linking the sulfur cycle with other nutrient cycles such as nitrogen or phosphorous and with continued focus of waste remediation by sulfur bacteria has led to emerging biotechnologies furthermore opportunities for energy harvest and resource recovery based on sulfur bacteria are also discussed the electroactivity of sulfur bacteria indicates a broad perspective of sulfur based bioelectrochemical systems in terms of bioelectricity production and bioelectrochemical synthesis the considerable pha accumulation high yield and anoxygenic growth conditions in certain phototrophic sulfur bacteria could provide an interesting alternative for bioplastic production in this review new merits of biological sulfide oxidation from a traditional environmental management perspective as well as a waste to resource perspective are presented along with their potential applications keywords biological sulfur oxidation sulfur bacteria wastewater treatment energy and resource recovery 1 introduction sulfur is one of the most abundant elements in nature the major sulfur deposits are present as gypsum caso4 metal sulfide fes2 and elemental sulfur s0 in the earth s crust and as sulfate so4 2 in seawater canfield and farquhar 2012 diverse intermediate valence states result in a complex sulfur cycle which can be driven chemically and biologically steudel 2003 muyzer and stams 2008 increasing anthropogenic activities has created a significant imbalance of the sulfur cycle leading to several sulfur related environmental issues such as odor nuisance corrosion sulfide toxicity and acid rain around the world lens and kuenen 2001 pikaar et al 2014 these human activities are predominantly industrial and include petroleum refining henshaw et al 1999 tang et al 2009 pulp and paper manufacturing wani et al 1999 janssen et al 2009 food processing livestock farming chung et al 2001 mining vera et al 2013 and natural gas processing tang et al 2009 all of which result in the discharge of considerable quantities of sulfide hs in wastewaters and hydrogen sulfide h2s in gas streams several urban water cycle processes also contribute to sulfide production such as anaerobic digestion for biogas production pokorna and zabranska 2015 sulfate laden wastewater treatment hao et al 2014 and extensive utilization of sulfate containing flocculants e g alum for potable water purification rauch and kleidorfer 2014 to overcome the challenges due to hs h2s several technologies for sulfur pollution remediation have been developed and practiced over the past decades including conventional physicochemical based processes such as alkanolamine claus holmes stretford and lo cat iliuta and larachi 2003 krishnakumar et al 2005 and biological processes such as thiopaq process paques the netherlands and sulfothane veolia france the physicochemical processes are developed specifically for the treatment of gaseous sulfide streams or large volumes of polluted aqueous stream with high sulfide concentrations tang et al 2009 however most of the physicochemical technologies require high chemical dosages and consume energy heavily resulting in high operational costs especially for small scale applications sulfide loading below 100 t day gabriel and deshusses 2003 syed et al 2006 klok et al 2013 in contrast biological approaches have demonstrated attractive advantages no addition of catalysts needed low sludge yield and the potential recovery of elemental sulfur more importantly they can be operated at ambient temperature and pressure and they produce smaller volumes of contaminated byproduct streams resulting in safer operations and easier waste disposal management these advantages also lead to significantly reduced energy consumption with similar or improved efficiency over physicochemical methods 99 removal jensen and webb 1995 henshaw and zhu 2001 biological technologies are therefore preferred for the treatment of low and medium strength sulfide laden waste streams buisman et al 1989 sercu et al 2005 the two main categories of biological sulfide removal systems are phototrophic and chemotrophic based on the metabolism of the bacteria involved phototrophs capture light energy for oxidizing sulfur compounds while chemotrophs obtain their metabolic energy by oxidizing sulfur directly in conjunction with other chemicals chemotrophs are the most prevalent organism applied in commercial biotechnologies due to their flexibility in a wide range of environmental conditions e g ph and temperature independence of light conditions allowing more compact reactors and high sulfide tolerance lens and kuenen 2001 widespread chemoautotrophic metabolism among sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob explains their dominance in the treatment of sulfide laden wastewaters containing low levels of organics and high concentrations of inorganic reduced sulfur compounds smet et al 1998 hao et al 2014 their metabolic diversity also ensures a stable performance even when the system fluctuates biological processes for the treatment of undesirable sulfur compounds and factors influencing their performance have been thoroughly reviewed by syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 and pokorna and zabranska 2015 notably for desulfurization of gas and the combined denitrification and desulfurization of wastewater this review not only focuses on microbiology and present applications of biological sulfide oxidation in wastewater treatment but also explores emerging opportunities for biological sulfur oxidation owing to the versatility of sulfur bacteria with a focus on energy and resource recovery it is intended that the review will update the reader on recent knowledge and spur further research and development to extend the application scope of biological sulfur oxidation biotechnology 2 sulfur bacteria biological transformations of sulfur are complicated due to the wide oxidation states of sulfur and the diverse microbial organisms involved in the sulfur cycle madigan and martinko 2014 the two main groups of microorganisms involved in the biological sulfur cycle are sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sob srb use oxidized sulfur compounds e g so4 2 so3 2 and s0 as electron acceptors and produce sulfide while oxidizing organics for energy generation and cell growth see muyzer and stams 2008 and hao et al 2014 for comprehensive reviews on srb sob on the other hand use reduced forms of sulfur as electron donors and are categorized into two groups based on their energy source and growth conditions 1 phototrophic sulfur bacteria and 2 chemotrophic colorless sulfur bacteria 2 1 phototrophic sulfur bacteria phototrophic sob are characterized by performing sulfur based anoxygenic photosynthesis under anaerobic conditions they acquire electrons and hydrogen from reduced sulfur compounds using light energy and fix inorganic carbon for cell growth syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 identified by their phenotypic properties such as color phototrophic sob can be predominantly classified into green sulfur bacteria gsb encompassing several key genera including chlorobium prosthecochloris ancalochloris pelodictyon and chloroherpeton and purple sulfur bacteria psb composed of genera such as thiospirillum thiorhodovibrio chromatium thiocystis thioalkalicoccus thiorhodococcus thiocapsa thiococcus thiodictyon and thiopedia imhoff 1995 frigaard and dahl 2008 natural habitats for phototrophic sob are usually aquatic environments in which reduced sulfur compounds and penetrated light are available in the anoxic layers van gemerden and mas 1995 overmann 2008 as well as supratidal salt flats and marshes trüper 1970 fernandez et al 2016 all gsb are strictly anaerobic and obligately photoautotrophic psb are more versatile in that they grow not only photoautotrophically but photoheterotrophically as well gaining carbon from organic compounds in the presence of high organic compound loads e g in domestic wastewater streams psb often dominate over gsb van gemerden and mas 1995 frigaard and dahl 2008 frigaard 2016 and despite light being the main energy source for phototrophic sulfur bacteria some psb like thiocapsa roseopersicina demonstrate chemolithotrophic growth in the absence of light friedrich et al 2001 both gsb and psb acquire energy by employing light harvesting pigments such as bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids from which they also acquire their colors light is harvested through these pigments and then transferred to reaction centers leading to photophosphorylation and atp generation madigan and martinko 2014 the different pigments are responsible for the light absorption properties table 1 which allow the maximal use of the available energy by the biofilm microbial community in the electromagnetic spectrum and enables multiple phototroph phenotypes to coexist in the same habitat in gsb light harvesting pigments are enriched in chlorosomes and the dense arrays of bacteriochlorophyll on these chlorosomes absorb light energy the light energy passes through a fenna matthews olson fmo protein frigaard and dahl 2008 madigan and martinko 2014 on its way to reaction centers commonly bacteriochlorophyll a located at the cytoplasmic membrane in contrast to gsb the light harvesting pigments of psb are attached to proteins and form photocomplexes each consisting of tens of pigment molecules clustering around reaction center pigments due to the more effective light accepting structure of chlorosomes gsb can grow even under conditions of severely limited light and show a higher light utilization efficiency than psb furthermore brown colored gsb e g chlorobium phaeobacteroides can acquire energy for proliferation and growth from lower light intensities than green colored gsb e g chlorobium limicola since carotenoids of brown species can efficiently capture the light in the 450 550 nm wavelength range that reaches lower water zone imhoff 2014 a stable population of a brown colored chlorobium strain has been found at a point in the black sea where only 0 0007 light transmits from the surface manske et al 2005 other than light energy anoxygenic photosynthesis in gsb and psb requires reduced sulfur species serving as electron donors to produce reducing power for inorganic carbon fixation electrons are extracted from reduced sulfur species via a sulfur oxidation enzymatic system and then transferred to the electron transfer chains as will be discussed in section 2 3 below frigaard and dahl 2008 provide a more comprehensive discussion of sulfur oxidation biochemistry and electron transport when sulfide is the initial electron donor it is first oxidized to s0 and then further to so4 2 given sufficient energy madigan and martinko 2014 the van niel curve is commonly used to describe the relationship between light irradiation intensity and sulfide concentration fig 1 cork et al 1985 this curve indicates the amount of light energy required to oxidize a given concentration of sulfide to s0 and is defined by eq 1 1 2 h 2 s c o 2 l i g h t 2 s 0 c h 2 o c a r b o h y d r a t e h 2 o under limited light intensity and sufficient co2 s0 will accumulate when excessive sulfide is present with sufficient light sulfide can be completely oxidized to so4 2 see eq 2 2 h 2 s 2 c o 2 2 h 2 o l i g h t s o 4 2 2 c h 2 o c a r b o h y d r a t e h 2 the specific sulfide oxidation rate is subject to the growth of phototrophic sob which in turn is dependent on the incident irradiance exceeding a certain threshold growth and specific sulfide oxidation rate increase with the irradiation intensity until photoinhibition induced by overirradiation sets in however due to the diversity of sob and the environmental conditions in which they are found the magnitude of irradiation that each system can tolerate will differ hurse et al 2008 other than gsb and psb several other groups of phototrophic bacteria exist that do not rely primarily on sulfur oxidation for metabolism but are capable of sulfide oxidation to some degree cyanobacteria commonly known as blue green algae are a group of phototrophic bacteria which conduct oxygenic photosynthesis recent findings have demonstrated that at least some organisms within this group can switch between anoxygenic i e sulfide oxidizing and oxygenic photosynthesis klatt et al 2015 this feature is controlled by sulfide concentration with oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis occurring simultaneously to maintain an overall maximum rate of photosynthesis klatt et al 2015 such ability could have provided an ecological advantage in the redox stratified upper zones of oceans in the proterozoic eon klatt et al 2016 purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb within the alphaproteobacteria can oxidize sulfur as well dahl 2017 these organisms are typically capable of photoautotrophic photoheterotrophic and chemotrophic growth with the preferred mode being photoheterotrophic imhoff et al 2005 for these reasons they are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems although not because they are performing sulfide oxidation other sulfide oxidizing organisms worth mentioning are the filamentous phototrophic members of the chloroflexi phylum and heliobacteria dahl 2017 the ability to oxidize sulfur exists widely among a variety of microorganisms which is attributed to horizontal gene transfer madigan and martinko 2014 leading to emerging applications other than sulfur removal which will be introduced in section 5 2 2 chemotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria chemotrophic sob are commonly referred to as colorless sulfur bacteria without needing light they oxidize almost all reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide polysulfide elemental sulfur polythionate thiosulfate sulfite and in some cases organic sulfur compounds such as methanethiol dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide using various electron acceptors e g o2 or no3 madigan and martinko 2014 2 2 1 energy and carbon sources for chemotrophic sob physiologically the colorless sob can be categorized into four groups based on the energy or carbon source they utilize these groups are 1 obligate chemolithotrophs which obtain metabolic energy purely from the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds fixing inorganic carbon as the carbon source 2 facultative chemolithotrophs which grow with inorganic sulfur compounds as the energy source while use the inorganic carbon or organics as the carbon source 3 chemolithoheterotrophs which generate energy from the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds but rely on organics for carbon and 4 chemoorganoheterotrophs which are primarily heterotrophic but oxidize sulfur for detoxification of by reducing hydrogen peroxide produced by metabolism robertson and kuenen 2006 muyzer et al 2013 pokorna and zabranska 2015 oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds is the major feature of these bacteria however the various metabolic categories such as facultative chemolithotroph chemolithoheteroph and chemoorganotheterotoph that sob belong to demonstrate that many of sob can also rely on electron sources other than sulfur for example acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans can acquire energy and electrons from reduction of fe2 and h2 muyzer et al 2013 like other microorganisms sob can also be classified as acidophiles e g acidithiobacillus neutrophiles e g thiobacillus and thiothrix and alkaliphiles e g thioalkalivibrio and thioalkalispira according their affinity of ph and psychrophiles e g thiovulum mesophiles e g thioalkalivibrio and thermophiles e g thermothrix according to temperature therefore the physiological diversity of chemotrophic sob enables them to flourish in a variety of extreme environments for example the acidophiles are employed for bioleaching of heavy metals vera et al 2013 and the alkaliphiles are used for removing sulfide absorbed in basic solutions van den bosch et al 2007 more comprehensive information of chemotrophic sob is given in table 2 2 2 2 electron acceptors for chemotrophic sob 2 2 2 1 oxygen o2 is universally used as an electron acceptor for the growth of colorless chemotrophic sob muyzer et al 2013 representative genera are thiobacillus acidithiobacillus sulfolobus thiovulum thiothrix and thiospira table 2 robertson and kuenen 2006 the overall biological chemotrophic oxidation of sulfide in the presence of o2 is described in eqs 3 5

commonly an o s ratio slightly higher than stoichiometry typically around 0 7 is required for s0 to dominate as the final product while a high o s ratio 1 results in significant formation of so4 2 an o s ratio lower than 0 6 results mainly in the formation of s2o3 2 through abiotic chemical oxidation which outcompetes biological oxidation under low dissolved oxygen do conditions janssen et al 1995 van den bosch et al 2007 klok et al 2012 however when no so4 2 is formed the growth of some sob e g thioalkalivibrio versutus would be inhibited van den bosch et al 2007 because additional energy is needed to drive reverse electron flow see section 2 3 below for biomass synthesis during oxidation from hs to so4 2 klok et al 2012 madigan and martinko 2014 do control is one of the methods applied to realize selective biological oxidation when the reactor is operated in continuous flow mode with a relatively stable sulfide concentration table 4 buisman et al 1990 janssen et al 1997 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 do values around 0 1 mg l are commonly applied to constrain chemotrophic sulfur oxidation to elemental sulfur with a yield exceeding 90 of the oxidized sulfide although many studies have used higher concentrations successfully buisman et al 1990 however the dynamic nature of the do in the system due to continuous consumption by sulfide causes difficulties in maintaining the o s ratio effectively janssen et al 1998 krishnakumar et al 2005 as an alternative oxidation reduction potential orp determined by both sulfide concentration and do has proven to be a more feasible indicator for controlling chemotrophic sulfur oxidation the optimal orp for high sulfide removal and sulfur recovery differed significantly across previous studies ranging from 400 mv to 137 mv as summarized in table 3 which could be ascribed to differences in functional bacteria media composition and other biochemical reactions taking place when orp is lower than 420 mv no sulfur can be obtained because the orp is dominated by a high sulfide concentration and the biological reactions become inhibited klok et al 2012 due to its universality orp control is extensively practiced in biogas desulfurization and natural gas processing to achieve sulfide removal and sulfur recovery 2 2 2 2 nitrate and nitrite although chemotrophic sob are primarily aerobic some species of the genera thiobacillus thiomicrospira and thiosphaera table 2 display different metabolic traits growing anoxically by using no3 or no2 as the terminal electron acceptor which is commonly known as autotrophic denitrification takai et al 2006 kellermann and griebler 2009 shao et al 2010 shapleigh 2013 reactions related to simultaneous sulfur oxidation and denitrification are listed below dolejs et al 2015

and martinko 2014 nonetheless some are strict anaerobes e g sulfurimonas denitrificans which can only use no3 and no2 as electron acceptors sorokin et al 2004 sievert et al 2008 in terms of nitrogen reduction the series of reactions are similar to those for traditional heterotrophic denitrifiers species such as thiobacillus denitrificans paracoccus versutus and sulfurimonas denitrificans can perform complete denitrification from no3 to n2 while others like thiobacillus thioparus and thiobacillus delicatus only reduce no3 to no2 robertson and kuenen 2006 muyzer et al 2013 as they can remove sulfur and nitrogen compounds simultaneously autotrophic denitrifying sob are employed in sulfate laden wastewater treatment and groundwater purification processes sierra alvarez et al 2007 shao et al 2010 like the o s ratio the molar ratio of nitrate sulfide n s also affects the end products of sulfur based denitrification table 3 krishnakumar and manilal 1999 reyes avila et al 2004 cardoso et al 2006 based on eq 8 when the n s ratio is maintained at 1 6 the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate and the complete reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas can proceed with the highest energy yield however when n s 4 eq 9 excess nitrate or n s 1 eq 10 insufficient nitrate the end products are sulfate and nitrite or elemental sulfur and nitrite respectively when n s 0 4 eq 6 the end products are elemental sulfur and nitrogen gas cardoso et al 2006 mahmood et al 2007 an et al 2010 the production of ammonia was observed when n s 0 35 indicating a severe nitrate deficiency dolejs et al 2015 such a reaction could be attributed to the genus beggiatoa which is able to carry out ammonification reduction of nitrate to ammonia shao et al 2010 however even if n s is maintained at a suitable ratio sudden changes in loading can significantly affect the efficiency of removing n and s temporarily cai et al 2008 in addition sulfide oxidation rate could be inhibited by high concentrations of sulfide an approximately 21 fold decrease in the sulfide oxidation rate and the denitrification rate have been observed for a sulfide concentration increase from 80 to 320 mg s l cardoso et al 2006 this may be attributed to the inhibition of no3 reduction to no2 by sulfide the first step of denitrification cardoso et al 2006 the accumulation of no2 under excess no3 can also inhibit the reaction rate due to nitrite toxicity oh et al 2000 2 3 biological sulfur oxidation mechanism hs and s0 are the most common electron donors for gsb psb and colorless sulfur bacteria fig 2 kelly 1999 muyzer et al 2013 madigan and martinko 2014 several sulfur oxidation pathways were observed and reported amongst these three sob groups however significant distinction of the pathways between these groups does not exist due to the horizontal gene transfer that is these pathways distribute universally among gsb psb and colorless sulfur bacteria ghosh and dam 2009 generally s0 is first formed in the oxidation of hs and this step is suggested to be carried out by flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase fcsd or sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and their subunits the electrons are then transferred to the membrane bounded cytochrome c pool or the quinone pool respectively griesbeck et al 2000 beller et al 2006 valdés et al 2008 frigaard and dahl 2008 muyzer et al 2011 when employing fcsd or sqr the oxidation reduction state of cytochrome c and quinone which is subject to the sulfide to oxidant ratio determines the end product of biological sulfide oxidation s0 is the major product when a low oxidant level occurs visser et al 1997 klok et al 2013 s0 produced intracellularly as in the case of most phototrophic psb and chemotrophic sob like beggiatoa or extracellularly as in the case of most phototrophic gsb and chemotrophic sob like thiobacillus can serve as an energy and electron storage substance kleinjan et al 2003 schulz and schulz 2005 frigaard and dahl 2008 when the supply of sulfide is depleted additional energy can be generated from the oxidation of s0 to so4 2 in the oxidation of s0 to so4 2 so3 2 is formed as an intermediate fig 2 as the first step in this step a sulfur oxygenase reductase sor is believed to be responsible for oxidizing s0 to so3 2 friedrich et al 2001 the subsequent oxidation from so3 2 to so4 2 primarily uses one of the two confirmed sub pathways the first employs the sulfite oxidase enzyme this enzyme oxidizes so3 2 and transfers the electrons to cytochrome c in the other sub pathway sulfur chemolithotrophs oxidize so3 2 to so4 2 through the reverse activity of the enzyme aps adenosine phosphosulfate reductase which is an essential enzyme in the metabolism of srb to reduce so4 2 to so3 2 this reaction yields one energy rich phosphate bond when amp adenosine monophosphate is converted to adp adenosine diphosphate madigan and martinko 2014 other than these two pathways a third pathway for complete sulfur oxidation is the sox sulfur oxidation system without the intermediate so3 2 formation the sox system exists widely in nature consisting of a series of enzymes and occurs in both phototrophic and chemotrophic sob ghosh and dam 2009 madigan and martinko 2014 for more comprehensive information of biochemical sulfur oxidation pathways readers can refer to griesbeck et al 2000 frigaard and dahl 2008 and ghosh and dam 2009 electrons delivered from reduced sulfur compounds enter the electron transport chain fig 3 via the sulfur oxidation enzymatic system depending on the e0 of the electron donor couple and the corresponding sulfur oxidizing enzyme electrons enter the electron transfer chain at different levels of electron carriers and are transported through the chain generating a proton motive force that forms atp these levels are flavoprotein e0 0 2 v which accepts electrons from hs at quinone e0 0 v or at cytochrome c e0 0 3 v which accepts electrons from s0 and s2o3 2 in autotrophic both photoautotrophic and chemoautotrophic growth reducing power nadh is essential for co2 fixation reverse electron flow dotted line in fig 3 in psb and colorless sulfur bacteria is necessary for production of nadh because the potential of the primary electron acceptors flavoprotein and quinone is more positive than the nad nadh couple in the electron chain of gsb ferredoxin with a more negative e0 than nadh is produced through light driven reactions to generate reducing power madigan and martinko 2014 being an energy consuming process the reverse electron transfer lowers the energy efficiency of sulfur oxidation electrons are recycled within the activated state and ground state of reaction centers in phototrophs with net electron consumption only when reducing agents e g nadh are produced to fix co2 however continuous net electron consumption from an external electron donor e g hs is required in chemotrophs electrons from sulfide are transferred for both energetic purpose and co2 fixation in the chemotrophic electron transfer chain indicating that chemotrophs possess better sulfide oxidizing capability than phototrophs since phototrophs consume sulfide only when new cell mass is built prescott et al 2008 ghosh and dam 2009 3 biological gas desulfurization as aforementioned sulfide is present in various waste streams creating many environmental problems the versatility of sob offers an energy efficient and cost effective way of treating sulfide compared with physicochemical approaches klok et al 2012 end products of sob based processes sulfur or sulfate are non hazardous and sulfate can be discharged directly into the sea or brackish receiving waters for freshwater the sulfide is selectively oxidized to elemental sulfur which can be separated and recovered from the liquid phase lens and kuenen 2001 muyzer et al 2013 the recovered sulfur can be used as a raw material in industry and agriculture to produce sulfuric acid sulfur fertilizers and fungicides chung et al 2013 h2s reaches concentrations ranging from 500 ppmv to 20 000 ppmv in biogas from anaerobic digestion or industrial gas streams in natural gas processing pokorna and zabranska 2015 removal of h2s is essential to control corrosion and odor issues during transportation and distribution and to prevent so2 emission to the atmosphere upon combustion burgess et al 2001 mousavi et al 2006 cost effective biological methods can be utilized under a wide range of conditions and applications tang et al 2009 pokorna and zabranska 2015 biogas and industrial gas desulfurization usually take place in one of three types of systems biofilters biotrickling filters or bioscrubbers as shown in fig 4 chen et al 2008 for biogas production these external reactors are important to avoid the disturbance of methanogens resulting from direct air dosage within the digester a summary of these three technologies along with their advantages and disadvantages are provided in table 4 3 1 biofilters biofilters fig 4a are the simplest type of gas desulfurization system and have been in use for almost a century van groenestijn and hesselink 1993 a moist h2s gas stream passes through a media bed on which sob and other organisms reside and perform purification performance of the biofilters is influenced by many operational parameters such as bed medium moisture content temperature ph nutrient and oxygen levels and the development of biofilm allegue et al 2012 a suitable bed material should have a large specific area and large porosity low pressure loss and low cost it should be lightweight and able to retain water packing moisture content between 40 and 60 nutrients and indigenous microorganisms and to absorb gas odor cho et al 2000 natural organic materials such as composts woodchips bark soil and peats rather than activated carbons zeolites and polymer supports are often used in biofilters aizpuru et al 2003 composts and peat are preferred materials due to their native microorganism consortia and high performance alexander 1999 khammar et al 2004 ph gradients occurring in the media resulting from sulfuric acid formation during the degradation of h2s and inefficient mixing are critical issues for all biofilters oh and bartha 1994 mudliar et al 2010 measures to address these issues include adding alkaline compounds using a basic carrier that itself has alkaline properties selection of acid tolerant microbes and washing the filter media periodically oxygen level within the bed is often controlled by injecting air directly into gas streams typically 5 10 of the volume however the optimal value varies a lot with different bed materials a high oxygen level results in the formation of sulfate and alleviates the clogging problem but lowers the quality of the off gas if this is an intended product of the process regarding the development of biofilm two main aspects are primary the thickness and the acclimated microbes the average thickness of biofilm is around 1 mm in the biofilters which is an appropriate level that provides enough biomass while not hindering mass transfer sob such as thiobacillus pseudomonas and acidothiobacillus etc are usually enriched in the biofilm for sulfide removal syed et al 2006 mudliar et al 2010 biofilters are suitable for low loading rates and low pollutant concentrations mainly due to their limited buffering capacity and issues with moisture control under high air flow rates nikiema et al 2007 mudliar et al 2010 a large footprint is required due to long residence times yang and allen 1994 demonstrated a maximum rate of 130 g s m3 h for a compost biofilter across a range of concentrations from 120 to 2000 ppmv where full removal was achieved so long as the residence time was adjusted to maintain this loading where other volatile organic compounds including organic sulfur compounds are treated longer residence times are required togna and singh 1994 3 2 biotrickling filters biotrickling filters differ from biofilters in their continuous feeding of the nutrient solution making environmental conditions easier to be controlled another difference is the packing bed material inert material is commonly used in biotrickling filters elias et al 2002 mudliar et al 2010 fig 4b plastic supports granular activated carbons and porous ceramics are typically chosen cox and deshusses 2002 lee et al 2006 biotrickling filters avoid buffering and acidification issues through the continual washout of acid reaction products by continuous trickling allegue et al 2012 however due to the continual supply of nutrients and the higher loading rates than those in biofilters other concerns exist such as increasing back pressure and the emergence of anaerobic zones resulting from clogging caused by biomass growth and sulfur accumulation iliuta et al 2005 these concerns may be partially alleviated by oxidizing sulfide to sulfate fortuny et al 2010 choosing suitable biomass carriers cho et al 2000 promoting protozoal predation cox and deshusses 1999 or designing the system to allow for periodic backwash smith et al 1996 many commercial biotrickling filter systems for sulfide removal have been implemented the biopuric process veolia france is one such technology and was first developed in germany in the 1980s mckinsey 2003 this process can achieve 90 98 h2s removal at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 15 000 ppmv with loading rates up to 200 kg h2s d about two thirds h2s oxidization into elemental sulfur occurs and elemental sulfur will accumulate on the media which is then periodically removed from the reactor other commercial systems include sulfurexbf dmt environmental technology the netherlands and biogascleaner biogasclean denmark 3 3 bioscrubbers bioscrubber systems applied for removal of h2s from gas streams are usually composed of two reactors see fig 4c nishimura and yoda 1997 mesa et al 2002 krischan et al 2012 the first reactor a gas absorber is used to absorb h2s into liquid and unlike biofilters and biotrickling filters does not aim to develop a biofilm preferentially either an alkaline liquid containing hco3 and co3 2 or an acidic medium containing fe3 pagella et al 1996 is used to enhance the process limiting mass transfer step in the absorption the absorbing solution goes to the second reactor consisting of functional microorganisms e g thiobacillus and thioalkalivibrio and the effluent is recirculated to the absorption tower a sedimentation tank is commonly installed after the aerated reactor to separate s0 and o2 is usually used as the oxidant in wastewater treatment plants nitrification effluent containing no3 and no2 provides another alternative baspinar et al 2011 compared to biofilters and biotrickling filters bioscrubbers have the advantage of not requiring the injection of o2 and n2 into the biogas stream although the investment is higher in addition they have been demonstrated to handle fluctuating loads significantly better most likely due to the longer retention time of the pollutants in the activated sludge reactor lebrero et al 2011 furthermore environmental conditions are easier to be controlled within a completed mixed reactor which ensure a stable performance optimum conditions for different end products are discussed in section 2 other advantages and disadvantages are highlighted in table 4 the thiopaq process paques the netherlands and sulfothane veolia france are two very similar and worldwide applied technologies based on a bioscrubber design for gas desulfurization typically capable of achieving 99 sulfide removal cline et al 2003 both the thiopaq and sulfothane processes first contact the h2s containing gas stream with an alkaline solution the sulfide containing scrubbing liquid is then transferred to a micro oxygenated reactor where the absorbed sulfide is mostly converted biologically to elemental sulfur by a consortium of chemotrophic sob typically dominated by the haloalkaliphilic thioalkalivibrio janssen et al 2009 in the thiopaq process less than 3 5 of the h2s is converted to sulfate van den bosch 2008 less than 4 ppm of h2s remains in the effluent under high pressure 4 bars operation when treating natural gas containing h2s of 2000 ppm and less than 25 ppm of effluent h2s are achieved under low pressure 4 bars the most significant disadvantage of the thiopaq process is the need to precisely control the system and the relatively high investment allegue et al 2012 in both systems a liquid sulfur fertilizer is produced from the settler which can also be used as a fungicide 4 emerging and niche applications of biological sulfur oxidation apart from the well established biological gas desulfurization process there are still many processes reported in both small and large scales due to the versatility of both phototrophic and chemotrophic sob in this section several emerging niches of sob application are discussed 4 1 phototrophic sulfide oxidation although not as popular as chemotrophic sob phototrophic sob still offer a number of advantages for removal of sulfide from waste streams including the avoidance of explosion risks encountered by mixing ch4 with o2 pokorna and zabranska 2015 and using natural light and low energy light emitting diodes led to provide energy savings over aerobic systems kim et al 1996 syed and henshaw 2005 furthermore led illumination provides great flexibility and control of the process through selection of only certain wavelengths corresponding to organisms of interest with a well regulated light source and proper reactor designs the oxidation product is limited to s0 following the correlation presented by the van niel curve and can also be used to control the overall reaction rates nevertheless in terms of energy efficiency syed and henshaw 2005 suggested that use of an infrared bulb may be more energy efficient overall due its wider light spread and higher strength therefore illumination and design of the photobioreactor are the major factors determining the successful application of phototrophic sob an and kim 2000 hurse et al 2008 provide a detailed evaluation of the most suitable organism for phototrophic biological sulfur removal gsb species were found optimal due to their extracellular formation of elemental sulfur their ability to withstand high sulfide concentrations and their ability to remove sulfide under low light intensities however the optimum organisms could depend on the wastewater characteristics for instance industrial streams with both sulfide and thermal load may be equally suited to other thermophilic phototrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria such as members of chloroflexaceae hanada 2014 typical photobioreactors for the decomposition of sulfide using phototrophic sulfur bacteria include stirred tank reactors and phototube reactors syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 stirred tank reactors are commonly operated continuously for the gas phase and cyclically for treatment of the liquid phase the bacteria are suspended in liquid phase or immobilized on different carriers e g strontium alginate tygon tubes or raschig rings kim et al 1993 henshaw et al 1998 an and kim 2000 chlorobium thiosulfatophilum gsb cultivated in suspension or immobilized on alginate has been applied to oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur kim and chang 1991 in which attached cells consumed 30 less light energy than planktonic cells with a removal rate of 68 mg h2s l 1h 1 light penetration is the major concern of stirred tank reactors especially with high cell densities or elemental sulfur production an and kim 2000 sought to overcome this through the use of internal fibre optic cables for illumination achieving specific sulfide removal rates 8 5 times higher than their earlier work involving an externally illuminated reactor kim et al 1992 phototube reactors are another typical reactor design for the application of phototrophic sob transparent phototubes can be set horizontally vertically or spirally and the tubular configuration facilitates the control of retention time the bacteria grow in the form of biofilm on the inner walls of tubes and sulfide is oxidized to elemental sulfur kobayashi et al 1983 henshaw and zhu 2001 syed and henshaw 2003 satisfactory results have been obtained from lab scale studies with sulfide loading rates of 286 mg l 1h 1 and 92 95 of the oxidized sulfide transformed to elemental sulfur by the chlorobium thiosulfatophlium henshaw and zhu 2001 this rate is equivalent to the chemoheterotrophic removal rates achieved with colorless sulfur bacteria henshaw et al 1998 while sulfide removal photobioreactors possess some advantages several issues prevent their widespread uptake these include a lack of efficient ways to scale up particularly for tubular photobioreactors where many of the diameters found optimal in laboratory scale systems are not feasible for full scale systems especially with wastewaters containing solids syed and henshaw 2003 hurse and keller 2004a b the fact that vfas reduce overall sulfide oxidation rates hurse and keller 2005 which may limit the effectiveness in certain wastewaters and c potential challenges in recovering elemental sulfur while henshaw and co workers observed almost complete sulfide conversion to effluent elemental sulfur using short diameter tubular photobioreactors henshaw and zhu 2001 syed and henshaw 2003 elemental sulfur in the effluent was not observed with a flat plate design hurse and keller 2004a 2005 furthermore the latter authors had a notable discrepancy in their sulfur mass balance most plausibly associated with polysulfide formation instead although scale up issues have been significant in the deployment of this technology with no reported full scale installations garcia et al 2015 performed a small scale onsite pilot study using two 25 l photobioreactors for sulfide removal from a 360 l upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor however while successful at removing sulfide levels to less than 0 5 mg s l influent concentrations were only 1 6 mg s l and the hrt was 12 24 h highlighting the low volumetric rates currently achievable with larger reactors special reactor designs were also proposed for the scaling up of other photobioreactors for instance hurse and keller 2004b grew phototrophic biofilms on the exterior surface of transparent carriers e g light diffusing fiber or panels suspended in wastewater with such design favourable biomass concentration and high irradiated surface area per reactor volume can be ensured even if the reactor is enlarged 4 2 sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification the ability to carry out sulfur driven denitrification by a variety of sob leads to a wide range of applications the feasibility of integrating biogas desulfurization with autotrophic denitrification has been proved by some researchers the existing nitrification units provide nitrifying activated sludge containing no3 and no2 for the biogas desulfurization unit a sulfide removal efficiency exceeding 95 and a maximum removal rate of 2 4 kg s m 3d 1 were achieved at the optimum nitrified wastewater biogas ratio of 2 3 m3 m3 baspinar et al 2011 improved sulfide removal efficiency 98 was also obtained by bayrakdar et al 2016 by adding no3 into an up flow reactor designed for the desulfurization of biogas from a chicken manure digester however these attempts suffered from clogging of the reactors when elemental sulfur accumulated nitrate removal using elemental sulfur as an electron donor is also an alternative in wastewater treatment in which the readily biodegradable substrate is deficient such as groundwater sierra alvarez et al 2007 landfill leachate koenig and liu 1996 and leather and fertilizer processing wastewater manconi et al 2007 an average nitrate removal efficiency of 95 9 can be achieved in a sulfur limestone packing bed reactor sierra alvarez et al 2007 although an inevitable issue is the low mass transfer efficiency when using elemental sulfur zeng and zhang 2005 the application of a microbial approach reliant on autotrophic denitrifying sob has also emerged as an attractive option to handle domestic wastewater with low cod n ratios koenig and liu 1996 due to two major advantages 1 addition of an external organic substrate e g methanol is not needed reducing operation costs and 2 less sludge production shao et al 2010 moreover the sulfur oxidizing denitrification process demonstrated significant reductions in n2o emissions compared with heterotrophic denitrification using sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification with an n s molar ratio of 0 43 yang et al 2016 the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process is one such process for municipal wastewater treatment developed in hong kong wang et al 2009 lu et al 2011 wu et al 2016 the sani process is a new sulfur cycle based biological carbon and nutrient removal process and uses the sulfate originating from seawater toilet flushing as an electron carrier see fig 5 a the sani process has recently been scaled up to a 1000 m3 d demo plant wu et al 2016 not only is it able to meet local effluent standards it also achieved 60 70 less biological sludge production and 30 40 less space needed than conventional activated sludge plant wu et al 2016 however one drawback of this process is sulfur compounds remaining in the effluent potentially resulting in secondary sulfate reduction 4 3 biological sulfur oxidation associated phosphorous removal in recent decades a group of sob called large sulfur bacteria including the genera of thiomargarita thioploca and beggiatoa have been reportedly involved in phosphogenesis in coastal areas like chile and namibia schulz and schulz 2005 holmkvist et al 2010 these bacteria contain considerable amounts of intracellular polyphosphates due to their large size schulz 2006 teske and nelson 2006 and were found in remarkably high populations in areas associated with the most active modern phosphorite formation and in phosphorite rocks fossing et al 1995 schulz et al 1999 reimers et al 1990 bailey et al 2007 p release and p uptake similar to that performed by phosphorous accumulating organisms paos in wastewater treatment were observed for thiomargarita namibiensis in vitro thiomargarita took up carbon to synthesize glycogen powered by the breakdown of polyphosphate and the release of phosphorous under anaerobic conditions meanwhile sulfide was also taken in by cells and stored when electron acceptors o2 or no3 were available the intracellularly stored elemental sulfur and glycogen were oxidized and phosphate was accumulated as poly p schulz and schulz 2005 elemental sulfur was stored intracellularly as an energy reserve in parallel with polyphosphate when sulfide and electron acceptors o2 or no3 were supplied in surplus which was found to be a common energy strategy in many sobs madigan and martinko 2014 particularly large sulfur bacteria store no3 intracellularly in case of a shortage of electron acceptors which enables them to convert sulfide to elemental sulfur without external electron acceptors schulz and schulz 2005 a sulfur cycle associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr process was proposed recently by wu et al 2014 they provided evidence of a similar p uptake and release process to that found in large sulfur bacteria interestingly in the ebpr system mentioned above no large sulfur bacteria genera thiomargarita thioploca and beggiatoa or conventional phosphorus accumulating organisms paos e g accumulibacteria and tetrasphaera were detected while srb e g desulfobacter desulfobulbus and desulfuromonas and sob e g thiohalomonas thiotrichaceae and thiobacillus were enriched even though the environment and the operating conditions of the reactor were suitable for large sulfur bacteria to perform p uptake and p release further investigation revealed that the phosphorous removal may be attributed to the synergy of srb and sob in which srb provide sulfide through sulfate reduction and sob in the system may act in place of conventional paos to provide sulfur and poly p as the energy storage to perform phosphorus removal guo et al 2016 sob other than the large sulfur bacteria may also possess an ability to take in excess phosphorous since polyphosphate is employed as an energy store in a variety of organisms kornberg 1995 the necessary presence of sulfide for stable p removal offers evidence for the role of sulfur oxidation in this p removal for metabolic purposes guo et al 2016 however the exact p removal mechanism and organisms capable of conducting this process are still unclear requiring further research in another study thiothrix caldifontis was dominant in a sulfide fed ebpr system and displayed a mixotrophic lifestyle like large sulfur bacteria which facilitates p removal in wastewater lacking organics but rich in sulfide rubio rincón et al 2017 4 4 dye treatment dyes are a product of tanning and textile industries among others and pose a multifaceted threat due to their persistence typical toxicity and color the latter of which reduces light penetration and photosynthesis in receiving environments cervantes and dos santos 2011 anaerobic treatments especially sulfate reducing systems have been favoured over aerobic treatments in the past as most of dyes used in industry are azo dyes dos santos et al 2007 zeng et al 2017 the produced sulfide acts as an electron donor for azo dye reduction and is predominantly mediated by biologically produced redox mediators van der zee et al 2003 prato garcia et al 2013 little attention has been paid to the role of sulfide oxidizing bacteria presumably because the typical electron acceptors for sulfide oxidation such as oxygen and nitrate result in an oxidative reductive potential too high for azo reduction dos santos et al 2007 nevertheless both chlorobi and chloroflexi classes containing a substantial proportion of organisms capable of sulfide oxidation have frequently been observed in anaerobic sulfate reducing systems treating azo dyes sun et al 2013 zeng et al 2017 over the gradual startup and operation of an anoxygenic phototrophic rotating biological contactor system treating azo dye waste wang et al 2015 the community pigmentation changed from predominantly purple to green which was also correlated with an improvement in azo dye removal throughout the study this suggests that chlorobi identified in the microbial community was a significant organism in the performance of the system in another recent study of five textile wastewater plants and five activated sludge plants in belgium both chlorobi and chloroflexi were also identified as dominant groups in textile plants and elevated in number compared to the municipal activated sludge plants meerbergen et al 2017 therefore while the role of sulfide oxidizing organisms has not been thoroughly investigated in dye removal treatment systems their repeated occurrence along with demonstration of certain species capable of dye biodegradation warrants future investigations 5 opportunities for energy harvest and resource recovery in biological sulfur oxidation 5 1 sulfur recovery and reuse most biological sulfide removal processes tend to selectively oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur lens and kuenen 2001 fu and wang 2011 the produced elemental sulfur can be used as a raw material for sulfuric acid fertilizers and pesticide production chung et al 2013 however with the emergence of a series of modern technologies interest in using elemental sulfur as a raw feedstock material for other applications is increasing 5 1 1 li s fuel cells the growing need for high performance energy storage systems in recent years has been driving the development of high capacity rechargeable batteries lim et al 2015 among which li batteries are gaining attention of all the redox couples enabling rechargeable batteries the li s couple demonstrates the highest specific energy of 2600 wh kg 1 novák et al 1997 because the theoretical capacity of sulfur 1672 mah g 1 is the highest among all feasible solid compounds for cathodes yuan et al 2009 manthiram et al 2014 elemental sulfur can be incorporated directly into the electrode framework e g carbon to form a sulfur based cathode however currently a number of challenges exist such as the high resistance of sulfur and intermediate products e g polysulfide dissolved polysulfide shuttling between the anode and cathode during charge discharge cycling mikhaylik and akridge 2004 passivation of electrodes due to the conversion of sulfur to lithium sulfide causing structural and morphological changes in the electrode and repetitive dissolution and deposition of reactive species manthiram et al 2014 however with the continuing development of li s batteries a large amount of sulfur is required as raw feedstock material 5 1 2 potential sulfur consumption in the construction industry one emerging niche for sulfur incorporating materials with significant growth potential is the construction industry mixing elemental sulfur with aggregates to produce sulfur concrete was first reported in 1976 vroom 1981 microcrystalline sulfur and sulfur polymers can be used in mortars concretes and asphaltic paving materials sulfur concrete possesses many unique properties such as rapid strength development high ultimate strength low permeability and superior resistance to strong acids and saline solutions vroom 1981 ciak and harasymiuk 2013 mohamed et al 2015 the latter feature is particularly useful for wastewater applications notably sewer pipes where the technology has been demonstrated to be more corrosion resistant than portland cement concrete and sulfate resistant concrete mohamed et al 2015 the low permeability also leads to safer stabilization of hazardous wastes mohamed and el gamal 2010 however when elemental sulfur is used directly without modification high shrinkage occurs on cooling to ambient temperature resulting in distortion and unpredictable final dimensions on the other hand the durability of this type of material is poor under many conditions especially in moist environments and when subjected to thermal cycling the addition of organic polymers can increase the durability mohamed and el gamal 2010 5 1 3 biologically produced sulfur different from commercial crystalline sulfur sulfur produced from biological sulfide oxidation possesses special characteristics such as hydrophilicity and biological activity kleinjan et al 2003 numerous researchers have reported that biologically produced sulfur displays a stronger ability to dissolve sulfide ores than commercial sulfur due to its hydrophilic properties which accelerates sulfuric acid production during biological sulfide oxidation in the leaching processes tichý et al 1994 1996 seidel et al 2006 brierley and brierley 2013 moreover biologically produced sulfur can be used directly as a fertilizer lens and pol 2000 as was demonstrated with an oil bearing vegetable canola a 50 increase in grain yield was observed after the addition of biologically produced sulfur outperforming commercially available sulfur sources used in the same study cline et al 2003 moreover the sulfur limestone process using elemental sulfur to drive autotrophic denitrification for groundwater purification is restricted by a low reaction rate due to the low solubility of sulfur amend et al 2004 zeng and zhang 2005 the hydrophilicity of biologically produced sulfur may overcome this drawback by accelerating mass transfer 5 2 sulfur compound based microbial electrochemical systems microbial electrochemical cells mxcs also known as bioelectrochemical systems bess have received significant interest because of their ability to provide energy positive wastewater treatment using microbial fuel cells mfcs and value added product recovery at reduced energy input using microbial electrolysis cells mecs or microbial electrosynthesis cells mes while most studies have focused on electricity generation from organics in wastewater or conversion of these organics into hydrogen or methane bajracharya et al 2016 a limited number of studies have considered bes for sulfide abatement or use of sulfide as an electron donor sulfide oxidation was first reported in electrochemical cells using marine sediment mfcs where oxidation of both dissolved and solid phase sulfide compounds contributed to the production of currents tender et al 2002 ryckelynck et al 2005 sulfur oxidizers in anoxic sediments are known to utilize electron donors in the oxic interface through synergistic relationships with cable bacteria lovley 2017 the dominant sulfur associated microbial species first observed in the sulfide oxidizing anodes of these sediment mfcs were actually srb from the desulfobulbaceae family namely desulfobulbus and desulfocapsa which are known for sulfur disproportionation ryckelynck et al 2005 however the appearance of sor enzymes in some srb species like desulfurolobus ambivalens indicates a sulfur oxidizing ability kelly 1999 the species desulfubulbus propionacus has demonstrated the ability to transfer electrons directly to an electrode during sulfur oxidation holmes et al 2004 other organisms capable of both sulfide oxidation and direct electron transfer to electrodes include another srb desulfuromonas tz1 gong et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 the autotrophic denitrifier pseudomonas c27 lee et al 2012a and the gsb prosthecochloris aestaurii ha et al 2017 synergism has been observed between sob such as chlorobi and geobacter whereby the glycogen produced by photosynthetic gsb under dark conditions is supplied to geobacter to produce currents badalamenti et al 2014 many other sulfide oxidizing organisms have been identified in anodic chambers of sulfide oxidizing mxcs such as paracoccus acaligenes and acidothiobacillus but their role in electron transfer within the mxcs remains unclear rabaey et al 2006 sulonen et al 2015 ni et al 2016 unfortunately the mechanism of electron transfer is frequently not well differentiated since sulfur compounds are electroactive and abiotic and biotic sulfur oxidation can both readily occur on electrode surfaces dutta et al 2008 demonstrated the abiotic role of sulfur oxidation on the anode in the generation of currents nevertheless sob involvement in electron transfer was comprehensively demonstrated by ha et al 2017 in a synergistic relation with geobacter further study is needed to confirm the role sob play in mxcs and the dynamics between biotic and abiotic electron transfer processes some mxc applications have been demonstrated using sulfide oxidation at the anode although this was not always demonstrated to be biologically mediated these applications include simple sulfide removal with simultaneous current generation rabaey et al 2006 izadi and rahimnejad 2014 autotrophic denitrification where excess sulfide current can be harvested even with electron donors and acceptors both in the anodic compartment lee et al 2012b removal of inorganic sulfur compounds such as tetrathionate from acid mine drainage sulonen et al 2015 2016 2017 ni et al 2016 removal of sulfate from wastewater lee et al 2012b 2015 driving electrosynthesis and electro fermentation of valuable chemical feedstocks such as acetate gong et al 2012 and powering microbial solar cells badalamenti et al 2013 2014 one specialized system was that proposed by zhang et al 2009a for the treatment of vanadium containing wastewaters wherein an mfc was used for simultaneous removal of sulfide and organics at the anode after which the mixture was passed to the cathode for reduction of v v to the less toxic and more easily precipitated v iv the same researchers also proposed an integrated treatment system whereby they treated real undiluted molasses wastewater with a uasb mfc baf configuration zhang et al 2009b the mfc was used for sulfide removal and electricity generation the system attained sulfide removal efficiencies of 86 in which over 200 mg l sulfide from the uasb was reduced to below 30 mg l in the mfc effluent the abiotic oxidation of sulfide at the anode results in the production of either s0 sx 2 or s4o6 2 s2o3 2 leading to the generation of either 2 4 or 4 5 electrons per sulfur atom sun et al 2009 gong et al 2012 under microbially mediated sulfide oxidation sulfate is the main end product resulting in the transfer of 8 electrons per sulfur atom greatly increasing the potential of the cell to produce currents gong et al 2012 sulonen et al 2017 demonstrated that the presence of biofilm on the anode reduced the required anode potential from 0 5 v to 0 3 v vs ag agcl for tetrathionate degradation to maintain a current density above 70 ma m 2 an anode potential of only 0 4 v was required in the mxc whereas 0 7 v was needed in the abiotic electrochemical cell while the coulombic efficiency was lower in the mxc under optimal conditions 8 vs 1 48 in the abiotic cell the rates of tetrathionate oxidation were significantly increased 110 240 mg l 1d 1 vs 20 35 mg l 1d 1 as a result the microbially mediated tetrathionate oxidation was energy positive under realistic operating conditions while the abiotic electrochemical cell was not other than the anodic electroactivity donating electrons to solid electron acceptor displayed by the sulfur bacteria discussed above the ability of acquiring electrons from a solid electron donor which refers to the oxidation of metal sulfide or elemental sulfur indicates cathodic electroactivity accepting electrons from electrodes sydow et al 2014 shi et al 2016 a thiobacillus denitrificans biofilm was cultivated on a cathode accepting electrons for denitrification with a maximum no3 removal rate of 21 12 1 67 mmol n l 1day 1m 2 at a cathode potential of 500 mv vs saturated calomel reference electrodes yu et al 2015 the cathodic electroactivity provides an entrance for electrons from solid donors to the membrane bound electron transfer chain of sob given the metabolic diversity of sob cultivating sob at the cathode of mxcs should lead to several emerging applications the main challenges hindering the further development of sulfide oxidizing electrochemical processes are similar to those facing all electrochemical processes namely the cost effective scaling up of the system long term reductions in efficiency due to electrode poisoning or fouling and ion exchange membrane fouling resulting in increased internal resistance of the system logan 2010 sulonen et al 2016 anode poisoning by elemental sulfur deposition has been identified as a risk with sulfide oxidizing mxcs rabaey et al 2006 nevertheless with the exception of scaling up these issues may not be as prevalent as first thought for example sulonen et al 2017 operated an mfc treating real acid mine drainage wastewater for more than 700 days during this period no significant fouling of the anode or ion exchange membrane was observed instead internal resistance decreased and electrical efficiency increased therefore the application of mxcs for simultaneous removal of sulfide and production of electricity or chemicals is one of the most promising areas of development for sulfide oxidation technology 5 3 reclamation of metals from waste sludge sulfur bacteria have been employed for many decades in the leaching of metals from low grade ores containing metal sulfide in the mining industry olson et al 2003 brierley and brierley 2013 the functional bacteria were found in the genera of acidithiobacillus acidianus leptospirillum and sulpholobus which are acidophilic and often occur in acidic habitats such as coal mining drainage and leach dumps madigan and martinko 2014 kelly and wood 2014 there are two mechanisms of leaching out metal one is a direct mechanism in which the sulfur moiety of metal sulfide is oxidized and metal ions are released to the leachate the other is an indirect mechanism reduced sulfur compounds e g s0 and hs are oxidized by sob to so4 2 and form sulfuric acid which reduces the ph thus enhancing the solubilization of metals rohwerder et al 2003 vera et al 2013 the process of leaching out metals can also be applied for metal reclamation from wastes containing low levels of metal like waste sewage sludge in which heavy metals typically make up only 0 5 2 of the dry weight and reaching 6 in some cases pathak et al 2009 these metals are in the form of metal sulfides metal oxides hydroxides etc and can be solubilized via the direct and indirect mechanisms mentioned above due to the decrease in ph marchioretto 2003 the removal of metals from municipal sewage sludge improves the opportunities for land application where soil metal accumulation is typically the limiting factor wong and henry 1983 used a ferrooxidans in the bioleaching of anaerobic digested sludge they reported solubilization of 65 cu 78 ni 86 cd and 87 zn from the sludge in 8 days with the optimum initial ph of 4 and the optimum temperatures ranging from 25 to 30 c a coculture of a ferrooxidans atcc 19859 and a thiooxidans achieved about 10 higher solubilization of heavy metals than a pure culture of a ferrooxidans atcc 19859 in anaerobic digested sludge tyagi et al 1988 bioleaching of aerobic waste sludge using a ferrooxidans has also been studied high solubilization of the metals was achieved in 1 2 days in a batch reactor and 47 80 cu 42 60 ni and 40 71 cd were leached out couillard and chartier 1991 a mixed culture of indigenous sob for metal solubilization was also tested in 23 different sewages fresh aerated sludge aerated digested sludge and anaerobic digested sludge and favourable results were also obtained generally a ph ranging from 1 to approximately 4 and a temperature between 20 and 40 c are favourable which are also the optimum growth conditions for most acidophilic sulfur bacteria leachate containing metal ions was obtained after the bioleaching process thus a subsequent process for the removal and recovery of metals from leachate is required for recovering metals from the leachate many methods such as precipitation adsorption biosorption ion exchange solvent extraction and electrochemical technology can be options pathak et al 2009 sulfide as a preferred metal precipitant can be provided by sulfidogenic bioreactors which has already been implemented in the recovery of metals from acid mine drainage e g sulfateq the precipitate is usually separated from the liquid by sedimentation flotation or membrane filtration marchioretto 2003 bioleaching facilitated by acidophilic sulfur bacteria and the integrated process for metal recovery from waste sludge are believed to be a cost effective and eco friendly technology because the participation of chemotrophic sob does not require external dosage of carbon source and vigorous sterilization is not needed in the process due the low ph achieved pathak et al 2009 5 4 polyhydroxyalkanoates polyhydroxyalkanoates phas are thermoplastic or elastoplastic polyester materials with melting points ranging between 40 and 180 c as they are also biodegradable and biocompatible they have received growing interest for bioplastics production especially in the biomedical field phas are produced by a wide range of bacteria as internal storage polymers that can act as carbon substrates for growth interest is now growing in the use of photosynthetic cultures for the generation of phas to avoid aeration a major energy consumer and cost component in the pha production process fradinho et al 2013a samantaray et al 2013 anoxygenic phototrophs provide greater promise due to their ability to accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate phb at moderate levels mas and van gemerden 1995 higuchi takeuchi et al 2016 and their ability to produce phas under continuous feast conditions fradinho et al 2016 the former ability comes from the commonly cyclic variations in carbon nutrients and energy light in typical environments inhabited by gsb and psb such as tidal flats mas and van gemerden 1995 while the latter ability arises from anoxygenic phototrophs unique feature of using pha generation to dissipate reducing power studies to date indicate that psb widely accumulate phb mas and van gemerden 1995 while the gsb like chloroflexus can also do so provided hydrogen is present due to the reductive tca cycle utilized by chlorobi it is unable to synthesize phb sirevâg 1995 to date specific studies of gsb and psb for pha generation are limited liebergesell et al 1991 provided a comprehensive study of 15 strains six genera of psb and their phb production capabilities the highest pha content achieved was 83 with thiocystis violacea higuchi takeuchi et al 2016 investigated the pha storage capabilities of three psb along with nine pnsb all three psb accumulated pha when fed acetate under nitrogen limited conditions thiohalocapsa marina thiohaeococcus mangrove and marichromatium bheemilicum each accumulated a maximum of 16 18 pha with m bheemilicum accumulating 200 mg pha l of culture for all three psb the polymers produced consisted of 3hb homopolyester the pha was observed to have a high molecular weight between 72 and 994 103 g mol which is beneficial for increased mechanical strength of the pha fradinho et al 2013a 2013b 2016 ran a number of experiments on photosynthetic mixed cultures for pha production microbial analysis in their studies indicated a large gammaproteobacteria group with only a small community of pnsb suggesting that psb which could not be detected due to a lack of psb fluorescent in situ hybridization probes may be the dominant organism alternating light conditions were used in their study where the feast phase occurred in the dark which selected for anoxygenic phototrophs over algae this doubled the pha production rate and increased the pha content of the culture from 20 to 30 fradinho et al 2013b light availability was shown to be a critical factor in achieving these results but were comparable to levels achievable by natural sunlight these most recent results of photosynthetic anoxygenic pha production are promising where the pha content is still low but approaching that of aerobic heterotrophic feast famine cultures and the yield per carbon substrate is similar or better 6 conclusion owing to the widespread industrial and environmental applications biological sulfide oxidation has been extensively investigated all large scale applications of biological sulfide oxidation to date are chemotrophic systems because the simple energy and nutrient requirement and relatively high sulfide oxidizing efficiency of chemotrophs enable an easier implementation over a wider scope than those of phototrophs the metabolic diversity of chemotrophic sob links the sulfide oxidation to both nitrogen and phosphorous cycles allowing this set of organisms a wide range of emerging applications in waste remediation particularly in wastewater treatment however more technical practices especially large scale implementations are required additionally the electroactivity of sulfur bacteria offers a new opportunity for utilizing the high electron donating capacity of sulfide for energy generation and valuable chemicals synthesis opportunities for resource recovery like acquiring metals and pha have also emerged however applications of the sulfur bacteria are certainly not limited to those discussed in this article and future research could lead to the further development utilizing these versatile microorganisms acknowledgement the research was supported by the national

19406,sulfide prevails in both industrial and municipal waste streams and is one of the most troublesome issues with waste handling various technologies and strategies have been developed and used to deal with sulfide for decades among which biological means make up a considerable portion due to their low operation requirements and flexibility sulfur bacteria play a vital role in these biotechnologies in this article conventional biological approaches dealing with sulfide and functional microorganisms are systematically reviewed linking the sulfur cycle with other nutrient cycles such as nitrogen or phosphorous and with continued focus of waste remediation by sulfur bacteria has led to emerging biotechnologies furthermore opportunities for energy harvest and resource recovery based on sulfur bacteria are also discussed the electroactivity of sulfur bacteria indicates a broad perspective of sulfur based bioelectrochemical systems in terms of bioelectricity production and bioelectrochemical synthesis the considerable pha accumulation high yield and anoxygenic growth conditions in certain phototrophic sulfur bacteria could provide an interesting alternative for bioplastic production in this review new merits of biological sulfide oxidation from a traditional environmental management perspective as well as a waste to resource perspective are presented along with their potential applications keywords biological sulfur oxidation sulfur bacteria wastewater treatment energy and resource recovery 1 introduction sulfur is one of the most abundant elements in nature the major sulfur deposits are present as gypsum caso4 metal sulfide fes2 and elemental sulfur s0 in the earth s crust and as sulfate so4 2 in seawater canfield and farquhar 2012 diverse intermediate valence states result in a complex sulfur cycle which can be driven chemically and biologically steudel 2003 muyzer and stams 2008 increasing anthropogenic activities has created a significant imbalance of the sulfur cycle leading to several sulfur related environmental issues such as odor nuisance corrosion sulfide toxicity and acid rain around the world lens and kuenen 2001 pikaar et al 2014 these human activities are predominantly industrial and include petroleum refining henshaw et al 1999 tang et al 2009 pulp and paper manufacturing wani et al 1999 janssen et al 2009 food processing livestock farming chung et al 2001 mining vera et al 2013 and natural gas processing tang et al 2009 all of which result in the discharge of considerable quantities of sulfide hs in wastewaters and hydrogen sulfide h2s in gas streams several urban water cycle processes also contribute to sulfide production such as anaerobic digestion for biogas production pokorna and zabranska 2015 sulfate laden wastewater treatment hao et al 2014 and extensive utilization of sulfate containing flocculants e g alum for potable water purification rauch and kleidorfer 2014 to overcome the challenges due to hs h2s several technologies for sulfur pollution remediation have been developed and practiced over the past decades including conventional physicochemical based processes such as alkanolamine claus holmes stretford and lo cat iliuta and larachi 2003 krishnakumar et al 2005 and biological processes such as thiopaq process paques the netherlands and sulfothane veolia france the physicochemical processes are developed specifically for the treatment of gaseous sulfide streams or large volumes of polluted aqueous stream with high sulfide concentrations tang et al 2009 however most of the physicochemical technologies require high chemical dosages and consume energy heavily resulting in high operational costs especially for small scale applications sulfide loading below 100 t day gabriel and deshusses 2003 syed et al 2006 klok et al 2013 in contrast biological approaches have demonstrated attractive advantages no addition of catalysts needed low sludge yield and the potential recovery of elemental sulfur more importantly they can be operated at ambient temperature and pressure and they produce smaller volumes of contaminated byproduct streams resulting in safer operations and easier waste disposal management these advantages also lead to significantly reduced energy consumption with similar or improved efficiency over physicochemical methods 99 removal jensen and webb 1995 henshaw and zhu 2001 biological technologies are therefore preferred for the treatment of low and medium strength sulfide laden waste streams buisman et al 1989 sercu et al 2005 the two main categories of biological sulfide removal systems are phototrophic and chemotrophic based on the metabolism of the bacteria involved phototrophs capture light energy for oxidizing sulfur compounds while chemotrophs obtain their metabolic energy by oxidizing sulfur directly in conjunction with other chemicals chemotrophs are the most prevalent organism applied in commercial biotechnologies due to their flexibility in a wide range of environmental conditions e g ph and temperature independence of light conditions allowing more compact reactors and high sulfide tolerance lens and kuenen 2001 widespread chemoautotrophic metabolism among sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob explains their dominance in the treatment of sulfide laden wastewaters containing low levels of organics and high concentrations of inorganic reduced sulfur compounds smet et al 1998 hao et al 2014 their metabolic diversity also ensures a stable performance even when the system fluctuates biological processes for the treatment of undesirable sulfur compounds and factors influencing their performance have been thoroughly reviewed by syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 and pokorna and zabranska 2015 notably for desulfurization of gas and the combined denitrification and desulfurization of wastewater this review not only focuses on microbiology and present applications of biological sulfide oxidation in wastewater treatment but also explores emerging opportunities for biological sulfur oxidation owing to the versatility of sulfur bacteria with a focus on energy and resource recovery it is intended that the review will update the reader on recent knowledge and spur further research and development to extend the application scope of biological sulfur oxidation biotechnology 2 sulfur bacteria biological transformations of sulfur are complicated due to the wide oxidation states of sulfur and the diverse microbial organisms involved in the sulfur cycle madigan and martinko 2014 the two main groups of microorganisms involved in the biological sulfur cycle are sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sob srb use oxidized sulfur compounds e g so4 2 so3 2 and s0 as electron acceptors and produce sulfide while oxidizing organics for energy generation and cell growth see muyzer and stams 2008 and hao et al 2014 for comprehensive reviews on srb sob on the other hand use reduced forms of sulfur as electron donors and are categorized into two groups based on their energy source and growth conditions 1 phototrophic sulfur bacteria and 2 chemotrophic colorless sulfur bacteria 2 1 phototrophic sulfur bacteria phototrophic sob are characterized by performing sulfur based anoxygenic photosynthesis under anaerobic conditions they acquire electrons and hydrogen from reduced sulfur compounds using light energy and fix inorganic carbon for cell growth syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 identified by their phenotypic properties such as color phototrophic sob can be predominantly classified into green sulfur bacteria gsb encompassing several key genera including chlorobium prosthecochloris ancalochloris pelodictyon and chloroherpeton and purple sulfur bacteria psb composed of genera such as thiospirillum thiorhodovibrio chromatium thiocystis thioalkalicoccus thiorhodococcus thiocapsa thiococcus thiodictyon and thiopedia imhoff 1995 frigaard and dahl 2008 natural habitats for phototrophic sob are usually aquatic environments in which reduced sulfur compounds and penetrated light are available in the anoxic layers van gemerden and mas 1995 overmann 2008 as well as supratidal salt flats and marshes trüper 1970 fernandez et al 2016 all gsb are strictly anaerobic and obligately photoautotrophic psb are more versatile in that they grow not only photoautotrophically but photoheterotrophically as well gaining carbon from organic compounds in the presence of high organic compound loads e g in domestic wastewater streams psb often dominate over gsb van gemerden and mas 1995 frigaard and dahl 2008 frigaard 2016 and despite light being the main energy source for phototrophic sulfur bacteria some psb like thiocapsa roseopersicina demonstrate chemolithotrophic growth in the absence of light friedrich et al 2001 both gsb and psb acquire energy by employing light harvesting pigments such as bacteriochlorophylls and carotenoids from which they also acquire their colors light is harvested through these pigments and then transferred to reaction centers leading to photophosphorylation and atp generation madigan and martinko 2014 the different pigments are responsible for the light absorption properties table 1 which allow the maximal use of the available energy by the biofilm microbial community in the electromagnetic spectrum and enables multiple phototroph phenotypes to coexist in the same habitat in gsb light harvesting pigments are enriched in chlorosomes and the dense arrays of bacteriochlorophyll on these chlorosomes absorb light energy the light energy passes through a fenna matthews olson fmo protein frigaard and dahl 2008 madigan and martinko 2014 on its way to reaction centers commonly bacteriochlorophyll a located at the cytoplasmic membrane in contrast to gsb the light harvesting pigments of psb are attached to proteins and form photocomplexes each consisting of tens of pigment molecules clustering around reaction center pigments due to the more effective light accepting structure of chlorosomes gsb can grow even under conditions of severely limited light and show a higher light utilization efficiency than psb furthermore brown colored gsb e g chlorobium phaeobacteroides can acquire energy for proliferation and growth from lower light intensities than green colored gsb e g chlorobium limicola since carotenoids of brown species can efficiently capture the light in the 450 550 nm wavelength range that reaches lower water zone imhoff 2014 a stable population of a brown colored chlorobium strain has been found at a point in the black sea where only 0 0007 light transmits from the surface manske et al 2005 other than light energy anoxygenic photosynthesis in gsb and psb requires reduced sulfur species serving as electron donors to produce reducing power for inorganic carbon fixation electrons are extracted from reduced sulfur species via a sulfur oxidation enzymatic system and then transferred to the electron transfer chains as will be discussed in section 2 3 below frigaard and dahl 2008 provide a more comprehensive discussion of sulfur oxidation biochemistry and electron transport when sulfide is the initial electron donor it is first oxidized to s0 and then further to so4 2 given sufficient energy madigan and martinko 2014 the van niel curve is commonly used to describe the relationship between light irradiation intensity and sulfide concentration fig 1 cork et al 1985 this curve indicates the amount of light energy required to oxidize a given concentration of sulfide to s0 and is defined by eq 1 1 2 h 2 s c o 2 l i g h t 2 s 0 c h 2 o c a r b o h y d r a t e h 2 o under limited light intensity and sufficient co2 s0 will accumulate when excessive sulfide is present with sufficient light sulfide can be completely oxidized to so4 2 see eq 2 2 h 2 s 2 c o 2 2 h 2 o l i g h t s o 4 2 2 c h 2 o c a r b o h y d r a t e h 2 the specific sulfide oxidation rate is subject to the growth of phototrophic sob which in turn is dependent on the incident irradiance exceeding a certain threshold growth and specific sulfide oxidation rate increase with the irradiation intensity until photoinhibition induced by overirradiation sets in however due to the diversity of sob and the environmental conditions in which they are found the magnitude of irradiation that each system can tolerate will differ hurse et al 2008 other than gsb and psb several other groups of phototrophic bacteria exist that do not rely primarily on sulfur oxidation for metabolism but are capable of sulfide oxidation to some degree cyanobacteria commonly known as blue green algae are a group of phototrophic bacteria which conduct oxygenic photosynthesis recent findings have demonstrated that at least some organisms within this group can switch between anoxygenic i e sulfide oxidizing and oxygenic photosynthesis klatt et al 2015 this feature is controlled by sulfide concentration with oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis occurring simultaneously to maintain an overall maximum rate of photosynthesis klatt et al 2015 such ability could have provided an ecological advantage in the redox stratified upper zones of oceans in the proterozoic eon klatt et al 2016 purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb within the alphaproteobacteria can oxidize sulfur as well dahl 2017 these organisms are typically capable of photoautotrophic photoheterotrophic and chemotrophic growth with the preferred mode being photoheterotrophic imhoff et al 2005 for these reasons they are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems although not because they are performing sulfide oxidation other sulfide oxidizing organisms worth mentioning are the filamentous phototrophic members of the chloroflexi phylum and heliobacteria dahl 2017 the ability to oxidize sulfur exists widely among a variety of microorganisms which is attributed to horizontal gene transfer madigan and martinko 2014 leading to emerging applications other than sulfur removal which will be introduced in section 5 2 2 chemotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria chemotrophic sob are commonly referred to as colorless sulfur bacteria without needing light they oxidize almost all reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide polysulfide elemental sulfur polythionate thiosulfate sulfite and in some cases organic sulfur compounds such as methanethiol dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide using various electron acceptors e g o2 or no3 madigan and martinko 2014 2 2 1 energy and carbon sources for chemotrophic sob physiologically the colorless sob can be categorized into four groups based on the energy or carbon source they utilize these groups are 1 obligate chemolithotrophs which obtain metabolic energy purely from the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds fixing inorganic carbon as the carbon source 2 facultative chemolithotrophs which grow with inorganic sulfur compounds as the energy source while use the inorganic carbon or organics as the carbon source 3 chemolithoheterotrophs which generate energy from the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds but rely on organics for carbon and 4 chemoorganoheterotrophs which are primarily heterotrophic but oxidize sulfur for detoxification of by reducing hydrogen peroxide produced by metabolism robertson and kuenen 2006 muyzer et al 2013 pokorna and zabranska 2015 oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds is the major feature of these bacteria however the various metabolic categories such as facultative chemolithotroph chemolithoheteroph and chemoorganotheterotoph that sob belong to demonstrate that many of sob can also rely on electron sources other than sulfur for example acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans can acquire energy and electrons from reduction of fe2 and h2 muyzer et al 2013 like other microorganisms sob can also be classified as acidophiles e g acidithiobacillus neutrophiles e g thiobacillus and thiothrix and alkaliphiles e g thioalkalivibrio and thioalkalispira according their affinity of ph and psychrophiles e g thiovulum mesophiles e g thioalkalivibrio and thermophiles e g thermothrix according to temperature therefore the physiological diversity of chemotrophic sob enables them to flourish in a variety of extreme environments for example the acidophiles are employed for bioleaching of heavy metals vera et al 2013 and the alkaliphiles are used for removing sulfide absorbed in basic solutions van den bosch et al 2007 more comprehensive information of chemotrophic sob is given in table 2 2 2 2 electron acceptors for chemotrophic sob 2 2 2 1 oxygen o2 is universally used as an electron acceptor for the growth of colorless chemotrophic sob muyzer et al 2013 representative genera are thiobacillus acidithiobacillus sulfolobus thiovulum thiothrix and thiospira table 2 robertson and kuenen 2006 the overall biological chemotrophic oxidation of sulfide in the presence of o2 is described in eqs 3 5

commonly an o s ratio slightly higher than stoichiometry typically around 0 7 is required for s0 to dominate as the final product while a high o s ratio 1 results in significant formation of so4 2 an o s ratio lower than 0 6 results mainly in the formation of s2o3 2 through abiotic chemical oxidation which outcompetes biological oxidation under low dissolved oxygen do conditions janssen et al 1995 van den bosch et al 2007 klok et al 2012 however when no so4 2 is formed the growth of some sob e g thioalkalivibrio versutus would be inhibited van den bosch et al 2007 because additional energy is needed to drive reverse electron flow see section 2 3 below for biomass synthesis during oxidation from hs to so4 2 klok et al 2012 madigan and martinko 2014 do control is one of the methods applied to realize selective biological oxidation when the reactor is operated in continuous flow mode with a relatively stable sulfide concentration table 4 buisman et al 1990 janssen et al 1997 lohwacharin and annachhatre 2010 do values around 0 1 mg l are commonly applied to constrain chemotrophic sulfur oxidation to elemental sulfur with a yield exceeding 90 of the oxidized sulfide although many studies have used higher concentrations successfully buisman et al 1990 however the dynamic nature of the do in the system due to continuous consumption by sulfide causes difficulties in maintaining the o s ratio effectively janssen et al 1998 krishnakumar et al 2005 as an alternative oxidation reduction potential orp determined by both sulfide concentration and do has proven to be a more feasible indicator for controlling chemotrophic sulfur oxidation the optimal orp for high sulfide removal and sulfur recovery differed significantly across previous studies ranging from 400 mv to 137 mv as summarized in table 3 which could be ascribed to differences in functional bacteria media composition and other biochemical reactions taking place when orp is lower than 420 mv no sulfur can be obtained because the orp is dominated by a high sulfide concentration and the biological reactions become inhibited klok et al 2012 due to its universality orp control is extensively practiced in biogas desulfurization and natural gas processing to achieve sulfide removal and sulfur recovery 2 2 2 2 nitrate and nitrite although chemotrophic sob are primarily aerobic some species of the genera thiobacillus thiomicrospira and thiosphaera table 2 display different metabolic traits growing anoxically by using no3 or no2 as the terminal electron acceptor which is commonly known as autotrophic denitrification takai et al 2006 kellermann and griebler 2009 shao et al 2010 shapleigh 2013 reactions related to simultaneous sulfur oxidation and denitrification are listed below dolejs et al 2015

oxygen and oxidized nitrogen compounds as electron acceptors e g thiobacillus denitrificans and thioalkalivibrio denitrificans brannan and caldwell 1980 sorokin et al 2001 muyzer et al 2013 madigan and martinko 2014 nonetheless some are strict anaerobes e g sulfurimonas denitrificans which can only use no3 and no2 as electron acceptors sorokin et al 2004 sievert et al 2008 in terms of nitrogen reduction the series of reactions are similar to those for traditional heterotrophic denitrifiers species such as thiobacillus denitrificans paracoccus versutus and sulfurimonas denitrificans can perform complete denitrification from no3 to n2 while others like thiobacillus thioparus and thiobacillus delicatus only reduce no3 to no2 robertson and kuenen 2006 muyzer et al 2013 as they can remove sulfur and nitrogen compounds simultaneously autotrophic denitrifying sob are employed in sulfate laden wastewater treatment and groundwater purification processes sierra alvarez et al 2007 shao et al 2010 like the o s ratio the molar ratio of nitrate sulfide n s also affects the end products of sulfur based denitrification table 3 krishnakumar and manilal 1999 reyes avila et al 2004 cardoso et al 2006 based on eq 8 when the n s ratio is maintained at 1 6 the complete oxidation of sulfide to sulfate and the complete reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas can proceed with the highest energy yield however when n s 4 eq 9 excess nitrate or n s 1 eq 10 insufficient nitrate the end products are sulfate and nitrite or elemental sulfur and nitrite respectively when n s 0 4 eq 6 the end products are elemental sulfur and nitrogen gas cardoso et al 2006 mahmood et al 2007 an et al 2010 the production of ammonia was observed when n s 0 35 indicating a severe nitrate deficiency dolejs et al 2015 such a reaction could be attributed to the genus beggiatoa which is able to carry out ammonification reduction of nitrate to ammonia shao et al 2010 however even if n s is maintained at a suitable ratio sudden changes in loading can significantly affect the efficiency of removing n and s temporarily cai et al 2008 in addition sulfide oxidation rate could be inhibited by high concentrations of sulfide an approximately 21 fold decrease in the sulfide oxidation rate and the denitrification rate have been observed for a sulfide concentration increase from 80 to 320 mg s l cardoso et al 2006 this may be attributed to the inhibition of no3 reduction to no2 by sulfide the first step of denitrification cardoso et al 2006 the accumulation of no2 under excess no3 can also inhibit the reaction rate due to nitrite toxicity oh et al 2000 2 3 biological sulfur oxidation mechanism hs and s0 are the most common electron donors for gsb psb and colorless sulfur bacteria fig 2 kelly 1999 muyzer et al 2013 madigan and martinko 2014 several sulfur oxidation pathways were observed and reported amongst these three sob groups however significant distinction of the pathways between these groups does not exist due to the horizontal gene transfer that is these pathways distribute universally among gsb psb and colorless sulfur bacteria ghosh and dam 2009 generally s0 is first formed in the oxidation of hs and this step is suggested to be carried out by flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase fcsd or sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr and their subunits the electrons are then transferred to the membrane bounded cytochrome c pool or the quinone pool respectively griesbeck et al 2000 beller et al 2006 valdés et al 2008 frigaard and dahl 2008 muyzer et al 2011 when employing fcsd or sqr the oxidation reduction state of cytochrome c and quinone which is subject to the sulfide to oxidant ratio determines the end product of biological sulfide oxidation s0 is the major product when a low oxidant level occurs visser et al 1997 klok et al 2013 s0 produced intracellularly as in the case of most phototrophic psb and chemotrophic sob like beggiatoa or extracellularly as in the case of most phototrophic gsb and chemotrophic sob like thiobacillus can serve as an energy and electron storage substance kleinjan et al 2003 schulz and schulz 2005 frigaard and dahl 2008 when the supply of sulfide is depleted additional energy can be generated from the oxidation of s0 to so4 2 in the oxidation of s0 to so4 2 so3 2 is formed as an intermediate fig 2 as the first step in this step a sulfur oxygenase reductase sor is believed to be responsible for oxidizing s0 to so3 2 friedrich et al 2001 the subsequent oxidation from so3 2 to so4 2 primarily uses one of the two confirmed sub pathways the first employs the sulfite oxidase enzyme this enzyme oxidizes so3 2 and transfers the electrons to cytochrome c in the other sub pathway sulfur chemolithotrophs oxidize so3 2 to so4 2 through the reverse activity of the enzyme aps adenosine phosphosulfate reductase which is an essential enzyme in the metabolism of srb to reduce so4 2 to so3 2 this reaction yields one energy rich phosphate bond when amp adenosine monophosphate is converted to adp adenosine diphosphate madigan and martinko 2014 other than these two pathways a third pathway for complete sulfur oxidation is the sox sulfur oxidation system without the intermediate so3 2 formation the sox system exists widely in nature consisting of a series of enzymes and occurs in both phototrophic and chemotrophic sob ghosh and dam 2009 madigan and martinko 2014 for more comprehensive information of biochemical sulfur oxidation pathways readers can refer to griesbeck et al 2000 frigaard and dahl 2008 and ghosh and dam 2009 electrons delivered from reduced sulfur compounds enter the electron transport chain fig 3 via the sulfur oxidation enzymatic system depending on the e0 of the electron donor couple and the corresponding sulfur oxidizing enzyme electrons enter the electron transfer chain at different levels of electron carriers and are transported through the chain generating a proton motive force that forms atp these levels are flavoprotein e0 0 2 v which accepts electrons from hs at quinone e0 0 v or at cytochrome c e0 0 3 v which accepts electrons from s0 and s2o3 2 in autotrophic both photoautotrophic and chemoautotrophic growth reducing power nadh is essential for co2 fixation reverse electron flow dotted line in fig 3 in psb and colorless sulfur bacteria is necessary for production of nadh because the potential of the primary electron acceptors flavoprotein and quinone is more positive than the nad nadh couple in the electron chain of gsb ferredoxin with a more negative e0 than nadh is produced through light driven reactions to generate reducing power madigan and martinko 2014 being an energy consuming process the reverse electron transfer lowers the energy efficiency of sulfur oxidation electrons are recycled within the activated state and ground state of reaction centers in phototrophs with net electron consumption only when reducing agents e g nadh are produced to fix co2 however continuous net electron consumption from an external electron donor e g hs is required in chemotrophs electrons from sulfide are transferred for both energetic purpose and co2 fixation in the chemotrophic electron transfer chain indicating that chemotrophs possess better sulfide oxidizing capability than phototrophs since phototrophs consume sulfide only when new cell mass is built prescott et al 2008 ghosh and dam 2009 3 biological gas desulfurization as aforementioned sulfide is present in various waste streams creating many environmental problems the versatility of sob offers an energy efficient and cost effective way of treating sulfide compared with physicochemical approaches klok et al 2012 end products of sob based processes sulfur or sulfate are non hazardous and sulfate can be discharged directly into the sea or brackish receiving waters for freshwater the sulfide is selectively oxidized to elemental sulfur which can be separated and recovered from the liquid phase lens and kuenen 2001 muyzer et al 2013 the recovered sulfur can be used as a raw material in industry and agriculture to produce sulfuric acid sulfur fertilizers and fungicides chung et al 2013 h2s reaches concentrations ranging from 500 ppmv to 20 000 ppmv in biogas from anaerobic digestion or industrial gas streams in natural gas processing pokorna and zabranska 2015 removal of h2s is essential to control corrosion and odor issues during transportation and distribution and to prevent so2 emission to the atmosphere upon combustion burgess et al 2001 mousavi et al 2006 cost effective biological methods can be utilized under a wide range of conditions and applications tang et al 2009 pokorna and zabranska 2015 biogas and industrial gas desulfurization usually take place in one of three types of systems biofilters biotrickling filters or bioscrubbers as shown in fig 4 chen et al 2008 for biogas production these external reactors are important to avoid the disturbance of methanogens resulting from direct air dosage within the digester a summary of these three technologies along with their advantages and disadvantages are provided in table 4 3 1 biofilters biofilters fig 4a are the simplest type of gas desulfurization system and have been in use for almost a century van groenestijn and hesselink 1993 a moist h2s gas stream passes through a media bed on which sob and other organisms reside and perform purification performance of the biofilters is influenced by many operational parameters such as bed medium moisture content temperature ph nutrient and oxygen levels and the development of biofilm allegue et al 2012 a suitable bed material should have a large specific area and large porosity low pressure loss and low cost it should be lightweight and able to retain water packing moisture content between 40 and 60 nutrients and indigenous microorganisms and to absorb gas odor cho et al 2000 natural organic materials such as composts woodchips bark soil and peats rather than activated carbons zeolites and polymer supports are often used in biofilters aizpuru et al 2003 composts and peat are preferred materials due to their native microorganism consortia and high performance alexander 1999 khammar et al 2004 ph gradients occurring in the media resulting from sulfuric acid formation during the degradation of h2s and inefficient mixing are critical issues for all biofilters oh and bartha 1994 mudliar et al 2010 measures to address these issues include adding alkaline compounds using a basic carrier that itself has alkaline properties selection of acid tolerant microbes and washing the filter media periodically oxygen level within the bed is often controlled by injecting air directly into gas streams typically 5 10 of the volume however the optimal value varies a lot with different bed materials a high oxygen level results in the formation of sulfate and alleviates the clogging problem but lowers the quality of the off gas if this is an intended product of the process regarding the development of biofilm two main aspects are primary the thickness and the acclimated microbes the average thickness of biofilm is around 1 mm in the biofilters which is an appropriate level that provides enough biomass while not hindering mass transfer sob such as thiobacillus pseudomonas and acidothiobacillus etc are usually enriched in the biofilm for sulfide removal syed et al 2006 mudliar et al 2010 biofilters are suitable for low loading rates and low pollutant concentrations mainly due to their limited buffering capacity and issues with moisture control under high air flow rates nikiema et al 2007 mudliar et al 2010 a large footprint is required due to long residence times yang and allen 1994 demonstrated a maximum rate of 130 g s m3 h for a compost biofilter across a range of concentrations from 120 to 2000 ppmv where full removal was achieved so long as the residence time was adjusted to maintain this loading where other volatile organic compounds including organic sulfur compounds are treated longer residence times are required togna and singh 1994 3 2 biotrickling filters biotrickling filters differ from biofilters in their continuous feeding of the nutrient solution making environmental conditions easier to be controlled another difference is the packing bed material inert material is commonly used in biotrickling filters elias et al 2002 mudliar et al 2010 fig 4b plastic supports granular activated carbons and porous ceramics are typically chosen cox and deshusses 2002 lee et al 2006 biotrickling filters avoid buffering and acidification issues through the continual washout of acid reaction products by continuous trickling allegue et al 2012 however due to the continual supply of nutrients and the higher loading rates than those in biofilters other concerns exist such as increasing back pressure and the emergence of anaerobic zones resulting from clogging caused by biomass growth and sulfur accumulation iliuta et al 2005 these concerns may be partially alleviated by oxidizing sulfide to sulfate fortuny et al 2010 choosing suitable biomass carriers cho et al 2000 promoting protozoal predation cox and deshusses 1999 or designing the system to allow for periodic backwash smith et al 1996 many commercial biotrickling filter systems for sulfide removal have been implemented the biopuric process veolia france is one such technology and was first developed in germany in the 1980s mckinsey 2003 this process can achieve 90 98 h2s removal at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 15 000 ppmv with loading rates up to 200 kg h2s d about two thirds h2s oxidization into elemental sulfur occurs and elemental sulfur will accumulate on the media which is then periodically removed from the reactor other commercial systems include sulfurexbf dmt environmental technology the netherlands and biogascleaner biogasclean denmark 3 3 bioscrubbers bioscrubber systems applied for removal of h2s from gas streams are usually composed of two reactors see fig 4c nishimura and yoda 1997 mesa et al 2002 krischan et al 2012 the first reactor a gas absorber is used to absorb h2s into liquid and unlike biofilters and biotrickling filters does not aim to develop a biofilm preferentially either an alkaline liquid containing hco3 and co3 2 or an acidic medium containing fe3 pagella et al 1996 is used to enhance the process limiting mass transfer step in the absorption the absorbing solution goes to the second reactor consisting of functional microorganisms e g thiobacillus and thioalkalivibrio and the effluent is recirculated to the absorption tower a sedimentation tank is commonly installed after the aerated reactor to separate s0 and o2 is usually used as the oxidant in wastewater treatment plants nitrification effluent containing no3 and no2 provides another alternative baspinar et al 2011 compared to biofilters and biotrickling filters bioscrubbers have the advantage of not requiring the injection of o2 and n2 into the biogas stream although the investment is higher in addition they have been demonstrated to handle fluctuating loads significantly better most likely due to the longer retention time of the pollutants in the activated sludge reactor lebrero et al 2011 furthermore environmental conditions are easier to be controlled within a completed mixed reactor which ensure a stable performance optimum conditions for different end products are discussed in section 2 other advantages and disadvantages are highlighted in table 4 the thiopaq process paques the netherlands and sulfothane veolia france are two very similar and worldwide applied technologies based on a bioscrubber design for gas desulfurization typically capable of achieving 99 sulfide removal cline et al 2003 both the thiopaq and sulfothane processes first contact the h2s containing gas stream with an alkaline solution the sulfide containing scrubbing liquid is then transferred to a micro oxygenated reactor where the absorbed sulfide is mostly converted biologically to elemental sulfur by a consortium of chemotrophic sob typically dominated by the haloalkaliphilic thioalkalivibrio janssen et al 2009 in the thiopaq process less than 3 5 of the h2s is converted to sulfate van den bosch 2008 less than 4 ppm of h2s remains in the effluent under high pressure 4 bars operation when treating natural gas containing h2s of 2000 ppm and less than 25 ppm of effluent h2s are achieved under low pressure 4 bars the most significant disadvantage of the thiopaq process is the need to precisely control the system and the relatively high investment allegue et al 2012 in both systems a liquid sulfur fertilizer is produced from the settler which can also be used as a fungicide 4 emerging and niche applications of biological sulfur oxidation apart from the well established biological gas desulfurization process there are still many processes reported in both small and large scales due to the versatility of both phototrophic and chemotrophic sob in this section several emerging niches of sob application are discussed 4 1 phototrophic sulfide oxidation although not as popular as chemotrophic sob phototrophic sob still offer a number of advantages for removal of sulfide from waste streams including the avoidance of explosion risks encountered by mixing ch4 with o2 pokorna and zabranska 2015 and using natural light and low energy light emitting diodes led to provide energy savings over aerobic systems kim et al 1996 syed and henshaw 2005 furthermore led illumination provides great flexibility and control of the process through selection of only certain wavelengths corresponding to organisms of interest with a well regulated light source and proper reactor designs the oxidation product is limited to s0 following the correlation presented by the van niel curve and can also be used to control the overall reaction rates nevertheless in terms of energy efficiency syed and henshaw 2005 suggested that use of an infrared bulb may be more energy efficient overall due its wider light spread and higher strength therefore illumination and design of the photobioreactor are the major factors determining the successful application of phototrophic sob an and kim 2000 hurse et al 2008 provide a detailed evaluation of the most suitable organism for phototrophic biological sulfur removal gsb species were found optimal due to their extracellular formation of elemental sulfur their ability to withstand high sulfide concentrations and their ability to remove sulfide under low light intensities however the optimum organisms could depend on the wastewater characteristics for instance industrial streams with both sulfide and thermal load may be equally suited to other thermophilic phototrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria such as members of chloroflexaceae hanada 2014 typical photobioreactors for the decomposition of sulfide using phototrophic sulfur bacteria include stirred tank reactors and phototube reactors syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 stirred tank reactors are commonly operated continuously for the gas phase and cyclically for treatment of the liquid phase the bacteria are suspended in liquid phase or immobilized on different carriers e g strontium alginate tygon tubes or raschig rings kim et al 1993 henshaw et al 1998 an and kim 2000 chlorobium thiosulfatophilum gsb cultivated in suspension or immobilized on alginate has been applied to oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur kim and chang 1991 in which attached cells consumed 30 less light energy than planktonic cells with a removal rate of 68 mg h2s l 1h 1 light penetration is the major concern of stirred tank reactors especially with high cell densities or elemental sulfur production an and kim 2000 sought to overcome this through the use of internal fibre optic cables for illumination achieving specific sulfide removal rates 8 5 times higher than their earlier work involving an externally illuminated reactor kim et al 1992 phototube reactors are another typical reactor design for the application of phototrophic sob transparent phototubes can be set horizontally vertically or spirally and the tubular configuration facilitates the control of retention time the bacteria grow in the form of biofilm on the inner walls of tubes and sulfide is oxidized to elemental sulfur kobayashi et al 1983 henshaw and zhu 2001 syed and henshaw 2003 satisfactory results have been obtained from lab scale studies with sulfide loading rates of 286 mg l 1h 1 and 92 95 of the oxidized sulfide transformed to elemental sulfur by the chlorobium thiosulfatophlium henshaw and zhu 2001 this rate is equivalent to the chemoheterotrophic removal rates achieved with colorless sulfur bacteria henshaw et al 1998 while sulfide removal photobioreactors possess some advantages several issues prevent their widespread uptake these include a lack of efficient ways to scale up particularly for tubular photobioreactors where many of the diameters found optimal in laboratory scale systems are not feasible for full scale systems especially with wastewaters containing solids syed and henshaw 2003 hurse and keller 2004a b the fact that vfas reduce overall sulfide oxidation rates hurse and keller 2005 which may limit the effectiveness in certain wastewaters and c potential challenges in recovering elemental sulfur while henshaw and co workers observed almost complete sulfide conversion to effluent elemental sulfur using short diameter tubular photobioreactors henshaw and zhu 2001 syed and henshaw 2003 elemental sulfur in the effluent was not observed with a flat plate design hurse and keller 2004a 2005 furthermore the latter authors had a notable discrepancy in their sulfur mass balance most plausibly associated with polysulfide formation instead although scale up issues have been significant in the deployment of this technology with no reported full scale installations garcia et al 2015 performed a small scale onsite pilot study using two 25 l photobioreactors for sulfide removal from a 360 l upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor however while successful at removing sulfide levels to less than 0 5 mg s l influent concentrations were only 1 6 mg s l and the hrt was 12 24 h highlighting the low volumetric rates currently achievable with larger reactors special reactor designs were also proposed for the scaling up of other photobioreactors for instance hurse and keller 2004b grew phototrophic biofilms on the exterior surface of transparent carriers e g light diffusing fiber or panels suspended in wastewater with such design favourable biomass concentration and high irradiated surface area per reactor volume can be ensured even if the reactor is enlarged 4 2 sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification the ability to carry out sulfur driven denitrification by a variety of sob leads to a wide range of applications the feasibility of integrating biogas desulfurization with autotrophic denitrification has been proved by some researchers the existing nitrification units provide nitrifying activated sludge containing no3 and no2 for the biogas desulfurization unit a sulfide removal efficiency exceeding 95 and a maximum removal rate of 2 4 kg s m 3d 1 were achieved at the optimum nitrified wastewater biogas ratio of 2 3 m3 m3 baspinar et al 2011 improved sulfide removal efficiency 98 was also obtained by bayrakdar et al 2016 by adding no3 into an up flow reactor designed for the desulfurization of biogas from a chicken manure digester however these attempts suffered from clogging of the reactors when elemental sulfur accumulated nitrate removal using elemental sulfur as an electron donor is also an alternative in wastewater treatment in which the readily biodegradable substrate is deficient such as groundwater sierra alvarez et al 2007 landfill leachate koenig and liu 1996 and leather and fertilizer processing wastewater manconi et al 2007 an average nitrate removal efficiency of 95 9 can be achieved in a sulfur limestone packing bed reactor sierra alvarez et al 2007 although an inevitable issue is the low mass transfer efficiency when using elemental sulfur zeng and zhang 2005 the application of a microbial approach reliant on autotrophic denitrifying sob has also emerged as an attractive option to handle domestic wastewater with low cod n ratios koenig and liu 1996 due to two major advantages 1 addition of an external organic substrate e g methanol is not needed reducing operation costs and 2 less sludge production shao et al 2010 moreover the sulfur oxidizing denitrification process demonstrated significant reductions in n2o emissions compared with heterotrophic denitrification using sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification with an n s molar ratio of 0 43 yang et al 2016 the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process is one such process for municipal wastewater treatment developed in hong kong wang et al 2009 lu et al 2011 wu et al 2016 the sani process is a new sulfur cycle based biological carbon and nutrient removal process and uses the sulfate originating from seawater toilet flushing as an electron carrier see fig 5 a the sani process has recently been scaled up to a 1000 m3 d demo plant wu et al 2016 not only is it able to meet local effluent standards it also achieved 60 70 less biological sludge production and 30 40 less space needed than conventional activated sludge plant wu et al 2016 however one drawback of this process is sulfur compounds remaining in the effluent potentially resulting in secondary sulfate reduction 4 3 biological sulfur oxidation associated phosphorous removal in recent decades a group of sob called large sulfur bacteria including the genera of thiomargarita thioploca and beggiatoa have been reportedly involved in phosphogenesis in coastal areas like chile and namibia schulz and schulz 2005 holmkvist et al 2010 these bacteria contain considerable amounts of intracellular polyphosphates due to their large size schulz 2006 teske and nelson 2006 and were found in remarkably high populations in areas associated with the most active modern phosphorite formation and in phosphorite rocks fossing et al 1995 schulz et al 1999 reimers et al 1990 bailey et al 2007 p release and p uptake similar to that performed by phosphorous accumulating organisms paos in wastewater treatment were observed for thiomargarita namibiensis in vitro thiomargarita took up carbon to synthesize glycogen powered by the breakdown of polyphosphate and the release of phosphorous under anaerobic conditions meanwhile sulfide was also taken in by cells and stored when electron acceptors o2 or no3 were available the intracellularly stored elemental sulfur and glycogen were oxidized and phosphate was accumulated as poly p schulz and schulz 2005 elemental sulfur was stored intracellularly as an energy reserve in parallel with polyphosphate when sulfide and electron acceptors o2 or no3 were supplied in surplus which was found to be a common energy strategy in many sobs madigan and martinko 2014 particularly large sulfur bacteria store no3 intracellularly in case of a shortage of electron acceptors which enables them to convert sulfide to elemental sulfur without external electron acceptors schulz and schulz 2005 a sulfur cycle associated enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr process was proposed recently by wu et al 2014 they provided evidence of a similar p uptake and release process to that found in large sulfur bacteria interestingly in the ebpr system mentioned above no large sulfur bacteria genera thiomargarita thioploca and beggiatoa or conventional phosphorus accumulating organisms paos e g accumulibacteria and tetrasphaera were detected while srb e g desulfobacter desulfobulbus and desulfuromonas and sob e g thiohalomonas thiotrichaceae and thiobacillus were enriched even though the environment and the operating conditions of the reactor were suitable for large sulfur bacteria to perform p uptake and p release further investigation revealed that the phosphorous removal may be attributed to the synergy of srb and sob in which srb provide sulfide through sulfate reduction and sob in the system may act in place of conventional paos to provide sulfur and poly p as the energy storage to perform phosphorus removal guo et al 2016 sob other than the large sulfur bacteria may also possess an ability to take in excess phosphorous since polyphosphate is employed as an energy store in a variety of organisms kornberg 1995 the necessary presence of sulfide for stable p removal offers evidence for the role of sulfur oxidation in this p removal for metabolic purposes guo et al 2016 however the exact p removal mechanism and organisms capable of conducting this process are still unclear requiring further research in another study thiothrix caldifontis was dominant in a sulfide fed ebpr system and displayed a mixotrophic lifestyle like large sulfur bacteria which facilitates p removal in wastewater lacking organics but rich in sulfide rubio rincón et al 2017 4 4 dye treatment dyes are a product of tanning and textile industries among others and pose a multifaceted threat due to their persistence typical toxicity and color the latter of which reduces light penetration and photosynthesis in receiving environments cervantes and dos santos 2011 anaerobic treatments especially sulfate reducing systems have been favoured over aerobic treatments in the past as most of dyes used in industry are azo dyes dos santos et al 2007 zeng et al 2017 the produced sulfide acts as an electron donor for azo dye reduction and is predominantly mediated by biologically produced redox mediators van der zee et al 2003 prato garcia et al 2013 little attention has been paid to the role of sulfide oxidizing bacteria presumably because the typical electron acceptors for sulfide oxidation such as oxygen and nitrate result in an oxidative reductive potential too high for azo reduction dos santos et al 2007 nevertheless both chlorobi and chloroflexi classes containing a substantial proportion of organisms capable of sulfide oxidation have frequently been observed in anaerobic sulfate reducing systems treating azo dyes sun et al 2013 zeng et al 2017 over the gradual startup and operation of an anoxygenic phototrophic rotating biological contactor system treating azo dye waste wang et al 2015 the community pigmentation changed from predominantly purple to green which was also correlated with an improvement in azo dye removal throughout the study this suggests that chlorobi identified in the microbial community was a significant organism in the performance of the system in another recent study of five textile wastewater plants and five activated sludge plants in belgium both chlorobi and chloroflexi were also identified as dominant groups in textile plants and elevated in number compared to the municipal activated sludge plants meerbergen et al 2017 therefore while the role of sulfide oxidizing organisms has not been thoroughly investigated in dye removal treatment systems their repeated occurrence along with demonstration of certain species capable of dye biodegradation warrants future investigations 5 opportunities for energy harvest and resource recovery in biological sulfur oxidation 5 1 sulfur recovery and reuse most biological sulfide removal processes tend to selectively oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur lens and kuenen 2001 fu and wang 2011 the produced elemental sulfur can be used as a raw material for sulfuric acid fertilizers and pesticide production chung et al 2013 however with the emergence of a series of modern technologies interest in using elemental sulfur as a raw feedstock material for other applications is increasing 5 1 1 li s fuel cells the growing need for high performance energy storage systems in recent years has been driving the development of high capacity rechargeable batteries lim et al 2015 among which li batteries are gaining attention of all the redox couples enabling rechargeable batteries the li s couple demonstrates the highest specific energy of 2600 wh kg 1 novák et al 1997 because the theoretical capacity of sulfur 1672 mah g 1 is the highest among all feasible solid compounds for cathodes yuan et al 2009 manthiram et al 2014 elemental sulfur can be incorporated directly into the electrode framework e g carbon to form a sulfur based cathode however currently a number of challenges exist such as the high resistance of sulfur and intermediate products e g polysulfide dissolved polysulfide shuttling between the anode and cathode during charge discharge cycling mikhaylik and akridge 2004 passivation of electrodes due to the conversion of sulfur to lithium sulfide causing structural and morphological changes in the electrode and repetitive dissolution and deposition of reactive species manthiram et al 2014 however with the continuing development of li s batteries a large amount of sulfur is required as raw feedstock material 5 1 2 potential sulfur consumption in the construction industry one emerging niche for sulfur incorporating materials with significant growth potential is the construction industry mixing elemental sulfur with aggregates to produce sulfur concrete was first reported in 1976 vroom 1981 microcrystalline sulfur and sulfur polymers can be used in mortars concretes and asphaltic paving materials sulfur concrete possesses many unique properties such as rapid strength development high ultimate strength low permeability and superior resistance to strong acids and saline solutions vroom 1981 ciak and harasymiuk 2013 mohamed et al 2015 the latter feature is particularly useful for wastewater applications notably sewer pipes where the technology has been demonstrated to be more corrosion resistant than portland cement concrete and sulfate resistant concrete mohamed et al 2015 the low permeability also leads to safer stabilization of hazardous wastes mohamed and el gamal 2010 however when elemental sulfur is used directly without modification high shrinkage occurs on cooling to ambient temperature resulting in distortion and unpredictable final dimensions on the other hand the durability of this type of material is poor under many conditions especially in moist environments and when subjected to thermal cycling the addition of organic polymers can increase the durability mohamed and el gamal 2010 5 1 3 biologically produced sulfur different from commercial crystalline sulfur sulfur produced from biological sulfide oxidation possesses special characteristics such as hydrophilicity and biological activity kleinjan et al 2003 numerous researchers have reported that biologically produced sulfur displays a stronger ability to dissolve sulfide ores than commercial sulfur due to its hydrophilic properties which accelerates sulfuric acid production during biological sulfide oxidation in the leaching processes tichý et al 1994 1996 seidel et al 2006 brierley and brierley 2013 moreover biologically produced sulfur can be used directly as a fertilizer lens and pol 2000 as was demonstrated with an oil bearing vegetable canola a 50 increase in grain yield was observed after the addition of biologically produced sulfur outperforming commercially available sulfur sources used in the same study cline et al 2003 moreover the sulfur limestone process using elemental sulfur to drive autotrophic denitrification for groundwater purification is restricted by a low reaction rate due to the low solubility of sulfur amend et al 2004 zeng and zhang 2005 the hydrophilicity of biologically produced sulfur may overcome this drawback by accelerating mass transfer 5 2 sulfur compound based microbial electrochemical systems microbial electrochemical cells mxcs also known as bioelectrochemical systems bess have received significant interest because of their ability to provide energy positive wastewater treatment using microbial fuel cells mfcs and value added product recovery at reduced energy input using microbial electrolysis cells mecs or microbial electrosynthesis cells mes while most studies have focused on electricity generation from organics in wastewater or conversion of these organics into hydrogen or methane bajracharya et al 2016 a limited number of studies have considered bes for sulfide abatement or use of sulfide as an electron donor sulfide oxidation was first reported in electrochemical cells using marine sediment mfcs where oxidation of both dissolved and solid phase sulfide compounds contributed to the production of currents tender et al 2002 ryckelynck et al 2005 sulfur oxidizers in anoxic sediments are known to utilize electron donors in the oxic interface through synergistic relationships with cable bacteria lovley 2017 the dominant sulfur associated microbial species first observed in the sulfide oxidizing anodes of these sediment mfcs were actually srb from the desulfobulbaceae family namely desulfobulbus and desulfocapsa which are known for sulfur disproportionation ryckelynck et al 2005 however the appearance of sor enzymes in some srb species like desulfurolobus ambivalens indicates a sulfur oxidizing ability kelly 1999 the species desulfubulbus propionacus has demonstrated the ability to transfer electrons directly to an electrode during sulfur oxidation holmes et al 2004 other organisms capable of both sulfide oxidation and direct electron transfer to electrodes include another srb desulfuromonas tz1 gong et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 the autotrophic denitrifier pseudomonas c27 lee et al 2012a and the gsb prosthecochloris aestaurii ha et al 2017 synergism has been observed between sob such as chlorobi and geobacter whereby the glycogen produced by photosynthetic gsb under dark conditions is supplied to geobacter to produce currents badalamenti et al 2014 many other sulfide oxidizing organisms have been identified in anodic chambers of sulfide oxidizing mxcs such as paracoccus acaligenes and acidothiobacillus but their role in electron transfer within the mxcs remains unclear rabaey et al 2006 sulonen et al 2015 ni et al 2016 unfortunately the mechanism of electron transfer is frequently not well differentiated since sulfur compounds are electroactive and abiotic and biotic sulfur oxidation can both readily occur on electrode surfaces dutta et al 2008 demonstrated the abiotic role of sulfur oxidation on the anode in the generation of currents nevertheless sob involvement in electron transfer was comprehensively demonstrated by ha et al 2017 in a synergistic relation with geobacter further study is needed to confirm the role sob play in mxcs and the dynamics between biotic and abiotic electron transfer processes some mxc applications have been demonstrated using sulfide oxidation at the anode although this was not always demonstrated to be biologically mediated these applications include simple sulfide removal with simultaneous current generation rabaey et al 2006 izadi and rahimnejad 2014 autotrophic denitrification where excess sulfide current can be harvested even with electron donors and acceptors both in the anodic compartment lee et al 2012b removal of inorganic sulfur compounds such as tetrathionate from acid mine drainage sulonen et al 2015 2016 2017 ni et al 2016 removal of sulfate from wastewater lee et al 2012b 2015 driving electrosynthesis and electro fermentation of valuable chemical feedstocks such as acetate gong et al 2012 and powering microbial solar cells badalamenti et al 2013 2014 one specialized system was that proposed by zhang et al 2009a for the treatment of vanadium containing wastewaters wherein an mfc was used for simultaneous removal of sulfide and organics at the anode after which the mixture was passed to the cathode for reduction of v v to the less toxic and more easily precipitated v iv the same researchers also proposed an integrated treatment system whereby they treated real undiluted molasses wastewater with a uasb mfc baf configuration zhang et al 2009b the mfc was used for sulfide removal and electricity generation the system attained sulfide removal efficiencies of 86 in which over 200 mg l sulfide from the uasb was reduced to below 30 mg l in the mfc effluent the abiotic oxidation of sulfide at the anode results in the production of either s0 sx 2 or s4o6 2 s2o3 2 leading to the generation of either 2 4 or 4 5 electrons per sulfur atom sun et al 2009 gong et al 2012 under microbially mediated sulfide oxidation sulfate is the main end product resulting in the transfer of 8 electrons per sulfur atom greatly increasing the potential of the cell to produce currents gong et al 2012 sulonen et al 2017 demonstrated that the presence of biofilm on the anode reduced the required anode potential from 0 5 v to 0 3 v vs ag agcl for tetrathionate degradation to maintain a current density above 70 ma m 2 an anode potential of only 0 4 v was required in the mxc whereas 0 7 v was needed in the abiotic electrochemical cell while the coulombic efficiency was lower in the mxc under optimal conditions 8 vs 1 48 in the abiotic cell the rates of tetrathionate oxidation were significantly increased 110 240 mg l 1d 1 vs 20 35 mg l 1d 1 as a result the microbially mediated tetrathionate oxidation was energy positive under realistic operating conditions while the abiotic electrochemical cell was not other than the anodic electroactivity donating electrons to solid electron acceptor displayed by the sulfur bacteria discussed above the ability of acquiring electrons from a solid electron donor which refers to the oxidation of metal sulfide or elemental sulfur indicates cathodic electroactivity accepting electrons from electrodes sydow et al 2014 shi et al 2016 a thiobacillus denitrificans biofilm was cultivated on a cathode accepting electrons for denitrification with a maximum no3 removal rate of 21 12 1 67 mmol n l 1day 1m 2 at a cathode potential of 500 mv vs saturated calomel reference electrodes yu et al 2015 the cathodic electroactivity provides an entrance for electrons from solid donors to the membrane bound electron transfer chain of sob given the metabolic diversity of sob cultivating sob at the cathode of mxcs should lead to several emerging applications the main challenges hindering the further development of sulfide oxidizing electrochemical processes are similar to those facing all electrochemical processes namely the cost effective scaling up of the system long term reductions in efficiency due to electrode poisoning or fouling and ion exchange membrane fouling resulting in increased internal resistance of the system logan 2010 sulonen et al 2016 anode poisoning by elemental sulfur deposition has been identified as a risk with sulfide oxidizing mxcs rabaey et al 2006 nevertheless with the exception of scaling up these issues may not be as prevalent as first thought for example sulonen et al 2017 operated an mfc treating real acid mine drainage wastewater for more than 700 days during this period no significant fouling of the anode or ion exchange membrane was observed instead internal resistance decreased and electrical efficiency increased therefore the application of mxcs for simultaneous removal of sulfide and production of electricity or chemicals is one of the most promising areas of development for sulfide oxidation technology 5 3 reclamation of metals from waste sludge sulfur bacteria have been employed for many decades in the leaching of metals from low grade ores containing metal sulfide in the mining industry olson et al 2003 brierley and brierley 2013 the functional bacteria were found in the genera of acidithiobacillus acidianus leptospirillum and sulpholobus which are acidophilic and often occur in acidic habitats such as coal mining drainage and leach dumps madigan and martinko 2014 kelly and wood 2014 there are two mechanisms of leaching out metal one is a direct mechanism in which the sulfur moiety of metal sulfide is oxidized and metal ions are released to the leachate the other is an indirect mechanism reduced sulfur compounds e g s0 and hs are oxidized by sob to so4 2 and form sulfuric acid which reduces the ph thus enhancing the solubilization of metals rohwerder et al 2003 vera et al 2013 the process of leaching out metals can also be applied for metal reclamation from wastes containing low levels of metal like waste sewage sludge in which heavy metals typically make up only 0 5 2 of the dry weight and reaching 6 in some cases pathak et al 2009 these metals are in the form of metal sulfides metal oxides hydroxides etc and can be solubilized via the direct and indirect mechanisms mentioned above due to the decrease in ph marchioretto 2003 the removal of metals from municipal sewage sludge improves the opportunities for land application where soil metal accumulation is typically the limiting factor wong and henry 1983 used a ferrooxidans in the bioleaching of anaerobic digested sludge they reported solubilization of 65 cu 78 ni 86 cd and 87 zn from the sludge in 8 days with the optimum initial ph of 4 and the optimum temperatures ranging from 25 to 30 c a coculture of a ferrooxidans atcc 19859 and a thiooxidans achieved about 10 higher solubilization of heavy metals than a pure culture of a ferrooxidans atcc 19859 in anaerobic digested sludge tyagi et al 1988 bioleaching of aerobic waste sludge using a ferrooxidans has also been studied high solubilization of the metals was achieved in 1 2 days in a batch reactor and 47 80 cu 42 60 ni and 40 71 cd were leached out couillard and chartier 1991 a mixed culture of indigenous sob for metal solubilization was also tested in 23 different sewages fresh aerated sludge aerated digested sludge and anaerobic digested sludge and favourable results were also obtained generally a ph ranging from 1 to approximately 4 and a temperature between 20 and 40 c are favourable which are also the optimum growth conditions for most acidophilic sulfur bacteria leachate containing metal ions was obtained after the bioleaching process thus a subsequent process for the removal and recovery of metals from leachate is required for recovering metals from the leachate many methods such as precipitation adsorption biosorption ion exchange solvent extraction and electrochemical technology can be options pathak et al 2009 sulfide as a preferred metal precipitant can be provided by sulfidogenic bioreactors which has already been implemented in the recovery of metals from acid mine drainage e g sulfateq the precipitate is usually separated from the liquid by sedimentation flotation or membrane filtration marchioretto 2003 bioleaching facilitated by acidophilic sulfur bacteria and the integrated process for metal recovery from waste sludge are believed to be a cost effective and eco friendly technology because the participation of chemotrophic sob does not require external dosage of carbon source and vigorous sterilization is not needed in the process due the low ph achieved pathak et al 2009 5 4 polyhydroxyalkanoates polyhydroxyalkanoates phas are thermoplastic or elastoplastic polyester materials with melting points ranging between 40 and 180 c as they are also biodegradable and biocompatible they have received growing interest for bioplastics production especially in the biomedical field phas are produced by a wide range of bacteria as internal storage polymers that can act as carbon substrates for growth interest is now growing in the use of photosynthetic cultures for the generation of phas to avoid aeration a major energy consumer and cost component in the pha production process fradinho et al 2013a samantaray et al 2013 anoxygenic phototrophs provide greater promise due to their ability to accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate phb at moderate levels mas and van gemerden 1995 higuchi takeuchi et al 2016 and their ability to produce phas under continuous feast conditions fradinho et al 2016 the former ability comes from the commonly cyclic variations in carbon nutrients and energy light in typical environments inhabited by gsb and psb such as tidal flats mas and van gemerden 1995 while the latter ability arises from anoxygenic phototrophs unique feature of using pha generation to dissipate reducing power studies to date indicate that psb widely accumulate phb mas and van gemerden 1995 while the gsb like chloroflexus can also do so provided hydrogen is present due to the reductive tca cycle utilized by chlorobi it is unable to synthesize phb sirevâg 1995 to date specific studies of gsb and psb for pha generation are limited liebergesell et al 1991 provided a comprehensive study of 15 strains six genera of psb and their phb production capabilities the highest pha content achieved was 83 with thiocystis violacea higuchi takeuchi et al 2016 investigated the pha storage capabilities of three psb along with nine pnsb all three psb accumulated pha when fed acetate under nitrogen limited conditions thiohalocapsa marina thiohaeococcus mangrove and marichromatium bheemilicum each accumulated a maximum of 16 18 pha with m bheemilicum accumulating 200 mg pha l of culture for all three psb the polymers produced consisted of 3hb homopolyester the pha was observed to have a high molecular weight between 72 and 994 103 g mol which is beneficial for increased mechanical strength of the pha fradinho et al 2013a 2013b 2016 ran a number of experiments on photosynthetic mixed cultures for pha production microbial analysis in their studies indicated a large gammaproteobacteria group with only a small community of pnsb suggesting that psb which could not be detected due to a lack of psb fluorescent in situ hybridization probes may be the dominant organism alternating light conditions were used in their study where the feast phase occurred in the dark which selected for anoxygenic phototrophs over algae this doubled the pha production rate and increased the pha content of the culture from 20 to 30 fradinho et al 2013b light availability was shown to be a critical factor in achieving these results but were comparable to levels achievable by natural sunlight these most recent results of photosynthetic anoxygenic pha production are promising where the pha content is still low but approaching that of aerobic heterotrophic feast famine cultures and the yield per carbon substrate is similar or better 6 conclusion owing to the widespread industrial and environmental applications biological sulfide oxidation has been extensively investigated all large scale applications of biological sulfide oxidation to date are chemotrophic systems because the simple energy and nutrient requirement and relatively high sulfide oxidizing efficiency of chemotrophs enable an easier implementation over a wider scope than those of phototrophs the metabolic diversity of chemotrophic sob links the sulfide oxidation to both nitrogen and phosphorous cycles allowing this set of organisms a wide range of emerging applications in waste remediation particularly in wastewater treatment however more technical practices especially large scale implementations are required additionally the electroactivity of sulfur bacteria offers a new opportunity for utilizing the high electron donating capacity of sulfide for energy generation and valuable chemicals synthesis opportunities for resource recovery like acquiring metals and pha have also emerged however applications of the sulfur bacteria are certainly not limited to those discussed in this article and future research could lead to the further development utilizing these versatile microorganisms acknowledgement the research was supported by the national

19407,a comprehensive review was carried out on the influence of mixing on anaerobic digestion ad efficiency in stirred tank anaerobic digesters though traditionally stirred tank digesters operated as continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs this review revealed that there is no motivation to continue to operate stirred tank anaerobic digesters as cstrs if ad energy efficiency is to be improved ad energy production efficiency can be achieved with optimized intermittent mixing ad efficiency should include an assessment of the net energy production efficiency and should be the criteria in determining the mixing mode mixing intensity mixing time and mixing interval for every anaerobic digestion operating plan keywords anaerobic digestion efficiency cstrs optimized intermittent mixing 1 introduction the anaerobic digestion ad process mainly depends on the feed characteristics the feeding pattern ph temperature redox potential hydraulic retention time hrt solids retention time srt and mixing inside the digester terashima et al 2009 meroney 2009 the ad process and performance efficiency are influenced by the proximity of the microorganisms to the available substrates and nutrients uniform operating temperature and ph hrt srt and the distribution of metabolic waste which are all influenced by mixing karim et al 2005a b c rico et al 2011 wu 2011 2014 lindmark et al 2014a nandi et al 2017 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 mixing is therefore a physical process that influences the ad process stirred tank digesters are designed to provide external physical mixing inside the digesters a complete stirred tank digester is essentially a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr that is designed to process organic waste from 3 to 10 total solid ts concentrations wu 2013 this is typically done at a mesophilic temperature 35 c with a hrt ranging from 10 to 20 days lusk 1998 beddoes et al 2007 wu 2013 the substrates are regularly fed through the inlet with an equal amount simultaneously exiting through the outlet of the digester the hrt and srt are assumed to be the same lindmark et al 2014a b kaparaju et al 2008 the digester contents are typically mixed continuously either by gas recirculation liquid slurry recirculation mechanical pumping and mechanical stirring or combinations to maintain the solids in suspension and to form a homogenous mixture karim et al 2004 wu 2010a b c d 2013 2014 lindmark et al 2014a b wiedemann et al 2017 light solids such as fiber straw or feathers have a tendency to float on the surface thereby impeding the release of biogas james et al 1980 strenstrom et al 1983 while heavy solids such as stones egg shells sand or other dense lumps settle at the bottom of the digester stratification of either sedimentation or floatation reduces the active digester volume causes mechanical problems with pumps and impellers causes the obstruction of the release of biogas from the liquid phase and may also cause foam scum and crust formation mixing has the following advantages 1 provides efficient utilization of the entire digester volume 2 prevents stratification floating and sedimentation 3 prevents foam scum and crust formation 4 avoids ph and temperature gradients 5 disperses metabolic end products and any toxic materials contained in the influent 6 facilitates the release of biogas from the substrate 7 maintains intimate contact between the bacteria bacterial enzymes and their substrate 8 aids in particle size reduction and 9 promotes mass heat transfer mill 1979 stafford et al 1980 chapman 1989 lema et al 1991 rivard et al 1995 stroot et al 2001 gerardi 2003 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 karim et al 2005a wu and chen 2008 hoffmann et al 2008 wu 2010a b c d lindmark et al 2014a b zhang et al 2016 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 the main purpose of mixing is to achieve homogeneity in the fluid mixture and provide an equal platform for the anaerobes adequate mixing provides a uniform environment for anaerobic bacteria which is one of the major factors in obtaining maximum digestion monteith and stephenson 1981 strenstrom et al 1983 parkin and owen 1986 chapman 1989 lema et al 1991 karim et al 2005a b wu 2014 adequate mixing prevents clogging in digesters wu 2014 inadequate mixing in traditional sludge anaerobic digesters typically resulted in the oversizing of the digesters due to the resulting reduced hrt srt leading to less contact of the substrates with the microorganisms and poor volatile solids vs reduction and low biogas production monteith and stephenson 1981 one important factor attributed to digester failure is improper mixing inside the digester james et al 1980 strenstrom et al 1983 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a b c d mendoza et al 2011 however vavilin and angelidaki 2005 reported that uneven mixing can create initiation zones where methanogens can grow and thrive and from there they can then seed the rest of the digester their claim was confirmed by lindmark et al 2014a b and zhang et al 2016 issues of what constitute adequate and inadequate mixing in ad are still a subject of debate and whether achieving complete homogeneity is economically feasible in the quest to improve ad energy efficiency karim et al 2005a wu 2014 nandi et al 2017 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 the disadvantages of stirred tank digesters are the high capital cost and operational and maintenance cost of mixing equipment traditionally a complete stirred tank digester operates as continuous stirred tank reactor cstr in which the digester is continuously fed and mixed it is estimated that the energy demand for mixing in a full scale digester varies from 8 to 58 of the total energy demand rivard et al 1995 berglund and börjesson 2006 naegele et al 2012 lemmer et al 2013 kowalczyk et al 2013 lindmark et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 kress et al 2018 the variations in the energy efficiency are attributed to the substrate type ts tank geometries mixing types and their orientations and mixing operational mode berglund and börjesson 2006 ward et al 2008 wu 2012 wiedemann et al 2017 therefore most industrial digesters operate as heterogeneous mixture due to the high cost involved to obtain complete homogeneity latha et al 2009 sindall et al 2013b kress et al 2018 the economics of ad can be improved to maximize energy produced per unit substrate treated and the quality of the digestate while minimizing the capital and operational costs kaparaju and rintala 2008 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 economically optimized intermittent mixing is reported to reduce the energy demand and maintenance cost as well as improve the biogas production compared to the continuous mixing mode of a cstr gómez et al 2006 rico et al 2011 kowalczyk et al 2013 lindmark et al 2014a b wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 ideally mixing must coincide with feeding to homogenize the fresh feed introduced to provide intimate contact between the bacteria bacterial enzymes and their substrate and to provide an equal platform for the anaerobes therefore in intermittent mixing the mixing should coincide with feeding to distribute the feed and then mixed occasionally between feedings especially for daily batch fed or intermittent feeding modes rico et al 2011 hughes 2015 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 most research on the influence of mixing on ad in stirred tank digesters focuses on the process and performance efficiency without an assessment of the mixing energy input and the energy output from the methane ch4 produced since mixing energy input influences the ad process and performance efficiency evaluation of the influence of mixing on ad efficiency should include the net energy production efficiency which is the focus of this paper 1 1 comparison of mixing intensity and power requirements of impeller slurry recirculation and gas mixing the selection of a mixing method is important to ensure effective mixing efficiency at minimum power consumption there are generally three mixing methods gas recirculation liquid slurry recirculation and mechanical impeller mixing there are conflicting results from various authors on the effectiveness and efficiencies of these methods these differences could be due to different setups or methods applied in the evaluation and the type and concentration of substrates the recent development of technology such as computer automated radioactive particle carpt computational fluid dynamics cfd computed tomography ct and fluorescent in situ hybridization fish makes it easy to evaluate these mixing methods and to select an optimum ad mixing design configuration the impact of mixing on microorganisms and microbial consortia is not limited to disruption of flocs alone but also in the retardation of growth and product synthesis denaturation of extracellular protein change in morphology thickening of the cell wall and absence of certain cells doran 1995 de jesus et al 2017 for microbial flocs shear forces in turbulent flow are resisted by the mechanical strength of the particles since different cell types display different levels of shear sensitivity using a general equation to determine the interactions between turbulent eddies and cell flocs such as presented by doran 1995 alone does not account for other effects and therefore experimental measurement should be preferable the impact of interactions between turbulent eddies and cell flocs is not fully understood doran 1995 however the recent work by hoffmann et al 2008 employed state of the art methods to measure floc destruction at different mixing intensities in ad they reported the of effect mixing intensities during the startup process where the vs ranged from 10 2 kg m3 to 22 3 kg m3 corresponding to low ts of about 11 96 kg m3 and 26 14 kg m3 and hence low apparent viscosity since the viscosity has an effect on the turbulent eddies generated during mixing without affecting the microbial flocs computing the minimum impeller rotational speed above which disruption of flocs occurs using the equation presented by doran 1995 and assuming a floc diameter of 150 μm density of 1000 kg m3 and viscosity of 0 008 pa s shows that impeller rotational speeds above 986 14 rpm would affect the microbial flocs an increase in mixing speed reduces the size of eddies causing interactions with the flocs excessive mixing intensity above the threshold therefore leads to formation of eddies with a size small enough to cause damage to floc cells therefore their claim that 1500 rpm destroyed microbial floc is justifiable especially during the startup process when dense microbial flocs are formed while 1500 rpm may be impractical in normal digester operations it is important to point out at the research level that depending on the substrate characteristics such as the density rheological properties and viscosity optimum mixing intensity exists above which microbial flocs could be destroyed hoffmann et al 2008 reported the absence of methanosaeta concilli after some period of mixing with 1500 rpm mixing intensities contribute to microbial consortia dynamics they recorded similar floc size at the initial state from day 6 28 for the different mixing intensities which then decreased continually until no flocs were documented only single cells and clusters of cells up to 10 μm were recorded their conclusion that continuous mixing shear completely destroyed the microbial flocs without causing long term upsets in the digester performance is therefore valid based on the state of their experimental results even for the lower impeller mixing speed of 50 rpm the spatially average velocity gradient was 17 s 1 which is above the optimum range of 7 2 9 7 s 1 reported by sindall et al 2013a b for lab scale digesters they also confirmed that high intensity mixing also disrupts the spatial juxtaposition of microorganism which limits their syntrophic relationship since anaerobic digestion is multiphase consisting of solid liquid and gas the flow complexity inside the digester makes it difficult to predict the impact of high intensity mixing bubbles breaking up could contribute to the disruption of cell flocs even at a lower rotational speed an equation assuming single phase cells and turbulent eddy interactions as presented by doran 1995 cannot predict this effect doran 1995 de jesus et al 2017 the presence of baffles also increase the shear rate inside digesters de jesus et al 2017 wu 2010a evaluated the mixing efficiency of the three mixing methods in full scale digesters using a simulated average velocity of liquid to quantify the mixing intensity inside the digester and the computed power consumption the results of the gas mixing for ts ranging from 0 to 5 4 indicated that for the same mixing energy level mel as the ts increases the mixing intensity decreased confined gas draft tube mixing proved superior to unconfined gas mixing wu 2014 confirmed this claim unconfined gas mixing generated high velocity at the central region the average velocity of the gas draft tube mixing with ts of 5 4 was used as the basis to fix the rotational speed of a dual helical bladed propeller for mechanical mixing and the inlet velocity for pump circulation comparing the mel he concluded that the mechanical mixing is more efficient than gas mixing which also is more efficient than pump circulation to achieve the same average velocity the superficial gas injection velocity and pump circulation inlet velocity were 7 6 m s and 6 62 m s respectively and the propeller rotational speed was 248 rpm with a tip velocity of about 7 79 m s the high velocities at the impeller tip gas injection and at the inlet can damage microbial flocs near the impeller blades and at the exits where strong turbulent flow exists wu and chen 2008 demonstrated that optimum power input exists for any specific pump circulation mixed digester wu 2010b demonstrated that pump circulation inlet velocity of 6 46 m s with a local velocity gradient g l 70 s 1 causes floc breakup at both the viscous and the inertia subrange wu 2014 quantitatively identified the g l at the exit of the gas injection to be 70 s 1 high velocity gradient zone even though the average local velocity gradient was 1 97s 1 since the fluid flow eventually returns to the lower end of the tube where the gas exits continuous mixing may destroy the microbial flocs completely in the long term the computed breakup number of flocs at the gas exit support this argument the computed breakup number of flocs also indicated that at the liquid surface upper top zone near the draft tube where the large bubbles rupture into small bubbles also does not support floc growth due to the high superficial gas velocity when large bubbles rupture into small bubbles the breakup occurred at the inertia subrange due to shear forces at the gas exit and during the bulk movement of the liquid and the bubbles thin films rupturing at the surface of the liquid trad et al 2016 compared the three mixing methods and presented findings contrary to the findings of wu 2010a their findings indicate that the mel for gas mixing is lower than pump recirculation which is lower than mechanical mixing with a lower shear level in the same order however mechanical mixing promoted homogeneity at a lower mixing time and good mass transfer especially with a high olr non newtonian fluid and should be preferred for an optimized design as presented by wu 2010a since impeller type and the position influence the power consumption and the shear rate generated de jesus et al 2017 recently evaluated the hydrodynamic mass transfer and power consumption performance of four bioreactors bubble column concentric tube airlift concentric tube stirred airlift and mechanical stirred tank using a viscous newtonian and non newtonian fluid they concluded that gas holding and mass transfer coefficients were higher in the concentric tube stirred airlift and mechanical stirred tank which also showed a higher shear rate which could damage microorganisms or cells sensitive to shear forces the power consumption was lower in the bubble column and airlift bioreactors however mechanical mixing provided better homogeneity of the digester contents their work supports the findings presented by trad et al 2016 however it should be noted that the type of impeller used had a higher power number generating a higher shear rate with higher power consumption optimized impeller design could therefore reverse the ranking as presented by wu 2010a who used a lower power number dual helical bladed propeller vertical linear motion mixers with lower power consumption are now being introduced for high efficient mixing of high viscous non newtonian in digesters massart et al 2008 meroney and sheker 2014 promoting mechanical mixing as the best choice for high viscous non newtonian fluids the work of karim et al 2004 demonstrated that low superficial gas velocity at the inlet 0 4 0 8 1 2 m s resulted in stagnation at the bottom and near the walls while the upper top zone near the draft tube was well mixed due to bubbles rupturing as the superficial gas velocity increased the percentage of dead zones decreased high superficial gas velocity is therefore required depending on the rheological properties and density of the liquid slurry for proper mixing however excessive mixing intensity in either mixing methods have the same effect on microorganisms and microbial flocs affecting the ad process and performance and reducing the overall digestion efficiency excessive superficial gas velocity also increases the mel making it uneconomical while inadequate mixing can results in short circuiting washout bypass dead zones sedimentation floatation foam and scum formation clogging and eventual digester failure further discussions include these three mixing methods and in some cases general conclusions are made if the effects on each type are the same 1 2 effect of mixing shear intensity on microorganisms high mixing intensity is reported to have a negative effect on the flocs formation which affects the syntrophic interaction of acetogenic and methanogenic anaerobes causing inhibition due to high hydrogen partial pressure and high propionate and acetate concentrations which increases the time required for startup conrad et al 1985 whitmore et al 1987 dolfing 1992 stroot et al 2001 mcmahon et al 2001 ong et al 2002 kim et al 2002 vavilin et al 2007 hoffmann et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a microbial consortia are also affected by a high mixing intensity kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a b the stability of anaerobic digestion depends on the methanogenic biomass concentration high intensity mixing inhibits hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis due to high volatile fatty acids vfa concentrations causing instability in the digestion process vavilin et al 2007 methanogens are more sensitive to high intensity mixing than other microorganisms these imbalances may cause an inhibition in the ad process stroot et al 2001 methanosarcina spp and methanobacteriacea are reported to increase in digesters with higher mixing intensity due to the high acetate and vfa concentrations while methanosaeta concilii only increased in abundance in digesters mixed at lower intensities where there is no vfa accumulation mcmahon et al 2001 karakashev et al 2005 kaparaju et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2008 zignanshin et al 2011 2013 for a stable ad process the vfa concentration should be within 3 4 g l above which process instability and souring of the digester and even failure may occur hoffmann et al 2008 kaparaju et al 2008 khanal 2009 kaparaju et al 2008 reported the dominance of small rod shaped bacterial cells in continuously mixed digesters and digesters where mixing was withheld for 2 h prior to mixing indicating the presence of methanosarcinacea while long rods bacterial cells were dominant in the intermittent minimal mixed digester indicating the presence of methanosaeta however methanosarcinacea were present in all the digesters indicating that in intermittent minimally mixed digesters there is a good balance of the acetotropphic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogensis and may be the reason for the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent minimally mixed digesters compared to the other mixing schemes in addition closer microbial consortia proximity or the building of microbial layers could also be attributed to the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent minimally mixed digester kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 methanomicrobiales which are hydrogenotrophic methanogens were dominant in the continuous mixed pilot scale digester and no stratification of microorganisms was observed in the intermittent mixing stratification of microorganisms was observed archaea belonging to methanobacteriaceae which are strictly hydrogen utilizing methanogens were abundant in the top layer while small irregular shaped bacterial cells were abundant in the middle layer clusters of methanosarcinacae and cells belonging to methanomicrobiales were found in the bottom layer the results of the pilot scale confirm the lab scale results indicating that in intermittent mixed digesters there is a good balance of the acetrotrophic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens and may be the reason for the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent mixed digesters compared to the continuous mixed digesters kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 hoffmann et al 2008 observed the dominance of two different acetrotrophic methanogenic populations at different mixing intensities methanosarcina spp dominated at a high mixing intensity while methanosaeta concilii dominated at a low mixing intensity this is probably because the vfa concentration influences the dominance of acetrotrophic methanogens at high vfa concentration as experienced in high mixing intensity methanosarcina spp is dominant and methanosaeta concilii dominates at lower vfa concentration mcmahon et al 2001 karakashev et al 2005 ziganshin et al 2011 kaparaju et al 2008 methanosaeta concilii cells have long filaments and therefore a high mixing intensity may affect the formation of filaments while methanosarcina spp cell grow as cocci the advantage of methanosarcina over methanosaeta is that methanosarcina can survive using another methanogenesis pathway by reducing carbon dioxide co2 and hydrogen h2 to produce methane ch4 whereas methanosaeta rely only on acetate they concluded that methanosarcina spp resulted in more stable digesters and this might be an advantage for high mixing intensities conklin et al 2006 and that continuous mixing completely destroyed the microbial flocs without causing long term upsets in the digester performance however high mixing intensity and continuous mixing should be discouraged due to high power consumption reducing the energy efficiency of the system kowalczyk et al 2013 investigated layering of microorganisms in non mixed digesters they observed that microorganisms build layers in non mixed digesters and that methanogens mostly live in the lower layers which has a positive impact on the digestion process supporting the findings of previous authors kim et al 2002 kaparaju et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2008 their results shows the benefits of intermittent mixing over continuous mixing in improving the ad efficiency the positive impact of microbial layering in non mixed periods could be the reason for higher biogas production in intermittent minimal mixing and intermittent mixing with a longer mixing interval 1 3 effect of mixing intensity on ad efficiency rivard et al 1990 studied digester mixing requirements for high solids digestion of municipal solid waste msw to produce ch4 under mesophilic conditions 37 c to improve the economic benefit of ad the laboratory scale digesters with a working volume of 20 l were batch fed daily they concluded there was no significant difference in the digester performance between mixing intensities of 1 and 25 rpm for a high organic loading rate olr of up to 9 5 g vs l d and gradual increasing of ts from 5 to 36 they concluded that to improve ad efficiency maximization of olr while minimizing mixing intensities to increase ch4 production at a minimum cost are preferable the 25 rpm mixing intensity was a waste of energy kaparaju et al 2008 investigated the effect of mixing intensities on biogas production using 400 ml serum bottles and indicated that for a high substrate to inoculum ratio 40 60 gentle and minimal mixing 1 min of shaking by hand when a sample is taken was beneficial compared to vigorous continuous mixing and for low substrate to inoculum ratio 10 90 gentle mixing was also reported as the best their results are consistent with findings of rivard et al 1990 high mixing intensity is a waste of energy and does not improve biogas and ch4 production hoffmann et al 2008 studied the effect of shear generated as a result of mechanical mixing using an axial impeller on the performance and microbial ecology of continuously stirred anaerobic mesophilic digesters 34 1 c digesting dairy cow manure they used computer automated radioactive particle tracking carpt in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics cfd to map the shear distribution and to estimate the local shear intensities developed by the different mixing intensities the performance of each digester was monitored with parameters indicating performance and stability while molecular techniques such as membrane hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization fish were used to track changes in the methanogenic population dynamics and juxtaposition of syntrophic microbes in four laboratory scale 4 5 l unbaffled digesters operating at different mixing intensities 50 1500 rpm the manure with 5 vs was fed into the digesters daily at five different olrs between 0 6 and 3 5 g vs l d they concluded that at steady state conditions the different mixing intensities had no effect on the biogas production rates and yields the methane content and vs removal efficiencies were similar therefore low intensity mixing should be preferred to improve the net energy production efficiency and more energy could be saved with intermittent mixing their results also agree with those of the previous authors rivard et al 1990 kaparaju et al 2008 lemmer et al 2013 recommended slow moving inclined mixers with large propeller diameters which consume less power for mixing high ts contents than a fast moving submersible mixer with smaller propeller diameters their study reveal the fact that the impeller type and geometry is important in saving energy and also in improving the mixing quality they concluded that an optimum mixing intensity is a requirement for every digester operating process in other to achieve optimum biogas and methane production and to improve net energy production efficiency hoffmann et al 2008 sindall et al 2013a b hughes 2015 sindall et al 2013a b showed that there is a mixing intensity threshold above which biogas production decreases increasing mixing intensity above the threshold is a waste of energy shen et al 2013 investigated the mixing performance of different impellers at mixing intensity ranging from 20 to 160 rpm at intervals of 20 rpm to determine the suitable mixing intensity for higher biogas production from rice straw in a batch ad with 65 kg m3 ts at a mesophilic temperature 35 c and with a mixing frequency of 12 times a day with a stirring duration of 5 min each their results of the biogas yield indicate a mixing speed of 80 rpm performed better the cumulative biogas production of the 80 rpm was higher by 23 6 11 4 and 18 3 for 40 rpm 120 rpm and 160 rpm respectively the cfd results indicate that 80 rpm was sufficient for uniform suspension of solids with a turbulent kinetic energy tke ranging from 0 004 to 0 012 m2 s2 for the 40 rpm the tke was below 0 006 m2 s2 while for the 120 and 160 rpm the values increase to 0 014 and 0 02 m2 s2 respectively their work supports the fact that optimum mixing intensity exists for optimum biogas production for every ad setup lindmark et al 2014b investigated the influence of mixing intensity on biogas production during ad batch processing of both high organic loading and minimal organic loading of fresh source sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste ssofmsw and the effluent from a full scale anaerobic digester processing ssofmsw the lab scale mesophilic batch digesters with an operating temperature of 33 c and a volume of 700 ml were operated continuously with two mixing intensities of 25 rpm and 150 rpm or intermittent minimal mixing by only turning the digester 180 and then back their results for the continuous mixing shows that a digester mixing speed of 150 rpm produced lower biogas for both high olr and low olr compared to the 25 rpm the biogas production of the intermittent minimal mixing was lower than the 25 rpm at steady state 4 lower but higher than the 150 rpm this shows that some amount of mixing is beneficial since the intermittent minimal mixing was done manually by hand and therefore impractical in real digesters gentle or medium intermittent mixing may be recommended since the 25 rpm continuous mixing did not show much improvement compared to the intermittent minimal mixing implementing intermittent mixing with the 25 rpm once a day or at a longer interval will be more energy efficient hughes 2015 demonstrated that optimum mixing intensity is required for high biogas production for digesters treating 10 5 ts cow manure under mesophilic conditions at a high olr the highest ch4 production was obtained with high intensity 140 rpm intermittent mixing at short intervals compared to 61 6 rpm and 36 96 rpm however the medium to low mixing intensities with a longer resting interval 12 h resting were ranked as the most cost effective method for both batch and batch fed experiments while cstr was the worse in terms of the net energy produced hence optimized intermittent mixing improves ad efficiency wiedemann et al 2017 also reported that optimum mixing intensity is required to improve ad efficiency 1 4 effects of mixing mode and duration ad efficiency mixing mode time and interval are important in improving ad efficiency mixing mode as used in this paper refers to continuous mixing intermittent and non mixed conditions ad have both environmental and economic benefits and therefore the need to create a balance between these two are paramount in ad research research work to improve the energy efficiency of stirred tank digesters will help to make ad economically viable and attractive to farmers and investors due to the advantages ascribed to mixing traditional stirred digesters operated as cstr were reputed to accrue all the benefits however analysis of the net energy production efficiency of most digesters operating as cstr has showed low or negative values berglund and börjesson 2006 intermittent mixing is reported to reduce the energy demand and maintenance cost as well as improve the biogas production compared to the continuous mixing mode of a cstr gómez et al 2006 rico et al 2011 kowalczyk et al 2013 lindmark et al 2014a b kress et al 2018 various authors have shown that the biogas that is trapped during the non mixed condition is released during the mixing period mills 1979 sung and dague 1995 ong et al 2002 mills 1979 ran an experiment with intermittent mixing of 5 min h in a pilot digester and observed that about 70 of the biogas produced is released during mixing smith et al 1996 reported that intermittent mixing is sufficient for anaerobic biomass conversion hashimoto et al 1981 reported no difference in ch4 production rates when the thermophilic fermentor 50 c was mixed 2 h d compared to continuous mixing and that mixing in the 5 7 m3 fermentor amounted to 7 3 of the gross ch4 energy production with an olr of 9 6 g vs l d hashimoto 1982 investigated the effect of mixing duration on ch4 production rate from beef cattle waste under a thermophilic temperature of 55 c a 6 day hrt and olr of 9 6 g vs l d with mixing durations of 1 2 3 and 24 h d he concluded that even though continuous mixing produced higher ch4 production rates the increase was only 8 11 higher compared to intermittent mixing for a 6 day hrt and a 4 day hrt with a mixing duration of 2 h d respectively intermittent mixing should therefore be preferred since the incremental increase in ch4 cannot offset the energy input stroot et al 2001 showed that continuously mixed digesters performances were unstable at higher olrs while intermittent minimally mixed thoroughly hand shaken 1 min after feeding and 1 min before emptying digesters performed well for all the olrs ranging from 3 5 to 9 4 g vs l d operated under mesophilic conditions 37 c and an initial 20 day hrt kim et al 2002 compared the process performance of cstrs and intermittent minimally mixed manually mixed before wastage and immediately after feeding digesters operated under mesophilic conditions 35 c and thermophilic conditions 55 c with an initial hrt of 20 days 4 ts increasing to 9 4 while decreasing the hrt under steady state operations with both a low and an increased olr the lowest biogas production was recorded in the cstrs while the intermittent minimally mixed recorded the highest biogas production at both temperatures presumably due to the closer microbial consortia proximity karim et al 2005a investigated the effect of mixing on biogas production in six laboratory scale gas mixed anaerobic digesters with a working volume of 3 73 l operated under mesophilic conditions 35 c digesting cow manure slurry with 5 ts and an olr of 3 37 g tcod l d they reported no difference in the performance of the digesters a higher ch4 production rate was observed in the non mixed digesters they observed that an increased in the biogas recirculation rate reduced the methane production they concluded that self mixing created by the naturally produced gas bubbles rising might be the result of the similar performance of the mixed and the non mixed digesters or the longer hrt of 16 2 days the higher ch4 production rate in the non mixed digesters could also be as a result of closer microbial consortia proximity or the building of microbial layers kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 as confirmed by the negative impact of high intensity mixing on biogas production with an increasing recirculation rate karim et al 2005b further examined the effect of the mixing mode on biogas production and found that the non mixed and mixed digesters performed quite similarly when fed with 5 ts cow manure slurry karim et al 2005a the mixed digesters produced more biogas than the non mixed ones when the digesters were fed with 10 and 15 ts cow manure slurries natural mixing always occurs in a digester due to rising bubbles and thermal convection currents caused by heating the digester but this is not adequate for a stable digestion process performance at high ts or olr wu 2014 for digesters fed with 10 and 15 ts with an olr of 3 2 and 4 7 g vs l d respectively the biogas production of the mixed digesters increased 10 30 more than the non mixed for the digestion of 10 ts comparing the biogas production of the non mixed digesters with the mixed digesters the increases were 29 for slurry recirculation 22 for impeller mixed and 15 for biogas recirculation the higher biogas production with slurry recirculation could be attributed to a longer srt than the difference in mixing for the digestion of 15 ts comparing the biogas production of the non mixed digesters with the mixed digesters the increases were 35 for biogas recirculation and 12 for impeller mixed the higher increase for biogas recirculation was attributed to a blockage and solids accumulation increasing the srt they recommended impeller mixed for higher ts though the results show higher biogas production for mixed than the non mixed it s obvious that the biogas increase cannot offset the energy input per unit volume 8 w m3 for the continuously mixed ad intermittent mixing could therefore save energy and improve the net energy production efficiency the results also show that at higher ts impeller mixed efficiency is reduced and non mixed or intermittently mixed would be preferred moreover karim et al 2005c compared six gas mixing digesters and showed that methane production varied insignificantly with mixing conditions at a low solids concentration confirming their previous works karim et al 2005a b their findings point out the importance of mixing at higher ts however intermittently mixed should be preferred to cstr to improve ad efficiency kaparaju et al 2008 investigated the effects of mixing on biogas production in lab scale and pilot scale thermophilic ad of livestock manure to optimize biogas production the operation conditions of the three lab scale reactors with a working volume of 3 6 l were a 15 day hrt a temperature of 55 c 8 1 ts and 6 2 vs fed at 12 h intervals the pilot scale digester with a working volume of 500 l a 20 day hrt a temperature of 54 1 c 6 5 7 5 ts and 5 6 3 vs was fed three times a day 8 h intervals continuous mixing intermittent minimal mixing for 10 min prior to wastage feeding and withholding mixing for 2 h before wastage feeding were evaluated their results from the lab scale digesters indicate that intermittent minimal mixing increased biogas production by 12 5 compared to continuous mixing while withholding mixing for 2 h before wastage feeding also increased biogas production by 1 3 compared to continuous mixing intermittent minimal mixing produced more ch4 than withholding mixing for 2 h before wastage feeding and continuous mixing they however reported stratification of solids at the top and bottom with intermittent mixing but this did not affect the performance and could be an operational strategy for maintaining a higher srt by discharging from the middle results from the pilot scale reactor were similar with an average increase in biogas yield of 7 during intermittent mixing 5 min on and 5 min off compared with continuous mixing closer microbial consortia proximity or the building of microbial layers could also be attributed to the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent minimally mixed digester kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 hoffmann et al 2008 reported that continuous mixing completely destroyed the microbial flocks without causing long term upsets in the digester performance however continuous mixing is a waste of energy and does not improve ad efficiency also intermittent mixing with shorter mixing intervals does not improve the ad efficiency hence intermittent minimally mixed or with longer duration should be preferred rico et al 2011 evaluated the influence of the liquid recirculation rate on biogas production in a 1 5 m3 working volume pilot cstr digesting screened dairy manure of 6 1 ts operated under mesophilic temperatures of 37 1 c a 10 day hrt an olr of 4 5 kg vs m3 d and a 20 day hrt an olr of 2 3 kg vs m3 d the feeding mode was semi continuous in a cycle of 30 min with a discharge rate of 30 l h the intermittent recirculation mixing of 30 min cycles ten times a day coinciding with feeding mode produced more biogas than continuous and minimal mixing for the 10 day hrt the difference between intermittent mixing ten times a day and intermittent minimal mixing was 5 97 while with continuous mixing the difference was not statistically significant intermittent minimal and continuous mixing did not show a significant difference in the biogas production the ch4 content cod and vs reduction were similar for the 20 day hrt biogas production rates were similar but lower than the 10 day hrt however the cod and vs reductions were more their finding is consistent with other researchers karim et al 2005a b c kaparaju et al 2008 though intermittent mixing ten times a day produced more biogas economically intermittent minimal mixed could save energy jha et al 2012 conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of mixing in a batch reactor with a working volume of 3 l digesting cow dung with 16 28 ts without dilution operating at mesophilic temperatures of 35 1 and a 35 day digestion time two mixing modes were investigated continuous mixing and mixing once a day for 2 3 min the biogas and ch4 yield for the continuous mixing were 7 5 and 6 46 respectively more than mixing once a day the vs removal efficiency was 9 73 higher than mixing once a day their finding is consistent with the findings of karim et al 2005b for higher ts intermittent minimal mixing can improve the net energy production efficiency since continuous mixing only increased ch4 production marginally they also observed lower ph in the continuous mixed digester than the minimal mixed digester due to high vfa production and the release of hydrogen ions during ammonia stripping prolonging the startup time the higher vfa to alkalinity ratio of more than 0 8 during startup in the continuous mixed digester predicts inhibition which was evident as the biogas production was lower than in the minimal mixed digester kowalczyk et al 2013 investigated the effects of mixing modes on biogas production of energy crops corn cob and maize silage co digested with cow manure two experiments and three mixing modes were investigated in digesters with a working volume of 22 l in experiment 1 corn cob and cow dung served as the feedstock while in experiment 2 maize silage and cow dung were used in experiment 1 the following mixing modes were studied 2 h mixing and 1 h break 7 h mixing and 1 h break and continuous mixing 24 h a day intermittent mixing produced more biogas than the continuous mixing and the difference was about 10 for a low olr increasing the olr 0 1 3 5 kg vs m3 d produced fluctuating results in experiment 2 the mixing modes were 10 min mixing and 230 min break 10 min mixing 50 min break and continuous mixing again the intermittent mixing produced higher biogas about 20 more than continuous mixing at the beginning of the digestion process and varied to about 10 later in the process the ch4 content was not significantly influenced by the mixing mode they concluded that in experiment 1 2 h mixing and a 1 h break could save about 29 of the mixing power consumption without affecting the biogas production rate and the ch4 yield in experiment 2 even more energy could be saved their work supports the fact that optimized intermittent mixing and feeding could improve ad efficiency over cstr and intermittent mixing with shorter mixing intervals they observed that the average power consumption during the restart of on and off periods was only 2 5 higher than constant continuous mixing they concluded that the additional power consumption during on and off restart periods was insignificant and that 29 power consumption could be saved compared to constant stirring intermittent minimal mixing or using a longer mixing interval would save more energy and should be preferred lee and sung 2014 investigated the effects of continuous mixing and intermittent minimally mixing 1 5 min before wastage and after feeding on ad of livestock wastewater treated in a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 3 5 l operated under mesophilic 35 c and thermophilic 55 c conditions with an olr of 22 074 g tcod l and a hrt of 30 days their results indicate that under the same temperature tcod removal efficiency for the continuously mixed ad was about 0 11 0 58 higher than the intermittent minimally mixed ad and also the biogas production was about 1 7 4 6 higher for the continuously mixed than the intermittent minimally mixed this increase is statistically insignificant and therefore the intermittent minimally mixed will save energy and improve the overall energy efficiency of the system their result confirms previous authors that at a low olr continuously mixed and non mixed or intermittent minimally mixed show no significance difference at steady state operations karim et al 2005a b c kowalczyk et al 2013 keanoi et al 2014 reported that mixing increased biogas production progressively in a lab scale cstr digester with a working volume of 0 2 m3 co digesting cow manure rice straw and water hyacinths 1 1 1 at ambient temperature 31 c however the increase in the maximum biogas production was only 7 59 compared to non mixed condition the difference in ch4 content was statistically insignificant at 5 confidence level f 0 259607 fcrit 3 954568 p value 0 611726 df 1 84 the specific methane production rate was statistically the same f 3 952113 fcrit 3 954568 p value 0 05007 df 1 84 for long term operations and for an economic benefit optimized intermittent mixing should be preferred to cstr lindmark et al 2014b showed that for a low ts 3 7 and 5 7 the biogas production for the intermittent minimal mixing and 25 rpm continuous mixing did not show a statistical difference but were higher than continuous mixing at 150 rpm their results are consistent with those of previous findings that for a low olr or a low ts continuous mixing did not improve the biogas and ch4 production but higher mixing intensity produced lower biogas and ch4 karim et al 2005a kaparaju et al 2008 their work supports the fact that intermittent mixing at low mixing intensity could improve ad efficiency over cstr and that a high intensity mixing is a waste of energy subramanian and pagilla 2014 reported similar biogas production rates with continuous mixing and intermittent mixing 3 h d 1 h three times a day for a maximum olr of 3 kg vs m3 d they indicated that a higher level of mixing may be necessary to maintain homogeneity than to improve digester performance reducing continuous mixing to mixing 1 h three times a day was enough to maintain homogeneity they indicate the possibility of natural mixing due to gas bubbles during the non mixed period karim et al 2005a b c hughes 2015 reported that low mixing intensities with a longer mixing interval is a cost effective method for both batch and batch fed ad of cow manure slurry with an average ts of 10 5 his results indicate that cstr was the worse in terms of the net energy produced optimized intermittent mixing could improve the net energy production efficiency nandi et al 2017 investigated the effect of mechanical mixing on biogas and ch4 production using a propeller with a rotating speed of 100 rpm mixing for 5 min at 15 min intervals and non mixed three mesophilic 35 c lab scale anaerobic digesters with a net capacity of 15 l each were operated simultaneously at a hrt of 30 days and ts concentrations ranging from 7 5 to 10 ts with different operating conditions biogas and ch4 production of intermittent mixed with a shorter interval were statistically insignificant compared to the non mixed therefore intermittent mixing with longer mixing intervals could save more energy and prevent foam scum and crust formation which could occur in non mixed digesters while improving ad efficiency kress et al 2018 investigated the impact of mixing time in a full scale cstr biogas digesters to reduce the power consumption and to improve ad efficiency mixing times of 10 5 and 2 min with a 30 min rest interval were investigated using two mechanical mixers an inclined propeller mixer and a submersible mixer operated simultaneously the digester operated with an olr of about 3 53 0 24 kg vs m3 d their results show that a reduction in the mixing time from 10 min to 5 min reduced the power consumption 53 and reducing it further to 2 min reduced the power consumption 81 though gas production was higher for the 10 min mixing time the difference was only 15 while there was no significance difference between the 5 min and the 2 min mixing time since there was no evidence of dead zones floating or sinking and inhibition with a reduced mixing time the net energy efficiency could therefore be improved with a 2 min mixing time for the system they studied and more energy could be saved with a longer rest interval between mixing their study confirms the fact that energy efficiency can be achieved with a reduced mixing time kowalczyk et al 2013 1 5 effects of mixing on scum crust and foam formation foam scum and crust formation are major problems affecting ad efficiency in full scale digesters the effect of mixing in contributing and controlling these phenomenon are briefly discussed moeller et al 2012 defined foam as generally a dispersion of gas in a liquid consisting of a large proportion approximately 95 of gas surface active and hydrophobic compounds form a liquid film around the gas bubbles preventing them from bursting ganidi et al 2009 moeller et al 2012 foaming occurs in the presence of a high concentration of surface active agents such as surfactants biosurfactants and filamentous microorganisms exceeding certain thresholds ganidi et al 2009 moeller et al 2012 moeller and görsch 2015 subramanian and pagilla 2014 reported that excessive pump recirculation mixing contributes to foaming when in combination with high filamentous microorganisms ganidi et al 2009 moeller and görsch 2015 they concluded that reducing pump mixing intensity could maintained digester performance and reduce foaming shimada et al 2014 reported reducing pump continuous mixing to intermittent mixing and reducing mixing intensity are operational strategies to stabilize foaming digesters ganidi et al 2009 and moeller et al 2012 reported that excessive mixing initiates foaming in the presence of a high concentration of surface active agents such as surfactants biosurfactants and filamentous microorganisms exceeding certain thresholds excessive mixing increases bubbles in the bulk phase enhancing the attachment of surface active agents and hydrophobic compounds on the bubbles resulting in a higher foaming potential ganidi et al 2009 pagilla et al 1997 moen 2003 barber 2005 moeller et al 2012 moeller and görsch 2015 poor mixing results in stratification and due to the poor degradation at the air liquid interface surface activities increase resulting in potential foaming rivard et al 1995 ganidi et al 2009 gas mixing has been reported to create more foam than mechanical mixing pagilla et al 1997 other researchers identified gas mixing especially fine bubble gas mixing as the cause of foaming moen 2003 barber 2005 kowalczyk et al 2013 reported swelling and foaming during the long break period between intermittent mixing for the initial days of operation the intensity was reduced during the digestion process and did not have significant influence on biogas production continuously mixed ad with the same impeller speed did not show swelling and foaming the cause of the foaming could be the co substrate maize cob and maize silage co digested with cow manure or poor mixing due to shorter mixing time and a longer break period however kress et al 2018 used a shorter mixing time of 2 min at a30 min interval and did not observe swelling or foaming in a full scale digester and therefore gradually increasing the olr could be a strategy to avoid foaming during startup additional headspace allowance could be provided to accommodate low intensity swelling and foaming at startup nandi et al 2017 did not find significant difference in the biogas production between non mixed and intermittent mixed with a shorter mixing interval digesting manure slurry ranging from 7 5 to 10 ts although foam scum and crust formation was not observed they concluded that mixing might be a long term solution to prevent crust formation in digesters which reduces ad efficiency and can lead to the eventual failure of the digesters optimized intermittent mixing and low intensity mixing could save more energy and still prevent crust scum and foam formation while improving ad efficiency 1 6 effects of mixing on the hrt srt the hrt and srt of cstrs are assumed to be the same hoffmann et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a b in mesophilic cstrs the hrt srt ranges from 10 to 20 days for ts ranging from 3 to 10 lusk 1998 beddoes et al 2007 wu 2012 linke 1997 recommended that for satisfactory ch4 yields the hrt srt should not be less than 10 days with an optimum range of 10 15 days and the olr should be less than 9 g vs l d stroot et al 2001 reported excellent digester performance under steady state conditions with an initial 20 day hrt an olr of 3 7 g vs l d operated under mesophilic temperatures 33 c and continuously or intermittently minimal mixed conditions reducing the hrt from 20 days to 13 days thereby increasing the olr the digesters still showed an excellent performance the specific gas production reduced slightly by about 11 55 1 42 while the gas production rate substantially increased about 22 24 1 99 compared to the 20 day hrt reducing the hrt further to 4 days creating an extreme overloaded condition the digesters performed poorly with signs of instabilities the specific gas production reduced substantially by about 58 41 4 58 even though the gas production rate increased about 45 63 5 32 generally the vfa concentrations increased and the ph was not within the optimal range and these conditions can cause digesters failure in the long term their results show that both continuously or intermittently minimal mixed digesters performed poorly at extremely high olr extremely high olr should therefore be avoided in ad the 13 day hrt srt is within the recommended range especially for low ts intermittently minimal mixing is therefore enough to improve ad efficiency within the optimum hrt karim et al 2005b demonstrated that mixed digesters performed better than non mixed digesters operated at a 16 2 day hrt under mesophilic conditions 35 c however increasing the ts which usually corresponds to a higher olr and a reduced hrt in most cases increased the biogas production while the ch4 yield was reduced indicating that the vs were not fully utilized vs accumulation was high for the non mixed condition and could benefit from a higher hrt for stable biogas production kaparaju et al 2008 reported stratification of solids at the top and bottom with intermittent mixing but this not did affect the digester performance therefore intermittent mixing and positioning the discharging outlet in the middle could be an operational strategy to decouple the hrt and srt and to maintain a higher srt in the digester thereby improving ad efficiency ward et al 2008 reported that a low mixing intensity allows digesters to better absorb the disturbance of shock loading than a high mixing intensity they explained that syntrophic activity enhanced by closer microbial consortia proximity help improve yield and reduce hrt hence high intensity mixing that disrupts syntrophic activity should be avoid the results presented by hoffmann et al 2008 and lindmark et al 2014b indicate that for a longer hrt and a low olr mixing intensity has no benefit to the overall biogas production intermittent mixing with low to medium mixing intensity should therefore be preferred within the optimum hrt range rico et al 2011 reported a high vfa accumulation for a 10 day hrt olr 4 5 kg vs m3 d while no accumulation was recorded for the 20 day hrt olr 2 3 kg vs m3 d indicating that the specific biogas and ch4 yields were reduced with a 10 day hrt intermittent mixing coinciding with feeding performance was better than continuous mixing for the 10 day hrt at a 20 day hrt the biogas production was similar they concluded that at the longer hrt srt and lower olr intermittent minimal mixing is required to improve ad efficiency hughes 2015 investigated the effects of the mixing regime and the hrt in order to optimize anaerobic ch4 production of cow slurry the lab scale digesters with a working volume of 0 4 l for a batch ad and 2 l for a batch fed ad operated at a mesophilic temperature of 37 5 c digesting cow manure with an average ts of 10 5 his results indicate that during batch operations with an hrt of 21 days and a batch fed operation with an hrt of 30 days mixing intensity 36 96 rpm 61 6 rpm and 140 rpm had a minimal effect on the ch4 production with a reduced hrt corresponding to an increased olr the mixing intensity had a great influence on the ch4 production the highest ch4 production was obtained with the high intensity 140 rpm intermittent mixing the difference was only 10 more compared to the 61 6 rpm and 36 96 rpm mixing intensity the validity of their results is reduced due to the fact that the ch4 content was assumed to be the same notwithstanding their results show that for a 10 day hrt with an olr of 8 0 g vs l d low to medium mixing intensity can be successfully applied with considerable energy saving potential 1 7 effect of mixing on vfa stroot et al 2001 reported that generally the vfa increased during the startup phase acetate concentrations especially increased sharply under continuous mixing conditions they attributed this increase to be as a result of an imbalance between hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis continuous mixing at a high mixing intensity could increase hydrolysis and due to the relatively low growth rate of methanogens could results in the high vfa concentrations during the startup kim et al 2002 reported digester s process instabilities during the startup period for all the cstrs for both mesophilic 35 c and thermophilic 55 c conditions while the intermittent minimally mixed ad performed well reaching steady state at a shorter time with a relatively stable ph and low vfa concentrations the higher vfa in the cstr under thermophilic 55 c condition was due to an elevated propionate concentration as a result of an imbalance of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis stroot et al 2001 lower vfa concentrations were reported in intermittent minimally mixed conditions this was attributed to the closer microbial consortia proximity enhancing propionate degradation and increasing the rate of methanogenesis speece et al 2006 confirmed the importance of closer microbial consortia proximity in maintaining lower h2 concentrations for efficient propionate degradation into acetate and h2 closer microbial consortia proximity enhances the syntrophic relationship between acetogens acetate h2 producers and methanogens acetate h2 consumers kaparaju et al 2008 khanal 2009 the conversion of h2 to ch4 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens is thermodynamically possible only when the h2 concentration is 10 4 to 10 6 atm mccarty and smith et al 1986 schmidt and ahring 1993 khanal 2009 karim et al 2005b reported that mixing during the startup period lowered the ph this resulted in digester performance instability and prolonged the startup time the lower ph is attributed to high vfa concentrations inside the digester due to imbalance of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis stroot et al 2001 jha et al 2012 reported that continuous mixing prolonged the startup due to relatively higher vfa a higher vfa to alkalinity ratio and a lower ph than mixing once a day kaparaju et al 2008 reported high levels of acetate and propionate concentrations with persistence of propionate in high mixing intensity conditions reducing the mixing intensity to gentle mixing conditions the propionate degraded quickly high intensity mixing should be avoided during startup due to vfa concentrations buildup reducing the biogas production rates vavilin et al 2007 hoffmann et al 2008 kress et al 2018 showed that highest actetic acids hac and dry matter content was close to the feeding point where mixing was inadequate when the mixing time was reduced the hac concentration increased 35 0 012 though there was no significant difference between the 5 min and 2 min mixing times the fast degradation of hac for the 10 min mixing time could explain the reason for the high biogas and ch4 production lindmark et al 2014b also reported faster vfa degradation with 150 rpm than the 25 rpm at the beginning of the mixing this may be attributed to the dominance of methanosarcina spp and methanobacteriacea due to high intensity mixing and methanosaeta in the low intensity mixing methanosarcina specific growth rate and specific substrate utilization rate are higher than methanosaeta and may explain the faster degradation of vfa in the 150 rpm than in the 25 rpm at the beginning of the mixing however prolong continuous mixing at a high intensity had a negative effect on the methanogenesis and hence the biogas produced non mixing or intermittent minimal mixing at low mixing intensity should be preferred during the startup to maintain process stability and improve performance efficiency at steady operation optimized intermittent mixing at low mixing intensity should be preferred 1 8 effect of mixing intensity and mixing mode on biohydrogen production biohydrogen bioh2 production is a partial substrate degradation which is influenced by the hrt ph and temperature these parameters are influenced by the mixing intensity and mixing mode trad et al 2016 palomo briones et al 2017 tashyreva et al 2017 moodley and kana 2017 the hrt and ph are reported to influence the microbial community and the bioh2 yield volumetric hydrogen production rate vhpr and substrate degradation trad et al 2016 palomo briones et al 2017 moodley and kana 2017 proper mixing prevents ph gradients and provides uniform distribution of substrates thereby maintaining an optimum hrt equal to the srt for optimum bioh2 production ding et al 2010 employed cfd methodology to optimize the reactor impeller mixing configuration to improve the performance of bioh2 production the reactor operated under mesophilic 35 1 c conditions 8 h hrt with a substrate concentration of 3000 mg cod l and mixed continuously with impeller speeds of 50 70 90 110 and 130 rpm the residence time distribution the flow fields turbulence parameters and bioh2 volume fraction were studied based on their results they concluded that the economic speeds of between 50 and 70 rpm is optimum for bioh2 production 50 rpm produced the highest bioh2 yield wang et al 2010 scaled up the work of ding et al 2010 to an industrial scale using a double layer impeller two mixing intensities were investigated 40 rpm and 60 rpm they concluded that the 40 rpm was optimum based on the velocity contours the flow pattern and the power requirement their work supports that with proper understanding of the hydrodynamics of flow inside digesters coupled with experimental results optimum mixing intensity exists for optimum ad efficiency trad et al 2016 reported that bioh2 production is highly sensitive to mixing conditions due to the three multiphase process although the hydrogen producing bacteria are less sensitive to shear than methanogenic bacteria they concluded that for economical bioh2 production power consumption and mixing effectiveness should be optimized niño navarro et al 2016 demonstrated that hydrodynamic optimization of a digester enhances bioh2 production tashyreva et al 2017 recently investigated the effect of three mixing intensities 12 24 and 48 rpm on biohydrogen yield in a batch fermentation with 70 g l ts and reported that 24 rpm was the optimum mixing intensity providing equal distribution of the digester content preventing a ph gradient but without disruption of the particle structure high mixing intensity caused disruption of particles and intense acidification the results of two mixing durations indicate that mixing 10 min and 20 min intervals performed about 2 9 times better than 5 min and 1 h intervals however conclusions cannot be made whether the shorter mixing interval made the different since the mixing time was different evaluating of whether 5 min mixing time was sufficient to distribute the substrate fed was not made still their work supports the fact that optimized intermittent mixing is possible for optimum bioh2 production and further research should be carried out non mixing performed poorly due to the shorter fermentation duration of 7 days since optimum ph and hrt are critical proper mixing is critical for optimum bioh2 production however proper mixing does not necessarily mean continuous mixing or higher intensity mixing improper mixing will cause some substrate to stay longer than desired promoting the growth of hydrogen consuming bacteria palomo briones et al 2017 investigated the influence of hrt on dark fermentation of lactose with 20 g l ts and reported that 6 12 h hrt produced more than 18 24 h hrt with 6 h as the optimum hrt due to difference in microbial community intermittent mixing with optimum mixing intensity and mixing duration may prove economical just like in ad for ch4 production experimental and cfd methodology will play an important role for optimization of bioh2 production 1 9 summary and analysis of different observations this section presents a summary of some of the different observations and data analyzed and discussed briefly due to the difficulty of comparing different experimental and simulation results as a result of the variety of treatments such as the feed type and concentrations mixing method mixing mode mixing intensity geometry of tank geometry of mixers and the setup position some analysis is based on the same treatment conditions or substrate types however an attempt is made to use general rules and recommendations to analyze the different observations table 1 presents the results of different mixing methods mixing intensity and mixing mode for different ts and vs and different substrate types the results indicate that the methane yield and production rate depends more on the vs olr and the hrt than the effect of mixing the biodegradable part of the organic waste and how long its stays in the digester in contact with microorganisms determines the methane yield and production rate for example for ts of 100 kg m3 and vs of 53 kg m3 presented by karim et al 2005b the methane yield is comparable to the results obtained by hoffmann et al 2008 for ts 59 5 kg m3 and vs 50 kg m3 at almost similar hrt and comparable to rico et al 2011 for ts 61 and vs 45 at 20 days hrt mixing method or mixing intensity had no influence even though the ts were different the most important factor was the vs and the olr which were almost similar the results show that increasing the olr reduced the methane yield however the methane production rate increased for the same mel as presented by karim et al 2004 rico et al 2011 and hoffmann et al 2008 with different mixing intensities for vs of 50 kg m3 5 and 53 kg m3 5 3 mixing method and mixing mode did not have an influence in the methane yield and production rate the results presented by rico et al 2011 show that for a 20 day hrt intermittent and continuous mixing produced similar results however for a 10 day hrt intermittently mixed for 6 8 h a day performed slightly better than continuously mixed while intermittently mixed 2 5 h a day and continuously mixed did not show significant differences comparing intermittently mixed for 6 8 h a day and 2 5 h a day the different was only 5 97 it should also be noted that variability in vs and feeding could contribute to this difference and also the fact the 6 8 h a day coincided with the feeding mode therefore economically intermittent mixing with a longer interval could be optimized to improve ad efficiency comparing dairy manure and municipal solids waste msw as feed msw has a high vs of about 90 while dairy manure vs as presented by karim et al 2005b was lower at 50 of ts of both 10 and 15 ts this influences the results of the methane yield and production rate as msw at 14 ts yields higher methane than dairy manure at 15 ts with an even higher olr this is because methane production rate depends on the biodegradable vs and also on the hrt again for the msw mixing mixing intensity did not influence the methane content significantly as the methane yield was the same the methane yield and production rate were higher compare to the dairy manure with low biodegradability the speed of the mixer and the mixing intensity depends also on the impeller type the rheological properties and apparent viscosity also influence mixing however these properties are not only affected by the ts but also by the vs content of the ts continuous mixing and high intensity mixing for such low ts or low olr is a waste of energy and will not improve the digestion process and performance but actually reduce the ad efficiency although mixing improved the methane yield and production as the olr increases the power equivalents of the increase methane produced cannot offset the input power consumption intermittent mixing is therefore the alternative to ensure long term production process without eventual failure and to improve the ad efficiency as indicated earlier the difference between impeller mixed and biogas and slurry recirculation as presented by karim et al 2005b was due to longer srt as a result of ts and vs accumulation which may have a long term effect of reducing the effective volume and causing digester upsets and eventual failure the results indicate that for the same mel generally mechanical mixing provides effective mixing uniformity and should be preferred especially for high solids mixing table 2 presents some summary of experimental and simulated values of average velocity velocity gradient and mixing energy level and their impact on methane production and microbial flocs there is no generally accepted standard of evaluating the mixing intensity that creates an optimum balance between the physicochemical and biochemical processes in ad due to the variety of substrates mixing methods and configurations however the average velocity average velocity gradient g and the local velocity gradient g l turbulent kinetic energy and mel are used by various authors to evaluate the mixing intensity these parameters are related and depend on the impeller type speed of the impeller or the inlet injection velocity the diameter the position and the feed characteristics such as the density the rheological properties and the viscosity the geometry of the tank and the position of feed inlet discharge out feeding mode and the presence or absence of baffles contributes to the flow pattern and hydrodynamic properties inside digesters the recommendation by u s epa of a mel of 5 8 w m3 and g of 50 80 s 1 u s epa 1979 has been adopted by many authors the mel is the motor horsepower and therefore the actual power transferred to the slurry depends on the efficiency of the motor and compressor or pump u s epa 1979 rivard et al 1995 and wu 2012 reported values of mel above 8 w m3 for high solids mixing indicating that as the ts concentration increases the unit power requirement also increases mixing for ts concentration above 20 is therefore not ideal and since settling and solid liquid separation is not an issue in high solids digestions optimized intermittent mixing should be preferred and excessive olr should be avoided sindall et al 2013a reported a mel of approximately 3 1 w m3 for a large scale sewage treatment anaerobic digester in the uk which is below the range the g accounts for the actual power transferred to the liquid slurry and the effect of the viscosity of the liquid slurry and should be a preferred criteria for evaluating the mixing intensity however wu 2010b 2014 proved that g of 50 80 s 1 is not meant for non newtonian fluids and that the general equation for computing g is not applicable for non newtonian fluid mixing since the absolute viscosity was applied the g l is therefore a recommended method to compute the velocity gradient for non newtonian fluids hoffmann et al 2008 reported that a continuously mixed digester with g 17 s 1 lower than the recommended g of 50 80 s 1 disrupted the microbial flocs into single cells and clusters of cells up to 10 μm their experiment showed that continuously mixing should be avoided once the mixing time or turnover time to achieve a certain mixing effectiveness or homogeneity is determined mixing should be discontinued and probably start again when there is evidence of foaming or separation that can greatly influence digestion process and performance this will prevent disruption of microbial flocs due to a continuous shear force sindall et al 2013a recommended an optimum g range of 7 2 9 7 s 1 for a lab scale digester with low ts concentration ratanatamskul and saleart 2016 recently compared three slurry recirculation mixing flow rates mixed 30 min twice a day in food waste anaerobic digester with a working volume of 10 m3 ts and vs concentrations of 8 and 7 88 respectively the computed g for the three mixing intensities were 13 33 s 1 20 s 1 and 40 s 1 the methane production rate shows that g 20 s 1 was the optimum with a flow rate per volume of 0 016 l min l comparing methane production of the g 20 s 1 with the g 13 33 s 1 and g 40 s 1 the reduction were 38 and 13 respectively indicating that optimum mixing intensity exists for optimum methane production wu 2010b 2014 characterized the complex flow field distribution in a large scale digester by using three velocity gradient zones low velocity gradient zone lgz 0 g l 10 s 1 medium velocity gradient zone mvz 10 g l 70 s 1 and high velocity gradient zone hvz g l 70 s 1 the lgz 0 g l 10 s 1 ranged from 84 2 to 96 5 mvz 10 g l 70 s 1 ranged from 1 8 to 13 4 and hvz g l 70 s 1 ranged from 1 5 to 7 6 of the volume he demonstrated that zones with g l 70 s 1 caused flocs to breakup sindall et al 2013b reported that 20 85 of a lab scale digester experiences g l 10 s 1 wu 2014 reported an average g l value as low as 1 97 s 1 even though a smaller percentage 2 of the digester recorded g l 70 s 1 for manure slurry mixing with 5 4 ts indicating that with appropriate design optimization the average velocity gradient can be lower promoting effective mixing and optimum biological growth while reducing power consumption the velocity and the g l zoning is a helpful tool to predict dead zones and possible negative impact on microorganisms and microbial flocs since all industrial anaerobic digesters are heterogeneously mixed complete mixing is an ideal mixing and is rare in industrial anaerobic digesters for impeller mixing high velocity zones occur at the impeller blades tip and close to the impeller blades in gas recirculation and slurry recirculation high velocity occurs at and near the injection nozzle and inlet nozzle respectively and around the regions of entrainment and at the surface where bubbles collapse at these points the g l is high and could cause damage to microorganisms and microbial consortia due to breakup cause by bubble collapse collision and shear force the velocity field distribution is also a function of the actual power transfer to the liquid slurry and is used to evaluate the mixing intensity wu 2010b 2012 established a linear relation between the average velocity and the mel wu and chen 2008 quantitatively identified the flow patterns using three velocity zones a low velocity zone lvz 0 001 0 1 m s a medium velocity zone mvz 0 1 1 m s and a high velocity zone hvz 1 m s using the mel range of 5 8 w m3 wu 2010b recommended average velocity ranges of 0 208 0 332 m s however since the settling velocity of manure and sludge is within the range of 0 001 0 005 m s lower velocities above this range is acceptable wu 2010a demonstrated that with appropriate design optimization an average velocity of about 0 08 m s is sufficient without causing damage to microorganisms while reducing power consumption wu 2009 demonstrated that with an appropriate optimization of a mixing design power input of 63 78 can be saved even though the values of mel for high viscous non newtonian fluids are higher and outside the range the velocity average should not be higher than this range for optimum biological activities and ad efficiency generally the average velocity decreases with an increase in ts and the effective mixing flow distance is reduced with higher viscosities wu 2009 increasing impeller speed or the gas superficial velocity at injection and slurry recirculation are required for high ts also increasing the diameter of the impeller or nozzle enhance effective mixing in high ts double impellers or nozzles are effective for mixing high ts rivard et al 1989 recommended low speed high torque powered impellers combination of gas mixing with mechanical mixing can be a solution to reducing the power input and enhancing effective mixing in high ts an average velocity higher than 0 5 m s is reported to be unbeneficial to methane production shen et al 2013 the results of hoffmann et al 2008 show that continuous mixing with an impeller tip velocity of 0 16 m s can disrupt microbial flocs in dairy manure with ts of about 6 optimization of mixing designs and configurations are necessary for optimum velocity and g l distributions wu 2009 2010a 2010c 2010d 2011 2012 2014 demonstrated that power consumption can be reduced significantly without compromising the mixing effectiveness with appropriate design optimization of the tank geometry mixers types and geometry and the positioning of the impeller and inlet nozzle meister et al 2018 confirmed these findings physical mixing process must therefore enhance optimum biological process at the lowest power input to improve ad efficiency 2 conclusions traditionally stirred tank anaerobic digesters operate as continuous stirred tank reactor cstr there is no motivation to continue to operate stirred tank anaerobic digesters as cstr if improvement of the ad efficiency which includes an assessment of the net energy production efficiency are to be achieved ad efficiency can be achieved with optimized intermittent mixing there exists a mixing intensity threshold for every ad setup above which increasing the mixing intensity is a waste of energy and does not increase ch4 production but rather may reduce it higher mixing intensity above a certain threshold is harmful to microbial consortia and should be avoided anaerobic digesters operating under mesophilic conditions can successfully process low ts concentrations or low olr without external physical mixing operations due to mixing by convection currents feeding rising gas bubbles and geometry configuration however due to the variety of substrates intermittent mixing or foaming suppressors may be applied where foaming or solid liquid separation exist though non mixing experiments have shown high biogas and ch4 production comparable to cstr and intermittent mixing in some cases issues of fouling due to foaming scum and stratification are reported causing process instability and in the long term would lead to crust formation and digester failure for long term operations of anaerobic stirred tank digesters mixing is required despite the influence of substrates on mixing results generally to improve ad efficiency optimized intermittent mixing is preferable to continuous mixing intermittent minimal mixing is enough to maintain the process and performance efficiencies of ad in daily batch fed digesters producing ch4 the impact of mixing on biohydrogen production in stirred tanks needs further research however intermittent mixing proved promising economically improvement of the ad efficiency should be the main criteria in determining the mixing mode mixing intensity and mixing interval for every ad process plan acknowledgement this work was supported by the priority academic program development of jiangsu higher education institutions 
19407,a comprehensive review was carried out on the influence of mixing on anaerobic digestion ad efficiency in stirred tank anaerobic digesters though traditionally stirred tank digesters operated as continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs this review revealed that there is no motivation to continue to operate stirred tank anaerobic digesters as cstrs if ad energy efficiency is to be improved ad energy production efficiency can be achieved with optimized intermittent mixing ad efficiency should include an assessment of the net energy production efficiency and should be the criteria in determining the mixing mode mixing intensity mixing time and mixing interval for every anaerobic digestion operating plan keywords anaerobic digestion efficiency cstrs optimized intermittent mixing 1 introduction the anaerobic digestion ad process mainly depends on the feed characteristics the feeding pattern ph temperature redox potential hydraulic retention time hrt solids retention time srt and mixing inside the digester terashima et al 2009 meroney 2009 the ad process and performance efficiency are influenced by the proximity of the microorganisms to the available substrates and nutrients uniform operating temperature and ph hrt srt and the distribution of metabolic waste which are all influenced by mixing karim et al 2005a b c rico et al 2011 wu 2011 2014 lindmark et al 2014a nandi et al 2017 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 mixing is therefore a physical process that influences the ad process stirred tank digesters are designed to provide external physical mixing inside the digesters a complete stirred tank digester is essentially a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr that is designed to process organic waste from 3 to 10 total solid ts concentrations wu 2013 this is typically done at a mesophilic temperature 35 c with a hrt ranging from 10 to 20 days lusk 1998 beddoes et al 2007 wu 2013 the substrates are regularly fed through the inlet with an equal amount simultaneously exiting through the outlet of the digester the hrt and srt are assumed to be the same lindmark et al 2014a b kaparaju et al 2008 the digester contents are typically mixed continuously either by gas recirculation liquid slurry recirculation mechanical pumping and mechanical stirring or combinations to maintain the solids in suspension and to form a homogenous mixture karim et al 2004 wu 2010a b c d 2013 2014 lindmark et al 2014a b wiedemann et al 2017 light solids such as fiber straw or feathers have a tendency to float on the surface thereby impeding the release of biogas james et al 1980 strenstrom et al 1983 while heavy solids such as stones egg shells sand or other dense lumps settle at the bottom of the digester stratification of either sedimentation or floatation reduces the active digester volume causes mechanical problems with pumps and impellers causes the obstruction of the release of biogas from the liquid phase and may also cause foam scum and crust formation mixing has the following advantages 1 provides efficient utilization of the entire digester volume 2 prevents stratification floating and sedimentation 3 prevents foam scum and crust formation 4 avoids ph and temperature gradients 5 disperses metabolic end products and any toxic materials contained in the influent 6 facilitates the release of biogas from the substrate 7 maintains intimate contact between the bacteria bacterial enzymes and their substrate 8 aids in particle size reduction and 9 promotes mass heat transfer mill 1979 stafford et al 1980 chapman 1989 lema et al

wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 the main purpose of mixing is to achieve homogeneity in the fluid mixture and provide an equal platform for the anaerobes adequate mixing provides a uniform environment for anaerobic bacteria which is one of the major factors in obtaining maximum digestion monteith and stephenson 1981 strenstrom et al 1983 parkin and owen 1986 chapman 1989 lema et al 1991 karim et al 2005a b wu 2014 adequate mixing prevents clogging in digesters wu 2014 inadequate mixing in traditional sludge anaerobic digesters typically resulted in the oversizing of the digesters due to the resulting reduced hrt srt leading to less contact of the substrates with the microorganisms and poor volatile solids vs reduction and low biogas production monteith and stephenson 1981 one important factor attributed to digester failure is improper mixing inside the digester james et al 1980 strenstrom et al 1983 vesvikar and al dahhan 2005 wu 2010a b c d mendoza et al 2011 however vavilin and angelidaki 2005 reported that uneven mixing can create initiation zones where methanogens can grow and thrive and from there they can then seed the rest of the digester their claim was confirmed by lindmark et al 2014a b and zhang et al 2016 issues of what constitute adequate and inadequate mixing in ad are still a subject of debate and whether achieving complete homogeneity is economically feasible in the quest to improve ad energy efficiency karim et al 2005a wu 2014 nandi et al 2017 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 the disadvantages of stirred tank digesters are the high capital cost and operational and maintenance cost of mixing equipment traditionally a complete stirred tank digester operates as continuous stirred tank reactor cstr in which the digester is continuously fed and mixed it is estimated that the energy demand for mixing in a full scale digester varies from 8 to 58 of the total energy demand rivard et al 1995 berglund and börjesson 2006 naegele et al 2012 lemmer et al 2013 kowalczyk et al 2013 lindmark et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 kress et al 2018 the variations in the energy efficiency are attributed to the substrate type ts tank geometries mixing types and their orientations and mixing operational mode berglund and börjesson 2006 ward et al 2008 wu 2012 wiedemann et al 2017 therefore most industrial digesters operate as heterogeneous mixture due to the high cost involved to obtain complete homogeneity latha et al 2009 sindall et al 2013b kress et al 2018 the economics of ad can be improved to maximize energy produced per unit substrate treated and the quality of the digestate while minimizing the capital and operational costs kaparaju and rintala 2008 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 economically optimized intermittent mixing is reported to reduce the energy demand and maintenance cost as well as improve the biogas production compared to the continuous mixing mode of a cstr gómez et al 2006 rico et al 2011 kowalczyk et al 2013 lindmark et al 2014a b wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 ideally mixing must coincide with feeding to homogenize the fresh feed introduced to provide intimate contact between the bacteria bacterial enzymes and their substrate and to provide an equal platform for the anaerobes therefore in intermittent mixing the mixing should coincide with feeding to distribute the feed and then mixed occasionally between feedings especially for daily batch fed or intermittent feeding modes rico et al 2011 hughes 2015 wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 most research on the influence of mixing on ad in stirred tank digesters focuses on the process and performance efficiency without an assessment of the mixing energy input and the energy output from the methane ch4 produced since mixing energy input influences the ad process and performance efficiency evaluation of the influence of mixing on ad efficiency should include the net energy production efficiency which is the focus of this paper 1 1 comparison of mixing intensity and power requirements of impeller slurry recirculation and gas mixing the selection of a mixing method is important to ensure effective mixing efficiency at minimum power consumption there are generally three mixing methods gas recirculation liquid slurry recirculation and mechanical impeller mixing there are conflicting results from various authors on the effectiveness and efficiencies of these methods these differences could be due to different setups or methods applied in the evaluation and the type and concentration of substrates the recent development of technology such as computer automated radioactive particle carpt computational fluid dynamics cfd computed tomography ct and fluorescent in situ hybridization fish makes it easy to evaluate these mixing methods and to select an optimum ad mixing design configuration the impact of mixing on microorganisms and microbial consortia is not limited to disruption of flocs alone but also in the retardation of growth and product synthesis denaturation of extracellular protein change in morphology thickening of the cell wall and absence of certain cells doran 1995 de jesus et al 2017 for microbial flocs shear forces in turbulent flow are resisted by the mechanical strength of the particles since different cell types display different levels of shear sensitivity using a general equation to determine the interactions between turbulent eddies and cell flocs such as presented by doran 1995 alone does not account for other effects and therefore experimental measurement should be preferable the impact of interactions between turbulent eddies and cell flocs is not fully understood doran 1995 however the recent work by hoffmann et al 2008 employed state of the art methods to measure floc destruction at different mixing intensities in ad they reported the of effect mixing intensities during the startup process where the vs ranged from 10 2 kg m3 to 22 3 kg m3 corresponding to low ts of about 11 96 kg m3 and 26 14 kg m3 and hence low apparent viscosity since the viscosity has an effect on the turbulent eddies generated during mixing without affecting the microbial flocs computing the minimum impeller rotational speed above which disruption of flocs occurs using the equation presented by doran 1995 and assuming a floc diameter of 150 μm density of 1000 kg m3 and viscosity of 0 008 pa s shows that impeller rotational speeds above 986 14 rpm would affect the microbial flocs an increase in mixing speed reduces the size of eddies causing interactions with the flocs excessive mixing intensity above the threshold therefore leads to formation of eddies with a size small enough to cause damage to floc cells therefore their claim that 1500 rpm destroyed microbial floc is justifiable especially during the startup process when dense microbial flocs are formed while 1500 rpm may be impractical in normal digester operations it is important to point out at the research level that depending on the substrate characteristics such as the density rheological properties and viscosity optimum mixing intensity exists above which microbial flocs could be destroyed hoffmann et al 2008 reported the absence of methanosaeta concilli after some period of mixing with 1500 rpm mixing intensities contribute to microbial consortia dynamics they recorded similar floc size at the initial state from day 6 28 for the different mixing intensities which then decreased continually until no flocs were documented only single cells and clusters of cells up to 10 μm were recorded their conclusion that continuous mixing shear completely destroyed the microbial flocs without causing long term upsets in the digester performance is therefore valid based on the state of their experimental results even for the lower impeller mixing speed of 50 rpm the spatially average velocity gradient was 17 s 1 which is above the optimum range of 7 2 9 7 s 1 reported by sindall et al 2013a b for lab scale digesters they also confirmed that high intensity mixing also disrupts the spatial juxtaposition of microorganism which limits their syntrophic relationship since anaerobic digestion is multiphase consisting of solid liquid and gas the flow complexity inside the digester makes it difficult to predict the impact of high intensity mixing bubbles breaking up could contribute to the disruption of cell flocs even at a lower rotational speed an equation assuming single phase cells and turbulent eddy interactions as presented by doran 1995 cannot predict this effect doran 1995 de jesus et al 2017 the presence of baffles also increase the shear rate inside digesters de jesus et al 2017 wu 2010a evaluated the mixing efficiency of the three mixing methods in full scale digesters using a simulated average velocity of liquid to quantify the mixing intensity inside the digester and the computed power consumption the results of the gas mixing for ts ranging from 0 to 5 4 indicated that for the same mixing energy level mel as the ts increases the mixing intensity decreased confined gas draft tube mixing proved superior to unconfined gas mixing wu 2014 confirmed this claim unconfined gas mixing generated high velocity at the central region the average velocity of the gas draft tube mixing with ts of 5 4 was used as the basis to fix the rotational speed of a dual helical bladed propeller for mechanical mixing and the inlet velocity for pump circulation comparing the mel he concluded that the mechanical mixing is more efficient than gas mixing which also is more efficient than pump circulation to achieve the same average velocity the superficial gas injection velocity and pump circulation inlet velocity were 7 6 m s and 6 62 m s respectively and the propeller rotational speed was 248 rpm with a tip velocity of about 7 79 m s the high velocities at the impeller tip gas injection and at the inlet can damage microbial flocs near the impeller blades and at the exits where strong turbulent flow exists wu and chen 2008 demonstrated that optimum power input exists for any specific pump circulation mixed digester wu 2010b demonstrated that pump circulation inlet velocity of 6 46 m s with a local velocity gradient g l 70 s 1 causes floc breakup at both the viscous and the inertia subrange wu 2014 quantitatively identified the g l at the exit of the gas injection to be 70 s 1 high velocity gradient zone even though the average local velocity gradient was 1 97s 1 since the fluid flow eventually returns to the lower end of the tube where the gas exits continuous mixing may destroy the microbial flocs completely in the long term the computed breakup number of flocs at the gas exit support this argument the computed breakup number of flocs also indicated that at the liquid surface upper top zone near the draft tube where the large bubbles rupture into small bubbles also does not support floc growth due to the high superficial gas velocity when large bubbles rupture into small bubbles the breakup occurred at the inertia subrange due to shear forces at the gas exit and during the bulk movement of the liquid and the bubbles thin films rupturing at the surface of the liquid trad et al 2016 compared the three mixing methods and presented findings contrary to the findings of wu 2010a their findings indicate that the mel for gas mixing is lower than pump recirculation which is lower than mechanical mixing with a lower shear level in the same order however mechanical mixing promoted homogeneity at a lower mixing time and good mass transfer especially with a high olr non newtonian fluid and should be preferred for an optimized design as presented by wu 2010a since impeller type and the position influence the power consumption and the shear rate generated de jesus et al 2017 recently evaluated the hydrodynamic mass transfer and power consumption performance of four bioreactors bubble column concentric tube airlift concentric tube stirred airlift and mechanical stirred tank using a viscous newtonian and non newtonian fluid they concluded that gas holding and mass transfer coefficients were higher in the concentric tube stirred airlift and mechanical stirred tank which also showed a higher shear rate which could damage microorganisms or cells sensitive to shear forces the power consumption was lower in the bubble column and airlift bioreactors however mechanical mixing provided better homogeneity of the digester contents their work supports the findings presented by trad et al 2016 however it should be noted that the type of impeller used had a higher power number generating a higher shear rate with higher power consumption optimized impeller design could therefore reverse the ranking as presented by wu 2010a who used a lower power number dual helical bladed propeller vertical linear motion mixers with lower power consumption are now being introduced for high efficient mixing of high viscous non newtonian in digesters massart et al 2008 meroney and sheker 2014 promoting mechanical mixing as the best choice for high viscous non newtonian fluids the work of karim et al 2004 demonstrated that low superficial gas velocity at the inlet 0 4 0 8 1 2 m s resulted in stagnation at the bottom and near the walls while the upper top zone near the draft tube was well mixed due to bubbles rupturing as the superficial gas velocity increased the percentage of dead zones decreased high superficial gas velocity is therefore required depending on the rheological properties and density of the liquid slurry for proper mixing however excessive mixing intensity in either mixing methods have the same effect on microorganisms and microbial flocs affecting the ad process and performance and reducing the overall digestion efficiency excessive superficial gas velocity also increases the mel making it uneconomical while inadequate mixing can results in short circuiting washout bypass dead zones sedimentation floatation foam and scum formation clogging and eventual digester failure further discussions include these three mixing methods and in some cases general conclusions are made if the effects on each type are the same 1 2 effect of mixing shear intensity on microorganisms high mixing intensity is reported to have a negative effect on the flocs formation which affects the syntrophic interaction of acetogenic and methanogenic anaerobes causing inhibition due to high hydrogen partial pressure and high propionate and acetate concentrations which increases the time required for startup conrad et al 1985 whitmore et al 1987 dolfing 1992 stroot et al 2001 mcmahon et al 2001 ong et al 2002 kim et al 2002 vavilin et al 2007 hoffmann et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a microbial consortia are also affected by a high mixing intensity kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a b the stability of anaerobic digestion depends on the methanogenic biomass concentration high intensity mixing inhibits hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis due to high volatile fatty acids vfa concentrations causing instability in the digestion process vavilin et al 2007 methanogens are more sensitive to high intensity mixing than other microorganisms these imbalances may cause an inhibition in the ad process stroot et al 2001 methanosarcina spp and methanobacteriacea are reported to increase in digesters with higher mixing intensity due to the high acetate and vfa concentrations while methanosaeta concilii only increased in abundance in digesters mixed at lower intensities where there is no vfa accumulation mcmahon et al 2001 karakashev et al 2005 kaparaju et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2008 zignanshin et al 2011 2013 for a stable ad process the vfa concentration should be within 3 4 g l above which process instability and souring of the digester and even failure may occur hoffmann et al 2008 kaparaju et al 2008 khanal 2009 kaparaju et al 2008 reported the dominance of small rod shaped bacterial cells in continuously mixed digesters and digesters where mixing was withheld for 2 h prior to mixing indicating the presence of methanosarcinacea while long rods bacterial cells were dominant in the intermittent minimal mixed digester indicating the presence of methanosaeta however methanosarcinacea were present in all the digesters indicating that in intermittent minimally mixed digesters there is a good balance of the acetotropphic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogensis and may be the reason for the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent minimally mixed digesters compared to the other mixing schemes in addition closer microbial consortia proximity or the building of microbial layers could also be attributed to the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent minimally mixed digester kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 methanomicrobiales which are hydrogenotrophic methanogens were dominant in the continuous mixed pilot scale digester and no stratification of microorganisms was observed in the intermittent mixing stratification of microorganisms was observed archaea belonging to methanobacteriaceae which are strictly hydrogen utilizing methanogens were abundant in the top layer while small irregular shaped bacterial cells were abundant in the middle layer clusters of methanosarcinacae and cells belonging to methanomicrobiales were found in the bottom layer the results of the pilot scale confirm the lab scale results indicating that in intermittent mixed digesters there is a good balance of the acetrotrophic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens and may be the reason for the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent mixed digesters compared to the continuous mixed digesters kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 hoffmann et al 2008 observed the dominance of two different acetrotrophic methanogenic populations at different mixing intensities methanosarcina spp dominated at a high mixing intensity while methanosaeta concilii dominated at a low mixing intensity this is probably because the vfa concentration influences the dominance of acetrotrophic methanogens at high vfa concentration as experienced in high mixing intensity methanosarcina spp is dominant and methanosaeta concilii dominates at lower vfa concentration mcmahon et al 2001 karakashev et al 2005 ziganshin et al 2011 kaparaju et al 2008 methanosaeta concilii cells have long filaments and therefore a high mixing intensity may affect the formation of filaments while methanosarcina spp cell grow as cocci the advantage of methanosarcina over methanosaeta is that methanosarcina can survive using another methanogenesis pathway by reducing carbon dioxide co2 and hydrogen h2 to produce methane ch4 whereas methanosaeta rely only on acetate they concluded that methanosarcina spp resulted in more stable digesters and this might be an advantage for high mixing intensities conklin et al 2006 and that continuous mixing completely destroyed the microbial flocs without causing long term upsets in the digester performance however high mixing intensity and continuous mixing should be discouraged due to high power consumption reducing the energy efficiency of the system kowalczyk et al 2013 investigated layering of microorganisms in non mixed digesters they observed that microorganisms build layers in non mixed digesters and that methanogens mostly live in the lower layers which has a positive impact on the digestion process supporting the findings of previous authors kim et al 2002 kaparaju et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2008 their results shows the benefits of intermittent mixing over continuous mixing in improving the ad efficiency the positive impact of microbial layering in non mixed periods could be the reason for higher biogas production in intermittent minimal mixing and intermittent mixing with a longer mixing interval 1 3 effect of mixing intensity on ad efficiency rivard et al 1990 studied digester mixing requirements for high solids digestion of municipal solid waste msw to produce ch4 under mesophilic conditions 37 c to improve the economic benefit of ad the laboratory scale digesters with a working volume of 20 l were batch fed daily they concluded there was no significant difference in the digester performance between mixing intensities of 1 and 25 rpm for a high organic loading rate olr of up to 9 5 g vs l d and gradual increasing of ts from 5 to 36 they concluded that to improve ad efficiency maximization of olr while minimizing mixing intensities to increase ch4 production at a minimum cost are preferable the 25 rpm mixing intensity was a waste of energy kaparaju et al 2008 investigated the effect of mixing intensities on biogas production using 400 ml serum bottles and indicated that for a high substrate to inoculum ratio 40 60 gentle and minimal mixing 1 min of shaking by hand when a sample is taken was beneficial compared to vigorous continuous mixing and for low substrate to inoculum ratio 10 90 gentle mixing was also reported as the best their results are consistent with findings of rivard et al 1990 high mixing intensity is a waste of energy and does not improve biogas and ch4 production hoffmann et al 2008 studied the effect of shear generated as a result of mechanical mixing using an axial impeller on the performance and microbial ecology of continuously stirred anaerobic mesophilic digesters 34 1 c digesting dairy cow manure they used computer automated radioactive particle tracking carpt in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics cfd to map the shear distribution and to estimate the local shear intensities developed by the different mixing intensities the performance of each digester was monitored with parameters indicating performance and stability while molecular techniques such as membrane hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization fish were used to track changes in the methanogenic population dynamics and juxtaposition of syntrophic microbes in four laboratory scale 4 5 l unbaffled digesters operating at different mixing intensities 50 1500 rpm the manure with 5 vs was fed into the digesters daily at five different olrs between 0 6 and 3 5 g vs l d they concluded that at steady state conditions the different mixing intensities had no effect on the biogas production rates and yields the methane content and vs removal efficiencies were similar therefore low intensity mixing should be preferred to improve the net energy production efficiency and more energy could be saved with intermittent mixing their results also agree with those of the previous authors rivard et al 1990 kaparaju et al 2008 lemmer et al 2013 recommended slow moving inclined mixers with large propeller diameters which consume less power for mixing high ts contents than a fast moving submersible mixer with smaller propeller diameters their study reveal the fact that the impeller type and geometry is important in saving energy and also in improving the mixing quality they concluded that an optimum mixing intensity is a requirement for every digester operating process in other to achieve optimum biogas and methane production and to improve net energy production efficiency hoffmann et al 2008 sindall et al 2013a b hughes 2015 sindall et al 2013a b showed that there is a mixing intensity threshold above which biogas production decreases increasing mixing intensity above the threshold is a waste of energy shen et al 2013 investigated the mixing performance of different impellers at mixing intensity ranging from 20 to 160 rpm at intervals of 20 rpm to determine the suitable mixing intensity for higher biogas production from rice straw in a batch ad with 65 kg m3 ts at a mesophilic temperature 35 c and with a mixing frequency of 12 times a day with a stirring duration of 5 min each their results of the biogas yield indicate a mixing speed of 80 rpm performed better the cumulative biogas production of the 80 rpm was higher by 23 6 11 4 and 18 3 for 40 rpm 120 rpm and 160 rpm respectively the cfd results indicate that 80 rpm was sufficient for uniform suspension of solids with a turbulent kinetic energy tke ranging from 0 004 to 0 012 m2 s2 for the 40 rpm the tke was below 0 006 m2 s2 while for the 120 and 160 rpm the values increase to 0 014 and 0 02 m2 s2 respectively their work supports the fact that optimum mixing intensity exists for optimum biogas production for every ad setup lindmark et al 2014b investigated the influence of mixing intensity on biogas production during ad batch processing of both high organic loading and minimal organic loading of fresh source sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste ssofmsw and the effluent from a full scale anaerobic digester processing ssofmsw the lab scale mesophilic batch digesters with an operating temperature of 33 c and a volume of 700 ml were operated continuously with two mixing intensities of 25 rpm and 150 rpm or intermittent minimal mixing by only turning the digester 180 and then back their results for the continuous mixing shows that a digester mixing speed of 150 rpm produced lower biogas for both high olr and low olr compared to the 25 rpm the biogas production of the intermittent minimal mixing was lower than the 25 rpm at steady state 4 lower but higher than the 150 rpm this shows that some amount of mixing is beneficial since the intermittent minimal mixing was done manually by hand and therefore impractical in real digesters gentle or medium intermittent mixing may be recommended since the 25 rpm continuous mixing did not show much improvement compared to the intermittent minimal mixing implementing intermittent mixing with the 25 rpm once a day or at a longer interval will be more energy efficient hughes 2015 demonstrated that optimum mixing intensity is required for high biogas production for digesters treating 10 5 ts cow manure under mesophilic conditions at a high olr the highest ch4 production was obtained with high intensity 140 rpm intermittent mixing at short intervals compared to 61 6 rpm and 36 96 rpm however the medium to low mixing intensities with a longer resting interval 12 h resting were ranked as the most cost effective method for both batch and batch fed experiments while cstr was the worse in terms of the net energy produced hence optimized intermittent mixing improves ad efficiency wiedemann et al 2017 also reported that optimum mixing intensity is required to improve ad efficiency 1 4 effects of mixing mode and duration ad efficiency mixing mode time and interval are important in improving ad efficiency mixing mode as used in this paper refers to continuous mixing intermittent and non mixed conditions ad have both environmental and economic benefits and therefore the need to create a balance between these two are paramount in ad research research work to improve the energy efficiency of stirred tank digesters will help to make ad economically viable and attractive to farmers and investors due to the advantages ascribed to mixing traditional stirred digesters operated as cstr were reputed to accrue all the benefits however analysis of the net energy production efficiency of most digesters operating as cstr has showed low or negative values berglund and börjesson 2006 intermittent mixing is reported to reduce the energy demand and maintenance cost as well as improve the biogas production compared to the continuous mixing mode of a cstr gómez et al 2006 rico et al 2011 kowalczyk et al 2013 lindmark et al 2014a b kress et al 2018 various authors have shown that the biogas that is trapped during the non mixed condition is released during the mixing period mills 1979 sung and dague 1995 ong et al 2002 mills 1979 ran an experiment with intermittent mixing of 5 min h in a pilot digester and observed that about 70 of the biogas produced is released during mixing smith et al 1996 reported that intermittent mixing is sufficient for anaerobic biomass conversion hashimoto et al 1981 reported no difference in ch4 production rates when the thermophilic fermentor 50 c was mixed 2 h d compared to continuous mixing and that mixing in the 5 7 m3 fermentor amounted to 7 3 of the gross ch4 energy production with an olr of 9 6 g vs l d hashimoto 1982 investigated the effect of mixing duration on ch4 production rate from beef cattle waste under a thermophilic temperature of 55 c a 6 day hrt and olr of 9 6 g vs l d with mixing durations of 1 2 3 and 24 h d he concluded that even though continuous mixing produced higher ch4 production rates the increase was only 8 11 higher compared to intermittent mixing for a 6 day hrt and a 4 day hrt with a mixing duration of 2 h d respectively intermittent mixing should therefore be preferred since the incremental increase in ch4 cannot offset the energy input stroot et al 2001 showed that continuously mixed digesters performances were unstable at higher olrs while intermittent minimally mixed thoroughly hand shaken 1 min after feeding and 1 min before emptying digesters performed well for all the olrs ranging from 3 5 to 9 4 g vs l d operated under mesophilic conditions 37 c and an initial 20 day hrt kim et al 2002 compared the process performance of cstrs and intermittent minimally mixed manually mixed before wastage and immediately after feeding digesters operated under mesophilic conditions 35 c and thermophilic conditions 55 c with an initial hrt of 20 days 4 ts increasing to 9 4 while decreasing the hrt under steady state operations with both a low and an increased olr the lowest biogas production was recorded in the cstrs while the intermittent minimally mixed recorded the highest biogas production at both temperatures presumably due to the closer microbial consortia proximity karim et al 2005a investigated the effect of mixing on biogas production in six laboratory scale gas mixed anaerobic digesters with a working volume of 3 73 l operated under mesophilic conditions 35 c digesting cow manure slurry with 5 ts and an olr of 3 37 g tcod l d they reported no difference in the performance of the digesters a higher ch4 production rate was observed in the non mixed digesters they observed that an increased in the biogas recirculation rate reduced the methane production they concluded that self mixing created by the naturally produced gas bubbles rising might be the result of the similar performance of the mixed and the non mixed digesters or the longer hrt of 16 2 days the higher ch4 production rate in the non mixed digesters could also be as a result of closer microbial consortia proximity or the building of microbial layers kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 as confirmed by the negative impact of high intensity mixing on biogas production with an increasing recirculation rate karim et al 2005b further examined the effect of the mixing mode on biogas production and found that the non mixed and mixed digesters performed quite similarly when fed with 5 ts cow manure slurry karim et al 2005a the mixed digesters produced more biogas than the non mixed ones when the digesters were fed with 10 and 15 ts cow manure slurries natural mixing always occurs in a digester due to rising bubbles and thermal convection currents caused by heating the digester but this is not adequate for a stable digestion process performance at high ts or olr wu 2014 for digesters fed with 10 and 15 ts with an olr of 3 2 and 4 7 g vs l d respectively the biogas production of the mixed digesters increased 10 30 more than the non mixed for the digestion of 10 ts comparing the biogas production of the non mixed digesters with the mixed digesters the increases were 29 for slurry recirculation 22 for impeller mixed and 15 for biogas recirculation the higher biogas production with slurry recirculation could be attributed to a longer srt than the difference in mixing for the digestion of 15 ts comparing the biogas production of the non mixed digesters with the mixed digesters the increases were 35 for biogas recirculation and 12 for impeller mixed the higher increase for biogas recirculation was attributed to a blockage and solids accumulation increasing the srt they recommended impeller mixed for higher ts though the results show higher biogas production for mixed than the non mixed it s obvious that the biogas increase cannot offset the energy input per unit volume 8 w m3 for the continuously mixed ad intermittent mixing could therefore save energy and improve the net energy production efficiency the results also show that at higher ts impeller mixed efficiency is reduced and non mixed or intermittently mixed would be preferred moreover karim et al 2005c compared six gas mixing digesters and showed that methane production varied insignificantly with mixing conditions at a low solids concentration confirming their previous works karim et al 2005a b their findings point out the importance of mixing at higher ts however intermittently mixed should be preferred to cstr to improve ad efficiency kaparaju et al 2008 investigated the effects of mixing on biogas production in lab scale and pilot scale thermophilic ad of livestock manure to optimize biogas production the operation conditions of the three lab scale reactors with a working volume of 3 6 l were a 15 day hrt a temperature of 55 c 8 1 ts and 6 2 vs fed at 12 h intervals the pilot scale digester with a working volume of 500 l a 20 day hrt a temperature of 54 1 c 6 5 7 5 ts and 5 6 3 vs was fed three times a day 8 h intervals continuous mixing intermittent minimal mixing for 10 min prior to wastage feeding and withholding mixing for 2 h before wastage feeding were evaluated their results from the lab scale digesters indicate that intermittent minimal mixing increased biogas production by 12 5 compared to continuous mixing while withholding mixing for 2 h before wastage feeding also increased biogas production by 1 3 compared to continuous mixing intermittent minimal mixing produced more ch4 than withholding mixing for 2 h before wastage feeding and continuous mixing they however reported stratification of solids at the top and bottom with intermittent mixing but this did not affect the performance and could be an operational strategy for maintaining a higher srt by discharging from the middle results from the pilot scale reactor were similar with an average increase in biogas yield of 7 during intermittent mixing 5 min on and 5 min off compared with continuous mixing closer microbial consortia proximity or the building of microbial layers could also be attributed to the high biogas and methane production in the intermittent minimally mixed digester kim et al 2002 hoffmann et al 2008 kowalczyk et al 2013 hoffmann et al 2008 reported that continuous mixing completely destroyed the microbial flocks without causing long term upsets in the digester performance however continuous mixing is a waste of energy and does not improve ad efficiency also intermittent mixing with shorter mixing intervals does not improve the ad efficiency hence intermittent minimally mixed or with longer duration should be preferred rico et al 2011 evaluated the influence of the liquid recirculation rate on biogas production in a 1 5 m3 working volume pilot cstr digesting screened dairy manure of 6 1 ts operated under mesophilic temperatures of 37 1 c a 10 day hrt an olr of 4 5 kg vs m3 d and a 20 day hrt an olr of 2 3 kg vs m3 d the feeding mode was semi continuous in a cycle of 30 min with a discharge rate of 30 l h the intermittent recirculation mixing of 30 min cycles ten times a day coinciding with feeding mode produced more biogas than continuous and minimal mixing for the 10 day hrt the difference between intermittent mixing ten times a day and intermittent minimal mixing was 5 97 while with continuous mixing the difference was not statistically significant intermittent minimal and continuous mixing did not show a significant difference in the biogas production the ch4 content cod and vs reduction were similar for the 20 day hrt biogas production rates were similar but lower than the 10 day hrt however the cod and vs reductions were more their finding is consistent with other researchers karim et al 2005a b c kaparaju et al 2008 though intermittent mixing ten times a day produced more biogas economically intermittent minimal mixed could save energy jha et al 2012 conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of mixing in a batch reactor with a working volume of 3 l digesting cow dung with 16 28 ts without dilution operating at mesophilic temperatures of 35 1 and a 35 day digestion time two mixing modes were investigated continuous mixing and mixing once a day for 2 3 min the biogas and ch4 yield for the continuous mixing were 7 5 and 6 46 respectively more than mixing once a day the vs removal efficiency was 9 73 higher than mixing once a day their finding is consistent with the findings of karim et al 2005b for higher ts intermittent minimal mixing can improve the net energy production efficiency since continuous mixing only increased ch4 production marginally they also observed lower ph in the continuous mixed digester than the minimal mixed digester due to high vfa production and the release of hydrogen ions during ammonia stripping prolonging the startup time the higher vfa to alkalinity ratio of more than 0 8 during startup in the continuous mixed digester predicts inhibition which was evident as the biogas production was lower than in the minimal mixed digester kowalczyk et al 2013 investigated the effects of mixing modes on biogas production of energy crops corn cob and maize silage co digested with cow manure two experiments and three mixing modes were investigated in digesters with a working volume of 22 l in experiment 1 corn cob and cow dung served as the feedstock while in experiment 2 maize silage and cow dung were used in experiment 1 the following mixing modes were studied 2 h mixing and 1 h break 7 h mixing and 1 h break and continuous mixing 24 h a day intermittent mixing produced more biogas than the continuous mixing and the difference was about 10 for a low olr increasing the olr 0 1 3 5 kg vs m3 d produced fluctuating results in experiment 2 the mixing modes were 10 min mixing and 230 min break 10 min mixing 50 min break and continuous mixing again the intermittent mixing produced higher biogas about 20 more than continuous mixing at the beginning of the digestion process and varied to about 10 later in the process the ch4 content was not significantly influenced by the mixing mode they concluded that in experiment 1 2 h mixing and a 1 h break could save about 29 of the mixing power consumption without affecting the biogas production rate and the ch4 yield in experiment 2 even more energy could be saved their work supports the fact that optimized intermittent mixing and feeding could improve ad efficiency over cstr and intermittent mixing with shorter mixing intervals they observed that the average power consumption during the restart of on and off periods was only 2 5 higher than constant continuous mixing they concluded that the additional power consumption during on and off restart periods was insignificant and that 29 power consumption could be saved compared to constant stirring intermittent minimal mixing or using a longer mixing interval would save more energy and should be preferred lee and sung 2014 investigated the effects of continuous mixing and intermittent minimally mixing 1 5 min before wastage and after feeding on ad of livestock wastewater treated in a lab scale reactor with a working volume of 3 5 l operated under mesophilic 35 c and thermophilic 55 c conditions with an olr of 22 074 g tcod l and a hrt of 30 days their results indicate that under the same temperature tcod removal efficiency for the continuously mixed ad was about 0 11 0 58 higher than the intermittent minimally mixed ad and also the biogas production was about 1 7 4 6 higher for the continuously mixed than the intermittent minimally mixed this increase is statistically insignificant and therefore the intermittent minimally mixed will save energy and improve the overall energy efficiency of the system their result confirms previous authors that at a low olr continuously mixed and non mixed or intermittent minimally mixed show no significance difference at steady state operations karim et al 2005a b c kowalczyk et al 2013 keanoi et al 2014 reported that mixing increased biogas production progressively in a lab scale cstr digester with a working volume of 0 2 m3 co digesting cow manure rice straw and water hyacinths 1 1 1 at ambient temperature 31 c however the increase in the maximum biogas production was only 7 59 compared to non mixed condition the difference in ch4 content was statistically insignificant at 5 confidence level f 0 259607 fcrit 3 954568 p value 0 611726 df 1 84 the specific methane production rate was statistically the same f 3 952113 fcrit 3 954568 p value 0 05007 df 1 84 for long term operations and for an economic benefit optimized intermittent mixing should be preferred to cstr lindmark et al 2014b showed that for a low ts 3 7 and 5 7 the biogas production for the intermittent minimal mixing and 25 rpm continuous mixing did not show a statistical difference but were higher than continuous mixing at 150 rpm their results are consistent with those of previous findings that for a low olr or a low ts continuous mixing did not improve the biogas and ch4 production but higher mixing intensity produced lower biogas and ch4 karim et al 2005a kaparaju et al 2008 their work supports the fact that intermittent mixing at low mixing intensity could improve ad efficiency over cstr and that a high intensity mixing is a waste of energy subramanian and pagilla 2014 reported similar biogas production rates with continuous mixing and intermittent mixing 3 h d 1 h three times a day for a maximum olr of 3 kg vs m3 d they indicated that a higher level of mixing may be necessary to maintain homogeneity than to improve digester performance reducing continuous mixing to mixing 1 h three times a day was enough to maintain homogeneity they indicate the possibility of natural mixing due to gas bubbles during the non mixed period karim et al 2005a b c hughes 2015 reported that low mixing intensities with a longer mixing interval is a cost effective method for both batch and batch fed ad of cow manure slurry with an average ts of 10 5 his results indicate that cstr was the worse in terms of the net energy produced optimized intermittent mixing could improve the net energy production efficiency nandi et al 2017 investigated the effect of mechanical mixing on biogas and ch4 production using a propeller with a rotating speed of 100 rpm mixing for 5 min at 15 min intervals and non mixed three mesophilic 35 c lab scale anaerobic digesters with a net capacity of 15 l each were operated simultaneously at a hrt of 30 days and ts concentrations ranging from 7 5 to 10 ts with different operating conditions biogas and ch4 production of intermittent mixed with a shorter interval were statistically insignificant compared to the non mixed therefore intermittent mixing with longer mixing intervals could save more energy and prevent foam scum and crust formation which could occur in non mixed digesters while improving ad efficiency kress et al 2018 investigated the impact of mixing time in a full scale cstr biogas digesters to reduce the power consumption and to improve ad efficiency mixing times of 10 5 and 2 min with a 30 min rest interval were investigated using two mechanical mixers an inclined propeller mixer and a submersible mixer operated simultaneously the digester operated with an olr of about 3 53 0 24 kg vs m3 d their results show that a reduction in the mixing time from 10 min to 5 min reduced the power consumption 53 and reducing it further to 2 min reduced the power consumption 81 though gas production was higher for the 10 min mixing time the difference was only 15 while there was no significance difference between the 5 min and the 2 min mixing time since there was no evidence of dead zones floating or sinking and inhibition with a reduced mixing time the net energy efficiency could therefore be improved with a 2 min mixing time for the system they studied and more energy could be saved with a longer rest interval between mixing their study confirms the fact that energy efficiency can be achieved with a reduced mixing time kowalczyk et al 2013 1 5 effects of mixing on scum crust and foam formation foam scum and crust formation are major problems affecting ad efficiency in full scale digesters the effect of mixing in contributing and controlling these phenomenon are briefly discussed moeller et al 2012 defined foam as generally a dispersion of gas in a liquid consisting of a large proportion approximately 95 of gas surface active and hydrophobic compounds form a liquid film around the gas bubbles preventing them from bursting ganidi et al 2009 moeller et al 2012 foaming occurs in the presence of a high concentration of surface active agents such as surfactants biosurfactants and filamentous microorganisms exceeding certain thresholds ganidi et al 2009 moeller et al 2012 moeller and görsch 2015 subramanian and pagilla 2014 reported that excessive pump recirculation mixing contributes to foaming when in combination with high filamentous microorganisms ganidi et al 2009 moeller and görsch 2015 they concluded that reducing pump mixing intensity could maintained digester performance and reduce foaming shimada et al 2014 reported reducing pump continuous mixing to intermittent mixing and reducing mixing intensity are operational strategies to stabilize foaming digesters ganidi et al 2009 and moeller et al 2012 reported that excessive mixing initiates foaming in the presence of a high concentration of surface active agents such as surfactants biosurfactants and filamentous microorganisms exceeding certain thresholds excessive mixing increases bubbles in the bulk phase enhancing the attachment of surface active agents and hydrophobic compounds on the bubbles resulting in a higher foaming potential ganidi et al 2009 pagilla et al 1997 moen 2003 barber 2005 moeller et al 2012 moeller and görsch 2015 poor mixing results in stratification and due to the poor degradation at the air liquid interface surface activities increase resulting in potential foaming rivard et al 1995 ganidi et al 2009 gas mixing has been reported to create more foam than mechanical mixing pagilla et al 1997 other researchers identified gas mixing especially fine bubble gas mixing as the cause of foaming moen 2003 barber 2005 kowalczyk et al 2013 reported swelling and foaming during the long break period between intermittent mixing for the initial days of operation the intensity was reduced during the digestion process and did not have significant influence on biogas production continuously mixed ad with the same impeller speed did not show swelling and foaming the cause of the foaming could be the co substrate maize cob and maize silage co digested with cow manure or poor mixing due to shorter mixing time and a longer break period however kress et al 2018 used a shorter mixing time of 2 min at a30 min interval and did not observe swelling or foaming in a full scale digester and therefore gradually increasing the olr could be a strategy to avoid foaming during startup additional headspace allowance could be provided to accommodate low intensity swelling and foaming at startup nandi et al 2017 did not find significant difference in the biogas production between non mixed and intermittent mixed with a shorter mixing interval digesting manure slurry ranging from 7 5 to 10 ts although foam scum and crust formation was not observed they concluded that mixing might be a long term solution to prevent crust formation in digesters which reduces ad efficiency and can lead to the eventual failure of the digesters optimized intermittent mixing and low intensity mixing could save more energy and still prevent crust scum and foam formation while improving ad efficiency 1 6 effects of mixing on the hrt srt the hrt and srt of cstrs are assumed to be the same hoffmann et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a b in mesophilic cstrs the hrt srt ranges from 10 to 20 days for ts ranging from 3 to 10 lusk 1998 beddoes et al 2007 wu 2012 linke 1997 recommended that for satisfactory ch4 yields the hrt srt should not be less than 10 days with an optimum range of 10 15 days and the olr should be less than 9 g vs l d stroot et al 2001 reported excellent digester performance under steady state conditions with an initial 20 day hrt an olr of 3 7 g vs l d operated under mesophilic temperatures 33 c and continuously or intermittently minimal mixed conditions reducing the hrt from 20 days to 13 days thereby increasing the olr the digesters still showed an excellent performance the specific gas production reduced slightly by about 11 55 1 42 while the gas production rate substantially increased about 22 24 1 99 compared to the 20 day hrt reducing the hrt further to 4 days creating an extreme overloaded condition the digesters performed poorly with signs of instabilities the specific gas production reduced substantially by about 58 41 4 58 even though the gas production rate increased about 45 63 5 32 generally the vfa concentrations increased and the ph was not within the optimal range and these conditions can cause digesters failure in the long term their results show that both continuously or intermittently minimal mixed digesters performed poorly at extremely high olr extremely high olr should therefore be avoided in ad the 13 day hrt srt is within the recommended range especially for low ts intermittently minimal mixing is therefore enough to improve ad efficiency within the optimum hrt karim et al 2005b demonstrated that mixed digesters performed better than non mixed digesters operated at a 16 2 day hrt under mesophilic conditions 35 c however increasing the ts which usually corresponds to a higher olr and a reduced hrt in most cases increased the biogas production while the ch4 yield was reduced indicating that the vs were not fully utilized vs accumulation was high for the non mixed condition and could benefit from a higher hrt for stable biogas production kaparaju et al 2008 reported stratification of solids at the top and bottom with intermittent mixing but this not did affect the digester performance therefore intermittent mixing and positioning the discharging outlet in the middle could be an operational strategy to decouple the hrt and srt and to maintain a higher srt in the digester thereby improving ad efficiency ward et al 2008 reported that a low mixing intensity allows digesters to better absorb the disturbance of shock loading than a high mixing intensity they explained that syntrophic activity enhanced by closer microbial consortia proximity help improve yield and reduce hrt hence high intensity mixing that disrupts syntrophic activity should be avoid the results presented by hoffmann et al 2008 and lindmark et al 2014b indicate that for a longer hrt and a low olr mixing intensity has no benefit to the overall biogas production intermittent mixing with low to medium mixing intensity should therefore be preferred within the optimum hrt range rico et al 2011 reported a high vfa accumulation for a 10 day hrt olr 4 5 kg vs m3 d while no accumulation was recorded for the 20 day hrt olr 2 3 kg vs m3 d indicating that the specific biogas and ch4 yields were reduced with a 10 day hrt intermittent mixing coinciding with feeding performance was better than continuous mixing for the 10 day hrt at a 20 day hrt the biogas production was similar they concluded that at the longer hrt srt and lower olr intermittent minimal mixing is required to improve ad efficiency hughes 2015 investigated the effects of the mixing regime and the hrt in order to optimize anaerobic ch4 production of cow slurry the lab scale digesters with a working volume of 0 4 l for a batch ad and 2 l for a batch fed ad operated at a mesophilic temperature of 37 5 c digesting cow manure with an average ts of 10 5 his results indicate that during batch operations with an hrt of 21 days and a batch fed operation with an hrt of 30 days mixing intensity 36 96 rpm 61 6 rpm and 140 rpm had a minimal effect on the ch4 production with a reduced hrt corresponding to an increased olr the mixing intensity had a great influence on the ch4 production the highest ch4 production was obtained with the high intensity 140 rpm intermittent mixing the difference was only 10 more compared to the 61 6 rpm and 36 96 rpm mixing intensity the validity of their results is reduced due to the fact that the ch4 content was assumed to be the same notwithstanding their results show that for a 10 day hrt with an olr of 8 0 g vs l d low to medium mixing intensity can be successfully applied with considerable energy saving potential 1 7 effect of mixing on vfa stroot et al 2001 reported that generally the vfa increased during the startup phase acetate concentrations especially increased sharply under continuous mixing conditions they attributed this increase to be as a result of an imbalance between hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis continuous mixing at a high mixing intensity could increase hydrolysis and due to the relatively low growth rate of methanogens could results in the high vfa concentrations during the startup kim et al 2002 reported digester s process instabilities during the startup period for all the cstrs for both mesophilic 35 c and thermophilic 55 c conditions while the intermittent minimally mixed ad performed well reaching steady state at a shorter time with a relatively stable ph and low vfa concentrations the higher vfa in the cstr under thermophilic 55 c condition was due to an elevated propionate concentration as a result of an imbalance of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis stroot et al 2001 lower vfa concentrations were reported in intermittent minimally mixed conditions this was attributed to the closer microbial consortia proximity enhancing propionate degradation and increasing the rate of methanogenesis speece et al 2006 confirmed the importance of closer microbial consortia proximity in maintaining lower h2 concentrations for efficient propionate degradation into acetate and h2 closer microbial consortia proximity enhances the syntrophic relationship between acetogens acetate h2 producers and methanogens acetate h2 consumers kaparaju et al 2008 khanal 2009 the conversion of h2 to ch4 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens is thermodynamically possible only when the h2 concentration is 10 4 to 10 6 atm mccarty and smith et al 1986 schmidt and ahring 1993 khanal 2009 karim et al 2005b reported that mixing during the startup period lowered the ph this resulted in digester performance instability and prolonged the startup time the lower ph is attributed to high vfa concentrations inside the digester due to imbalance of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis stroot et al 2001 jha et al 2012 reported that continuous mixing prolonged the startup due to relatively higher vfa a higher vfa to alkalinity ratio and a lower ph than mixing once a day kaparaju et al 2008 reported high levels of acetate and propionate concentrations with persistence of propionate in high mixing intensity conditions reducing the mixing intensity to gentle mixing conditions the propionate degraded quickly high intensity mixing should be avoided during startup due to vfa concentrations buildup reducing the biogas production rates vavilin et al 2007 hoffmann et al 2008 kress et al 2018 showed that highest actetic acids hac and dry matter content was close to the feeding point where mixing was inadequate when the mixing time was reduced the hac concentration increased 35 0 012 though there was no significant difference between the 5 min and 2 min mixing times the fast degradation of hac for the 10 min mixing time could explain the reason for the high biogas and ch4 production lindmark et al 2014b also reported faster vfa degradation with 150 rpm than the 25 rpm at the beginning of the mixing this may be attributed to the dominance of methanosarcina spp and methanobacteriacea due to high intensity mixing and methanosaeta in the low intensity mixing methanosarcina specific growth rate and specific substrate utilization rate are higher than methanosaeta and may explain the faster degradation of vfa in the 150 rpm than in the 25 rpm at the beginning of the mixing however prolong continuous mixing at a high intensity had a negative effect on the methanogenesis and hence the biogas produced non mixing or intermittent minimal mixing at low mixing intensity should be preferred during the startup to maintain process stability and improve performance efficiency at steady operation optimized intermittent mixing at low mixing intensity should be preferred 1 8 effect of mixing intensity and mixing mode on biohydrogen production biohydrogen bioh2 production is a partial substrate degradation which is influenced by the hrt ph and temperature these parameters are influenced by the mixing intensity and mixing mode trad et al 2016 palomo briones et al 2017 tashyreva et al 2017 moodley and kana 2017 the hrt and ph are reported to influence the microbial community and the bioh2 yield volumetric hydrogen production rate vhpr and substrate degradation trad et al 2016 palomo briones et al 2017 moodley and kana 2017 proper mixing prevents ph gradients and provides uniform distribution of substrates thereby maintaining an optimum hrt equal to the srt for optimum bioh2 production ding et al 2010 employed cfd methodology to optimize the reactor impeller mixing configuration to improve the performance of bioh2 production the reactor operated under mesophilic 35 1 c conditions 8 h hrt with a substrate concentration of 3000 mg cod l and mixed continuously with impeller speeds of 50 70 90 110 and 130 rpm the residence time distribution the flow fields turbulence parameters and bioh2 volume fraction were studied based on their results they concluded that the economic speeds of between 50 and 70 rpm is optimum for bioh2 production 50 rpm produced the highest bioh2 yield wang et al 2010 scaled up the work of ding et al 2010 to an industrial scale using a double layer impeller two mixing intensities were investigated 40 rpm and 60 rpm they concluded that the 40 rpm was optimum based on the velocity contours the flow pattern and the power requirement their work supports that with proper understanding of the hydrodynamics of flow inside digesters coupled with experimental results optimum mixing intensity exists for optimum ad efficiency trad et al 2016 reported that bioh2 production is highly sensitive to mixing conditions due to the three multiphase process although the hydrogen producing bacteria are less sensitive to shear than methanogenic bacteria they concluded that for economical bioh2 production power consumption and mixing effectiveness should be optimized niño navarro et al 2016 demonstrated that hydrodynamic optimization of a digester enhances bioh2 production tashyreva et al 2017 recently investigated the effect of three mixing intensities 12 24 and 48 rpm on biohydrogen yield in a batch fermentation with 70 g l ts and reported that 24 rpm was the optimum mixing intensity providing equal distribution of the digester content preventing a ph gradient but without disruption of the particle structure high mixing intensity caused disruption of particles and intense acidification the results of two mixing durations indicate that mixing 10 min and 20 min intervals performed about 2 9 times better than 5 min and 1 h intervals however conclusions cannot be made whether the shorter mixing interval made the different since the mixing time was different evaluating of whether 5 min mixing time was sufficient to distribute the substrate fed was not made still their work supports the fact that optimized intermittent mixing is possible for optimum bioh2 production and further research should be carried out non mixing performed poorly due to the shorter fermentation duration of 7 days since optimum ph and hrt are critical proper mixing is critical for optimum bioh2 production however proper mixing does not necessarily mean continuous mixing or higher intensity mixing improper mixing will cause some substrate to stay longer than desired promoting the growth of hydrogen consuming bacteria palomo briones et al 2017 investigated the influence of hrt on dark fermentation of lactose with 20 g l ts and reported that 6 12 h hrt produced more than 18 24 h hrt with 6 h as the optimum hrt due to difference in microbial community intermittent mixing with optimum mixing intensity and mixing duration may prove economical just like in ad for ch4 production experimental and cfd methodology will play an important role for optimization of bioh2 production 1 9 summary and analysis of different observations this section presents a summary of some of the different observations and data analyzed and discussed briefly due to the difficulty of comparing different experimental and simulation results as a result of the variety of treatments such as the feed type and concentrations mixing method mixing mode mixing intensity geometry of tank geometry of mixers and the setup position some analysis is based on the same treatment conditions or substrate types however an attempt is made to use general rules and recommendations to analyze the different observations table 1 presents the results of different mixing methods mixing intensity and mixing mode for different ts and vs and different substrate types the results indicate that the methane yield and production rate depends more on the vs olr and the hrt than the effect of mixing the biodegradable part of the organic waste and how long its stays in the digester in contact with microorganisms determines the methane yield and production rate for example for ts of 100 kg m3 and vs of 53 kg m3 presented by karim et al 2005b the methane yield is comparable to the results obtained by hoffmann et al 2008 for ts 59 5 kg m3 and vs 50 kg m3 at almost similar hrt and comparable to rico et al 2011 for ts 61 and vs 45 at 20 days hrt mixing method or mixing intensity had no influence even though the ts were different the most important factor was the vs and the olr which were almost similar the results show that increasing the olr reduced the methane yield however the methane production rate increased for the same mel as presented by karim et al 2004 rico et al 2011 and hoffmann et al 2008 with different mixing intensities for vs of 50 kg m3 5 and 53 kg m3 5 3 mixing method and mixing mode did not have an influence in the methane yield and production rate the results presented by rico et al 2011 show that for a 20 day hrt intermittent and continuous mixing produced similar results however for a 10 day hrt intermittently mixed for 6 8 h a day performed slightly better than continuously mixed while intermittently mixed 2 5 h a day and continuously mixed did not show significant differences comparing intermittently mixed for 6 8 h a day and 2 5 h a day the different was only 5 97 it should also be noted that variability in vs and feeding could contribute to this difference and also the fact the 6 8 h a day coincided with the feeding mode therefore economically intermittent mixing with a longer interval could be optimized to improve ad efficiency comparing dairy manure and municipal solids waste msw as feed msw has a high vs of about 90 while dairy manure vs as presented by karim et al 2005b was lower at 50 of ts of both 10 and 15 ts this influences the results of the methane yield and production rate as msw at 14 ts yields higher methane than dairy manure at 15 ts with an even higher olr this is because methane production rate depends on the biodegradable vs and also on the hrt again for the msw mixing mixing intensity did not influence the methane content significantly as the methane yield was the same the methane yield and production rate were higher compare to the dairy manure with low biodegradability the speed of the mixer and the mixing intensity depends also on the impeller type the rheological properties and apparent viscosity also influence mixing however these properties are not only affected by the ts but also by the vs content of the ts continuous mixing and high intensity mixing for such low ts or low olr is a waste of energy and will not improve the digestion process and performance but actually reduce the ad efficiency although mixing improved the methane yield and production as the olr increases the power equivalents of the increase methane produced cannot offset the input power consumption intermittent mixing is therefore the alternative to ensure long term production process without eventual failure and to improve the ad efficiency as indicated earlier the difference between impeller mixed and biogas and slurry recirculation as presented by karim et al 2005b was due to longer srt as a result of ts and vs accumulation which may have a long term effect of reducing the effective volume and causing digester upsets and eventual failure the results indicate that for the same mel generally mechanical mixing provides effective mixing uniformity and should be preferred especially for high solids mixing table 2 presents some summary of experimental and simulated values of average velocity velocity gradient and mixing energy level and their impact on methane production and microbial flocs there is no generally accepted standard of evaluating the mixing intensity that creates an optimum balance between the physicochemical and biochemical processes in ad due to the variety of substrates mixing methods and configurations however the average velocity average velocity gradient g and the local velocity gradient g l turbulent kinetic energy and mel are used by various authors to evaluate the mixing intensity these parameters are related and depend on the impeller type speed of the impeller or the inlet injection velocity the diameter the position and the feed characteristics such as the density the rheological properties and the viscosity the geometry of the tank and the position of feed inlet discharge out feeding mode and the presence or absence of baffles contributes to the flow pattern and hydrodynamic properties inside digesters the recommendation by u s epa of a mel of 5 8 w m3 and g of 50 80 s 1 u s epa 1979 has been adopted by many authors the mel is the motor horsepower and therefore the actual power transferred to the slurry depends on the efficiency of the motor and compressor or pump u s epa 1979 rivard et al 1995 and wu 2012 reported values of mel above 8 w m3 for high solids mixing indicating that as the ts concentration increases the unit power requirement also increases mixing for ts concentration above 20 is therefore not ideal and since settling and solid liquid separation is not an issue in high solids digestions optimized intermittent mixing should be preferred and excessive olr should be avoided sindall et al 2013a reported a mel of approximately 3 1 w m3 for a large scale sewage treatment anaerobic digester in the uk which is below the range the g accounts for the actual power transferred to the liquid slurry and the effect of the viscosity of the liquid slurry and should be a preferred criteria for evaluating the mixing intensity however wu 2010b 2014 proved that g of 50 80 s 1 is not meant for non newtonian fluids and that the general equation for computing g is not applicable for non newtonian fluid mixing since the absolute viscosity was applied the g l is therefore a recommended method to compute the velocity gradient for non newtonian fluids hoffmann et al 2008 reported that a continuously mixed digester with g 17 s 1 lower than the recommended g of 50 80 s 1 disrupted the microbial flocs into single cells and clusters of cells up to 10 μm their experiment showed that continuously mixing should be avoided once the mixing time or turnover time to achieve a certain mixing effectiveness or homogeneity is determined mixing should be discontinued and probably start again when there is evidence of foaming or separation that can greatly influence digestion process and performance this will prevent disruption of microbial flocs due to a continuous shear force sindall et al 2013a recommended an optimum g range of 7 2 9 7 s 1 for a lab scale digester with low ts concentration ratanatamskul and saleart 2016 recently compared three slurry recirculation mixing flow rates mixed 30 min twice a day in food waste anaerobic digester with a working volume of 10 m3 ts and vs concentrations of 8 and 7 88 respectively the computed g for the three mixing intensities were 13 33 s 1 20 s 1 and 40 s 1 the methane production rate shows that g 20 s 1 was the optimum with a flow rate per volume of 0 016 l min l comparing methane production of the g 20 s 1 with the g 13 33 s 1 and g 40 s 1 the reduction were 38 and 13 respectively indicating that optimum mixing intensity exists for optimum methane production wu 2010b 2014 characterized the complex flow field distribution in a large scale digester by using three velocity gradient zones low velocity gradient zone lgz 0 g l 10 s 1 medium velocity gradient zone mvz 10 g l 70 s 1 and high velocity gradient zone hvz g l 70 s 1 the lgz 0 g l 10 s 1 ranged from 84 2 to 96 5 mvz 10 g l 70 s 1 ranged from 1 8 to 13 4 and hvz g l 70 s 1 ranged from 1 5 to 7 6 of the volume he demonstrated that zones with g l 70 s 1 caused flocs to breakup sindall et al 2013b reported that 20 85 of a lab scale digester experiences g l 10 s 1 wu 2014 reported an average g l value as low as 1 97 s 1 even though a smaller percentage 2 of the digester recorded g l 70 s 1 for manure slurry mixing with 5 4 ts indicating that with appropriate design optimization the average velocity gradient can be lower promoting effective mixing and optimum biological growth while reducing power consumption the velocity and the g l zoning is a helpful tool to predict dead zones and possible negative impact on microorganisms and microbial flocs since all industrial anaerobic digesters are heterogeneously mixed complete mixing is an ideal mixing and is rare in industrial anaerobic digesters for impeller mixing high velocity zones occur at the impeller blades tip and close to the impeller blades in gas recirculation and slurry recirculation high velocity occurs at and near the injection nozzle and inlet nozzle respectively and around the regions of entrainment and at the surface where bubbles collapse at these points the g l is high and could cause damage to microorganisms and microbial consortia due to breakup cause by bubble collapse collision and shear force the velocity field distribution is also a function of the actual power transfer to the liquid slurry and is used to evaluate the mixing intensity wu 2010b 2012 established a linear relation between the average velocity and the mel wu and chen 2008 quantitatively identified the flow patterns using three velocity zones a low velocity zone lvz 0 001 0 1 m s a medium velocity zone mvz 0 1 1 m s and a high velocity zone hvz 1 m s using the mel range of 5 8 w m3 wu 2010b recommended average velocity ranges of 0 208 0 332 m s however since the settling velocity of manure and sludge is within the range of 0 001 0 005 m s lower velocities above this range is acceptable wu 2010a demonstrated that with appropriate design optimization an average velocity of about 0 08 m s is sufficient without causing damage to microorganisms while reducing power consumption wu 2009 demonstrated that with an appropriate optimization of a mixing design power input of 63 78 can be saved even though the values of mel for high viscous non newtonian fluids are higher and outside the range the velocity average should not be higher than this range for optimum biological activities and ad efficiency generally the average velocity decreases with an increase in ts and the effective mixing flow distance is reduced with higher viscosities wu 2009 increasing impeller speed or the gas superficial velocity at injection and slurry recirculation are required for high ts also increasing the diameter of the impeller or nozzle enhance effective mixing in high ts double impellers or nozzles are effective for mixing high ts rivard et al 1989 recommended low speed high torque powered impellers combination of gas mixing with mechanical mixing can be a solution to reducing the power input and enhancing effective mixing in high ts an average velocity higher than 0 5 m s is reported to be unbeneficial to methane production shen et al 2013 the results of hoffmann et al 2008 show that continuous mixing with an impeller tip velocity of 0 16 m s can disrupt microbial flocs in dairy manure with ts of about 6 optimization of mixing designs and configurations are necessary for optimum velocity and g l distributions wu 2009 2010a 2010c 2010d 2011 2012 2014 demonstrated that power consumption can be reduced significantly without compromising the mixing effectiveness with appropriate design optimization of the tank geometry mixers types and geometry and the positioning of the impeller and inlet nozzle meister et al 2018 confirmed these findings physical mixing process must therefore enhance optimum biological process at the lowest power input to improve ad efficiency 2 conclusions traditionally stirred tank anaerobic digesters operate as continuous stirred tank reactor cstr there is no motivation to continue to operate stirred tank anaerobic digesters as cstr if improvement of the ad efficiency which includes an assessment of the net energy production efficiency are to be achieved ad efficiency can be achieved with optimized intermittent mixing there exists a mixing intensity threshold for every ad setup above which increasing the mixing intensity is a waste of energy and does not increase ch4 production but rather may reduce it higher mixing intensity above a certain threshold is harmful to microbial consortia and should be avoided anaerobic digesters operating under mesophilic conditions can successfully process low ts concentrations or low olr without external physical mixing operations due to mixing by convection currents feeding rising gas bubbles and geometry configuration however due to the variety of substrates intermittent mixing or foaming suppressors may be applied where foaming or solid liquid separation exist though non mixing experiments have shown high biogas and ch4 production comparable to cstr and intermittent mixing in some cases issues of fouling due to foaming scum and stratification are reported causing process instability and in the long term would lead to crust formation and digester failure for long term operations of anaerobic stirred tank digesters mixing is required despite the influence of substrates on mixing results generally to improve ad efficiency optimized intermittent mixing is preferable to continuous mixing intermittent minimal mixing is enough to maintain the process and performance efficiencies of ad in daily batch fed digesters producing ch4 the impact of mixing on biohydrogen production in stirred tanks needs further research however intermittent mixing proved promising economically improvement of the ad efficiency should be the main criteria in determining the mixing mode

19408,sludge disposal is an integral part of wastewater treatment systems and its cost usually accounts for more than half of the total operation cost sludge disposal technology is facing challenges and opportunities simultaneously and can still be improved sludge dewatering is an essential process in sludge disposal and it is important for the effective reduction of the final processing cost coagulation flocculation is a relatively mature cost effective user friendly sludge dewatering technology in this work coagulation flocculation and their combinations with other pretreatments including dewatering mechanisms are reviewed various coagulants flocculants used in sludge dewatering including inorganic coagulants organic synthetic and natural polymeric flocculants and bioflocculants are introduced in detail because coagulants flocculants are the key in coagulation flocculation the different factors that influence the dewatering performance of these coagulants

content in it is generally below 8 before treatment anjum et al 2016 nellenschulte and kayser 1997 sludge disposal is an important part of sewage treatment systems and its cost accounts for more than half of the total cost mowla et al 2013 ӧrmeci 2016 sludge disposal and management are thus major challenges in the global water industry in the latest reports issued by the 10th water conference of the international water association on october 10 2016 sludge disposal and management are highly popular topics ӧrmeci 2016 efficient separation of liquid and solid in sludge is one of the key steps in reducing the costs of sludge treatment transportation and final disposal mowla et al 2013 moisture content mc in sludge directly corresponds to the dewatering extent lu et al 2017 novak 2006 capillary suction time cst and specific resistance in filtration srf are two popular parameters in evaluating sludge dewaterability pan et al 2003 sawalha and scholz 2010 scholz 2005 yukseler et al 2007 the cst test is simple and inexpensive because it does not require an external source of pressure or suction scholz 2005 the srf test as defined in eq 1 1 is time consuming complex and expensive because it requires the application to be in a vacuum sawalha and scholz 2010 yukseler et al 2007 however the srf test is regarded as more scientific than the cst test because of its hydrodynamic characteristic fitria et al 2013 sawalha and scholz 2010 established an empirical model to obtain srf from cst data due to the empirical relativity of srf and cst 1 1 s r f 2 p a 2 b μ ω where p kg m2 is the pressure applied a m2 is the filter area b s m6 is the time to filtration ratio which is the slope of the curve that is obtained by plotting the ratio of the time of filtration to the volume of the filtrate t v versus the filtrate volume v μ kg s m2 is kinetic viscosity kv and ω kg m3 denotes the mass of dry solids ds per volume of sludge in the filtrate medium and should be assumed constant cst and srf are empirical and lacking in accuracy the srf test is based on classical filtration theory yukseler et al 2007 in this test mean porosity mean cake size and pore water pressure are assumed constant but this assumption does not conform to actual practice sawalha and scholz 2010 the cst test is also unable to predict variable physical properties and processes in reality because of its theoretical limitation pan et al 2003 scholz 2005 meanwhile the process of dissolving extracellular polymeric substances eps and releasing bound water might break large flocs into fine particles and could result in poor filtration performance therefore whether srf reduction is consistent with a decrease in mc is unknown guan et al 2017 dehydration rate was recently used as the main index to evaluate the dewaterability of sludge with high pressure in a study on the second dewatering of urban sewage dewatered sludge zhang et al 2017b the filtration compression cell fcc test is another powerful tool that can assess filtration and compression stages in sludge compression dewatering at the laboratory scale lu et al 2017 raynaud et al 2012 vaxelaire and olivier 2006 in the filtration stage a compressive piston pushes the sludge toward the filtering media and a filter cake builds up the compression expression phase corresponds to the removal of liquid by squeezing of the filter cake raynaud et al 2012 however the actual dewatering process is complex due to the large amount of particles with different sizes shapes and components sludge properties should be considered comprehensively to estimate sludge dewaterability accurately sludge desiccation is an indispensable process in sludge management after mechanical dewatering which includes filtration and centrifugation bennamoun 2012 mechanical dewatering is important in reducing sludge volume before further drying disposal because of the considerable influence of the site and climate on natural drying and the high energy consumption during artificial desiccation bennamoun 2012 however direct mechanical dewatering of sludge without any pretreatment cannot achieve the ideal dewatering effect and the mc of sludge after mechanical dewatering could only reach 80 98 wang et al 2010a because sludge is a highly complex system composed of numerous small and surface charged solids which could be relatively dynamically stable in water not only because of their low gravity and electrostatic repulsion effects but also because part of the water is tightly combined to the surface or captured inside the colloidal network vaxelaire and cézac 2004 especially highly charged eps can readily form a stable gel like suspended structure that binds with water molecules due to its steric force keiding et al 2001 mowla et al 2013 neyens et al 2004 qi et al 2011a thus efficient sludge separation is difficult to achieve and the mechanisms of dewatering remain unclear anjum et al 2016 christensen et al 2015 liu and fang 2003 mowla et al 2013 various pretreatments are applied to enhance sludge filtration and final dewatering efficiency dhar et al 2012 liu et al 2016b ruiz hernando et al 2014 zhang et al 2015c zhen et al 2013 existing methods of sludge conditioning can be mainly categorized as physical chemical and biological as shown in fig 1 physical conditioning refers to changing the physicochemical properties of sludge through physical methods including the addition of skeleton builders wu et al 2016c the thermal approach neyens and baeyens 2003 the freeze thaw approach hu et al 2011 use of microwave cai et al 2017 ultrasonic conditioning feng et al 2009 and their combinations dhar et al 2012 ruiz hernando et al 2014 chemical conditioning refers to the addition of acids alkalis li et al 2005 surfactants chen et al 2001 guan et al 2017 oxidants zhang et al 2015c coagulants flocculants mowla et al 2013 and other bio chemical agents guo et al 2015 or use of electrochemical methods mahmoud et al 2018 zhen et al 2013 to the sludge to change the nature of the sludge and improve dewatering performance coagulation flocculation is one of the most commonly used sludge conditioning approaches when cost and efficiency are considered small colloidal particles in the sludge form large flocs and compacted cakes for the improvement of sedimentation and dewatering performance by increasing the sludge dewatering rates and solid content chen et al 2015 2016a novak and o brien 1975 in this paper the characteristics of sludge which intrinsically result in dewatering difficulties are first introduced second coagulation flocculation applied in sludge dewatering is reviewed based on various employed coagulants flocculants including inorganic coagulants organic synthetic and natural polymeric flocculants and bioflocculants combined pretreatment technologies associated with coagulation flocculation are also introduced third different influencing factors are discussed briefly the main framework of this review is described in fig 2 lastly the prospects and technical developments in coagulation flocculation in sludge dewatering are further presented aiming at the characteristics of sludge and the difficulty of its treatment 2 characteristics of sludge 2 1 characteristics of water in sludge the components of sludge are highly complicated and they mainly include water and various types of solids anjum et al 2016 mowla et al 2013 with regard to the existing water different forms with different properties such as vapor pressure enthalpy entropy viscosity and density usually exist in sludge due to the presence of various solids erdincler and vesilind 2003 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 vesilind 1994 a clear classification of the moisture in sludge is essential for the study of dewatering generally sludge water can be classified according to the degree of removal difficulty vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the first classification is free water that is unaffected by solid particles it includes water in void but unaffected by capillary force and accounts for approximately 70 of the total water chen et al 2015 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the second classification is interstitial water that is trapped inside the crevices and interstitial spaces of flocs and organisms mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the third classification is surface water that is adsorbed or adheres onto the surface of particles the last classification is hydration or internal water which is tightly bound to the solids vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the sum of the three latter forms of water is usually collectively referred to as bound water lee and hsu 1995 lee and lee 1995 the content of bound water is one of the major influencing factors that limit sludge dewaterability erdincler and vesilind 2003 mowla et al 2013 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 however jin et al 2004 believed that free water might reflect sludge dewaterability better than bound water can due to the strong binding characteristics and small portion of bound water vaxelaire and cézac 2004 summarized various methods of determining the moisture distribution in sludge including thermal analysis technologies and mechanical strain tests to examine sludge conditioning and dewatering the four forms of water namely free interstitial surface and internal water can be roughly determined via the transition points in various tests lee and hsu 1995 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 for example interstitial surface and internal water can be estimated through the centrifugal settling test the cake is incompressible or slightly compressible from the sum of surface and internal water obtained from drying and dsc tests and from the internal water content from an expression test respectively lee and hsu 1995 lee and lee 1995 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the criteria of these approaches are not unified yet and the parameters of each test should not be ignored table 1 lists several commonly used thermal analysis approaches for measuring the content of bound water in sludge together with their mechanisms or hypotheses conventional dewatering processes can remove only free water and a part of bound water erdincler and vesilind 2003 further release of bound water inside the cell structure can be achieved by the disruption of sludge cells via sonication and alkali nacl and heat treatments erdincler and vesilind 2003 ruiz hernando et al 2014 sludge cell disruption changes the water distribution in sludge and a considerable amount of interstitial water trapped inside the cells including many organic matters is released however cell disruption creates additional surfaces for water binding and increases the unfreezable water content mostly vicinal water water of hydration and a fraction of interstitial water erdincler and vesilind 2003 ruiz hernando et al 2014 discovered that the content of bound water in sludge increases when the intensity of three treatments ultrasound thermal and alkali increases but sludge dewatering can still be improved by these treatments katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 reported that the bound water in activated and digested sludge is reduced by 30 and 70 by heat and freeze thaw treatments respectively although organic matter and bound water are released because of the disruption of flocs and cells during pretreatments extra surfaces for water binding are created as mentioned above thus further treatments such as flocculation coagulation for decreasing the binding sites are required vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the effect of coagulation flocculation on bound water to be discussed in detail later is largely acknowledged vaxelaire and cézac 2004 2 2 characteristics of solids in sludge the main solid components of different sludge types are usually dissimilar because of the different pollutants in various wastewaters and because sludge produced in different water treatment units present different characteristics the biological method can effectively reduce organic pollutants in wastewater and has been widely used in sewage treatment for decades a large amount of waste activated sludge was which usually contains over 95 of water is generated in this process colin and gazbar 1995 zhu et al 2013 thus was is highly popular and its main ingredients include microorganisms eps organic debris and inorganic colloidal particles christensen et al 2015 a schematic of the configuration of was is presented in fig 3 yu et al 2016 the existence of eps liu and fang 2002 2003 one of the main factors that influence the rheological properties of sludge dong et al 2011 is the main cause of the difficulty of efficient sludge dewatering yu et al 2010 divided sludge flocs into five fractions supernatant slime loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellet lb eps is diffused from tb eps which surrounds cells cao et al 2016 li and yang 2007 the dewaterability of sludge as influenced by eps fraction which is negatively charged and highly hydrated and captures a large amount of water is currently a popular topic in sludge management studies he et al 2016 the impact of eps fraction on the properties of the dewatering effect remains debatable research has shown that the addition of eps extracted from sludge does not influence sludge cake porosity but deteriorates srf kang et al 1989 and lb eps content exhibits a negative correlation with sludge settlement and dewatering performance li and yang 2007 moreover high eps concentrations worsen floc settlement and compressibility jin et al 2003 nevertheless a certain eps content is conducive for optimal dewatering performance houghton et al 2001 houghton and stephenson 2002 and a study has shown that the total extracted eps content is positively correlated with dewaterability jin et al 2004 these conflicting results based on extracted eps might be due to the low extraction efficiency and inaccurate characterization of eps wilén et al 2003 therefore extraction methods exert a significant impact on eps quantification wingender et al 1999 various individual methods of eps extraction mainly divided into physical and chemical methods and their mechanisms were summarized and categorized by sheng et al 2010 most studies combined two or more methods to extract eps table 2 lists the most recent commonly used eps extraction techniques formed by various individual extraction methods d abzac et al 2010 pointed out that higher eps yields can be achieved by chemical extraction procedures except for ethanol compared with physical procedures and the yield order of the four investigated sludge was as follows raw sludge sonication ethanol heating cationic exchange resin cer cer sonication formaldehyde heating edta formaldehyde naoh notably knowledge on eps is insufficient and no standard approach of eps extraction exists anjum et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 the difficulty of accurately analyzing eps in sludge might also be due to the high sensitivity of eps to various environmental factors resulting in uncertain transformation between different eps forms and even in the release of extra organic matter because of sludge cell disruption caused by several pretreatments previous research has also attempted to determine the detailed chemical compositions of eps which mainly includes protein like compounds pn 60 carbohydrates ps 40 95 lipids 40 dna 10 aquatic humic substances and small molecules flemming and wingender 2001 sheng et al 2010 to obtain insights into the effects of various eps fractions on sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 pn and ps are the two main components several colorimetric methods including kjedahl biuret lowry bicinchoninic acid bca and bradford have been utilized to analyze pn content the latter three methods have been used extensively for biologically treated effluents in the past 20 years due to their simplicity and precision le et al 2016 other colorimetric methods such as anthrone and phenol sulfuric acid have also been utilized to analyze ps content le and stuckey 2016 with regard to the effects of various eps components on sludge dewaterability many studies have demonstrated the negative correlation between sludge filterability and pn content in soluble eps cao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014b 2015a 2015c and the positive correlation between normalized cst and pn ps in outer layers meanwhile no apparent correlation has been observed between normalized cst and ps yu et al 2008 these results may be due in part to the molecular size of pn being larger than that of ps murthy et al 2000 yu et al 2008 you et al 2017 considered the impact of pn on sludge dewatering and studied the distribution of pn through the activity of leucyl aminopeptidase lap a hydrolytic enzyme related to the degradation of pn and the concentration of adenosine 5 triphosphate atp a supplier of energy in many enzymatic reactions in the presence of ceo2 nanoparticles they found that inhibited lap activity and reduced atp concentrations enhance the production of pn which results in increased sludge srf and reduced dewatering performance you et al 2017 however le et al 2016 discovered that the protein measured in wastewater samples using these colorimetric assays often produces false positive results and has little correlation to the real value the methods used for analyzing ps content encounter the same issue le and stuckey 2016 colorimetric methods including anthrone and phenol sulfuric acid were compared with three commercial assay kits in a previous study and the results showed that existing colorimetric methods can seriously under or over estimate the ps present in wastewater le and stuckey 2016 moreover various pretreatments such as coagulation flocculation have been proven to exert strong effects on the transformation and change in eps fractions thus they significantly change the contents of various eps compositions in sludge and influence the moisture distribution and final dewatering performance cao et al 2016 chen et al 2015 this condition adds complication and as a result the effects of various eps fractions and their components become difficult to explain accurately cao et al 2016 chen et al 2015 in addition most studies on the effects of eps on sludge dewaterability made deductions based on experimental results the mechanisms involved especially those associated with various pretreatments remain unclear to date to explore effective mechanisms in detail sheng et al 2010 increased attention should be given to the development of novel eps extraction methods in situ dynamic and quantitative analytical techniques including the main chemical compositions of pn and ps elucidation of various influencing factors and microscopic investigation of the surface structures of eps and their interactions with various conditioners especially at the molecular level this topic is discussed in detail in the following sections 2 3 characteristics of sludge cake 2 3 1 analysis of the properties of flocs the process of sludge dewatering shown in fig 4 is closely related to the formation of sludge cake in water sludge cake is formed by the aggregation of flocs in raw water which consists of various colloidal solids including eps floc properties affect the characteristics of sludge cake and dewatering performance floc properties mainly include floc size and compactness and various pretreatment processes that follow different dewatering mechanisms result in distinct floc properties and sludge cake which significantly affect the final dewatering performance cao et al 2016 fitria et al 2013 floc properties can be investigated using the image or light scattering technique in combination with fractal theory mandelbrot 1983 serra 1982 wei et al 2009 conflicting results have been obtained regarding the effects of floc structure on sludge dewatering fitria et al 2013 found that large floc size equates to high water removal cao et al 2016 indicated that small flocs with high compactness serve as skeleton builders to aid dewatering in the pressure process floc compactness might play a greater role in sludge dewatering than floc size floc compactness by sweep flocculation is reported to be the highest due to the particles enmeshed in the precipitation of flocs and comparisons show that the floc structure resulting from bridging flocculation is the loosest because of the polymer molecules connecting the particles li et al 2006 thus large but loose flocs form due to the bridging effect only and sludge conditioned with pam alone cannot achieve ideal dewatering performance chen et al 2016b in addition to floc size and compactness floc surface characteristics including surface charges and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity also affect floc aggregation and dewatering performance the changes in the surface characteristics and aggregation of sludge can be determined with extended derjaguin verwey landau overbeek dlvo theory and via aggregation tests liu et al 2010 the low energy barrier of sludge flocs and high hydrophobicity promote flocculation which is conducive for good solid liquid separation he et al 2015 liao et al 2001 showed that a strong inverse correlation exists between the surface charge and hydrophobicity contact angles of sludge and pere et al 1993 revealed an inverse correlation between the zeta potential and water contact angle of sludge from pulp and paper mill effluents floc characteristics can be also tested by contact angle to determine dewaterability to a certain extent pere et al 1993 thus geometric floc structures and surface characteristics should be considered to obtain a comprehensive understanding of floc properties and their effects on dewatering performance 2 3 2 sludge cake properties another main reason for inconsistent reports on the effects of floc structure on sludge dewatering is that the determined factor is the structure of the sludge cake itself and not that of the flocs on the basis of the principle of the structure activity relationship the structure and formation process of sludge cake are important sludge dewatering by draining and repelling water includes two procedures formation of sludge cake and subsequent compression of the sludge cake fig 4 thapa et al 2009a during the former procedure the solid in sludge is concentrated and aggregated resulting in the formation of a cake with the structural characteristics of an interconnected network which could be a sediment or a filter cake at a certain concentration stickland 2015 a portion of free water remains trapped in the cake the sludge water and solids in the cake present a complicated coexistence relationship the interaction between them results in unique characteristics through various dewatering treatments in the latter procedure if the applied pressure exceeds a certain load the sludge network would collapse such that the water in the sludge is seriously trapped because of cake void closure and subsequent deterioration in sludge filterability i e the permeability of the cake decreases with the excess pressure liu et al 2013 novak et al 1999 qi et al 2011b smollen and kafaar 1997 stickland 2015 thus excessively high pressure is useless for improving the dewatering rate sveegaard et al 2012 pointed out that within a low pressure range 0 50 kpa a linear relation is obtained between srf and pressure drop across the cake therefore the permeability and compressibility exhibited in different types of sludge are important for dewatering performance including the removal of sludge water and the increase in solid content qi et al 2011a many studies have characterized the compressibility of sludge by using the coefficient of compressibility s which is obtained by two values of srf under different applied pressures p 1 and p 2 kg m2 using eq 2 1 cao et al 2016 qi et al 2011a 2 1 s r f 1 s r f 2 p 1 p 2 s accordingly a small value of s indicates low sludge compressibility which is beneficial for sludge dewaterability cao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017c many researchers have also analyzed sludge expression characteristics via experimental evaluations for example shirato et al 1974 adopted the combined terzaghi voigt rheological model with three parameters b η and c e to study the time dependence of the consolidation ratio during the dewatering process as shown in eq 2 2 2 2 u c l 1 l l 1 l f 1 b 1 exp π 2 i 2 c e 4 ω 0 2 t c b 1 exp η t c where u c represents the consolidation ratio b represents the fraction occupied by the second stage c e represents the modified consolidation coefficient η is a creep factor ω denotes the specific volume of wet cake i is the number of drainage surfaces l is the cake thickness at a certain consolidation time t c and l 1 and l f are the cake thicknesses at the starting and ending times respectively under infinite consolidation time and assuming that the rate of the second consolidation stage is much slower than that of the first consolidation eq 2 2 can be written as 2 3 u c 1 b exp η t c where b and η can be determined through the results of ln 1 u c versus t c shirato et al 1974 the terzaghi voigt rheological model is a phenomenological model that lacks a theoretical basis chang and lee 1998 this model can be applied to describe the consolidation process of sludge without a large amount of bound water such as clay chu and lee 1999 and kaolin slurry chang and lee 1998 however an unexpected consolidation stage is speculated to arise from the erosion of strongly bound moisture chang and lee 1998 a modified three stage consolidation model shown in eq 2 4 is proposed for sewage sludge to further reflect the consolidation degree of sludge in the round chang and lee 1998 chu and lee 1999 2 4 u c l 1 l l 1 l f 1 b f 1 exp π 2 i 2 c e 4 ω 0 2 t c b 1 exp η t c f t c t c where t c is the duration of the entire stage and 1 b f b and f represent the fractions occupied by the first second and third stages respectively the first consolidation stage was proposed to be a process of pore water leakage and cake structure collapse the second stage was interpreted as the reconfiguration of sludge particles into a stable structure and the third one was speculated to be the erosion of bound water chang and lee 1998 the drawback of this modified three stage consolidation model is its weak sensibility toward b and the fraction of moisture removed in the second stage which makes model outputs with very different b values appear similar meanwhile the model outputs have high sensibility to η which causes a large error vaxelaire and olivier 2006 a visual and qualitative observation for the comparison of the difference between the first and second stages could be obtained by 1 u c or ln 1 u c versus the consolidation time plots lu et al 2017 raynaud et al 2012 vaxelaire and olivier 2006 as presented in fig 5 raynaud et al 2012 the steep slope of the first stage indicates the high elasticity of the sludge cake the slope of the second stage characterizes viscous behavior and a steep slope indicates high mobility of aggregates the two steep slopes are desired for dewatering by expression chu and lee 1999 lu et al 2017 raynaud et al 2012 the structure of sludge cake intrinsically accounts for the final dewatering performance however direct study of the condensed structures of sludge cake is limited to qualitative observation by microscopes cao et al 2016 you et al 2017 yu et al 2016 few study has performed quantitative or semi quantitative investigation of the structural information of sludge cakes and the relationship between cake structure and dewatering performance which are important in the construction and regulation of a suitable sludge cake structure with porous and incompressible characteristics by various pretreatments such as coagulation flocculation skeleton building thermal method microwave method ultrasonic conditioning acidification alkalinity oxidation etc the major difficulties in investigating this topic might be due to insufficient advanced technologies and sophisticated analytical instruments for highly complicated cake structures 3 coagulation flocculation in sludge dewatering coagulation flocculation is one of the most commonly applied techniques to achieve efficient solid liquid separation in water treatment bolto and gregory 2007 bratby 2016 chang 2011 ghernaout and ghernaout 2012 gregory 2006 ives 1977 jiang 2015 khachan et al 2014 lee et al 2014 lyklema 1985 overbeek 1977 sillanpää et al 2018 thomas et al 1999 verwey and overbeek 1948 yang et al 2016b in the coagulation process small suspended colloids in water are destabilized after diminishing their surface charges by the addition of coagulants with an opposite charge then the destabilized particles aggregate and settle down bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b to accelerate particle aggregation further and improve settlement efficiency polymeric flocculants with flexible long chain conformation are sometimes fed after coagulation as coagulant aids these polymeric flocculants act as bridges that adsorb and connect various colloidal particles in water to form large flocs that can be effectively removed by sedimentation bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b the latter process is called flocculation coagulation flocculation technology is widely employed in many industrial fields including mining roussy et al 2004 oil extraction ahmad et al 2005 and paper production ahmad et al 2008 aside from water treatment coagulation flocculation efficiency depends largely on the selected coagulants flocculants different coagulants flocculants exhibit different coagulation flocculation performance due to their different structural characteristics namely charge characteristics ionic properties special functional groups and molecular weight mw bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b owing to the different characteristics of various types of targeted pollutants a suitable coagulant flocculant should be selected according to the coagulation flocculation mechanisms on the basis of coagulation flocculation effects charge neutralization and bridging are two widely accepted mechanisms bratby 2016 chang 2011 yang et al 2016b zhang et al 2010a 2014b given that most of the insoluble suspended solids in water contain negative surface charge traditional coagulants are mainly trivalent metal inorganic salts such as aluminum sulfate ferric chloride poly aluminum chloride pac etc to obtain high charge neutralization effects on the basis of dlvo theory and the diffuse electric double layer model hubbard 2002 overbeek 1977 verwey and overbeek 1948 meanwhile the commonly used flocculants are organic polymeric materials including synthetic and natural polymeric flocculants and bioflocculants the mw of polymeric flocculants is important in bridging flocculation anbu clemensis et al 2012 meyn et al 2012 zheng et al 2014 the mw of polyacrylamide pam one of the most popular flocculants is usually more than 10 000 000 g mol in addition cationic polymeric flocculants usually possess dual functions of coagulation and flocculation lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b certain coagulant flocculant is commonly of single functionality which always results in a single mechanism and high dose low mw inorganic coagulants and organic polymeric flocculants exhibit different coagulation flocculation behaviors and removal superiorities because they possess substantially different molecular structures and various affinities to different contaminants in water bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b moreover real wastewater and sludge are both usually complex mixtures and contain various contaminants with different characteristics thus in addition to the sole use of various coagulants flocculants the combined usages of various inorganic coagulants and organic polymeric flocculants by making full use of their different advantages are crucial for example the dewatering efficiency of adding pac in sludge followed by cationic polymers is better than that conditioned by cationic polymeric flocculants alone because pac can efficiently neutralize the surface charge of sludge and enhance the permeability of conditioned sludge pambou et al 2016 the main mechanisms of sewage coagulation flocculation namely charge neutralization and bridging effect are also suitable for sludge dewatering böhm and kulicke 1997 thapa et al 2009b coagulants can effectively destroy the relative stability of charged particles and make them agglomerate into large flocs prior to sedimentation and mechanical dewatering qi et al 2011a zheng et al 2013 2014 zhu et al 2013 in the dewatering process the charge neutralization effect can still reduce the thickness of the hydrated shell of sludge particles and enhance the free water content by compressing the electric double layer and weakening the surface tension of sludge water wang et al 2016a moreover coagulants can destroy the sludge network structure and weaken its water trapping capability in deep dewatering zhang et al 2017b the bridging effect is also essential in sludge dewatering and floc stability lee and liu 2000 the packed sludge flocs formed by high mw polyelectrolytes demonstrate good filtration performance thapa et al 2009b therefore increasing the mw of flocculants is a major modification method for improving dewatering efficiency although the coagulation flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering are similar to those in contaminant removal such as suspended colloids and natural organic matter in normal water and wastewater treatment jiang 2015 lee et al 2014 sillanpää et al 2018 yang et al 2016b the treatment conditions and objectives of the two processes are fundamentally different generally the purpose of coagulation flocculation applied in normal water and wastewater treatment is to remove various contaminants and finally purify the water while that in sludge dewatering process is mainly to thoroughly separate water from solids as far as possible thus the former focuses on the aggregation and separation of contaminants promoted by coagulants flocculants in addition to this effect the latter one still emphasizes the construction of suitable structure of sludge cake with good filtration performance raynaud et al 2012 thapa et al 2009a wei et al 2018 with regard to the treatment process the solid content in sludge dewatering is higher and more complicated than that in the normal wastewater coagulation flocculation process which results in a heterogeneous coverage of dewatering conditioner on the oppositely charged sludge particles sun et al 2016 in normal wastewater coagulation flocculation this similar phenomenon is called charge patching in which the zeta potential of the supernatant deviates from zero at the optimal dose yang et al 2016b the presence of many sludge particles and the non uniform distribution of negative charge on the particles surfaces deteriorate the ideal charge neutralization effect in the sludge dewatering process moreover some particles are trapped in the net like structure before being fully neutralized thus the zero zeta potential achieved by the dose might not the optimal one for sludge dewatering sun et al 2016 this fact might be interpreted as another phenomenon that is the sludge with the large but loose flocs has not ideal dewateriblity chen et al 2016b numerous studies have confirmed that cationic sludge conditioners can improve dewaterability effectively and have used the zeta potential as a controlling parameter in interpreting the coagulation flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering jin et al 2016 lee and liu 2000 2001 lu et al 2017 sun et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 however the results showed that the zeta potential is not significantly correlated with other controlling parameters such as solid content and floc size sun et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 moreover charge neutralization and bridging simultaneously affect the coagulation flocculation process and the combined action of charge neutralization and bridging has been obtained based on experimental results sun et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 thus the explicit coagulation flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering are still unknown 3 1 factors that influence sludge dewatering coagulants flocculants make contact with suspended colloids to form large flocs that down easily bolto and gregory 2007 gregory and barany 2011 and are affected by various environmental factors therefore the various factors that influence sludge dewatering should be understood and considered conditioner dose ph and temperature are three popular environmental factors and are briefly discussed below 3 1 1 conditioner dose dose is one of the most important factors that affect the coagulation flocculation process in sludge dewatering an optimum dose exists for any conditioner in consideration of dewatering efficiency and economic issues insufficient or low doses of coagulants flocculants result in weak charge neutralization and bridging effects meanwhile excessive doses might cause sludge particles to be covered with coagulatants flocculants resulting in the regeneration of the suspension stability of flocs that is the restabilization effect lin et al 2015 yang et al 2016b consequently the turbidity induced by bio matters such as pn and ps with a relatively high mw decreases initially and then increases under coagulant overdose which results in the fluctuation of soluble eps properties and affects dewaterability zhang et al 2014b the restabilization effect is usually evident in coagulation systems that mainly follow simple charge neutralization and is not evident in those that follow the charge patching mechanism guibal et al 2006 ives 1977 sludge flocs exhibit reduced compactness at high coagulant doses verrelli et al 2009 for organic polymeric flocculants and microbial flocculants mbfs overdosing deteriorates the dewatering performance guo et al 2015 guo and ma 2015 jin et al 2016 pambou et al 2016 the cst curve that corresponds to sludge conditioned with polymers drops initially and then rises as the dose increases which means that an optimal conditioning dose exists pambou et al 2016 besides system re stability caused by superabundant positive charge and overdose of polymeric conditioners increase the viscosity of the sludge water system and thus result in the reduction of filtrate and deterioration of dewaterability christensen et al 1993 pambou et al 2016 in a previous work the srf of conditioned sludge increased and the filter paper broke due to the very high viscosity of conditioned sludge at a polymeric flocculant overdose of approximately 40 mg g ds dong et al 2011 in addition optimal conditioner doses change in different environmental conditions such as ph and temperature novak and bandak 1989 therefore optimal doses under different situations should be determined 3 1 2 ph the effect of ph on sludge dewatering is also crucial in the wastewater treatment process zheng et al 2013 generally the surface charges of colloidal particles in wastewater and coagulants flocculants especially in ionic coagulants flocculants vary under different ph levels which affect the charge neutralization effect seriously as reported by neyens and baeyens 2003 besra et al 2004 and raynaud et al 2012 the negative charges of colloidal particles are usually enhanced by the increasing ph value of the system various coagulants flocculants usually exhibit different ph dependencies in terms of sludge dewatering performance the system ph in inorganic coagulants can influence solubility speed of the hydrolysis reaction and precipitation forms verrelli et al 2009 as shown in fig 6 cao et al 2016 reported that the hydrolysis degree of inorganic salt coagulants exerts a significant impact on dewatering performance and monomer aluminum and oligomeric state aluminum exhibit poor performance meanwhile compared with slow reaction limited cluster aggregation that forms denser aggregates rapid diffusion limited cluster aggregation that results from a high metal hydrolysis ratio in a high ph system deteriorates the dewatering performance verrelli et al 2009 li et al 2005 pointed out that only acidification can decrease cst and srf when al salts are used to treat sludge water soluble organic polymeric flocculants exhibit complicated ph dependencies because of their distinct molecular structures and charge properties neutral and strongly ionic polymeric flocculants are usually suitable for a relatively wide ph range in sludge dewatering zheng et al 2014 for example three organic polymeric flocculants namely pam cationic pam cpam and chitosan graft poly dimethy ldiallyl ammonium chloride chitosan g pdmdaac can reduce mc to below 80 at a dose of 20 mg l in the range of ph 2 9 and they exert an excellent effect in the ph range of 4 7 wang et al 2016a amphoteric ones also show improved water solubility salt resistance and flocculation performance in a wide ph range dao et al 2016 lee et al 2014 rabiee et al 2014 however weak ionic polymeric flocculants usually exhibit strong ph effects for example chitosan a weak cationic natural polymer usually shows good flocculation performance in acidic conditions wang et al 2016a for mbfs the effect of system ph on dewatering is evident and important because most microorganisms contain weak acidic and or alkaline ions such as carboxyl groups which are highly sensitive to ph the mbfs reported by guo et al 2015 exhibit better dewatering performance in the ph range of 6 5 8 5 than in other ph ranges similarly zhang et al 2010b found that ph 7 5 is optimal for the hydration of sludge conditioned by mbfs in addition to the ph effects of coagulants flocculants the impact of ph on eps in sludge has also been considered extreme ph causes a disruption on the cell wall which results in intracellular material leakage neyens et al 2004 for example eps is released and dissolved in the sludge bulk after acidification due to instability at extreme ph values zhang et al 2015c in practice the mechanisms of eps extraction are mainly based on the improvement of repulsive force and disruption of the interaction between eps and cells after acidic or alkaline treatments sheng et al 2010 chen et al 2001 reported that sludge demonstrates good dewaterability and settleability in acidic conditions due to the destruction and reduction of eps raynaud et al 2012 who proposed that ph variation releases trapped water and fine particles also confirmed the effect of ph on the floc structure 3 1 3 temperature practical experience in the coagulation flocculation of wastewaters shows that ambient temperature also affects coagulation flocculation processes the optimal doses of coagulants flocculants usually increase as temperature decreases in a suitable range chen et al 2007 zhang et al 2010a zhang et al 2010a reported that the difference between the optimal doses for a chitosan based flocculant in summer 0 5 mg l and in winter 1 0 mg l in treating portable water can be double this finding can be ascribed to two factors yang et al 2016b one is that the viscosity of liquid increases with decreasing temperature which impedes the brownian movements of colloid particles and decreases agglomeration as a consequence zhang et al 2010a the other is that high temperature can usually improve the solubility and activity of polymeric flocculants and therefore results in a high extended conformation of macromolecules which benefits bridging flocculation sperling 2006 however a higher temperature is not benefical for the flocculation effects also lu et al 2005 lu et al 2005 compared the temperature effect on trona suspension using a mbf at 35 c 45 c 55 c and 65 c the status of the coagulation system the suspension viscosity and the activity of mbfs were affected by temperature and a maximum sedimentation rate was obtained at 45 c lu et al 2005 because the flocs formed at relatively high temperature was unstable and the sedimentation solid volume was easy to be expanded meanwhile the bioflocculant might be partly denaturation in high temperature situation lu et al 2005 the effect of temperature on sludge dewatering can also be explained by the abovementioned principles in a previous study the limiting viscosity the value of viscosity at the infinite shear rate decreased from 8 42 to 1 70 mpa for raw sludge and from 12 52 to 1 83 mpa for conditioned sludge and network strength weakened for those sludge as temperature increased from 10 c to 70 c dong et al 2011 from another aspect temperature influences dewaterability by changing sludge properties when the temperature is lower than 15 c the concentration of eps including pn and ps increases significantly moreover suspended solids have a high concentration due to the weak floc structure in winter wilén et al 2008 when the temperature drops further to the freezing stage limited quantities of organic matters are released hu et al 2011 freeze thaw and thermal treatments in sludge dewatering have also been studied under further temperature regulation hu et al 2011 wang et al 2017 was dewatered by freeze thaw treatment is accomplished through the separation of solid and liquid fractions during the formation of the ice matrix when bulk sludge is completely frozen tiny unfrozen regimes exist in the ice matrix and extended freezing or curing of sludge can improve sludge dewaterability hu et al 2011 freeze thaw treatment not only enhances sludge dewaterability but also solubilizes organic matters from the sludge matrix hu et al 2011 the improvement in sludge dewaterability after thermal treatment can be attributed to the changes in the original structures and properties of sludge wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 pointed out that a significant disintegration in eps occurs and the binding energy of water in sludge decreases after hydrothermal treatment in which most of the energy input is consumed in breaking down the binding strength between the adjacent water and solid particles free water becomes the main form of moisture existence in hydrothermal sludge when the temperature exceeds 180 c the melioration of surface properties including surface charge and relative hydrophobicity reportedly promotes the decrease in negative electrostatic repulsion and destroys the binding effect between particles and water wang et al 2014 thermal treatment in the temperature range of 60 c 180 c destroys the cell wall and makes the protein susceptible to biological degradation neyens and baeyens 2003 organic solubilization increases logarithmically with treatment duration in thermal pre treatment 60 c 180 c and high temperatures 180 c lead to high organic solubilization rates zhang et al 2017a 3 2 chemical coagulants flocculants common dewatering reagents include inorganic salt coagulants such as ferric and aluminum salts and synthetic organic polymeric flocculants mainly include pam and pam derivatives the addition of these chemicals is conducive to the agglomeration of fine sludge colloids through charge neutralization and bridging effects dentel et al 2000 niu et al 2013 thereby decreasing the srf and content of bound water in sludge katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 several novel bioflocculants and many combinations of techniques with other pretreatments were reported and utilized to enhance the final sludge dewatering of coagulation flocculation 3 2 1 inorganic salt coagulants inorganic salt coagulants facilitate the conglomeration of sludge particles into flocs through charge neutralization niu et al 2013 besides inorganic coagulants have been reported to serve as skeleton builders and improve the porosity of sludge cake qi et al 2011a sludge containing alum flocs or ferric flocs usually demonstrate low compressibility small but compact structures and high solid contents chen et al 2015 lai and liu 2004 the most commonly used inorganic salt coagulants in wastewater treatment are ferric and aluminum salts which can be divided into small molecule inorganic coagulants such as alcl3 al2 so4 3 fecl3 fe2 so4 3 etc and inorganic polymeric coagulants ipcs such as pac polyferric sulfate pfs etc ipcs generally have higher charge density and larger molecular weight than small molecule inorganic coagulants the various inorganic coagulants applied in different sludge dewatering processes are summarized in table 3 3 2 1 1 aluminum salt coagulants aluminum salts are the most commonly used inorganic coagulants turchiuli and fargues 2004 investigated the dewatering performance and sludge flocs of two small molecule inorganic coagulants al2 so4 3 and fecl3 in clay suspensions they pointed out that the floc structure is linked to sludge dewaterability turchiuli and fargues 2004 alum flocs are larger and more compact than ferric ones resulting in the faster settling of alum flocs ferric flocs contain approximately 20 less bound water than alum flocs but exhibit higher cst values and therefore higher resistance to water removal than alum ones turchiuli and fargues 2004 however verrelli et al 2009 reported that alum sludge exhibits poorer dewatering performance than ferric sludge at high ph and doses due to the high hydrolysis ratio of pac the same group also concluded that ferric and alum sludge yielded similar performance in dewatering kinetics after comparing and assessing the dewaterability of a range of drinking water treatment plant sludges through computation of dewatering performance indicators for a diaphragm filter press verrelli et al 2010 those inconsistent results might result from their different characteristics of treated sludge and experimental conditions turchiuli and fargues 2004 verrelli et al 2009 2010 in addition to using conventional inorganic coagulants in primary sludge conditions xia et al 2016 studied the influence of alcl3 on deep dewatering of dewatered sewage sludge and found that the mc of filter sludge cake decreases from 73 41 to 54 03 when the dose is 8 g alcl3 300 g of dewatered sewage sludge in addition to small molecule aluminum salts zhang et al 2014b investigated the conditioning effects of ipcs pac and a composite coagulant hpac on the characteristics of soluble eps they found that srf is correlated with zeta potential soluble eps and dissolved organic carbon doc and hpac with high charge density and good bridging capability is more efficient than pac in sludge dewaterability flocs conditioned by pac and hpac are larger but looser than those using fecl3 niu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 also reported that the floc formed using pac in coagulation is larger than that formed by fecl3 at a low dose due to the abundant binding sites with particles moreover zhao et al 2009 used silane coupling agents and alcl3 to synthesize covalently bound organic silicate aluminum hybrid coagulants which possess prime advantages of large mw and superior coagulation efficiency compared with traditional coagulants and their net positive modification in comparison with using negatively charged activated silicic acid or polysilicic acid several studies have investigated the roles of metal species in sludge conditioning different speciation of aluminum which is generally separated into ala or almon monomer and oligomeric forms of aluminum alb or al13 mainly made up of middle polymer forms of aluminum and alc or alun primarily composed of high polymer forms of aluminum can be categorized by ferron assay according to the polymerization degree and alb and alc are more positively charged and more stable than ala cao et al 2016 moreover sludge flocs conditioned by alb and alc are less compressible and smaller but more compact and stable than those conditioned by ala and alb and alc also perform better in protein like substance removal and eps compression thus they exhibit better dewaterability than oligomeric forms of al cao et al 2016 pax 14 commercial pac coagulant an ipc with a highly charged tridecameric polymer aluminum polycation alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 included in alb relative to alcl3 and al2 so4 3 is effective in terms of sludge drying rate pambou et al 2016 salt inorganic flocculants with suitable polymerization could improve their dewaterability cao et al 2016 zhao et al 2009 peeters et al 2013 presented a new application of pac as a conditioner for was prior dewatering and drying to avoid worldwide fouling problems in direct sludge dryers and to reduce torque issues in indirect sludge dryers and sludge decanter centrifuges this beneficial effect is proposed to be the result of the bound water associated with al polymers in pac solutions which act as a type of lubrication for intrinsically sticky sludge solids during drying peeters et al 2013 3 2 1 2 ferric salt coagulants ferric salts are another important class of inorganic coagulants given their low cost fast settling velocity of ferric flocs and lower toxicity wider ph range of applications better effect in low temperatures compared to pac bratby 2016 lee et al 2014 ferric salts are also favored in many wastewater treatment plants bień and bień 2014 niu et al 2013 ferric ions reportedly exhibit high affinity to protein like substances chen et al 2015 wei et al 2018 yu et al 2008 which is the deciding factor of sludge filterability zhang et al 2015b chen et al 2016b compared the sludge floc structure and dewatering performance of three coagulants namely fecl3 pac and pam the sludge flocs conditioned by fecl3 had the smallest size but the lowest mc of sludge cake without cao2 pretreatment because of their high charge density that enabled the efficient compression of the double electric layer and skeleton builders of the hydrolysis products chen et al 2016b similarly the sludge flocs conditioned by fecl3 were smaller but denser than those conditioned by pac and the former showed better dewatering performance niu et al 2013 moreover sludge with a high fe3 concentration has a small volume of small pores 1 10 nm but a large volume of large pores 10 nm the minimal small pores contribute to the affinity of water in sludge and the numerous large pores result in a rigid porous lattice structure yu et al 2016 in addition although fe2 is usually employed as fenton s reagent the fe3 translated from fe2 after oxidation can also be used as a good coagulant yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2015c yu et al 2016 found that higher fe3 content in comparison with fe2 content sharply reduces the specific surface area of sludge and has lower srf and cst and lower mc of the cake in addition to small molecule ferric salts the suspended solid colloid equivalence charge neutralization rate can increase to nearly 100 with pfs conditioning but only to approximately 50 with fecl3 conditioning due to the characteristics of ipcs with high charge density and large molecular weight moreover these two conditioners can both decrease cst to a low value watanabe et al 1999 3 2 1 3 others apart from these traditional inorganic salt coagulants other inorganic coagulants have been proposed na2sio3 can be used as a common coagulant aid due to its high bridging function the synergistic effect between na2sio3 and fecl3 on dewatering urban dewatered sewage sludge was investigated in a previous work zhang et al 2017b and the results showed that na2sio3 alone exerts an adverse effect on sludge dewaterability whereas the dehydration rate of sludge improved significantly after conditioning with fecl3 followed by na2sio3 in the combination of fecl3 and na2sio3 na2sio3 was proven to restructure sludge networks with high strength and low compression and therefore improves sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2017b moreover novel environmentally friendly inorganic materials such as titanium ti and magnesium mg salt coagulants which exhibit good performance in wastewater treatment wang et al 2016b wu et al 2001 zhang et al 2017c have elicited much attention in sludge dewatering huang et al 2016a zhang et al 2017c sludge dewaterability is enhanced by the combination of mg oh 2 and naoh due to the bridging effect between mg2 and eps huang et al 2016a zhang et al 2017c reported that using a titanium salt coagulant tsc prepared with different basicity can enhance was dewaterability and the mc of sludge cake can decrease to below 80 through the effective compression of eps which is considered the most important mechanism of sludge dewatering for tscs the floc size in sludge conditioned with prehydrolyzed polytitanium chloride and ti xerogel coagulant is larger than that conditioned with pfs and this condition may benefit dewaterability wang et al 2016b thus conditioners synthesized with novel inorganic materials present advantages over conventional conditioners however these novel inorganic materials also have drawbacks for example tscs are usually expensive easy to hydrolyze and affect the system ph zhang et al 2017c the practical applications of these new inorganic coagulants are yet to be investigated 3 2 2 organic synthetic polymeric flocculants the application of inorganic coagulants is limited because these coagulants are sensitive to ph in comprehensive consideration of dewatering rates mc of sludge cake and equipment costs polymeric flocculants exhibit good dewatering performance due to their larger floc size and more void spaces for water drainage lo et al 2001 novak and o brien 1975 pam and its derivatives are the most commonly used organic polymeric conditioners in sludge dewatering on the basis of different monomeric units that contain various types of charges polymeric conditioners can be categorized as nonionic cationic anionic and ampholytic novak and o brien 1975 sun et al 2016 watanabe et al 1999 as described in fig 7 the various organic polymeric flocculants applied in different sludge dewatering processes are summarized in table 4 3 2 2 1 cationic polymeric flocculants given that the fine particles in was are commonly negatively charged cationic polymeric flocculants are efficient in destabilizing sludge particles through charge neutralization due to the dual function of cationic polymeric flocculants coagulation and flocculation one of the typical cationic polymeric flocculants is cpam two methods are generally applied to synthesize cpams jaeger et al 2010 one is through the post polymerization functionalization of pam and the other is through the copolymerization of cationic monomers and acrylamide am zhao et al 2016 cpams synthesized by post polymerization are limited by short preservation time and high residue of monomers which is highly toxic and can cause severe neurotoxic diseases bolto and gregory 2007 dao et al 2016 yang et al 2016b copolymerization is more popular than post polymerization cpams are usually synthesized by copolymerization of am and one or more cationic monomers such as 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride dac methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride dmc and dimethyldiallyammonium chloride dmdaac jiang and zhu 2014 sun et al 2016 yang et al 2010 yang and ni 2012 zheng et al 2013 2014 zhu et al 2013 cpams exhibit efficient dewatering performance due to their effective mechanisms of particle flocculation including charge neutralization particle bridging and depletion flocculation bolto and gregory 2007 the former two effects depend on the absorption of polymers on the particle surface and the last one depends on the presence of free un adsorbed polymers that are probably not significant in water treatment practice bolto and gregory 2007 cpams are thus widely used in many water and wastewater treatment plants bolto and gregory 2007 jin et al 2016 lu et al 2017 yang et al 2016a sun et al 2016 found that cpams synthesized with dac and am through microwave and uv initiation are more effective than thermal and ultrasonic initiating ones in terms of dewatering capability fractal dimension of the flocs and the zeta potential although the addition of cpams increases the sludge floc size for settleability and corresponding filterability jin et al 2016 it increases the viscosity of sludge which implies increased difficulty in piping the polymer treated sludge chen et al 2005 moreover flocs with a network structure formed by pam or cpam in was have a strong water preservation capability which worsens the dewaterability of was zhang et al 2017b in addition to normal cpam several cationic polymeric flocculants with special structures have been reported chen et al 2016a guo et al 2016 a conditioner with a cationic microblock structure was synthesized with am and dac by applying template polymerization which can achieve a low srf of 1 99 1012 m kg and an mc of 71 at a dose of 40 mg l and ph of 7 0 chen et al 2016a when cationic units exhibit a blocky distribution the adsorption sites between the copolymer and negatively charged particle segments become stronger due to higher utilization of cationic charges than randomly distributed ones chen et al 2016a guo et al 2016 studied the synthesis characterization and sludge dewaterability of a novel cationic polyamidine that consisted of a five membered ring like structural unit fig 8 this flocculant with a strong cationic degree and hydrophobic regions could reduce mc in sludge cake to 77 7 at a dose of 60 mg l 3 2 2 2 anionic polymeric flocculants anionic polymeric flocculants such as anionic pam apam have also been used in sludge dewatering although they have the same negative charges as the suspended particles in wastewaters the main dewatering mechanisms of apams are efficient adsorption and bridging effects ma et al 2013 compared with cpam and nonionic pam apam has the worst dewaterability highest srf due to its electrostatic repulsions with negatively charged surface particles in wastewaters besra et al 2004 lo et al 2001 apart from apams poly acrylic acid paa can also be used as a flocculant in sludge dewatering paa exhibits better performance than cpam in dewatering acid treated sludge in terms of dewatering and dehydration degree and the addition of paa in sludge can enhance the dewatering rate at filtration and expression phases lu et al 2017 an anionic copolymer p am aa amps synthesized by am acrylic acid aa and 2 acylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid amps with the molecular weight of 8 106 g mol showed better dewatering efficiency than commercial pam the minimum filter cake s mc was reduced to 65 1 ma et al 2013 3 2 2 3 amphoteric polymeric flocculants ionic polymers that contain cationic and anionic functional groups are called amphoteric polymers which usually show notable improvement in solubility and salt resistance in a wide ph range dao et al 2016 lee et al 2014 rabiee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b although several amphoteric polymeric flocculants including synthetic and natural ones have been studied in the wastewater treatment field dao et al 2016 lee et al 2014 rabiee et al 2014 watanabe et al 1999 the application of these flocculants in sludge dewatering is rare watanabe et al 1999 watanabe et al 1999 utilized a metal coagulant for charge neutralization and an amphoteric polymer structure shown in fig 7 for flocculation to improve organic sludge dewaterability and obtain a high dehydration rate and low mc of the sludge cake their results indicated that the charge neutralization rate determines the type and dose of polymer to be used the mechanism of the conditioning process was as follows 1 charge neutralization reacted with metal salt and formation of metal hydroxide 2 the anionic part of the amphoteric polymer molecule reacted with the positive charge of metal hydroxide while the cationic part reacted with the negative charge of the primary sludge 3 gigantic flocs formed through further bridging and flocculation and 4 the uncharged anionic part reacted with the cationic part within flocs which made the sludge particles tightly bound 3 2 2 4 nonionic polymeric flocculants nonionic polymeric flocculants with low charge density might be no match for pac and fecl3 when was is pre oxidated the mc of the sludge cake could be reduced to below 80 wt through further treatment with inorganic coagulants whereas using pam alone cannot achieve this due to its low charge density chen et al 2016b however ionic polymeric flocculants with high charge density might prevent the primary flocs coated by flocculants from approaching one another due to electrostatic repulsions thus nonionic polymers show a higher probability of further particle aggregation besra et al 2004 in single polymer conditioning a previous study demonstrated that a nonionic polymer generates stronger bridging effect due to its higher mw and thus unusually exhibits better dewaterability than a cationic polymer lee and liu 2001 moreover in terms of srf and cst sludge conditioned with a dual polymer conditioning i e cationic polymer followed by a nonionic polymer performs better than sludge conditioned with a nonionic polymer followed by a cationic polymer and sludge conditioned with a single polymer lee and liu 2000 by adding the cationic polymer first sludge particles are adsorbed and small but compact primary flocs are formed then the nonionic polymer is added to adsorb on the loops and tails of the cationic polymer to form a larger and more compacted flocs lee and liu 2000 3 2 3 natural polymeric flocculants inorganic salt coagulants and organic synthetic polymeric flocculants have been proven to be efficient in sludge dewatering but they might result in secondary pollution and entail many health risks due to residual metal ions or the release of noxious polymeric monomers into the target water bratskaya et al 2004 lin et al 2015 song et al 2010 wang et al 2016a therefore natural polymeric flocculants have attracted significant attention as environmentally friendly biodegradable and nontoxic flocculants kaith et al 2010 lanthong et al 2006 yang et al 2016b polysaccharide based natural polymers consisting of hex sugar rings have a rigid rod structure which might improve cake compressibility in addition similar structures between polysaccharide based eps and polysaccharide based flocculants may result in good affinities wei et al 2018 however natural materials also have many drawbacks in practical application including small molecular weight low charge density and poor water solubility wu et al 2016b to overcome these disadvantages various chemical modification methods such as etherification anthony and sims 2013 chen et al 2007 heinze et al 2004 kaith et al 2010 liu et al 2017a khalil et al 1998 krentz et al 2006 wei et al 2008 2018 zhang et al 2007 esterification yang et al 2016b oxidation mathew and adlercreutz 2009 and graft copolymerization huang et al 2016b lanthong et al 2006 liu et al 2017b mishra et al 2011 wu et al 2016b yang et al 2014 have been applied to improve dewatering performance lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a with the aid of these modification methods many natural polymer based flocculants have been reported and studied however current research on natural polymeric flocculants is still inadequate especially their application in sludge dewatering table 5 summarizes various natural polymeric flocculants applied in sludge dewatering processes 3 2 3 1 starch based flocculants starch one of the most commonly used natural resources cannot directly act as a flocculant in general wang et al 2013 however it has been modified to yield various starch based flocculants used in wastewater treatment anthony and sims 2013 chen et al 2007 heinze et al 2004 huang et al 2016b khalil et al 1998 krentz et al 2006 lanthong et al 2006 liu et al 2017a 2017b mishra et al 2011 wei et al 2008 2018 wu et al 2016b yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 the surface of many organic pollutants and inorganic particles in was are mostly negatively charged introducing certain cationic functional groups onto the starch backbone is highly popular grafting modification is a useful methods that introduces positive pieces onto starch at branch chains such as the stc g pdmc starch graft poly 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride shown in fig 9 and stc g pdmdaac starch graft poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride lv et al 2014 wang et al 2013 wu et al 2016b the mw of these grafted flocculants with cationic groups on long molecular chains is obviously increased which is conducive to producing enhanced charge neutralization and bridging effects lv et al 2014 pourjavadi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 lv et al 2014 reported a novel sludge conditioner stc g pdmdaac which have not only hydrophilic groups for solubility and dispersion but also hydrophobic groups for building hydrophobic regions for forming drainage channels the sludge conditioned with stc g pdmdaac thus had low srf and cst and the final sludge water content was reduced to 50 6 from 97 85 lv et al 2014 besides a cost effective starch based flocculant was recently synthesized by etherification using 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cta as etherifying agent which exhibited good sludge dewaterability due to not only effective charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects but also its good affinity to polysaccharide components in eps because of their similar structures moreover the sludge dewatering performance of this cta modified starch based flocculant was further enhanced after combined use with fecl3 wei et al 2018 in addition to the cationic organic monomers mentioned above several inorganic materials such as aluminum iron and silicon have been complexed and grafted onto the starch backbone to produce starch based composite flocculants with a high charge density as shown in fig 10 lin et al 2015 peng et al 2017 combined silicon aluminum iron starch csiafs can adapt to large ph variations 3 0 11 0 and combined aluminum ferrous starch cafs can break sludge colloids easily and release many lb eps proteins both are superior to pam pac and fecl3 in dewatering treatment lin et al 2015 peng et al 2017 3 2 3 2 chitosan based flocculants chitosan poly β 1 4 2 amino 2 deoxy d glucose is a high performance natural polysaccharide material it is derived from the deacetylation of natural chitin which is the second most abundant natural polymer in the world guibal et al 2006 wang et al 2012 2016a yang et al 2016b chitosan contains abundant free amino groups along the chain backbone that are cationically charged in acidic media chitosan and its many derivatives thus exert more prominent flocculating effects as flocculants than other polysaccharide materials in wastewater treatment and sludge dewatering due to their more efficient charge neutralization and bridging effects guibal et al 2006 wang et al 2012 2016a yang et al 2016b wang et al 2016a prepared a cationic grafted chitosan based flocculant chitosan g pdmdaac having a great network and an inconsecutive appearance with numerous channels which was proven to be more effective than that of pam cpam and pac in sludge dewatering in addition a chitosan alcl3 composite coagulant prepared by mixing chitosan and an alcl3 stock solution was investigated and the sludge conditioned by this composite coagulant had higher dewaterability than that conditioned by chitosan and alcl3 dosed individually due to the improvement of charge neutralization and the bridging effect ma et al 2016 however chitosan is more expensive than other polysaccharide materials such as starch and cellulose ma et al 2016 yang et al 2016b 3 2 3 3 others aside from starch and chitosan other polysaccharide materials such as cellulose liberatore et al 2016 tannins özacar and şengil 2000 enteromorpha zhao and gao 2015 cyclodextrins hartong et al 2007 spent coffee ground hao et al 2018 and their derivatives have also been investigated in the dewatering field although several of them only act as coagulant aid in the dewatering process the addition of certain natural polymers can enhance the permeability of sludge and thus improve the dewatering performance hartong et al 2007 özacar and şengil 2000 the combination of 15 mg l of pam and 3 mg l of enteromorpha by zhao and gao 2015 obviously improved sludge dewatering efficiency in terms of the average particle size of flocs dehydration rate and pam reagent required özacar and şengil 2000 found that combined usage of tannin and al2 so4 3 improves sludge filterability significantly compared with using al2 so4 3 only and tannin is more effective than a synthetic anionic polyelectrolyte as a coagulant aid hartong et al 2007 pointed out that cyclodextrins combined with alum or cpam can increase the solid content and dewatering rate which can result in a 2 8 percentage point increase in cake solids in a full scale trial they proposed that cyclodextrins promote agglomeration by neutralizing excess charge on the polymer conditioned sludge surface hartong et al 2007 3 2 4 bioflocculants natural polymeric flocculants are mainly derived from polysaccharide materials such as starch chitosan cellulose etc as another class of green chemical conditioners mbfs i e natural organic macromolecular substances produced by microorganisms have been obtained zhang et al 2010b mbfs have attracted significant attention due to their advantages of biodegradability non toxicity high efficiency and cost effectiveness compared with traditional coagulants flocculants yang et al 2012a based on cultivation of specific microorganisms and different usage conditions in sludge conditioning two categories of mbfs are roughly classified in this study one refer to normal mbfs which have similar conditioning processes to conventional inorganic coagulants and organic flocculants the other are complex mbfs i e biogenic flocculants which are usually combined with energy substance such as fe2 and need a relatively long time for incubation murugesan et al 2014a kurade et al 2014 wong et al 2016a 2016b the addition of iron compound further improves in situ production of biogenic flocculants murugesan et al 2014a kurade et al 2014 wong et al 2016a 2016b the different mbfs used in sludge dewatering are summarized in table 6 one normal mbf produced by rhodococcus erythropolis separated from alkaline thermal pre treated sludge can make the ds and srf of sludge reach 22 5 and 3 4 1012 m kg respectively guo and ma 2015 in a previous study filamentous fungal strains were isolated from bioleaching sludge to act as a bioflocculants one of which reduced cst of the chemically enhanced primary treatment sludge from 83 15 s to 35 50 s and supplementation of metal cations such as ca2 and fe3 could further improve the dewaterability murugesan et al 2014b other studies inoculated sludge with acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans af culture with the energy substance fe2 kurade et al 2014 murugesan et al 2014a wong et al 2016a 2016b sludge treatment with isolated cells of af without fe2 exhibited no cst reduction whereas the same treatment with fe2 addition reduced the sludge cst from 122 7 s to 72 5 s wong et al 2016b these complex mbfs could improve the settlement of organic matter into the sludge pellet kurade et al 2014 wong et al 2016a 2016b this result was proven by the 27 increase in the calorific value of the treated sludge kurade et al 2014 compared with other flocculants such as cationic polymer pac and al2 so4 3 mbfs can show a similar or even better performance for sludge dewaterability at an optimum dose kurade et al 2014 yang et al 2012a the combined usage of mbf and the abovementioned coagulants flocculants greatly improves the dewatering performance due to large flocs formed through the enhanced charge neutralization and bridging effect guo and ma 2015 a study reported that when tj f1 a type of mbf is used alone it is better than p am dmc in sludge dewatering in terms of both srf and the time to filter ttf the composite using these two performs better in dewaterability zhang et al 2010b however the drawbacks of mbfs are worthy of note cultivation processes of mbfs are usually time consuming the incubation time of biogenic flocculants is much longer moreover ph of sludge system fluctuates large in the incubation process kurade et al 2014 murugesan et al 2014a wong et al 2016a 2016b in addition many normal mbfs were purified and obtained using lyophilization which are high cost and time consuming also guo et al 2015 yang et al 2012a zhang et al 2010b 3 2 5 evaluation of various coagulants flocculants table 7 summarizes various kinds of coagulants and flocculants in sludge dewatering inorganic coagulants and synthetic polymeric flocculants are the most frequently used dewatering conditioners and they mainly include aluminum and ferric salts and pam derivatives respectively although inorganic coagulants are cheap and exert a good effect on dewatering they also have many drawbacks such as high dose sensitivity to system ph and residual metal ions which may result in biological toxicity bratskaya et al 2004 walton 2013 synthetic polymeric flocculants among which pam derivatives are the most commonly used are excellent in terms of dose floc size and dewatering efficiency but their cost is relatively high furthermore the addition of pam and its derivatives may lead to secondary pollution and health risks due to their residual monomers lin et al 2015 wang et al 2016a bioflocculants require a relatively long retention time which is difficult in small plants guo et al 2015 wong et al 2016b lastly polysaccharide based natural polymers have attracted increasing attention due to their many advantages such as environmental friendliness widespread availability biodegradability and prominent structural features however they still lack practical application and need further investigation kaith et al 2010 lanthong et al 2006 wei et al 2018 yang et al 2016b therefore high efficiency cheap and environment friendly coagulants flocculants should be developed considering the shortcomings of polysaccharide based natural polymers their application performance can be improved through chemical modifications lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a in sludge dewatering grafted natural polymeric flocculants are usually employed thus grafting copolymerization is the most commonly used modification method in this field lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a when economic factors and maneuverability are considered other simpler modification methods lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a wei et al 2018 such as etherification esterification oxidation etc should be noted they can introduce various functional groups onto polymers conveniently bridging flocculation is also important in sludge dewatering aside from charge neutralization an enhanced bridging effect can be obtained by increasing the mw of polymeric flocculants apart from grafting copolymerization appropriate chemical crosslinking can also improve the mw of polymeric conditioners fig 11 with regard to the various introduced functional groups frequently studied polysaccharide based natural polymeric flocculants such as starch lv et al 2014 wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 chitosan wang et al 2016a and cellulose liberatore et al 2016 are usually modified cationic pieces are grafted onto the polysaccharide backbone to achieve efficient charge neutralization effects because of the negatively charged surface of mostly inorganic and organic colloidal particles in the sludge few studies focused on anionic modified conditioners anionic polymeric conditioners are usually much cheaper than cationic ones and they have a large hydrodynamic size in water due to intra chain electrostatic repulsions which are significantly beneficial to the bridging flocculation effect flory 1953 in addition to hydrophilic ionic groups hydrophobically associating flocculants which can help form hydrophobic regions within the sludge and further develop a porous structure in a mechanical dehydrating process may be synthesized guo et al 2016 lv et al 2014 yang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 several reports have confirmed the good dewatering performance of sludge conditioned with flocculants containing hydrophobic regions and high cationic degrees guo et al 2016 lv et al 2014 yang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 among the various polysaccharide based natural polymers cellulose and starch cost less than chitosan and can be modified chemically by introducing different functional groups onto their backbone due to the large amount of hydroxyl groups on the saccharide rings for different application purposes huang et al 2016b lv et al 2014 pourjavadi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 therefore cellulose and starch present better application potentials in practical operations furthermore due to the distinct structures of natural polymers natural conditioners show different flocculation and dewatering properties from traditional inorganic ones the flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering should also be investigated in detail flocculant structure is a key to the involvement of different flocculation mechanisms the structures of organic polymeric flocculants including synthetic and natural ones are highly complicated due to their long chain features elias 1984 flory 1953 yang and hu 2001 from the viewpoint of polymer physics the structure of a macromolecule should include short range long range and condensed structures which correspond to the repeating unit structure of the polymer chain type and chemical composition long chain morphology shape and size and packed polymer chains supermolecular structure respectively elias 1984 flory 1953 yang and hu 2001 the multiplicity of the polymer structure accounts for the wide performance range characteristic of polymer based materials research on polymeric flocculants aside from type and chemical composition short range structure includes the structural morphology and conformation of polymers in the solution long range structure which is a particularly important determinant of the final flocculation performance because flocculants are usually dissolved in water moreover the optimal dose of organic polymeric flocculants is usually in the range of 0 1 100 mg l which according to polymer solution theory is extremely diluted elias 1984 flory 1953 therefore compared with traditional polymer solution theories fuoss and strauss 1948 fuoss and cathers 1949 manning 1974 oosawa 1971 radeva 2001 the new relevant theory established from much wider polymer concentration ranges may be more promising in studying the hydrodynamic structure of polymers in extremely diluted concentration regions cheng 1997 yang et al 2012b however until now this topic has been rarely investigated furthermore the structure activity relationship can be established according to the achieved flocculation mechanisms the structural features and final flocculation performance of flocculants the quantitative correlations among the preparation condition structural features and flocculation properties can be well constructed through the combination of the synthesis recipe for flocculants accordingly a proper flocculant can be selected or designed through precise molecular control to achieve the desired dewatering performance and optimize the dewatering process this strategy is a practical operational method 3 3 techniques combined with other pretreatments large amounts of organic matters such as eps are crucial to wastewater treatment and sludge dewatering cao et al 2016 chen et al 2015 2016b zhang et al 2017c however the addition of cationic polymers can partially release eps from the sludge surface to the supernatant zheng et al 2014 inorganic coagulants including aluminum cao et al 2016 and ferric salts niu et al 2013 can make sludge cakes less compressible due to the strong binding strength between ions and protein like substances chen et al 2016b niu et al 2013 sole application of traditional coagulation flocculation cannot achieve satisfactory dewatering performance in china was is usually conditioned with traditional pam before mechanical filtration in many small and medium sized sewage treatment plants resulting in dewatered sludge of 30 million tons per year with mc as high as 80 lu et al 2013 xia et al 2016 this fact reflects the drawback of using coagulation flocculation alone aside from coagulation flocculation other pretreatments have been confirmed to effectively improve sludge dewatering performance by releasing bound water these pretreatments include skeleton builder addition wu et al 2016c sonic treatment bień and bień 2014 huan et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 thermal treatment neyens and baeyens 2003 wang et al 2014 2017 zhang et al 2017a acid and alkali treatment li et al 2005 oxidation methods he et al 2015 mo et al 2015 yu et al 2016 zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2012c and enzymatic treatment ayol 2005 dursun et al 2006 thomas et al 1993 wu et al 2016a the mechanisms and corresponding effects of which are briefly summarized in table 8 however after pretreatment with these methods release of bound water and degradation of the eps structure simultaneously occur consequently more fine particles are produced and organic matters are transferred to the outer layers chen et al 2015 2016b this is a part of reasons why using those conditioning methods solely such as enzymatic treatment or oxidation chen et al 2015 2016b cannot achieve an ideal dewatering performance or even deteriorates dewaterability thomas et al 1993 on this occasion coagulants flocculants can make the best use of their functionality through charge neutralization and the bridging effect thus the combined usages of various pretreatments with coagulation flocculation show a potential for use in efficient sludge dewatering 3 3 1 physical conditioning treatments 3 3 1 1 skeleton builders skeleton builders can improve the incompressibility and permeability of the sludge cake but increase the excess sludge yield therefore treatments that combine skeleton builders with coagulants flocculants and other pretreatments have been established for example coal fly ash chen et al 2010 biochar wu et al 2016c lime yu et al 2016 lignite qi et al 2011b thapa et al 2009a 2009b slag ning et al 2013 gypsum zhao and bache 2001 zhao 2006 and red mud zhang et al 2014a were added in previous studies to improve dewaterability thapa et al 2009a 2009b showed that the structure of lignite conditioning sludge is more porous and less compressible than that of directly flocculated sludge through experiments with mercury porosimetry scanning electron microscopy sem and cake yield stress curves sludge dewaterability was improved due to the porous rigid and less compressible structure of the sludge conditioned by combining cationic polyelectrolyte residues and negatively charged lignite particles qi et al 2011b the results resembled those of a study on slag conditioned sludge in which slag acted as a skeleton builder to form an incompressible and porous structure and sludge dewaterability was further improved by combining with cpam because the flocculated slag treated sludge reduced sludge compressibility by incorporating rigid structures and releasing water by increasing the solids porosity whereas the flocculated sludge by itself formed a highly compressible structure ning et al 2013 similar results were obtained when gypsum functioned as a physical conditioner combined with a polymer for conditioning a certain alum sludge because the polymer conditioning of sludge improved the rate of water removal and gypsum formed a permeable and rigid lattice structure for further dewatering under a high positive pressure zhao 2006 physical conditioners can be modified to obtain dual function materials for better utilization and further improvement of incompressibility and permeability for example red mud has a long term persistence of alkalinity and a high surface area which make this material act as a skeleton builder and a neutralizer in combination with fenton s reagent zhang et al 2014a raw rice husk biochar modified by fecl3 can not only act as a skeleton builder but also improve the neutralization effect due to its positively charged characteristics wu et al 2016c the prospects of combining coagulation flocculation and skeleton building in sludge dewatering or developing several cationic coagulants flocculants that contain similar features of skeleton builders are therefore feasible these physical conditioners can play an important role in sludge dewatering after proper modification 3 3 1 2 microwave treatment microwave treatment is believed to disintegrate the matrix and destroy microflocs leading to the release of eps and changes in particle size distributions cai et al 2017 cai et al 2017 demonstrated that the dewatering performance of antibiotic mycelial residue initially increases and then decreases while mc substantially decreases under microwave treatment however microwave application slightly enhances sludge dewaterability with a short contact time but significantly deteriorates dewatering performance with long contact time yu et al 2009 this finding may be due to the two conflicting effects of microwave treatment i e release of trapped water and formation of fine particles and the latter effect deteriorates the filtration efficiency despite the controversy the effect of eps concentration on dewaterability has been mentioned cai et al 2017 yu et al 2009 therefore an appropriate microwave intensity was proposed by luo et al 2013 who pointed out that the optimal combined condition for tannery sludge pretreatment is as follows microwave output power of 648 w radiation time of 60 s and cationic cpam dose of 8 mg l sludge treated under this condition performs better than sludge treated by cpam alone luo et al 2013 in the combined technique microwave radiation destroys the floc structure to release bound water and reduce the viscosity of sludge but form many fine particles and cpam plays an important role in flocculation and aggregation of those fine particles luo et al 2013 3 3 1 3 ultrasonic treatment ultrasonic treatment is an efficient tool for sludge disintegration and improving sludge biodegradability bień and bień 2014 huan et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 combined ultrasound cpam conditioning exerts a synergistic effect in comparison with using ultrasound alone because the effect of ultrasonic treatment mainly strips the eps and water from the sludge flocs zhu et al 2018 likewise the combined use of fe2 so4 3 and polyelectrolytes also results in a decrease in the hydration of sonicated sludge in the process of vacuum and pressure filtration bień and bień 2014 however the ultrasonic disintegration degree should be appropriately controlled and incompact sludge flocs can be thus disrupted to small fragments and re flocculated to tight particles with the help of coagulants flocculants resulting in improved dewaterability huan et al 2009 huan et al 2009 found that when the disintegration degree exceeds 40 most cells are destroyed at different degrees thereby deteriorating the dewatering performance only when the sludge disintegration degree is 2 5 can sludge dewaterability be improved with the conditioning of fecl3 3 3 2 chemical conditioning treatments 3 3 2 1 acid and alkali treatment the effect of ph on dewatering efficiency is crucial similarly acid and alkali treatment disrupts floc fragments and releases organic polymers and bound water li et al 2009 naoh and ca oh 2 are generally applied during alkaline treatment li et al 2008 2009 ca oh 2 can improve sludge dewaterability but the weight of sludge cake also increases li et al 2008 li et al 2008 demonstrated that low dose naoh 0 2 mol l deteriorates sludge dewaterability but dewatering performance recovers gradually with the increase in the naoh dose compared with alkali conditions acidification decreases the cst and srf of sludge containing aluminum and a recover al3 as coagulants more efficiently li et al 2005 alkali conditions and salt addition decrease the filtration kinetic significantly whereas acid conditions improve dewatering raynaud et al 2012 however excessive acidification significantly increases the concentration of organic matters in sludge bulk and deteriorates the dewatering rate li et al 2005 the addition of only 5 mg g of paa in acidified sludge can improve the dewatering rate through the re flocculating effect lu et al 2017 3 3 2 2 oxidation treatments oxidation treatment can degrade organic matters such as eps for further improvement of dewatering performance he et al 2015 mo et al 2015 yu et al 2016 zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2012c fenton fenton like treatments which are highly popular oxidation techniques are widely investigated in sludge conditioning because they can produce hydroxyl radicals oh for the collapse and degradation of eps and for improving the dewatering performance with the aid of iron species especially fe3 as a coagulant in addition to the oxidation effect yu et al 2016 the technique of fe2 and activated persulfate oxidation which ruptures flocs and releases bound water zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2012c has been also established to treat was several novel oxidants have been investigated too was pre oxidation by 20 mg of cao2 gtss was co conditioned by fecl3 pac or pam in a previous study and sludge dewaterability was enhanced obviously after three chemical re flocculation chen et al 2016b furthermore certain inorganic salts such as fe2 and zero valent iron exert a strong oxidation effect when incorporated with h2o2 or persulfate salt the production of fe3 can act as a coagulant skeleton builder and binding agent with pn nano oxidants have been also utilized in sludge dewatering nano fe2o3 prior to tsc addition can further improve sludge dewaterability and decrease compressibility zhang et al 2017c in another study a nano material fe fe2o3 which was combined with pdmdaac and h2so4 with doses of 40 4 8 and 136 mg g ds decreased the mc of sludge from 78 1 to 64 8 he et al 2016 the authors he et al 2016 explained that the fe fe2o3 nanomaterial induced molecular oxygen activation and the hydroxyl radicals decomposed eps thus the bound water in sludge was converted into free water 3 3 2 3 enzymatic treatment biological enzymes can not only solubilize the eps components of was under mild conditions but also improve its subsequent treatment and disposal chen et al 2015 enzymatic treatment which disrupts the sludge structure is usually combined with coagulants flocculants dursun et al 2006 thomas et al 1993 the dose of the enzyme product should be suitable because under dosage provokes slight hydrolysis and releases a portion of bound water whereas over dosage creates many hydrophilic end groups which counteract the dewatering performance thomas et al 1993 for example with the increase in the dose of two enzymes in a previous work sludge srf decreased from 7 47 1013 to approximately 4 1013 m kg at a protease dose of 100 mg g and from 1 34 1015 to approximately 0 95 1015 m kg at an α amylase dose of 50 mg g then srf increased with the overdose of the two enzymes chen et al 2015 the sludge filtration rate decreased significantly after enzymatic treatments and the addition of inorganic coagulants could not only reconstruct the floc structure compactly but also removed the eps in sludge bulk the results indicated that the combined technique could make mc lower than that of sludge cake treated with coagulants alone chen et al 2015 in summary these physical and chemical conditioning treatments disintegrate the sludge flocs more or less but excessive fragmentation is adverse to sludge dewaterability thus combined coagulation flocculation is feasible in sludge dewatering given that many problems exist in combination techniques for conditioning was in practice such as optimum combination ratio operation difficulty and various characteristics of sludge the synergistic and compensation mechanisms of coagulation flocculation with these pretreatments should be studied thoroughly 4 conclusion practical operation indicates that the current dewatering performance for was is still relatively poor which results in high cost sludge treatment the large amount of eps the high energy demand for bound water drainage and the strong compressibility of sludge cake are considered difficulties in the dewatering process other reasons include insufficient coincident standards for testing these above parameters however the major reason is the lack of well established structure activity relationship due to the highly complicated and multilevel structural features of sludge in sludge dewatering various solids including eps are first aggregated to form flocs then the flocs are further assembled in a condensed sludge cake the condensed structure of the sludge cake not the eps and flocs is the key to determining the final dewatering performance which might account for the many inconsistent reports between the dewatering performance and structural characteristics of eps or flocs to understand sludge better the characteristics of sludge cake should be studied thoroughly in addition to the water content solid components and floc properties accordingly a suitable porous and incompressible structure of sludge cake could be constructed and regulated to obtain the desired dewatering performance however little work has been conducted on the quantitative or semi quantitative investigation of the structural information of sludge cakes which might be further examined by using neutron scattering synchrotron radiation based techniques and so on in depth investigation of the condensed structure of sludge cake obviously depends on the development of advanced characterization techniques and highly sophisticated instruments coagulation flocculation as an indispensable pretreatment for sludge dewatering is widely applied in water and wastewater plants because of its economic efficiency and strong maneuverability to further improve the sludge dewatering performance novel coagulants flocculants should be developed urgently and should have the characteristics of high dewatering efficiency low cost and environmental friendliness research and development of novel coagulants flocculants are intrinsically based on the well established structure activity relationship dewatering mechanisms should thus be studied in detail based on not only the structural characteristics of sludge but also on those of the coagulants flocculants the effects of various metal species of inorganic coagulants and the multilevel structural characteristics of organic polymeric flocculants including various ionic or nonionic functional groups and their contents and distributions short range structure and molecular weight and various chain conformations in solutions long range structure on different target sludge types should be investigated in detail however the work related to this topic is unsystematic and even limited from the perspective of coagulation flocculation processes and conditioning methods various inorganic and organic conditioners including coagulation flocculation and composited coagulation flocculation can be combined to fully make use of their respective advantages and eventually achieve better dewatering performance the combination of coagulation flocculation with other pretreatments is also an effective method in addition to traditional pretreatments such as addition of skeleton builders microwave method ultrasonic conditioning acidification alkalinity oxidation etc nanotechnology advanced oxidation and bio treatment also present a significant potential to be energetically developed and applied in sludge dewatering however synergistic and compensation mechanisms including composite applications of inorganic and organic coagulants flocculants and various pretreatments with coagulation flocculation should be well investigated they are important and have great practical significance in promoting the applications of their combined usages and obtaining a final ideal dewatering performance 
19408,sludge disposal is an integral part of wastewater treatment systems and its cost usually accounts for more than half of the total operation cost sludge disposal technology is facing challenges and opportunities simultaneously and can still be improved sludge dewatering is an essential process in sludge disposal and it is important for the effective reduction of the final processing cost coagulation flocculation is a relatively mature cost effective user friendly sludge dewatering technology in this work coagulation flocculation and their combinations with other pretreatments including dewatering mechanisms are reviewed various coagulants flocculants used in sludge dewatering including inorganic coagulants organic synthetic and natural polymeric flocculants and bioflocculants are introduced in detail because coagulants flocculants are the key in coagulation flocculation the different factors that influence the dewatering performance of these coagulants flocculants are also presented briefly moreover aiming at the complicated composition of sludge and its treatment difficulty the prospects and technical developments of coagulation flocculation in

2007 the cst test is simple and inexpensive because it does not require an external source of pressure or suction scholz 2005 the srf test as defined in eq 1 1 is time consuming complex and expensive because it requires the application to be in a vacuum sawalha and scholz 2010 yukseler et al 2007 however the srf test is regarded as more scientific than the cst test because of its hydrodynamic characteristic fitria et al 2013 sawalha and scholz 2010 established an empirical model to obtain srf from cst data due to the empirical relativity of srf and cst 1 1 s r f 2 p a 2 b μ ω where p kg m2 is the pressure applied a m2 is the filter area b s m6 is the time to filtration ratio which is the slope of the curve that is obtained by plotting the ratio of the time of filtration to the volume of the filtrate t v versus the filtrate volume v μ kg s m2 is kinetic viscosity kv and ω kg m3 denotes the mass of dry solids ds per volume of sludge in the filtrate medium and should be assumed constant cst and srf are empirical and lacking in accuracy the srf test is based on classical filtration theory yukseler et al 2007 in this test mean porosity mean cake size and pore water pressure are assumed constant but this assumption does not conform to actual practice sawalha and scholz 2010 the cst test is also unable to predict variable physical properties and processes in reality because of its theoretical limitation pan et al 2003 scholz 2005 meanwhile the process of dissolving extracellular polymeric substances eps and releasing bound water might break large flocs into fine particles and could result in poor filtration performance therefore whether srf reduction is consistent with a decrease in mc is unknown guan et al 2017 dehydration rate was recently used as the main index to evaluate the dewaterability of sludge with high pressure in a study on the second dewatering of urban sewage dewatered sludge zhang et al 2017b the filtration compression cell fcc test is another powerful tool that can assess filtration and compression stages in sludge compression dewatering at the laboratory scale lu et al 2017 raynaud et al 2012 vaxelaire and olivier 2006 in the filtration stage a compressive piston pushes the sludge toward the filtering media and a filter cake builds up the compression expression phase corresponds to the removal of liquid by squeezing of the filter cake raynaud et al 2012 however the actual dewatering process is complex due to the large amount of particles with different sizes shapes and components sludge properties should be considered comprehensively to estimate sludge dewaterability accurately sludge desiccation is an indispensable process in sludge management after mechanical dewatering which includes filtration and centrifugation bennamoun 2012 mechanical dewatering is important in reducing sludge volume before further drying disposal because of the considerable influence of the site and climate on natural drying and the high energy consumption during artificial desiccation bennamoun 2012 however direct mechanical dewatering of sludge without any pretreatment cannot achieve the ideal dewatering effect and the mc of sludge after mechanical dewatering could only reach 80 98 wang et al 2010a because sludge is a highly complex system composed of numerous small and surface charged solids which could be relatively dynamically stable in water not only because of their low gravity and electrostatic repulsion effects but also because part of the water is tightly combined to the surface or captured inside the colloidal network vaxelaire and cézac 2004 especially highly charged eps can readily form a stable gel like suspended structure that binds with water molecules due to its steric force keiding et al 2001 mowla et al 2013 neyens et al 2004 qi et al 2011a thus efficient sludge separation is difficult to achieve and the mechanisms of dewatering remain unclear anjum et al 2016 christensen et al 2015 liu and fang 2003 mowla et al 2013 various pretreatments are applied to enhance sludge filtration and final dewatering efficiency dhar et al 2012 liu et al 2016b ruiz hernando et al 2014 zhang et al 2015c zhen et al 2013 existing methods of sludge conditioning can be mainly categorized as physical chemical and biological as shown in fig 1 physical conditioning refers to changing the physicochemical properties of sludge through physical methods including the addition of skeleton builders wu et al 2016c the thermal approach neyens and baeyens 2003 the freeze thaw approach hu et al 2011 use of microwave cai et al 2017 ultrasonic conditioning feng et al 2009 and their combinations dhar et al 2012 ruiz hernando et al 2014 chemical conditioning refers to the addition of acids alkalis li et al 2005 surfactants chen et al 2001 guan et al 2017 oxidants zhang et al 2015c coagulants flocculants mowla et al 2013 and other bio chemical agents guo et al 2015 or use of electrochemical methods mahmoud et al 2018 zhen et al 2013 to the sludge to change the nature of the sludge and improve dewatering performance coagulation flocculation is one of the most commonly used sludge conditioning approaches when cost and efficiency are considered small colloidal particles in the sludge form large flocs and compacted cakes for the improvement of sedimentation and dewatering performance by increasing the sludge dewatering rates and solid content chen et al 2015 2016a novak and o brien 1975 in this paper the characteristics of sludge which intrinsically result in dewatering difficulties are first introduced second coagulation flocculation applied in sludge dewatering is reviewed based on various employed coagulants flocculants including inorganic coagulants organic synthetic and natural polymeric flocculants and bioflocculants combined pretreatment technologies associated with coagulation flocculation are also introduced third different influencing factors are discussed briefly the main framework of this review is described in fig 2 lastly the prospects and technical developments in coagulation flocculation in sludge dewatering are further presented aiming at the characteristics of sludge and the difficulty of its treatment 2 characteristics of sludge 2 1 characteristics of water in sludge the components of sludge are highly complicated and they mainly include water and various types of solids anjum et al 2016 mowla et al 2013 with regard to the existing water different forms with different properties such as vapor pressure enthalpy entropy viscosity and density usually exist in sludge due to the presence of various solids erdincler and vesilind 2003 katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 vesilind 1994 a clear classification of the moisture in sludge is essential for the study of dewatering generally sludge water can be classified according to the degree of removal difficulty vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the first classification is free water that is unaffected by solid particles it includes water in void but unaffected by capillary force and accounts for approximately 70 of the total water chen et al 2015 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the second classification is interstitial water that is trapped inside the crevices and interstitial spaces of flocs and organisms mikkelsen and keiding 2002 the third classification is surface water that is adsorbed or adheres onto the surface of particles the last classification is hydration or internal water which is tightly bound to the solids vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the sum of the three latter forms of water is usually collectively referred to as bound water lee and hsu 1995 lee and lee 1995 the content of bound water is one of the major influencing factors that limit sludge dewaterability erdincler and vesilind 2003 mowla et al 2013 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 however jin et al 2004 believed that free water might reflect sludge dewaterability better than bound water can due to the strong binding characteristics and small portion of bound water vaxelaire and cézac 2004 summarized various methods of determining the moisture distribution in sludge including thermal analysis technologies and mechanical strain tests to examine sludge conditioning and dewatering the four forms of water namely free interstitial surface and internal water can be roughly determined via the transition points in various tests lee and hsu 1995 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 for example interstitial surface and internal water can be estimated through the centrifugal settling test the cake is incompressible or slightly compressible from the sum of surface and internal water obtained from drying and dsc tests and from the internal water content from an expression test respectively lee and hsu 1995 lee and lee 1995 vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the criteria of these approaches are not unified yet and the parameters of each test should not be ignored table 1 lists several commonly used thermal analysis approaches for measuring the content of bound water in sludge together with their mechanisms or hypotheses conventional dewatering processes can remove only free water and a part of bound water erdincler and vesilind 2003 further release of bound water inside the cell structure can be achieved by the disruption of sludge cells via sonication and alkali nacl and heat treatments erdincler and vesilind 2003 ruiz hernando et al 2014 sludge cell disruption changes the water distribution in sludge and a considerable amount of interstitial water trapped inside the cells including many organic matters is released however cell disruption creates additional surfaces for water binding and increases the unfreezable water content mostly vicinal water water of hydration and a fraction of interstitial water erdincler and vesilind 2003 ruiz hernando et al 2014 discovered that the content of bound water in sludge increases when the intensity of three treatments ultrasound thermal and alkali increases but sludge dewatering can still be improved by these treatments katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 reported that the bound water in activated and digested sludge is reduced by 30 and 70 by heat and freeze thaw treatments respectively although organic matter and bound water are released because of the disruption of flocs and cells during pretreatments extra surfaces for water binding are created as mentioned above thus further treatments such as flocculation coagulation for decreasing the binding sites are required vaxelaire and cézac 2004 the effect of coagulation flocculation on bound water to be discussed in detail later is largely acknowledged vaxelaire and cézac 2004 2 2 characteristics of solids in sludge the main solid components of different sludge types are usually dissimilar because of the different pollutants in various wastewaters and because sludge produced in different water treatment units present different characteristics the biological method can effectively reduce organic pollutants in wastewater and has been widely used in sewage treatment for decades a large amount of waste activated sludge was which usually contains over 95 of water is generated in this process colin and gazbar 1995 zhu et al 2013 thus was is highly popular and its main ingredients include microorganisms eps organic debris and inorganic colloidal particles christensen et al 2015 a schematic of the configuration of was is presented in fig 3 yu et al 2016 the existence of eps liu and fang 2002 2003 one of the main factors that influence the rheological properties of sludge dong et al 2011 is the main cause of the difficulty of efficient sludge dewatering yu et al 2010 divided sludge flocs into five fractions supernatant slime loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellet lb eps is diffused from tb eps which surrounds cells cao et al 2016 li and yang 2007 the dewaterability of sludge as influenced by eps fraction which is negatively charged and highly hydrated and captures a large amount of water is currently a popular topic in sludge management studies he et al 2016 the impact of eps fraction on the properties of the dewatering effect remains debatable research has shown that the addition of eps extracted from sludge does not influence sludge cake porosity but deteriorates srf kang et al 1989 and lb eps content exhibits a negative correlation with sludge settlement and dewatering performance li and yang 2007 moreover high eps concentrations worsen floc settlement and compressibility jin et al 2003 nevertheless a certain eps content is conducive for optimal dewatering performance houghton et al 2001 houghton and stephenson 2002 and a study has shown that the total extracted eps content is positively correlated with dewaterability jin et al 2004 these conflicting results based on extracted eps might be due to the low extraction efficiency and inaccurate characterization of eps wilén et al 2003 therefore extraction methods exert a significant impact on eps quantification wingender et al 1999 various individual methods of eps extraction mainly divided into physical and chemical methods and their mechanisms were summarized and categorized by sheng et al 2010 most studies combined two or more methods to extract eps table 2 lists the most recent commonly used eps extraction techniques formed by various individual extraction methods d abzac et al 2010 pointed out that higher eps yields can be achieved by chemical extraction procedures except for ethanol compared with physical procedures and the yield order of the four investigated sludge was as follows raw sludge sonication ethanol heating cationic exchange resin cer cer sonication formaldehyde heating edta formaldehyde naoh notably knowledge on eps is insufficient and no standard approach of eps extraction exists anjum et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 the difficulty of accurately analyzing eps in sludge might also be due to the high sensitivity of eps to various environmental factors resulting in uncertain transformation between different eps forms and even in the release of extra organic matter because of sludge cell disruption caused by several pretreatments previous research has also attempted to determine the detailed chemical compositions of eps which mainly includes protein like compounds pn 60 carbohydrates ps 40 95 lipids 40 dna 10 aquatic humic substances and small molecules flemming and wingender 2001 sheng et al 2010 to obtain insights into the effects of various eps fractions on sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 pn and ps are the two main components several colorimetric methods including kjedahl biuret lowry bicinchoninic acid bca and bradford have been utilized to analyze pn content the latter three methods have been used extensively for biologically treated effluents in the past 20 years due to their simplicity and precision le et al 2016 other colorimetric methods such as anthrone and phenol sulfuric acid have also been utilized to analyze ps content le and stuckey 2016 with regard to the effects of various eps components on sludge dewaterability many studies have demonstrated the negative correlation between sludge filterability and pn content in soluble eps cao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014b 2015a 2015c and the positive correlation between normalized cst and pn ps in outer layers meanwhile no apparent correlation has been observed between normalized cst and ps yu et al 2008 these results may be due in part to the molecular size of pn being larger than that of ps murthy et al 2000 yu et al 2008 you et al 2017 considered the impact of pn on sludge dewatering and studied the distribution of pn through the activity of leucyl aminopeptidase lap a hydrolytic enzyme related to the degradation of pn and the concentration of adenosine 5 triphosphate atp a supplier of energy in many enzymatic reactions in the presence of ceo2 nanoparticles they found that inhibited lap activity and reduced atp concentrations enhance the production of pn which results in increased sludge srf and reduced dewatering performance you et al 2017 however le et al 2016 discovered that the protein measured in wastewater samples using these colorimetric assays often produces false positive results and has little correlation to the real value the methods used for analyzing ps content encounter the same issue le and stuckey 2016 colorimetric methods including anthrone and phenol sulfuric acid were compared with three commercial assay kits in a previous study and the results showed that existing colorimetric methods can seriously under or over estimate the ps present in wastewater le and stuckey 2016 moreover various pretreatments such as coagulation flocculation have been proven to exert strong effects on the transformation and change in eps fractions thus they significantly change the contents of various eps compositions in sludge and influence the moisture distribution and final dewatering performance cao et al 2016 chen et al 2015 this condition adds complication and as a result the effects of various eps fractions and their components become difficult to explain accurately cao et al 2016 chen et al 2015 in addition most studies on the effects of eps on sludge dewaterability made deductions based on experimental results the mechanisms involved especially those associated with various pretreatments remain unclear to date to explore effective mechanisms in detail sheng et al 2010 increased attention should be given to the development of novel eps extraction methods in situ dynamic and quantitative analytical techniques including the main chemical compositions of pn and ps elucidation of various influencing factors and microscopic investigation of the surface structures of eps and their interactions with various conditioners especially at the molecular level this topic is discussed in detail in the following sections 2 3 characteristics of sludge cake 2 3 1 analysis of the properties of flocs the process of sludge dewatering shown in fig 4 is closely related to the formation of sludge cake in water sludge cake is formed by the aggregation of flocs in raw water which consists of various colloidal solids including eps floc properties affect the characteristics of sludge cake and dewatering performance floc properties mainly include floc size and compactness and various pretreatment processes that follow different dewatering mechanisms result in distinct floc properties and sludge cake which significantly affect the final dewatering performance cao et al 2016 fitria et al 2013 floc properties can be investigated using the image or light scattering technique in combination with fractal theory mandelbrot 1983 serra 1982 wei et al 2009 conflicting results have been obtained regarding the effects of floc structure on sludge dewatering fitria et al 2013 found that large floc size equates to high water removal cao et al 2016 indicated that small flocs with high compactness serve as skeleton builders to aid dewatering in the pressure process floc compactness might play a greater role in sludge dewatering than floc size floc compactness by sweep flocculation is reported to be the highest due to the particles enmeshed in the precipitation of flocs and comparisons show that the floc structure resulting from bridging flocculation is the loosest because of the polymer molecules connecting the particles li et al 2006 thus large but loose flocs form due to the bridging effect only and sludge conditioned with pam alone cannot achieve ideal dewatering performance chen et al 2016b in addition to floc size and compactness floc surface characteristics including surface charges and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity also affect floc aggregation and dewatering performance the changes in the surface characteristics and aggregation of sludge can be determined with extended derjaguin verwey landau overbeek dlvo theory and via aggregation tests liu et al 2010 the low energy barrier of sludge flocs and high hydrophobicity promote flocculation which is conducive for good solid liquid separation he et al 2015 liao et al 2001 showed that a strong inverse correlation exists between the surface charge and hydrophobicity contact angles of sludge and pere et al 1993 revealed an inverse correlation between the zeta potential and water contact angle of sludge from pulp and paper mill effluents floc characteristics can be also tested by contact angle to determine dewaterability to a certain extent pere et al 1993 thus geometric floc structures and surface characteristics should be considered to obtain a comprehensive understanding of floc properties and their effects on dewatering performance 2 3 2 sludge cake properties another main reason for inconsistent reports on the effects of floc structure on sludge dewatering is that the determined factor is the structure of the sludge cake itself and not that of the flocs on the basis of the principle of the structure activity relationship the structure and formation process of sludge cake are important sludge dewatering by draining and repelling water includes two procedures formation of sludge cake and subsequent compression of the sludge cake fig 4 thapa et al 2009a during the former procedure the solid in sludge is concentrated and aggregated resulting in the formation of a cake with the structural characteristics of an interconnected network which could be a sediment or a filter cake at a certain concentration stickland 2015 a portion of free water remains trapped in the cake the sludge water and solids in the cake present a complicated coexistence relationship the interaction between them results in unique characteristics through various dewatering treatments in the latter procedure if the applied pressure exceeds a certain load the sludge network would collapse such that the water in the sludge is seriously trapped because of cake void closure and subsequent deterioration in sludge filterability i e the permeability of the cake decreases with the excess pressure liu et al 2013 novak et al 1999 qi et al 2011b smollen and kafaar 1997 stickland 2015 thus excessively high pressure is useless for improving the dewatering rate sveegaard et al 2012 pointed out that within a low pressure range 0 50 kpa a linear relation is obtained between srf and pressure drop across the cake therefore the permeability and compressibility exhibited in different types of sludge are important for dewatering performance including the removal of sludge water and the increase in solid content qi et al 2011a many studies have characterized the compressibility of sludge by using the coefficient of compressibility s which is obtained by two values of srf under different applied pressures p 1 and p 2 kg m2 using eq 2 1 cao et al 2016 qi et al 2011a 2 1 s r f 1 s r f 2 p 1 p 2 s accordingly a small value of s indicates low sludge compressibility which is beneficial for sludge dewaterability cao et al 2016 zhang et al 2017c many researchers have also analyzed sludge expression characteristics via experimental evaluations for example shirato et al 1974 adopted the combined terzaghi voigt rheological model with three parameters b η and c e to study the time dependence of the consolidation ratio during the dewatering process as shown in eq 2 2 2 2 u c l 1 l l 1 l f 1 b 1 exp π 2 i 2 c e 4 ω 0 2 t c b 1 exp η t c where u c represents the consolidation ratio b represents the fraction occupied by the second stage c e represents the modified consolidation coefficient η is a creep factor ω denotes the specific volume of wet cake i is the number of drainage surfaces l is the cake thickness at a certain consolidation time t c and l 1 and l f are the cake thicknesses at the starting and ending times respectively under infinite consolidation time and assuming that the rate of the second consolidation stage is much slower than that of the first consolidation eq 2 2 can be written as 2 3 u c 1 b exp η t c where b and η can be determined through the results of ln 1 u c versus t c shirato et al 1974 the terzaghi voigt rheological model is a phenomenological model that lacks a theoretical basis chang and lee 1998 this model can be applied to describe the consolidation process of sludge without a large amount of bound water such as clay chu and lee 1999 and kaolin slurry chang and lee 1998 however an unexpected consolidation stage is speculated to arise from the erosion of strongly bound moisture chang and lee 1998 a modified three stage consolidation model shown in eq 2 4 is proposed for sewage sludge to further reflect the consolidation degree of sludge in the round chang and lee 1998 chu and lee 1999 2 4 u c l 1 l l 1 l f 1 b f 1 exp π 2 i 2 c e 4 ω 0 2 t c b 1 exp η t c f t c t c where t c is the duration of the entire stage and 1 b f b and f represent the fractions occupied by the first second and third stages respectively the first consolidation stage was proposed to be a process of pore water leakage and cake structure collapse the second stage was interpreted as the reconfiguration of sludge particles into a stable structure and the third one was speculated to be the erosion of bound water chang and lee 1998 the drawback of this modified three stage consolidation model is its weak sensibility toward b and the fraction of moisture removed in the second stage which makes model outputs with very different b values appear similar meanwhile the model outputs have high sensibility to η which causes a large error vaxelaire and olivier 2006 a visual and qualitative observation for the comparison of the difference between the first and second stages could be obtained by 1 u c or ln 1 u c versus the consolidation time plots lu et al 2017 raynaud et al 2012 vaxelaire and olivier 2006 as presented in fig 5 raynaud et al 2012 the steep slope of the first stage indicates the high elasticity of the sludge cake the slope of the second stage characterizes viscous behavior and a steep slope indicates high mobility of aggregates the two steep slopes are desired for dewatering by expression chu and lee 1999 lu et al 2017 raynaud et al 2012 the structure of sludge cake intrinsically accounts for the final dewatering performance however direct study of the condensed structures of sludge cake is limited to qualitative observation by microscopes cao et al 2016 you et al 2017 yu et al 2016 few study has performed quantitative or semi quantitative investigation of the structural information of sludge cakes and the relationship between cake structure and dewatering performance which are important in the construction and regulation of a suitable sludge cake structure with porous and incompressible characteristics by various pretreatments such as coagulation flocculation skeleton building thermal method microwave method ultrasonic conditioning acidification alkalinity oxidation etc the major difficulties in investigating this topic might be due to insufficient advanced technologies and sophisticated analytical instruments for highly complicated cake structures 3 coagulation flocculation in sludge dewatering coagulation flocculation is one of the most commonly applied techniques to achieve efficient solid liquid separation in water treatment bolto and gregory 2007 bratby 2016 chang 2011 ghernaout and ghernaout 2012 gregory 2006 ives 1977 jiang 2015 khachan et al 2014 lee et al 2014 lyklema 1985 overbeek 1977 sillanpää et al 2018 thomas et al 1999 verwey and overbeek 1948 yang et al 2016b in the coagulation process small suspended colloids in water are destabilized after diminishing their surface charges by the addition of coagulants with an opposite charge then the destabilized particles aggregate and settle down bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b to accelerate particle aggregation further and improve settlement efficiency polymeric flocculants with flexible long chain conformation are sometimes fed after coagulation as coagulant aids these polymeric flocculants act as bridges that adsorb and connect various colloidal particles in water to form large flocs that can be effectively removed by sedimentation bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b the latter process is called flocculation coagulation flocculation technology is widely employed in many industrial fields including mining roussy et al 2004 oil extraction ahmad et al 2005 and paper production ahmad et al 2008 aside from water treatment coagulation flocculation efficiency depends largely on the selected coagulants flocculants different coagulants flocculants exhibit different coagulation flocculation performance due to their different structural characteristics namely charge characteristics ionic properties special functional groups and molecular weight mw bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b owing to the different characteristics of various types of targeted pollutants a suitable coagulant flocculant should be selected according to the coagulation flocculation mechanisms on the basis of coagulation flocculation effects charge neutralization and bridging are two widely accepted mechanisms bratby 2016 chang 2011 yang et al 2016b zhang et al 2010a 2014b given that most of the insoluble suspended solids in water contain negative surface charge traditional coagulants are mainly trivalent metal inorganic salts such as aluminum sulfate ferric chloride poly aluminum chloride pac etc to obtain high charge neutralization effects on the basis of dlvo theory and the diffuse electric double layer model hubbard 2002 overbeek 1977 verwey and overbeek 1948 meanwhile the commonly used flocculants are organic polymeric materials including synthetic and natural polymeric flocculants and bioflocculants the mw of polymeric flocculants is important in bridging flocculation anbu clemensis et al 2012 meyn et al 2012 zheng et al 2014 the mw of polyacrylamide pam one of the most popular flocculants is usually more than 10 000 000 g mol in addition cationic polymeric flocculants usually possess dual functions of coagulation and flocculation lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b certain coagulant flocculant is commonly of single functionality which always results in a single mechanism and high dose low mw inorganic coagulants and organic polymeric flocculants exhibit different coagulation flocculation behaviors and removal superiorities because they possess substantially different molecular structures and various affinities to different contaminants in water bratby 2016 chang 2011 lee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b moreover real wastewater and sludge are both usually complex mixtures and contain various contaminants with different characteristics thus in addition to the sole use of various coagulants flocculants the combined usages of various inorganic coagulants and organic polymeric flocculants by making full use of their different advantages are crucial for example the dewatering efficiency of adding pac in sludge followed by cationic polymers is better than that conditioned by cationic polymeric flocculants alone because pac can efficiently neutralize the surface charge of sludge and enhance the permeability of conditioned sludge pambou et al 2016 the main mechanisms of sewage coagulation flocculation namely charge neutralization and bridging effect are also suitable for sludge dewatering böhm and kulicke 1997 thapa et al 2009b coagulants can effectively destroy the relative stability of charged particles and make them agglomerate into large flocs prior to sedimentation and mechanical dewatering qi et al 2011a zheng et al 2013 2014 zhu et al 2013 in the dewatering process the charge neutralization effect can still reduce the thickness of the hydrated shell of sludge particles and enhance the free water content by compressing the electric double layer and weakening the surface tension of sludge water wang et al 2016a moreover coagulants can destroy the sludge network structure and weaken its water trapping capability in deep dewatering zhang et al 2017b the bridging effect is also essential in sludge dewatering and floc stability lee and liu 2000 the packed sludge flocs formed by high mw polyelectrolytes demonstrate good filtration performance thapa et al 2009b therefore increasing the mw of flocculants is a major modification method for improving dewatering efficiency although the coagulation flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering are similar to those in contaminant removal such as suspended colloids and natural organic matter in normal water and wastewater treatment jiang 2015 lee et al 2014 sillanpää et al 2018 yang et al 2016b the treatment conditions and objectives of the two processes are fundamentally different generally the purpose of coagulation flocculation applied in normal water and wastewater treatment is to remove various contaminants and finally purify the water while that in sludge dewatering process is mainly to thoroughly separate water from solids as far as possible thus the former focuses on the aggregation and separation of contaminants promoted by coagulants flocculants in addition to this effect the latter one still emphasizes the construction of suitable structure of sludge cake with good filtration performance raynaud et al 2012 thapa et al 2009a wei et al 2018 with regard to the treatment process the solid content in sludge dewatering is higher and more complicated than that in the normal wastewater coagulation flocculation process which results in a heterogeneous coverage of dewatering conditioner on the oppositely charged sludge particles sun et al 2016 in normal wastewater coagulation flocculation this similar phenomenon is called charge patching in which the zeta potential of the supernatant deviates from zero at the optimal dose yang et al 2016b the presence of many sludge particles and the non uniform distribution of negative charge on the particles surfaces deteriorate the ideal charge neutralization effect in the sludge dewatering process moreover some particles are trapped in the net like structure before being fully neutralized thus the zero zeta potential achieved by the dose might not the optimal one for sludge dewatering sun et al 2016 this fact might be interpreted as another phenomenon that is the sludge with the large but loose flocs has not ideal dewateriblity chen et al 2016b numerous studies have confirmed that cationic sludge conditioners can improve dewaterability effectively and have used the zeta potential as a controlling parameter in interpreting the coagulation flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering jin et al 2016 lee and liu 2000 2001 lu et al 2017 sun et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 zhu et al 2013 however the results showed that the zeta potential is not significantly correlated with other controlling parameters such as solid content and floc size sun et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 moreover charge neutralization and bridging simultaneously affect the coagulation flocculation process and the combined action of charge neutralization and bridging has been obtained based on experimental results sun et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 thus the explicit coagulation flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering are still unknown 3 1 factors that influence sludge dewatering coagulants flocculants make contact with suspended colloids to form large flocs that down easily bolto and gregory 2007 gregory and barany 2011 and are affected by various environmental factors therefore the various factors that influence sludge dewatering should be understood and considered conditioner dose ph and temperature are three popular environmental factors and are briefly discussed below 3 1 1 conditioner dose dose is one of the most important factors that affect the coagulation flocculation process in sludge dewatering an optimum dose exists for any conditioner in consideration of dewatering efficiency and economic issues insufficient or low doses of coagulants flocculants result in weak charge neutralization and bridging effects meanwhile excessive doses might cause sludge particles to be covered with coagulatants flocculants resulting in the regeneration of the suspension stability of flocs that is the restabilization effect lin et al 2015 yang et al 2016b consequently the turbidity induced by bio matters such as pn and ps with a relatively high mw decreases initially and then increases under coagulant overdose which results in the fluctuation of soluble eps properties and affects dewaterability zhang et al 2014b the restabilization effect is usually evident in coagulation systems that mainly follow simple charge neutralization and is not evident in those that follow the charge patching mechanism guibal et al 2006 ives 1977 sludge flocs exhibit reduced compactness at high coagulant doses verrelli et al 2009 for organic polymeric flocculants and microbial flocculants mbfs overdosing deteriorates the dewatering performance guo et al 2015 guo and ma 2015 jin et al 2016 pambou et al 2016 the cst curve that corresponds to sludge conditioned with polymers drops initially and then rises as the dose increases which means that an optimal conditioning dose exists pambou et al 2016 besides system re stability caused by superabundant positive charge and overdose of polymeric conditioners increase the viscosity of the sludge water system and thus result in the reduction of filtrate and deterioration of dewaterability christensen et al 1993 pambou et al 2016 in a previous work the srf of conditioned sludge increased and the filter paper broke due to the very high viscosity of conditioned sludge at a polymeric flocculant overdose of approximately 40 mg g ds dong et al 2011 in addition optimal conditioner doses change in different environmental conditions such as ph and temperature novak and bandak 1989 therefore optimal doses under different situations should be determined 3 1 2 ph the effect of ph on sludge dewatering is also crucial in the wastewater treatment process zheng et al 2013 generally the surface charges of colloidal particles in wastewater and coagulants flocculants especially in ionic coagulants flocculants vary under different ph levels which affect the charge neutralization effect seriously as reported by neyens and baeyens 2003 besra et al 2004 and raynaud et al 2012 the negative charges of colloidal particles are usually enhanced by the increasing ph value of the system various coagulants flocculants usually exhibit different ph dependencies in terms of sludge dewatering performance the system ph in inorganic coagulants can influence solubility speed of the hydrolysis reaction and precipitation forms verrelli et al 2009 as shown in fig 6 cao et al 2016 reported that the hydrolysis degree of inorganic salt coagulants exerts a significant impact on dewatering performance and monomer aluminum and oligomeric state aluminum exhibit poor performance meanwhile compared with slow reaction limited cluster aggregation that forms denser aggregates rapid diffusion limited cluster aggregation that results from a high metal hydrolysis ratio in a high ph system deteriorates the dewatering performance verrelli et al 2009 li et al 2005 pointed out that only acidification can decrease cst and srf when al salts are used to treat sludge water soluble organic polymeric flocculants exhibit complicated ph dependencies because of their distinct molecular structures and charge properties neutral and strongly ionic polymeric flocculants are usually suitable for a relatively wide ph range in sludge dewatering zheng et al 2014 for example three organic polymeric flocculants namely pam cationic pam cpam and chitosan graft poly dimethy ldiallyl ammonium chloride chitosan g pdmdaac can reduce mc to below 80 at a dose of 20 mg l in the range of ph 2 9 and they exert an excellent effect in the ph range of 4 7 wang et al 2016a amphoteric ones also show improved water solubility salt resistance and flocculation performance in a wide ph range dao et al 2016 lee et al 2014 rabiee et al 2014 however weak ionic polymeric flocculants usually exhibit strong ph effects for example chitosan a weak cationic natural polymer usually shows good flocculation performance in acidic conditions wang et al 2016a for mbfs the effect of system ph on dewatering is evident and important because most microorganisms contain weak acidic and or alkaline ions such as carboxyl groups which are highly sensitive to ph the mbfs reported by guo et al 2015 exhibit better dewatering performance in the ph range of 6 5 8 5 than in other ph ranges similarly zhang et al 2010b found that ph 7 5 is optimal for the hydration of sludge conditioned by mbfs in addition to the ph effects of coagulants flocculants the impact of ph on eps in sludge has also been considered extreme ph causes a disruption on the cell wall which results in intracellular material leakage neyens et al 2004 for example eps is released and dissolved in the sludge bulk after acidification due to instability at extreme ph values zhang et al 2015c in practice the mechanisms of eps extraction are mainly based on the improvement of repulsive force and disruption of the interaction between eps and cells after acidic or alkaline treatments sheng et al 2010 chen et al 2001 reported that sludge demonstrates good dewaterability and settleability in acidic conditions due to the destruction and reduction of eps raynaud et al 2012 who proposed that ph variation releases trapped water and fine particles also confirmed the effect of ph on the floc structure 3 1 3 temperature practical experience in the coagulation flocculation of wastewaters shows that ambient temperature also affects coagulation flocculation processes the optimal doses of coagulants flocculants usually increase as temperature decreases in a suitable range chen et al 2007 zhang et al 2010a zhang et al 2010a reported that the difference between the optimal doses for a chitosan based flocculant in summer 0 5 mg l and in winter 1 0 mg l in treating portable water can be double this finding can be ascribed to two factors yang et al 2016b one is that the viscosity of liquid increases with decreasing temperature which impedes the brownian movements of colloid particles and decreases agglomeration as a consequence zhang et al 2010a the other is that high temperature can usually improve the solubility and activity of polymeric flocculants and therefore results in a high extended conformation of macromolecules which benefits bridging flocculation sperling 2006 however a higher temperature is not benefical for the flocculation effects also lu et al 2005 lu et al 2005 compared the temperature effect on trona suspension using a mbf at 35 c 45 c 55 c and 65 c the status of the coagulation system the suspension viscosity and the activity of mbfs were affected by temperature and a maximum sedimentation rate was obtained at 45 c lu et al 2005 because the flocs formed at relatively high temperature was unstable and the sedimentation solid volume was easy to be expanded meanwhile the bioflocculant might be partly denaturation in high temperature situation lu et al 2005 the effect of temperature on sludge dewatering can also be explained by the abovementioned principles in a previous study the limiting viscosity the value of viscosity at the infinite shear rate decreased from 8 42 to 1 70 mpa for raw sludge and from 12 52 to 1 83 mpa for conditioned sludge and network strength weakened for those sludge as temperature increased from 10 c to 70 c dong et al 2011 from another aspect temperature influences dewaterability by changing sludge properties when the temperature is lower than 15 c the concentration of eps including pn and ps increases significantly moreover suspended solids have a high concentration due to the weak floc structure in winter wilén et al 2008 when the temperature drops further to the freezing stage limited quantities of organic matters are released hu et al 2011 freeze thaw and thermal treatments in sludge dewatering have also been studied under further temperature regulation hu et al 2011 wang et al 2017 was dewatered by freeze thaw treatment is accomplished through the separation of solid and liquid fractions during the formation of the ice matrix when bulk sludge is completely frozen tiny unfrozen regimes exist in the ice matrix and extended freezing or curing of sludge can improve sludge dewaterability hu et al 2011 freeze thaw treatment not only enhances sludge dewaterability but also solubilizes organic matters from the sludge matrix hu et al 2011 the improvement in sludge dewaterability after thermal treatment can be attributed to the changes in the original structures and properties of sludge wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 pointed out that a significant disintegration in eps occurs and the binding energy of water in sludge decreases after hydrothermal treatment in which most of the energy input is consumed in breaking down the binding strength between the adjacent water and solid particles free water becomes the main form of moisture existence in hydrothermal sludge when the temperature exceeds 180 c the melioration of surface properties including surface charge and relative hydrophobicity reportedly promotes the decrease in negative electrostatic repulsion and destroys the binding effect between particles and water wang et al 2014 thermal treatment in the temperature range of 60 c 180 c destroys the cell wall and makes the protein susceptible to biological degradation neyens and baeyens 2003 organic solubilization increases logarithmically with treatment duration in thermal pre treatment 60 c 180 c and high temperatures 180 c lead to high organic solubilization rates zhang et al 2017a 3 2 chemical coagulants flocculants common dewatering reagents include inorganic salt coagulants such as ferric and aluminum salts and synthetic organic polymeric flocculants mainly include pam and pam derivatives the addition of these chemicals is conducive to the agglomeration of fine sludge colloids through charge neutralization and bridging effects dentel et al 2000 niu et al 2013 thereby decreasing the srf and content of bound water in sludge katsiris and kouzeli katsiri 1987 several novel bioflocculants and many combinations of techniques with other pretreatments were reported and utilized to enhance the final sludge dewatering of coagulation flocculation 3 2 1 inorganic salt coagulants inorganic salt coagulants facilitate the conglomeration of sludge particles into flocs through charge neutralization niu et al 2013 besides inorganic coagulants have been reported to serve as skeleton builders and improve the porosity of sludge cake qi et al 2011a sludge containing alum flocs or ferric flocs usually demonstrate low compressibility small but compact structures and high solid contents chen et al 2015 lai and liu 2004 the most commonly used inorganic salt coagulants in wastewater treatment are ferric and aluminum salts which can be divided into small molecule inorganic coagulants such as alcl3 al2 so4 3 fecl3 fe2 so4 3 etc and inorganic polymeric coagulants ipcs such as pac polyferric sulfate pfs etc ipcs generally have higher charge density and larger molecular weight than small molecule inorganic coagulants the various inorganic coagulants applied in different sludge dewatering processes are summarized in table 3 3 2 1 1 aluminum salt coagulants aluminum salts are the most commonly used inorganic coagulants turchiuli and fargues 2004 investigated the dewatering performance and sludge flocs of two small molecule inorganic coagulants al2 so4 3 and fecl3 in clay suspensions they pointed out that the floc structure is linked to sludge dewaterability turchiuli and fargues 2004 alum flocs are larger and more compact than ferric ones resulting in the faster settling of alum flocs ferric flocs contain approximately 20 less bound water than alum flocs but exhibit higher cst values and therefore higher resistance to water removal than alum ones turchiuli and fargues 2004 however verrelli et al 2009 reported that alum sludge exhibits poorer dewatering performance than ferric sludge at high ph and doses due to the high hydrolysis ratio of pac the same group also concluded that ferric and alum sludge yielded similar performance in dewatering kinetics after comparing and assessing the dewaterability of a range of drinking water treatment plant sludges through computation of dewatering performance indicators for a diaphragm filter press verrelli et al 2010 those inconsistent results might result from their different characteristics of treated sludge and experimental conditions turchiuli and fargues 2004 verrelli et al 2009 2010 in addition to using conventional inorganic coagulants in primary sludge conditions xia et al 2016 studied the influence of alcl3 on deep dewatering of dewatered sewage sludge and found that the mc of filter sludge cake decreases from 73 41 to 54 03 when the dose is 8 g alcl3 300 g of dewatered sewage sludge in addition to small molecule aluminum salts zhang et al 2014b investigated the conditioning effects of ipcs pac and a composite coagulant hpac on the characteristics of soluble eps they found that srf is correlated with zeta potential soluble eps and dissolved organic carbon doc and hpac with high charge density and good bridging capability is more efficient than pac in sludge dewaterability flocs conditioned by pac and hpac are larger but looser than those using fecl3 niu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 also reported that the floc formed using pac in coagulation is larger than that formed by fecl3 at a low dose due to the abundant binding sites with particles moreover zhao et al 2009 used silane coupling agents and alcl3 to synthesize covalently bound organic silicate aluminum hybrid coagulants which possess prime advantages of large mw and superior coagulation efficiency compared with traditional coagulants and their net positive modification in comparison with using negatively charged activated silicic acid or polysilicic acid several studies have investigated the roles of metal species in sludge conditioning different speciation of aluminum which is generally separated into ala or almon monomer and oligomeric forms of aluminum alb or al13 mainly made up of middle polymer forms of aluminum and alc or alun primarily composed of high polymer forms of aluminum can be categorized by ferron assay according to the polymerization degree and alb and alc are more positively charged and more stable than ala cao et al 2016 moreover sludge flocs conditioned by alb and alc are less compressible and smaller but more compact and stable than those conditioned by ala and alb and alc also perform better in protein like substance removal and eps compression thus they exhibit better dewaterability than oligomeric forms of al cao et al 2016 pax 14 commercial pac coagulant an ipc with a highly charged tridecameric polymer aluminum polycation alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 included in alb relative to alcl3 and al2 so4 3 is effective in terms of sludge drying rate pambou et al 2016 salt inorganic flocculants with suitable polymerization could improve their dewaterability cao et al 2016 zhao et al 2009 peeters et al 2013 presented a new application of pac as a conditioner for was prior dewatering and drying to avoid worldwide fouling problems in direct sludge dryers and to reduce torque issues in indirect sludge dryers and sludge decanter centrifuges this beneficial effect is proposed to be the result of the bound water associated with al polymers in pac solutions which act as a type of lubrication for intrinsically sticky sludge solids during drying peeters et al 2013 3 2 1 2 ferric salt coagulants ferric salts are another important class of inorganic coagulants given their low cost fast settling velocity of ferric flocs and lower toxicity wider ph range of applications better effect in low temperatures compared to pac bratby 2016 lee et al 2014 ferric salts are also favored in many wastewater treatment plants bień and bień 2014 niu et al 2013 ferric ions reportedly exhibit high affinity to protein like substances chen et al 2015 wei et al 2018 yu et al 2008 which is the deciding factor of sludge filterability zhang et al 2015b chen et al 2016b compared the sludge floc structure and dewatering performance of three coagulants namely fecl3 pac and pam the sludge flocs conditioned by fecl3 had the smallest size but the lowest mc of sludge cake without cao2 pretreatment because of their high charge density that enabled the efficient compression of the double electric layer and skeleton builders of the hydrolysis products chen et al 2016b similarly the sludge flocs conditioned by fecl3 were smaller but denser than those conditioned by pac and the former showed better dewatering performance niu et al 2013 moreover sludge with a high fe3 concentration has a small volume of small pores 1 10 nm but a large volume of large pores 10 nm the minimal small pores contribute to the affinity of water in sludge and the numerous large pores result in a rigid porous lattice structure yu et al 2016 in addition although fe2 is usually employed as fenton s reagent the fe3 translated from fe2 after oxidation can also be used as a good coagulant yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2015c yu et al 2016 found that higher fe3 content in comparison with fe2 content sharply reduces the specific surface area of sludge and has lower srf and cst and lower mc of the cake in addition to small molecule ferric salts the suspended solid colloid equivalence charge neutralization rate can increase to nearly 100 with pfs conditioning but only to approximately 50 with fecl3 conditioning due to the characteristics of ipcs with high charge density and large molecular weight moreover these two conditioners can both decrease cst to a low value watanabe et al 1999 3 2 1 3 others apart from these traditional inorganic salt coagulants other inorganic coagulants have been proposed na2sio3 can be used as a common coagulant aid due to its high bridging function the synergistic effect between na2sio3 and fecl3 on dewatering urban dewatered sewage sludge was investigated in a previous work zhang et al 2017b and the results showed that na2sio3 alone exerts an adverse effect on sludge dewaterability whereas the dehydration rate of sludge improved significantly after conditioning with fecl3 followed by na2sio3 in the combination of fecl3 and na2sio3 na2sio3 was proven to restructure sludge networks with high strength and low compression and therefore improves sludge dewaterability zhang et al 2017b moreover novel environmentally friendly inorganic materials such as titanium ti and magnesium mg salt coagulants which exhibit good performance in wastewater treatment wang et al 2016b wu et al 2001 zhang et al 2017c have elicited much attention in sludge dewatering huang et al 2016a zhang et al 2017c sludge dewaterability is enhanced by the combination of mg oh 2 and naoh due to the bridging effect between mg2 and eps huang et al 2016a zhang et al 2017c reported that using a titanium salt coagulant tsc prepared with different basicity can enhance was dewaterability and the mc of sludge cake can decrease to below 80 through the effective compression of eps which is considered the most important mechanism of sludge dewatering for tscs the floc size in sludge conditioned with prehydrolyzed polytitanium chloride and ti xerogel coagulant is larger than that conditioned with pfs and this condition may benefit dewaterability wang et al 2016b thus conditioners synthesized with novel inorganic materials present advantages over conventional conditioners however these novel inorganic materials also have drawbacks for example tscs are usually expensive easy to hydrolyze and affect the system ph zhang et al 2017c the practical applications of these new inorganic coagulants are yet to be investigated 3 2 2 organic synthetic polymeric flocculants the application of inorganic coagulants is limited because these coagulants are sensitive to ph in comprehensive consideration of dewatering rates mc of sludge cake and equipment costs polymeric flocculants exhibit good dewatering performance due to their larger floc size and more void spaces for water drainage lo et al 2001 novak and o brien 1975 pam and its derivatives are the most commonly used organic polymeric conditioners in sludge dewatering on the basis of different monomeric units that contain various types of charges polymeric conditioners can be categorized as nonionic cationic anionic and ampholytic novak and o brien 1975 sun et al 2016 watanabe et al 1999 as described in fig 7 the various organic polymeric flocculants applied in different sludge dewatering processes are summarized in table 4 3 2 2 1 cationic polymeric flocculants given that the fine particles in was are commonly negatively charged cationic polymeric flocculants are efficient in destabilizing sludge particles through charge neutralization due to the dual function of cationic polymeric flocculants coagulation and flocculation one of the typical cationic polymeric flocculants is cpam two methods are generally applied to synthesize cpams jaeger et al 2010 one is through the post polymerization functionalization of pam and the other is through the copolymerization of cationic monomers and acrylamide am zhao et al 2016 cpams synthesized by post polymerization are limited by short preservation time and high residue of monomers which is highly toxic and can cause severe neurotoxic diseases bolto and gregory 2007 dao et al 2016 yang et al 2016b copolymerization is more popular than post polymerization cpams are usually synthesized by copolymerization of am and one or more cationic monomers such as 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride dac methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride dmc and dimethyldiallyammonium chloride dmdaac jiang and zhu 2014 sun et al 2016 yang et al 2010 yang and ni 2012 zheng et al 2013 2014 zhu et al 2013 cpams exhibit efficient dewatering performance due to their effective mechanisms of particle flocculation including charge neutralization particle bridging and depletion flocculation bolto and gregory 2007 the former two effects depend on the absorption of polymers on the particle surface and the last one depends on the presence of free un adsorbed polymers that are probably not significant in water treatment practice bolto and gregory 2007 cpams are thus widely used in many water and wastewater treatment plants bolto and gregory 2007 jin et al 2016 lu et al 2017 yang et al 2016a sun et al 2016 found that cpams synthesized with dac and am through microwave and uv initiation are more effective than thermal and ultrasonic initiating ones in terms of dewatering capability fractal dimension of the flocs and the zeta potential although the addition of cpams increases the sludge floc size for settleability and corresponding filterability jin et al 2016 it increases the viscosity of sludge which implies increased difficulty in piping the polymer treated sludge chen et al 2005 moreover flocs with a network structure formed by pam or cpam in was have a strong water preservation capability which worsens the dewaterability of was zhang et al 2017b in addition to normal cpam several cationic polymeric flocculants with special structures have been reported chen et al 2016a guo et al 2016 a conditioner with a cationic microblock structure was synthesized with am and dac by applying template polymerization which can achieve a low srf of 1 99 1012 m kg and an mc of 71 at a dose of 40 mg l and ph of 7 0 chen et al 2016a when cationic units exhibit a blocky distribution the adsorption sites between the copolymer and negatively charged particle segments become stronger due to higher utilization of cationic charges than randomly distributed ones chen et al 2016a guo et al 2016 studied the synthesis characterization and sludge dewaterability of a novel cationic polyamidine that consisted of a five membered ring like structural unit fig 8 this flocculant with a strong cationic degree and hydrophobic regions could reduce mc in sludge cake to 77 7 at a dose of 60 mg l 3 2 2 2 anionic polymeric flocculants anionic polymeric flocculants such as anionic pam apam have also been used in sludge dewatering although they have the same negative charges as the suspended particles in wastewaters the main dewatering mechanisms of apams are efficient adsorption and bridging effects ma et al 2013 compared with cpam and nonionic pam apam has the worst dewaterability highest srf due to its electrostatic repulsions with negatively charged surface particles in wastewaters besra et al 2004 lo et al 2001 apart from apams poly acrylic acid paa can also be used as a flocculant in sludge dewatering paa exhibits better performance than cpam in dewatering acid treated sludge in terms of dewatering and dehydration degree and the addition of paa in sludge can enhance the dewatering rate at filtration and expression phases lu et al 2017 an anionic copolymer p am aa amps synthesized by am acrylic acid aa and 2 acylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid amps with the molecular weight of 8 106 g mol showed better dewatering efficiency than commercial pam the minimum filter cake s mc was reduced to 65 1 ma et al 2013 3 2 2 3 amphoteric polymeric flocculants ionic polymers that contain cationic and anionic functional groups are called amphoteric polymers which usually show notable improvement in solubility and salt resistance in a wide ph range dao et al 2016 lee et al 2014 rabiee et al 2014 yang et al 2016b although several amphoteric polymeric flocculants including synthetic and natural ones have been studied in the wastewater treatment field dao et al 2016 lee et al 2014 rabiee et al 2014 watanabe et al 1999 the application of these flocculants in sludge dewatering is rare watanabe et al 1999 watanabe et al 1999 utilized a metal coagulant for charge neutralization and an amphoteric polymer structure shown in fig 7 for flocculation to improve organic sludge dewaterability and obtain a high dehydration rate and low mc of the sludge cake their results indicated that the charge neutralization rate determines the type and dose of polymer to be used the mechanism of the conditioning process was as follows 1 charge neutralization reacted with metal salt and formation of metal hydroxide 2 the anionic part of the amphoteric polymer molecule reacted with the positive charge of metal hydroxide while the cationic part reacted with the negative charge of the primary sludge 3 gigantic flocs formed through further bridging and flocculation and 4 the uncharged anionic part reacted with the cationic part within flocs which made the sludge particles tightly bound 3 2 2 4 nonionic polymeric flocculants nonionic polymeric flocculants with low charge density might be no match for pac and fecl3 when was is pre oxidated the mc of the sludge cake could be reduced to below 80 wt through further treatment with inorganic coagulants whereas using pam alone cannot achieve this due to its low charge density chen et al 2016b however ionic polymeric flocculants with high charge density might prevent the primary flocs coated by flocculants from approaching one another due to electrostatic repulsions thus nonionic polymers show a higher probability of further particle aggregation besra et al 2004 in single polymer conditioning a previous study demonstrated that a nonionic polymer generates stronger bridging effect due to its higher mw and thus unusually exhibits better dewaterability than a cationic polymer lee and liu 2001 moreover in terms of srf and cst sludge conditioned with a dual polymer conditioning i e cationic polymer followed by a nonionic polymer performs better than sludge conditioned with a nonionic polymer followed by a cationic polymer and sludge conditioned with a single polymer lee and liu 2000 by adding the cationic polymer first sludge particles are adsorbed and small but compact primary flocs are formed then the nonionic polymer is added to adsorb on the loops and tails of the cationic polymer to form a larger and more compacted flocs lee and liu 2000 3 2 3 natural polymeric flocculants inorganic salt coagulants and organic synthetic polymeric flocculants have been proven to be efficient in sludge dewatering but they might result in secondary pollution and entail many health risks due to residual metal ions or the release of noxious polymeric monomers into the target water bratskaya et al 2004 lin et al 2015 song et al 2010 wang et al 2016a therefore natural polymeric flocculants have attracted significant attention as environmentally friendly biodegradable and nontoxic flocculants kaith et al 2010 lanthong et al 2006 yang et al 2016b polysaccharide based natural polymers consisting of hex sugar rings have a rigid rod structure which might improve cake compressibility in addition similar structures between polysaccharide based eps and polysaccharide based flocculants may result in good affinities wei et al 2018 however natural materials also have many drawbacks in practical application including small molecular weight low charge density and poor water solubility wu et al 2016b to overcome these disadvantages various chemical modification methods such as etherification anthony and sims 2013 chen et al 2007 heinze et al 2004 kaith et al 2010 liu et al 2017a khalil et al 1998 krentz et al 2006 wei et al 2008 2018 zhang et al 2007 esterification yang et al 2016b oxidation mathew and adlercreutz 2009 and graft copolymerization huang et al 2016b lanthong et al 2006 liu et al 2017b mishra et al 2011 wu et al 2016b yang et al 2014 have been applied to improve dewatering performance lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a with the aid of these modification methods many natural polymer based flocculants have been reported and studied however current research on natural polymeric flocculants is still inadequate especially their application in sludge dewatering table 5 summarizes various natural polymeric flocculants applied in sludge dewatering processes 3 2 3 1 starch based flocculants starch one of the most commonly used natural resources cannot directly act as a flocculant in general wang et al 2013 however it has been modified to yield various starch based flocculants used in wastewater treatment anthony and sims 2013 chen et al 2007 heinze et al 2004 huang et al 2016b khalil et al 1998 krentz et al 2006 lanthong et al 2006 liu et al 2017a 2017b mishra et al 2011 wei et al 2008 2018 wu et al 2016b yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 the surface of many organic pollutants and inorganic particles in was are mostly negatively charged introducing certain cationic functional groups onto the starch backbone is highly popular grafting modification is a useful methods that introduces positive pieces onto starch at branch chains such as the stc g pdmc starch graft poly 2 methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride shown in fig 9 and stc g pdmdaac starch graft poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride lv et al 2014 wang et al 2013 wu et al 2016b the mw of these grafted flocculants with cationic groups on long molecular chains is obviously increased which is conducive to producing enhanced charge neutralization and bridging effects lv et al 2014 pourjavadi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 lv et al 2014 reported a novel sludge conditioner stc g pdmdaac which have not only hydrophilic groups for solubility and dispersion but also hydrophobic groups for building hydrophobic regions for forming drainage channels the sludge conditioned with stc g pdmdaac thus had low srf and cst and the final sludge water content was reduced to 50 6 from 97 85 lv et al 2014 besides a cost effective starch based flocculant was recently synthesized by etherification using 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cta as etherifying agent which exhibited good sludge dewaterability due to not only effective charge neutralization and bridging flocculation effects but also its good affinity to polysaccharide components in eps because of their similar structures moreover the sludge dewatering performance of this cta modified starch based flocculant was further enhanced after combined use with fecl3 wei et al 2018 in addition to the cationic organic monomers mentioned above several inorganic materials such as aluminum iron and silicon have been complexed and grafted onto the starch backbone to produce starch based composite flocculants with a high charge density as shown in fig 10 lin et al 2015 peng et al 2017 combined silicon aluminum iron starch csiafs can adapt to large ph variations 3 0 11 0 and combined aluminum ferrous starch cafs can break sludge colloids easily and release many lb eps proteins both are superior to pam pac and fecl3 in dewatering treatment lin et al 2015 peng et al 2017 3 2 3 2 chitosan based flocculants chitosan poly β 1 4 2 amino 2 deoxy d glucose is a high performance natural polysaccharide material it is derived from the deacetylation of natural chitin which is the second most abundant natural polymer in the world guibal et al 2006 wang et al 2012 2016a yang et al 2016b chitosan contains abundant free amino groups along the chain backbone that are cationically charged in acidic media chitosan and its many derivatives thus exert more prominent flocculating effects as flocculants than other polysaccharide materials in wastewater treatment and sludge dewatering due to their more efficient charge neutralization and bridging effects guibal et al 2006 wang et al 2012 2016a yang et al 2016b wang et al 2016a prepared a cationic grafted chitosan based flocculant chitosan g pdmdaac having a great network and an inconsecutive appearance with numerous channels which was proven to be more effective than that of pam cpam and pac in sludge dewatering in addition a chitosan alcl3 composite coagulant prepared by mixing chitosan and an alcl3 stock solution was investigated and the sludge conditioned by this composite coagulant had higher dewaterability than that conditioned by chitosan and alcl3 dosed individually due to the improvement of charge neutralization and the bridging effect ma et al 2016 however chitosan is more expensive than other polysaccharide materials such as starch and cellulose ma et al 2016 yang et al 2016b 3 2 3 3 others aside from starch and chitosan other polysaccharide materials such as cellulose liberatore et al 2016 tannins özacar and şengil 2000 enteromorpha zhao and gao 2015 cyclodextrins hartong et al 2007 spent coffee ground hao et al 2018 and their derivatives have also been investigated in the dewatering field although several of them only act as coagulant aid in the dewatering process the addition of certain natural polymers can enhance the permeability of sludge and thus improve the dewatering performance hartong et al 2007 özacar and şengil 2000 the combination of 15 mg l of pam and 3 mg l of enteromorpha by zhao and gao 2015 obviously improved sludge dewatering efficiency in terms of the average particle size of flocs dehydration rate and pam reagent required özacar and şengil 2000 found that combined usage of tannin and al2 so4 3 improves sludge filterability significantly compared with using al2 so4 3 only and tannin is more effective than a synthetic anionic polyelectrolyte as a coagulant aid hartong et al 2007 pointed out that cyclodextrins combined with alum or cpam can increase the solid content and dewatering rate which can result in a 2 8 percentage point increase in cake solids in a full scale trial they proposed that cyclodextrins promote agglomeration by neutralizing excess charge on the polymer conditioned sludge surface hartong et al 2007 3 2 4 bioflocculants natural polymeric flocculants are mainly derived from polysaccharide materials such as starch chitosan cellulose etc as another class of green chemical conditioners mbfs i e natural organic macromolecular substances produced by microorganisms have been obtained zhang et al 2010b mbfs have attracted significant attention due to their advantages of biodegradability non toxicity high efficiency and cost effectiveness compared with traditional coagulants flocculants yang et al 2012a based on cultivation of specific microorganisms and different usage conditions in sludge conditioning two categories of mbfs are roughly classified in this study one refer to normal mbfs which have similar conditioning processes to conventional inorganic coagulants and organic flocculants the other are complex mbfs i e biogenic flocculants which are usually combined with energy substance such as fe2 and need a relatively long time for incubation murugesan et al 2014a kurade et al 2014 wong et al 2016a 2016b the addition of iron compound further improves in situ production of biogenic flocculants murugesan et al 2014a kurade et al 2014 wong et al 2016a 2016b the different mbfs used in sludge dewatering are summarized in table 6 one normal mbf produced by rhodococcus erythropolis separated from alkaline thermal pre treated sludge can make the ds and srf of sludge reach 22 5 and 3 4 1012 m kg respectively guo and ma 2015 in a previous study filamentous fungal strains were isolated from bioleaching sludge to act as a bioflocculants one of which reduced cst of the chemically enhanced primary treatment sludge from 83 15 s to 35 50 s and supplementation of metal cations such as ca2 and fe3 could further improve the dewaterability murugesan et al 2014b other studies inoculated sludge with acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans af culture with the energy substance fe2 kurade et al 2014 murugesan et al 2014a wong et al 2016a 2016b sludge treatment with isolated cells of af without fe2 exhibited no cst reduction whereas the same treatment with fe2 addition reduced the sludge cst from 122 7 s to 72 5 s wong et al 2016b these complex mbfs could improve the settlement of organic matter into the sludge pellet kurade et al 2014 wong et al 2016a 2016b this result was proven by the 27 increase in the calorific value of the treated sludge kurade et al 2014 compared with other flocculants such as cationic polymer pac and al2 so4 3 mbfs can show a similar or even better performance for sludge dewaterability at an optimum dose kurade et al 2014 yang et al 2012a the combined usage of mbf and the abovementioned coagulants flocculants greatly improves the dewatering performance due to large flocs formed through the enhanced charge neutralization and bridging effect guo and ma 2015 a study reported that when tj f1 a type of mbf is used alone it is better than p am dmc in sludge dewatering in terms of both srf and the time to filter ttf the composite using these two performs better in dewaterability zhang et al 2010b however the drawbacks of mbfs are worthy of note cultivation processes of mbfs are usually time consuming the incubation time of biogenic flocculants is much longer moreover ph of sludge system fluctuates large in the incubation process kurade et al 2014 murugesan et al 2014a wong et al 2016a 2016b in addition many normal mbfs were purified and obtained using lyophilization which are high cost and time consuming also guo et al 2015 yang et al 2012a zhang et al 2010b 3 2 5 evaluation of various coagulants flocculants table 7 summarizes various kinds of coagulants and flocculants in sludge dewatering inorganic coagulants and synthetic polymeric flocculants are the most frequently used dewatering conditioners and they mainly include aluminum and ferric salts and pam derivatives respectively although inorganic coagulants are cheap and exert a good effect on dewatering they also have many drawbacks such as high dose sensitivity to system ph and residual metal ions which may result in biological toxicity bratskaya et al 2004 walton 2013 synthetic polymeric flocculants among which pam derivatives are the most commonly used are excellent in terms of dose floc size and dewatering efficiency but their cost is relatively high furthermore the addition of pam and its derivatives may lead to secondary pollution and health risks due to their residual monomers lin et al 2015 wang et al 2016a bioflocculants require a relatively long retention time which is difficult in small plants guo et al 2015 wong et al 2016b lastly polysaccharide based natural polymers have attracted increasing attention due to their many advantages such as environmental friendliness widespread availability biodegradability and prominent structural features however they still lack practical application and need further investigation kaith et al 2010 lanthong et al 2006 wei et al 2018 yang et al 2016b therefore high efficiency cheap and environment friendly coagulants flocculants should be developed considering the shortcomings of polysaccharide based natural polymers their application performance can be improved through chemical modifications lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a in sludge dewatering grafted natural polymeric flocculants are usually employed thus grafting copolymerization is the most commonly used modification method in this field lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a when economic factors and maneuverability are considered other simpler modification methods lv et al 2014 shogren 2009 wang et al 2013 2016a wei et al 2018 such as etherification esterification oxidation etc should be noted they can introduce various functional groups onto polymers conveniently bridging flocculation is also important in sludge dewatering aside from charge neutralization an enhanced bridging effect can be obtained by increasing the mw of polymeric flocculants apart from grafting copolymerization appropriate chemical crosslinking can also improve the mw of polymeric conditioners fig 11 with regard to the various introduced functional groups frequently studied polysaccharide based natural polymeric flocculants such as starch lv et al 2014 wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 chitosan wang et al 2016a and cellulose liberatore et al 2016 are usually modified cationic pieces are grafted onto the polysaccharide backbone to achieve efficient charge neutralization effects because of the negatively charged surface of mostly inorganic and organic colloidal particles in the sludge few studies focused on anionic modified conditioners anionic polymeric conditioners are usually much cheaper than cationic ones and they have a large hydrodynamic size in water due to intra chain electrostatic repulsions which are significantly beneficial to the bridging flocculation effect flory 1953 in addition to hydrophilic ionic groups hydrophobically associating flocculants which can help form hydrophobic regions within the sludge and further develop a porous structure in a mechanical dehydrating process may be synthesized guo et al 2016 lv et al 2014 yang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 several reports have confirmed the good dewatering performance of sludge conditioned with flocculants containing hydrophobic regions and high cationic degrees guo et al 2016 lv et al 2014 yang et al 2010 zheng et al 2013 among the various polysaccharide based natural polymers cellulose and starch cost less than chitosan and can be modified chemically by introducing different functional groups onto their backbone due to the large amount of hydroxyl groups on the saccharide rings for different application purposes huang et al 2016b lv et al 2014 pourjavadi et al 2013 wang et al 2013 wei et al 2018 therefore cellulose and starch present better application potentials in practical operations furthermore due to the distinct structures of natural polymers natural conditioners show different flocculation and dewatering properties from traditional inorganic ones the flocculation mechanisms in sludge dewatering should also be investigated in detail flocculant structure is a key to the involvement of different flocculation mechanisms the structures of organic polymeric flocculants including synthetic and natural ones are highly complicated due to their long chain features elias 1984 flory 1953 yang and hu 2001 from the viewpoint of polymer physics the structure of a macromolecule should include short range long range and condensed structures which correspond to the repeating unit structure of the polymer chain type and chemical composition long chain morphology shape and size and packed polymer chains supermolecular structure respectively elias 1984 flory 1953 yang and hu 2001 the multiplicity of the polymer structure accounts for the wide performance range characteristic of polymer based materials research on polymeric flocculants aside from type and chemical composition short range structure includes the structural morphology and conformation of polymers in the solution long range structure which is a particularly important determinant of the final flocculation performance because flocculants are usually dissolved in water moreover the optimal dose of organic polymeric flocculants is usually in the range of 0 1 100 mg l which according to polymer solution theory is extremely diluted elias 1984 flory 1953 therefore compared with traditional polymer solution theories fuoss and strauss 1948 fuoss and cathers 1949 manning 1974 oosawa 1971 radeva 2001 the new relevant theory established from much wider polymer concentration ranges may be more promising in studying the hydrodynamic structure of polymers in extremely diluted concentration regions cheng 1997 yang et al 2012b however until now this topic has been rarely investigated furthermore the structure activity relationship can be established according to the achieved flocculation mechanisms the structural features and final flocculation performance of flocculants the quantitative correlations among the preparation condition structural features and flocculation properties can be well constructed through the combination of the synthesis recipe for flocculants accordingly a proper flocculant can be selected or designed through precise molecular control to achieve the desired dewatering performance and optimize the dewatering process this strategy is a practical operational method 3 3 techniques combined with other pretreatments large amounts of organic matters such as eps are crucial to wastewater treatment and sludge dewatering cao et al 2016 chen et al 2015 2016b zhang et al 2017c however the addition of cationic polymers can partially release eps from the sludge surface to the supernatant zheng et al 2014 inorganic coagulants including aluminum cao et al 2016 and ferric salts niu et al 2013 can make sludge cakes less compressible due to the strong binding strength between ions and protein like substances chen et al 2016b niu et al 2013 sole application of traditional coagulation flocculation cannot achieve satisfactory dewatering performance in china was is usually conditioned with traditional pam before mechanical filtration in many small and medium sized sewage treatment plants resulting in dewatered sludge of 30 million tons per year with mc as high as 80 lu et al 2013 xia et al 2016 this fact reflects the drawback of using coagulation flocculation alone aside from coagulation flocculation other pretreatments have been confirmed to effectively improve sludge dewatering performance by releasing bound water these pretreatments include skeleton builder addition wu et al 2016c sonic treatment bień and bień 2014 huan et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 thermal treatment neyens and baeyens 2003 wang et al 2014 2017 zhang et al 2017a acid and alkali treatment li et al 2005 oxidation methods he et al 2015 mo et al 2015 yu et al 2016 zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2012c and enzymatic treatment ayol 2005 dursun et al 2006 thomas et al 1993 wu et al 2016a the mechanisms and corresponding effects of which are briefly summarized in table 8 however after pretreatment with these methods release of bound water and degradation of the eps structure simultaneously occur consequently more fine particles are produced and organic matters are transferred to the outer layers chen et al 2015 2016b this is a part of reasons why using those conditioning methods solely such as enzymatic treatment or oxidation chen et al 2015 2016b cannot achieve an ideal dewatering performance or even deteriorates dewaterability thomas et al 1993 on this occasion coagulants flocculants can make the best use of their functionality through charge neutralization and the bridging effect thus the combined usages of various pretreatments with coagulation flocculation show a potential for use in efficient sludge dewatering 3 3 1 physical conditioning treatments 3 3 1 1 skeleton builders skeleton builders can improve the incompressibility and permeability of the sludge cake but increase the excess sludge yield therefore treatments that combine skeleton builders with coagulants flocculants and other pretreatments have been established for example coal fly ash chen et al 2010 biochar wu et al 2016c lime yu et al 2016 lignite qi et al 2011b thapa et al 2009a 2009b slag ning et al 2013 gypsum zhao and bache 2001 zhao 2006 and red mud zhang et al 2014a were added in previous studies to improve dewaterability thapa et al 2009a 2009b showed that the structure of lignite conditioning sludge is more porous and less compressible than that of directly flocculated sludge through experiments with mercury porosimetry scanning electron microscopy sem and cake yield stress curves sludge dewaterability was improved due to the porous rigid and less compressible structure of the sludge conditioned by combining cationic polyelectrolyte residues and negatively charged lignite particles qi et al 2011b the results resembled those of a study on slag conditioned sludge in which slag acted as a skeleton builder to form an incompressible and porous structure and sludge dewaterability was further improved by combining with cpam because the flocculated slag treated sludge reduced sludge compressibility by incorporating rigid structures and releasing water by increasing the solids porosity whereas the flocculated sludge by itself formed a highly compressible structure ning et al 2013 similar results were obtained when gypsum functioned as a physical conditioner combined with a polymer for conditioning a certain alum sludge because the polymer conditioning of sludge improved the rate of water removal and gypsum formed a permeable and rigid lattice structure for further dewatering under a high positive pressure zhao 2006 physical conditioners can be modified to obtain dual function materials for better utilization and further improvement of incompressibility and permeability for example red mud has a long term persistence of alkalinity and a high surface area which make this material act as a skeleton builder and a neutralizer in combination with fenton s reagent zhang et al 2014a raw rice husk biochar modified by fecl3 can not only act as a skeleton builder but also improve the neutralization effect due to its positively charged characteristics wu et al 2016c the prospects of combining coagulation flocculation and skeleton building in sludge dewatering or developing several cationic coagulants flocculants that contain similar features of skeleton builders are therefore feasible these physical conditioners can play an important role in sludge dewatering after proper modification 3 3 1 2 microwave treatment microwave treatment is believed to disintegrate the matrix and destroy microflocs leading to the release of eps and changes in particle size distributions cai et al 2017 cai et al 2017 demonstrated that the dewatering performance of antibiotic mycelial residue initially increases and then decreases while mc substantially decreases under microwave treatment however microwave application slightly enhances sludge dewaterability with a short contact time but significantly deteriorates dewatering performance with long contact time yu et al 2009 this finding may be due to the two conflicting effects of microwave treatment i e release of trapped water and formation of fine particles and the latter effect deteriorates the filtration efficiency despite the controversy the effect of eps concentration on dewaterability has been mentioned cai et al 2017 yu et al 2009 therefore an appropriate microwave intensity was proposed by luo et al 2013 who pointed out that the optimal combined condition for tannery sludge pretreatment is as follows microwave output power of 648 w radiation time of 60 s and cationic cpam dose of 8 mg l sludge treated under this condition performs better than sludge treated by cpam alone luo et al 2013 in the combined technique microwave radiation destroys the floc structure to release bound water and reduce the viscosity of sludge but form many fine particles and cpam plays an important role in flocculation and aggregation of those fine particles luo et al 2013 3 3 1 3 ultrasonic treatment ultrasonic treatment is an efficient tool for sludge disintegration and improving sludge biodegradability bień and bień 2014 huan et al 2009 zhu et al 2018 combined ultrasound cpam conditioning exerts a synergistic effect in comparison with using ultrasound alone because the effect of ultrasonic treatment mainly strips the eps and water from the sludge flocs zhu et al 2018 likewise the combined use of fe2 so4 3 and polyelectrolytes also results in a decrease in the hydration of sonicated sludge in the process of vacuum and pressure filtration bień and bień 2014 however the ultrasonic disintegration degree should be appropriately controlled and incompact sludge flocs can be thus disrupted to small fragments and re flocculated to tight particles with the help of coagulants flocculants resulting in improved dewaterability huan et al 2009 huan et al 2009 found that when the disintegration degree exceeds 40 most cells are destroyed at different degrees thereby deteriorating the dewatering performance only when the sludge disintegration degree is 2 5 can sludge dewaterability be improved with the conditioning of fecl3 3 3 2 chemical conditioning treatments 3 3 2 1 acid and alkali treatment the effect of ph on dewatering efficiency is crucial similarly acid and alkali treatment disrupts floc fragments and releases organic polymers and bound water li et al 2009 naoh and ca oh 2 are generally applied during alkaline treatment li et al 2008 2009 ca oh 2 can improve sludge dewaterability but the weight of sludge cake also increases li et al 2008 li et al 2008 demonstrated that low dose naoh 0 2 mol l deteriorates sludge dewaterability but dewatering performance recovers gradually with the increase in the naoh dose compared with alkali conditions acidification decreases the cst and srf of sludge containing aluminum and a recover al3 as coagulants more efficiently li et al 2005 alkali conditions and salt addition decrease the filtration kinetic significantly whereas acid conditions improve dewatering raynaud et al 2012 however excessive acidification significantly increases the concentration of organic matters in sludge bulk and deteriorates the dewatering rate li et al 2005 the addition of only 5 mg g of paa in acidified sludge can improve the dewatering rate through the re flocculating effect lu et al 2017 3 3 2 2 oxidation treatments oxidation treatment can degrade organic matters such as eps for further improvement of dewatering performance he et al 2015 mo et al 2015 yu et al 2016 zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2012c fenton fenton like treatments which are highly popular oxidation techniques are widely investigated in sludge conditioning because they can produce hydroxyl radicals oh for the collapse and degradation of eps and for improving the dewatering performance with the aid of iron species especially fe3 as a coagulant in addition to the oxidation effect yu et al 2016 the technique of fe2 and activated persulfate oxidation which ruptures flocs and releases bound water zhen et al 2012a 2012b 2012c has been also established to treat was several novel oxidants have been investigated too was pre oxidation by 20 mg of cao2 gtss was co conditioned by fecl3 pac or pam in a previous study and sludge dewaterability was enhanced obviously after three chemical re flocculation chen et al 2016b furthermore certain inorganic salts such as fe2 and zero valent iron exert a strong oxidation effect when incorporated with h2o2 or persulfate salt the production of fe3 can act as a coagulant skeleton builder and binding agent with pn nano oxidants have been also utilized in sludge dewatering nano fe2o3 prior to tsc addition can further improve sludge dewaterability and decrease compressibility zhang et al 2017c in another study a nano material fe fe2o3 which was combined with pdmdaac and h2so4 with doses of 40 4 8 and 136 mg g ds decreased the mc of sludge from 78 1 to 64 8 he et al 2016 the authors he et al 2016 explained that the fe fe2o3 nanomaterial induced molecular oxygen activation and the hydroxyl radicals decomposed eps thus the bound water in sludge was converted into free water 3 3 2 3 enzymatic treatment biological enzymes can not only solubilize the eps components of was under mild conditions but also improve its subsequent treatment and disposal chen et al 2015 enzymatic treatment which disrupts the sludge structure is usually combined with coagulants flocculants dursun et al 2006 thomas et al 1993 the dose of the enzyme product should be suitable because under dosage provokes slight hydrolysis and releases a portion of bound water whereas over dosage creates many hydrophilic end groups which counteract the dewatering performance thomas et al 1993 for example with the increase in the dose of two enzymes in a previous work sludge srf decreased from 7 47 1013 to approximately 4 1013 m kg at a protease dose of 100 mg g and from 1 34 1015 to approximately 0 95 1015 m kg at an α amylase dose of 50 mg g then srf increased with the overdose of the two enzymes chen et al 2015 the sludge filtration rate decreased significantly after enzymatic treatments and the addition of inorganic coagulants could not only reconstruct the floc structure compactly but also removed the eps in sludge bulk the results indicated that the combined technique could make mc lower than that of sludge cake treated with coagulants alone chen et al 2015 in summary these physical and chemical conditioning treatments disintegrate the sludge flocs more or less but excessive fragmentation is adverse to sludge dewaterability thus combined coagulation flocculation is feasible in sludge dewatering given that many problems exist in combination techniques for conditioning was in practice such as optimum combination ratio operation difficulty and various characteristics of sludge the synergistic and compensation mechanisms of coagulation flocculation with these pretreatments should be studied thoroughly 4 conclusion practical operation indicates that the current dewatering performance for was is still relatively poor which results in high cost sludge treatment the large amount of eps the high energy demand for bound water drainage and the strong compressibility of sludge cake are considered difficulties in the dewatering process other reasons include insufficient coincident standards for testing these above parameters however the major reason is the lack of well established structure activity relationship due to the highly complicated and multilevel structural features of sludge in sludge dewatering various solids including eps are first aggregated to form flocs then the flocs are further assembled in a condensed sludge cake the condensed structure of the sludge cake not the eps and flocs is the key to determining the final dewatering performance which might account for the many inconsistent reports between the dewatering performance and structural characteristics of eps or flocs to understand sludge better the characteristics of sludge cake should be studied thoroughly in addition to the water content solid components and floc properties accordingly a suitable porous and incompressible structure of sludge cake could be constructed and regulated to obtain the desired dewatering performance however little work has been conducted on the quantitative or semi quantitative investigation of the structural information of sludge cakes which might be further examined by using neutron scattering synchrotron radiation based techniques and so on in depth investigation of the condensed structure of sludge cake obviously depends on the development of advanced characterization techniques and highly sophisticated instruments coagulation flocculation as an indispensable pretreatment for sludge dewatering is widely applied in water and wastewater plants because of its economic efficiency and strong maneuverability to further improve the sludge dewatering performance novel coagulants flocculants should be developed urgently and should have the characteristics of high dewatering efficiency low cost and environmental friendliness research and development of novel coagulants flocculants are intrinsically based on the well established structure activity relationship dewatering mechanisms should thus be studied in detail based on not only the structural characteristics of sludge but also on those of the coagulants flocculants the effects of various metal species of inorganic coagulants and the multilevel structural characteristics of organic polymeric flocculants including various ionic or nonionic functional groups and their contents and distributions short range structure and molecular weight and various chain conformations in solutions long range structure on different target sludge types should be investigated in detail however the work related to this topic is unsystematic and even limited from the perspective of coagulation flocculation processes and conditioning methods various inorganic and organic conditioners including coagulation flocculation and composited coagulation flocculation can be combined to fully make use of their respective advantages and eventually achieve better dewatering performance the combination of coagulation flocculation with other pretreatments is also an effective method in addition to traditional pretreatments such as addition of skeleton builders microwave method ultrasonic conditioning acidification alkalinity oxidation etc nanotechnology advanced oxidation and bio treatment also present a significant potential to be energetically developed and applied in sludge dewatering however synergistic and compensation mechanisms including composite applications of inorganic and organic coagulants flocculants and various pretreatments with coagulation flocculation should be well investigated they are important and have great practical significance in promoting the applications of their combined usages and obtaining a final ideal dewatering performance

sinkkonen et al 1993a 1993b schwarzbauer et al 2000 a recent study has also identified 19 pcdps congeners in surface water and sediment samples of the yangtze river china zhang et al 2014b pcdpss may have much higher bioaccumulation potentials than pcdes according to the multimedia modeling and they belong to the highest or intermediate priority pollutants mostrag et al 2010 pcdpss are hydrophobic and tend to bioaccumulate in lipids shi et al 2012 the presence of pcdpss could cause potential harmful effects to living organisms exposure to pcdpss affects the antioxidant defense system in female kunming mice and freshwater goldfish causing alterations in the levels of antioxidants zhang et al 2012 li et al 2012 the luciferase reporter gene lrg assay in avian species and the h4iie luc transactivation assay in mammals revealed that some pcdps congeners can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr mediated molecular toxicological pathways zhang et al 2014a 2016 thus it is of utmost

among numerous sulfur containing contaminants no study on compounds containing both sulfur and chlorine atoms in the aromatic molecules has been done in the current paper we selected 17 pcdps compounds with the structures shown in table s1 to perform the kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of these molecules by fe vi we demonstrate for the first time that the oxidation by fe vi not only

used as received 2 2 oxidation procedures the experiments were conducted in acetonitrile phosphate buffer 0 02 m mixed solution v v 50 50 the limited solubility of pcdpss necessitated the use of acetonitrile as a co solvent with water 1 1 acetonitrile not only ensured achieving micro molar concentrations of pcdpss for this study but it also validated it in a highly polar solvent environment

adding certain volume of fe vi stock solution to 30 ml of 20 0 μm pcdpss solution present in 100 ml brown glass bottles at room temperature initial concentrations of fe vi in mixed solution were 400 0

techniques see next section the procedure was similar to our previous approaches chen et al 2016 usually a variety of environmental factors such as inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter e g humic acid konstantinou and albanis 2004 are considerably common in wastewaters and also in natural water implying a non ignorable influence on 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps removal by fe vi in a removal study

pecdps and its oxidized products were evaluated using calculated data from the ecosar program ecosar 2014 prediction of contaminants is performed using correlation of available experimental toxicity with structure activity relationships sars burden et al 2016 literature has shown successful application of the program to predict aquatic toxicities to screen environmental contaminants jones et al 2002 gao et al 2014 in evaluating exposure risks to aquatic organisms three different trophic levels are included green algae daphnia and fish acute toxicity was expressed using ec50 values the contaminant concentration that inhibits green algae growth by 50 growth after 96 h and lc50 values the pollutant concentration that leads to the death of 50 fish and daphnia after 48 and 96 h exposures respectively classification of chronic and acute toxicity based on the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals van zelm et al 2010 is given in table s2 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics initially a value of k for the oxidation of pecdps by fe vi was determined at ph 8 0 results of concentration of pecdps and fe vi at different times were used to plot ln c c 0 versus fe vi t inset fig 1 in the plot c 0 and c t are the concentrations of pecdps at time zero and time t respectively a plot was linear and the slope of the line gave the values of k as 1 37 0 05 103 m 1 s 1 next values of k at different ph were determined and are shown in fig 1 rate constants k of the oxidation of pecdps by fe vi were somewhat similar in the ph range from 8 0 to 8 5 followed by decrease with further increase in ph to 9 5 the decrease in the values of k in alkaline medium is similar to many reported studies on the reactions between fe vi and pollutants feng et al 2017a lee et al 2009 sharma et al 2011 2015 this is related to the species of fe vi involved in the reaction water hfeo4 h feo4 2 pk a3 7 23 sharma et al 2001 to better understand the trend of k with ph seen in our study fig 1 a value of pk a3 in water acetonitrile 50 50 v v phosphate buffer were determined a similar approach used in our previous study was applied sharma et al 2001 a variation of molar absorptivity at 510 nm ε510 nm with ph is shown in fig s1 from this plot a value of pk a3 was estimated as 8 2 0 1 this value was used to fit the ph dependent values of k in fig 1 a solid line represents the fit that gave species specific rate constants as k hfeo4 pecdps 2 1 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 and k feo4 2 pecdps 1 0 0 1 102 m 1 s 1 the hfeo4 species has a higher ability to oxidize pollutants than the un protonated species feo4 2 the level of hfeo4 decreases with increase in ph see dashed line in fig 1 which causes the observed trend in the values of k as a function of ph in fig 1 next kinetics of the oxidation of a series of 17 pcdpss by fe vi ranging from dichlorodiphenyl sulfide to heptapchlorodiphenyl sulfide which were different in numbers and positions of chlorine atoms i e congeners were studied at ph 8 0 values of the evaluated k for these pcdpss are summarized in table s1 and are plotted as a function of chlorine atoms in fig 2 a the oxidation rates changed with the number of chlorine atoms of pcdpss fig 2a values of k increased with increase in chlorine atoms from 2 to 4 followed by decrease with increase in chlorine atoms to 6 or 7 the charges on different atoms present in the molecule of pcdpss i e sulfur atom carbon atoms to hydrogen atom and carbon atom to chlorine atom vary with the numbers of chlorine atoms results of fig 2a suggest that the relative rate of the attack of fe vi may be influenced by the chlorine atoms and their positions in the molecule a variation in the oxidation rates of different pcdpss may be understood by knowing their thermodynamic properties in solution the standard gibbs energy of formation δf g 0 of the pcdpss may represent their relative stability the thermodynamic properties of pcdpss including δf g 0 have been calculated for a wide range of congeners using dft calculations zeng et al 2008 these values of δf g 0 are summarized in table s1 congeners of pcdpss have shown a variation in the values of δf g 0 table s1 a plot of fig 2b showed a reasonable linear decrease in values of k with increase in δf g 0 r2 0 66 it seems that pcdpss with low δf g 0 values would be more likely to be susceptible to be attacked by fe vi it should be pointed out that a correlation as shown in fig 2b provides a general trend but many factors would determine the oxidation rates of pcdpss by fe vi these factors may include repulsion interactions between chlorine atoms and between cl and s atoms of pcdpss the interactions vary with number of chlorine atoms on the different positions and the number of relative position for these chlorine atoms of pcdpss 3 2 degradation a number of inorganic ions and natural organic matters are present in natural water and wastewater which may influence the degradation of target contaminant by fe vi tests were performed on effects of anions cl no3 and so4 2 cations ca2 and mg2 heavy metal ions fe3 and cu2 and humic acid ha on removal of pecdps at ph 8 0 experiments were performed at a molar ratio of 20 1 fe vi 0 pecdps 0 results of remaining pecdps as a function of time in the mixed solutions at two levels of ions 0 5 mm and 5 mm are shown in fig 3 a complete degradation or removal of pecdps without ions in solution was seen in 240 s no obvious effect of cl no3 and so4 2 on degrading pecdps by fe vi was found figs 3a and 3b however removal of pecdps was inhibited after additions of cations and heavy metal ions fig 3c f this inhibition increased with increased concentrations of the ions fig 3c versus fig 3d and fig 3e versus fig 3f removal of pecdps by fe vi in presence of 5 mm ions in 240 s is summarized in fig s2 the decrease in removal of pecdps was more pronounced in presence of heavy metal ions than inorganic cations in reaction mixture after adding 0 5 mm of fe3 cu2 ca2 and mg2 cations the degradation of pecdps decreased by 9 8 5 7 0 12 and 0 38 respectively compared to control i e no ions in solution fig s2 slight less removal of pecdps in presence of fe3 and cu2 ions may be related to the formation of complex between ions and pecdps which could not be easily reacted with fe vi this hypothesized complex formation may be through the s atom of the pecdps the decrease by fe3 was much more than that caused by cu2 in water fig s2 fe3 ions tend to form the stronger complex with sulfur atom of pecdps than cu2 it appears that the stronger complex is less reactive with fe vi compared to the weaker complex to result in less removal of pecdps by fe vi when fe3 was present in solution than cu2 fig s2 the effect of ha on the degradation efficiency of pecdps by fe vi was also studied results of experiments using three different levels of ha 1 0 5 0 and 15 0 mg l are presented in fig s3 the degradation rates of pecdps in 1 0 and 5 0 mg l ha were similar to that without ha in solution in presence of 15 mg l ha the degradation rate was decreased however at 240 s complete removal of pecdps was observed at all studied levels of ha in solution therefore there was no apparent effect of ha in solution on the removal of pecdps see fig s3 it seems that ha in solution was not competing significantly with pecdps to react fe vi to have any influence on the removal efficiency of fe vi in other words fe vi may be reacting faster with pecdps than ha in the mixed solution to give observed effects of ha in fig s3 3 3 identification of oxidized product ops the reaction solution of fe vi and pecdps at ph 8 0 was first subjected to analysis of ops at different reaction times 600 s by lc hrms method esi neg pos in addition analyses of some of the ops were also conducted using gc ms technique ei the product ion scans in the ms ms were performed to assign structures of these products 3 3 1 structural identification of the oxidized products of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps by lc ms figure s4 shows the total ion current tic chromatograms of the reaction solutions of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps by fe vi treatment at different times structural assignments of the ops were performed by the product ion scan based on the corresponding extracted ion chromatograms xic and ms ms spectra an approach used to identify ops is described below for op 336 and op 372 as the examples 3 3 1 1 op 336 lc ms neg at 21 22 min an ion cluster of m z 336 88 338 88 340 87 342 87 344 87 was detected with the chlorine isotope ratio of 75 4 100 0 50 6 12 1 3 suggesting the presence of four cl atoms in the compound op 336 as shown in fig s5a the fragment ions at m z 300 9043 and 264 9275 correspond to the sequential losses of two hcl another major fragment ion at m z 191 9200 corresponds to the individual loss of such fragment as c2cl3o thus op 336 was identified as c12h6cl4so with the structure shown in fig s5a 3 3 1 2 op 372 lc ms pos the chromatographic peak of op 372 was observed with a retention time of 15 36 min in the positive ion mode which provides a direct evidence for direct oxidation of sulfur atom of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps in the product ion spectra fig s5b the fragment ion peaks with m z 355 8487 320 8804 and 285 9122 indicated the sequential losses of o h cl and cl from the parent ion m z 372 8513 furthermore the fragment ions at m z 226 8842 and 192 9237 resulted from the cleavage of c s bonds from op 372 m z 372 8513 another two product ions at m z 210 8894 and 175 9212 corresponded to sequential losses of 16 and 35 da in m z 226 8842 respectively these were attributed to the losses of o and cl respectively similarly in view of isotope characteristic peaks the repeated ms ms fragments and proposed fragmentation patterns of the ops of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps the individual structures of op 258 op 274 op 352a and b op 370 op 386a and b and op 402 were proposed the detailed fragmentation pathways are shown in figs s6 s11 the data of products ions with low concentration were not shown 3 3 2 structural identification of the oxidized products of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps by gc ms figure s12 shows the gc ms results of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps or pecdps solution after 2 min of fe vi oxidation the 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps peak was observed at 19 25 min fig s12a the mass spectrum of the gas phase intermediate is also shown fig s12b the ei mass spectrum indicates a penta chloro compound with base peak ions at m z 357 89 and 359 89 corresponding to the molecular ions m and m 2 presenting the characteristic chlorine signature the major fragment ions are m z 322 90 presumable loss of cl 287 92 loss of cl2 252 95 loss of cl3 176 00 loss of c6h3cl3 143 04 loss of c6h3cl3s 109 08 loss of c6h3cl4s and 74 08 loss of c6h3cl5s one of the main ops analyzed using gc ms technique was op 389 fig s13a shows that the peak of this op appeared at 20 50 min the mass spectrum of the gas phase intermediate 1 2 3 dichlorophenylsulfonyl 2 4 5 trichlorobenzene or op 389 is presented in fig s13b the base peak ions in this case are m z 389 98 and 391 95 corresponding to the molecular ions m and m 2 also presenting the chlorine signature the major fragmentation ion is m z 192 99 and it corresponds to the loss of c6h2ocl4 relating to the cleavage of s o and s c bonds subsequently the fragment ion at m z 145 01 results from the loss of thioether bond in m z 192 99 furthermore the fragment ions at m z 110 00 and 75 13 are formed after the loss of two chlorine atoms in m z 145 01 a summary of identified ops and their structures are presented in table s3 oxidative transformation of the pecdps m z 357 89 resulted in different products with m z values ranging from 258 8791 to 402 8332 these ops were assigned as op 258 op 274 op 336 op 352a op 352b op 370 op 386a op 386b op 389 and op 402 see table s3 the mass analysis of ops suggests the presence of sulfhydryl and hydroxyl groups in the transformation of pecdps by fe vi the low m z values of ops i e 258 8791 and 274 8742 indicate the cleavage of the c s bond in the parent molecule a substitution of cl atom from pecdps by hydroxyl group is also possible based on the product with m z of 336 8818 op 336 3 4 plausible mechanism 3 4 1 o atom transfer to sulfur ii op 372 is a biaryl sulfoxide type product which could be formed through the attack of fe vi on s ii of pecdps fig 4 shows a proposed mechanism of pathway 1 in which s ii acts an electron pair donor to the high valent fe vi via direct interaction with the ferrate oxygen atoms an effective oxygen transfer occurs as shown through the detailed mechanism of pathway 1 the sulfoxide can subsequently undergo a similar mechanism of oxidation leading to the sulfone op 389 step wise oxidation of pecdps to op 372 to op 389 was observed in the peak areas of these ops fig s14 initial 120 s of the reaction between fe vi and pecdps showed an increase in the yield of sulfoxide and sulfone containing ops after the complete degradation of pecdps in 120 s an excess of fe vi reacted to covert the sulfone group to sulfonic group via cleavage of the c s bond to yield op 258 it seems the hydrolysis step after cleavage may be taking place to yield sulfonic group containing op 258 the formation of op 274 was also observed as a result of the hydroxylation of the benzene ring of the op 258 both of the last two steps were evident from peak areas of op 258 and op 274 which were formed significantly after 120 s fig s14 3 4 2 oxidization of benzene ring pathway 2 presents the oxidation of the ring of pecdps by fe vi that describes the formation of op 370 op 386a op 386b and op 402 fig 5 fig s15 exhibits the increased peak areas of these ops with time up to 120 s after 120 s peak areas of these ops were decreased except op 402 fe vi attacks the ring of pecdps to form hydroxylated product op 370 pathway 2 shows the proposed mechanism for the fe vi oxidation of the aromatic ring the o of fe vi adds via a radical mechanism to the aromatic ring at the position ortho to the cl substituent this generates a cl stabilized aromatic radical and fe v a subsequent step possessing a higher rate abstracts the aromatic h via the other o radical to re aromatize the ring and reduce fe v to fe iv the aromatic o subsequently leaves the fe iv op 402 can form via oxidative pathway 1 occurring twice on op 370 further oxidation of op 370 may occur through two pathways to produce the products op 386a and op 386b an attack of fe vi on the sulfur moiety produces a sulfoxide group op 386a as described in pathway 1 similarly an oxidation of the sulfoxide group to the sulfone group forms op 402 via the same pathway 1 the hydroxylation of the ring of the op 370 by fe vi generates a di hydroxylated product op 386b via pathway 2 3 4 3 chlorine atom substitution by hydroxyl group op 336 shows the replacement of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group of the fe vi during the oxidation of pecdps fig 6 the hydroxyl group of fe vi could add to the aromatic ring leading to a sulfur stabilized radical after which a chlorine atom transfer can occur to the ferrate oxygen followed by water oxidation to hocl the selective oxidation of sulfur atom of op 336 resulted in sulfoxide containing product op 352a the hydroxylation of op 336 formed the di hydroxylation product op 352b significantly hydroxylation of generally deactivated benzene ring was observed in pathway 2 these hydroxylated products are minor and may be generated through intermediates iron v and iron iv when fe vi was reduced by pecdps this speculation is supported by observation of hydroxylation by the iron iv and iron v complexes in organic solvent cho et al 2016 nam et al 2014 oloo and que 2015 degradation of pecdps with concomitant growth of the peak areas of the products from pathway 3 was found fig s16 significantly the relative peak areas of ops in fig 6 compared to other ops of the oxidation of pecdps indicate that the products obtained from the substitution of chlorine atom were minor peak areas of fig s16 versus peak areas of fig s14 or s15 3 5 ecotoxicity evaluation finally the toxicity of ops obtained in pathways 1 3 see figs 4 6 was assessed using the ecosar program toxicity results are shown in table s4 fig 7 and figs s17 s19 the determined toxicity of pecdps is found in the category of very toxic i e 0 1 mg l to fish daphnia and algae comparatively evaluated toxicity of all ops is lower than the parent compound pecdps pathway 1 shows the major products of the oxidation of pedcps op 258 and op 274 fig 4 which are determined to be not harmful see figs 7a and 7b and fig s17 other intermediate products of the sulfur oxidation of pecdps op 372 and op 389 pathway 1 have lower toxicity than pecdps see figs 7a and 7b and fig s17 however excess of fe vi ensured that these intermediates degraded almost completely to not harmful products i e op 258 and op 274 fig s14 ops of the hydroxylation of benzene ring i e pathway 2 fig 5 op 370 op 386a op 386b and op 402 have lower toxicity than pecdps to fish daphnia and green algae see figs 7c and 7d and fig s18 significantly most of these ops except op 402 were fully eliminated in presence of excess fe vi see fig s15 other minor ops were op 336 op 352a and op 352b pathway 3 fig 6 which also have lower toxicity than pecdps see figs 7e and 7f and fig s19 ops having toxicity are minor products of the oxidation of pecdps based on the peak areas figs s15 and s16 and may not contribute much to the overall toxicity of ops to these three aquatic organisms it should be pointed out that the acute toxicity herein is the baseline toxicity and other type of toxicity may be involved which may be investigated in future studies 4 conclusions complete degradation of pcdpss in water can be accomplished in a short time scale e g 240 s for pentachlorodisphenyl sulfide at ph 8 0 time scale for degrading pcdpss would vary with solution ph and fe vi dose removal studies suggest that pcdpss in surface water and rivers may be degraded using fe vi results presented herein clearly demonstrate that pcdpss undergo major oxidations at the s ii moiety by fe vi to finally yield oxidized products which have been evaluated to be not harmful to aquatic organisms some of the minor products which are relatively polar and toxic may require additional treatment for their removal after oxidation of pcdpss by fe vi organic sulfur compounds e g thiophenes are generally present in heavy oil that decreases the quality of fuel aromatic sulfur compounds e g thiols also contribute to the odor of the wastewater sludge removal of sulfur compounds in the present study imply that fe vi may also be applicable in cleaning fossil fuel and in eliminating sludge odor acknowledgments this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 21577063 21607073

zeng and combs 2008 sinkkonen et al 1993a 1993b pcdpss have been found in pulp mill effluents waste incinerator stack gas fly ashes from metal recycling plants and sediments of the elbe river sinkkonen et al 1993a 1993b schwarzbauer et al 2000 a recent study has also identified 19 pcdps congeners in surface water and sediment samples of the yangtze river china zhang et al 2014b pcdpss may have much higher bioaccumulation potentials than pcdes according to the multimedia modeling and they belong to the highest or intermediate priority pollutants mostrag et al 2010 pcdpss are hydrophobic and tend to bioaccumulate in lipids shi et al 2012 the presence of pcdpss could cause potential harmful effects to living organisms exposure to pcdpss affects the antioxidant defense system in female kunming mice and freshwater goldfish causing alterations in the levels of antioxidants zhang et al 2012 li et al 2012 the luciferase reporter gene lrg assay in avian species and the h4iie luc transactivation assay in mammals revealed that some pcdps congeners can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr mediated molecular toxicological pathways zhang et al 2014a 2016 thus it is of utmost importance to develop efficient technologies to treat pcdpss in water before their release into the aquatic environment however no treatment strategy to treat pcdpss in water has been proposed in

sharma 2018 most of the investigations have been conducted with an aim of seeking removal of these contaminants by fe vi without understanding the steps involved in oxidizing the compounds by fe vi among numerous sulfur containing contaminants no study on compounds containing both sulfur and chlorine atoms in the aromatic molecules has been done in the current paper we selected 17 pcdps compounds with the structures shown in table s1 to perform the kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of these molecules by fe vi we demonstrate for the first time that the oxidation by fe vi not only involves the oxygen atom transfer to sulfur but also the hydroxylation of aromatic ring and chlorine substitution of aromatic molecules by hydroxyl group objectives of the present paper are to i determine the kinetics of the reaction between fe vi and pcdpss to learn if numbers and positions of chlorine atoms on phenyl rings have any influence on the rate of the oxidation ii study the effect of constituents of water cation anions and organic matters on the degradation of pcdpss by fe vi to see potential of fe vi to remove selected contaminants the emerging class of persistent organosulfur

used as received 2 2 oxidation procedures the experiments were conducted in acetonitrile phosphate buffer 0 02 m mixed solution v v 50 50 the limited solubility of pcdpss necessitated the use of acetonitrile as a co solvent with water 1 1 acetonitrile not only ensured achieving micro molar concentrations of pcdpss for this study but it also validated it in a highly polar solvent environment since it has a dielectric constant of 37 5 which is amongst the closest to that of water 80 1 the ph of the solutions was adjusted using either h3po4 or naoh kinetic experiments were initiated by adding certain volume of fe vi stock solution to 30 ml of 20 0 μm pcdpss solution present in 100 ml brown glass bottles at room temperature initial concentrations of fe vi in mixed solution were 400 0

techniques see next section the procedure was similar to our previous approaches chen et al 2016 usually a variety of environmental factors such as inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter e g humic acid konstantinou and albanis 2004 are considerably common in wastewaters and also in natural water implying a non ignorable influence on 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps removal by fe vi in a removal study

pecdps and its oxidized products were evaluated using calculated data from the ecosar program ecosar 2014 prediction of contaminants is performed using correlation of available experimental toxicity with structure activity relationships sars burden et al 2016 literature has shown successful application of the program to predict aquatic toxicities to screen environmental contaminants jones et al 2002 gao et al 2014 in evaluating exposure risks to aquatic organisms three different trophic levels are included green algae daphnia and fish acute toxicity was expressed using ec50 values the contaminant concentration that inhibits green algae growth by 50 growth after 96 h and lc50 values the pollutant concentration that leads to the death of 50 fish and daphnia after 48 and 96 h exposures respectively classification of chronic and acute toxicity based on the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals van zelm et al 2010 is given in table s2 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics initially a value of k for the oxidation of pecdps by fe vi was determined at ph 8 0 results of concentration of pecdps and fe vi at different times were used to plot ln c c 0 versus fe vi t inset fig 1 in the plot c 0 and c t are the concentrations of pecdps at time zero and time t respectively a plot was linear and the slope of the line gave the values of k as 1 37 0 05 103 m 1 s 1 next values of k at different ph were determined and are shown in fig 1 rate constants k of the oxidation of pecdps by fe vi were somewhat similar in the ph range from 8 0 to 8 5 followed by decrease with further increase in ph to 9 5 the decrease in the values of k in alkaline medium is similar to many reported studies on the reactions between fe vi and pollutants feng et al 2017a lee et al 2009 sharma et al 2011 2015 this is related to the species of fe vi involved in the reaction water hfeo4 h feo4 2 pk a3 7 23 sharma et al 2001 to better understand the trend of k with ph seen in our study fig 1 a value of pk a3 in water acetonitrile 50 50 v v phosphate buffer were determined a similar approach used in our previous study was applied sharma et al 2001 a variation of molar absorptivity at 510 nm ε510 nm with ph is shown in fig s1 from this plot a value of pk a3 was estimated as 8 2 0 1 this value was used to fit the ph dependent values of k in fig 1 a solid line represents the fit that gave species specific rate constants as k hfeo4 pecdps 2 1 0 3 103 m 1 s 1 and k feo4 2 pecdps 1 0 0 1 102 m 1 s 1 the hfeo4 species has a higher ability to oxidize pollutants than the un protonated species feo4 2 the level of hfeo4 decreases with increase in ph see dashed line in fig 1 which causes the observed trend in the values of k as a function of ph in fig 1 next kinetics of the oxidation of a series of 17 pcdpss by fe vi ranging from dichlorodiphenyl sulfide to heptapchlorodiphenyl sulfide which were different in numbers and positions of chlorine atoms i e congeners were studied at ph 8 0 values of the evaluated k for these pcdpss are summarized in table s1 and are plotted as a function of chlorine atoms in fig 2 a the oxidation rates changed with the number of chlorine atoms of pcdpss fig 2a values of k increased with increase in chlorine atoms from 2 to 4 followed by decrease with increase in chlorine atoms to 6 or 7 the charges on different atoms present in the molecule of pcdpss i e sulfur atom carbon atoms to hydrogen atom and carbon atom to chlorine atom vary with the numbers of chlorine atoms results of fig 2a suggest that the relative rate of the attack of fe vi may be influenced by the chlorine atoms and their positions in the molecule a variation in the oxidation rates of different pcdpss may be understood by knowing their thermodynamic properties in solution the standard gibbs energy of formation δf g 0 of the pcdpss may represent their relative stability the thermodynamic properties of pcdpss including δf g 0 have been calculated for a wide range of congeners using dft calculations zeng et al 2008 these values of δf g 0 are summarized in table s1 congeners of pcdpss have shown a variation in the values of δf g 0 table s1 a plot of fig 2b showed a reasonable linear decrease in values of k with increase in δf g 0 r2 0 66 it seems that pcdpss with low δf g 0 values would be more likely to be susceptible to be attacked by fe vi it should be pointed out that a correlation as shown in fig 2b provides a general trend but many factors would determine the oxidation rates of pcdpss by fe vi these factors may include repulsion interactions between chlorine atoms and between cl and s atoms of pcdpss the interactions vary with number of chlorine atoms on the different positions and the number of relative position for these chlorine atoms of pcdpss 3 2 degradation a number of inorganic ions and natural organic matters are present in natural water and wastewater which may influence the degradation of target contaminant by fe vi tests were performed on effects of anions cl no3 and so4 2 cations ca2 and mg2 heavy metal ions fe3 and cu2 and humic acid ha on removal of pecdps at ph 8 0 experiments were performed at a molar ratio of 20 1 fe vi 0 pecdps 0 results of remaining pecdps as a function of time in the mixed solutions at two levels of ions 0 5 mm and 5 mm are shown in fig 3 a complete degradation or removal of pecdps without ions in solution was seen in 240 s no obvious effect of cl no3 and so4 2 on degrading pecdps by fe vi was found figs 3a and 3b however removal of pecdps was inhibited after additions of cations and heavy metal ions fig 3c f this inhibition increased with increased concentrations of the ions fig 3c versus fig 3d and fig 3e versus fig 3f removal of pecdps by fe vi in presence of 5 mm ions in 240 s is summarized in fig s2 the decrease in removal of pecdps was more pronounced in presence of heavy metal ions than inorganic cations in reaction mixture after adding 0 5 mm of fe3 cu2 ca2 and mg2 cations the degradation of pecdps decreased by 9 8 5 7 0 12 and 0 38 respectively compared to control i e no ions in solution fig s2 slight less removal of pecdps in presence of fe3 and cu2 ions may be related to the formation of complex between ions and pecdps which could not be easily reacted with fe vi this hypothesized complex formation may be through the s atom of the pecdps the decrease by fe3 was much more than that caused by cu2 in water fig s2 fe3 ions tend to form the stronger complex with sulfur atom of pecdps than cu2 it appears that the stronger complex is less reactive with fe vi compared to the weaker complex to result in less removal of pecdps by fe vi when fe3 was present in solution than cu2 fig s2 the effect of ha on the degradation efficiency of pecdps by fe vi was also studied results of experiments using three different levels of ha 1 0 5 0 and 15 0 mg l are presented in fig s3 the degradation rates of pecdps in 1 0 and 5 0 mg l ha were similar to that without ha in solution in presence of 15 mg l ha the degradation rate was decreased however at 240 s complete removal of pecdps was observed at all studied levels of ha in solution therefore there was no apparent effect of ha in solution on the removal of pecdps see fig s3 it seems that ha in solution was not competing significantly with pecdps to react fe vi to have any influence on the removal efficiency of fe vi in other words fe vi may be reacting faster with pecdps than ha in the mixed solution to give observed effects of ha in fig s3 3 3 identification of oxidized product ops the reaction solution of fe vi and pecdps at ph 8 0 was first subjected to analysis of ops at different reaction times 600 s by lc hrms method esi neg pos in addition analyses of some of the ops were also conducted using gc ms technique ei the product ion scans in the ms ms were performed to assign structures of these products 3 3 1 structural identification of the oxidized products of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps by lc ms figure s4 shows the total ion current tic chromatograms of the reaction solutions of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps by fe vi treatment at different times structural assignments of the ops were performed by the product ion scan based on the corresponding extracted ion chromatograms xic and ms ms spectra an approach used to identify ops is described below for op 336 and op 372 as the examples 3 3 1 1 op 336 lc ms neg at 21 22 min an ion cluster of m z 336 88 338 88 340 87 342 87 344 87 was detected with the chlorine isotope ratio of 75 4 100 0 50 6 12 1 3 suggesting the presence of four cl atoms in the compound op 336 as shown in fig s5a the fragment ions at m z 300 9043 and 264 9275 correspond to the sequential losses of two hcl another major fragment ion at m z 191 9200 corresponds to the individual loss of such fragment as c2cl3o thus op 336 was identified as c12h6cl4so with the structure shown in fig s5a 3 3 1 2 op 372 lc ms pos the chromatographic peak of op 372 was observed with a retention time of 15 36 min in the positive ion mode which provides a direct evidence for direct oxidation of sulfur atom of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps in the product ion spectra fig s5b the fragment ion peaks with m z 355 8487 320 8804 and 285 9122 indicated the sequential losses of o h cl and cl from the parent ion m z 372 8513 furthermore the fragment ions at m z 226 8842 and 192 9237 resulted from the cleavage of c s bonds from op 372 m z 372 8513 another two product ions at m z 210 8894 and 175 9212 corresponded to sequential losses of 16 and 35 da in m z 226 8842 respectively these were attributed to the losses of o and cl respectively similarly in view of isotope characteristic peaks the repeated ms ms fragments and proposed fragmentation patterns of the ops of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps the individual structures of op 258 op 274 op 352a and b op 370 op 386a and b and op 402 were proposed the detailed fragmentation pathways are shown in figs s6 s11 the data of products ions with low concentration were not shown 3 3 2 structural identification of the oxidized products of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps by gc ms figure s12 shows the gc ms results of 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps or pecdps solution after 2 min of fe vi oxidation the 2 2 3 4 5 pecdps peak was observed at 19 25 min fig s12a the mass spectrum of the gas phase intermediate is also shown fig s12b the ei mass spectrum indicates a penta chloro compound with base peak ions at m z 357 89 and 359 89 corresponding to the molecular ions m and m 2 presenting the characteristic chlorine signature the major fragment ions are m z 322 90 presumable loss of cl 287 92 loss of cl2 252 95 loss of cl3 176 00 loss of c6h3cl3 143 04 loss of c6h3cl3s 109 08 loss of c6h3cl4s and 74 08 loss of c6h3cl5s one of the main ops analyzed using gc ms technique was op 389 fig s13a shows that the peak of this op appeared at 20 50 min the mass spectrum of the gas phase intermediate 1 2 3 dichlorophenylsulfonyl 2 4 5 trichlorobenzene or op 389 is presented in fig s13b the base peak ions in this case are m z 389 98 and 391 95 corresponding to the molecular ions m and m 2 also presenting the chlorine signature the major fragmentation ion is m z 192 99 and it corresponds to the loss of c6h2ocl4 relating to the cleavage of s o and s c bonds subsequently the fragment ion at m z 145 01 results from the loss of thioether bond in m z 192 99 furthermore the fragment ions at m z 110 00 and 75 13 are formed after the loss of two chlorine atoms in m z 145 01 a summary of identified ops and their structures are presented in table s3 oxidative transformation of the pecdps m z 357 89 resulted in different products with m z values ranging from 258 8791 to 402 8332 these ops were assigned as op 258 op 274 op 336 op 352a op 352b op 370 op 386a op 386b op 389 and op 402 see table s3 the mass analysis of ops suggests the presence of sulfhydryl and hydroxyl groups in the transformation of pecdps by fe vi the low m z values of ops i e 258 8791 and 274 8742 indicate the cleavage of the c s bond in the parent molecule a substitution of cl atom from pecdps by hydroxyl group is also possible based on the product with m z of 336 8818 op 336 3 4 plausible mechanism 3 4 1 o atom transfer to sulfur ii op 372 is a biaryl sulfoxide type product which could be formed through the attack of fe vi on s ii of pecdps fig 4 shows a proposed mechanism of pathway 1 in which s ii acts an electron pair donor to the high valent fe vi via direct interaction with the ferrate oxygen atoms an effective oxygen transfer occurs as shown through the detailed mechanism of pathway 1 the sulfoxide can subsequently undergo a similar mechanism of oxidation leading to the sulfone op 389 step wise oxidation of pecdps to op 372 to op 389 was observed in the peak areas of these ops fig s14 initial 120 s of the reaction between fe vi and pecdps showed an increase in the yield of sulfoxide and sulfone containing ops after the complete degradation of pecdps in 120 s an excess of fe vi reacted to covert the sulfone group to sulfonic group via cleavage of the c s bond to yield op 258 it seems the hydrolysis step after cleavage may be taking place to yield sulfonic group containing op 258 the formation of op 274 was also observed as a result of the hydroxylation of the benzene ring of the op 258 both of the last two steps were evident from peak areas of op 258 and op 274 which were formed significantly after 120 s fig s14 3 4 2 oxidization of benzene ring pathway 2 presents the oxidation of the ring of pecdps by fe vi that describes the formation of op 370 op 386a op 386b and op 402 fig 5 fig s15 exhibits the increased peak areas of these ops with time up to 120 s after 120 s peak areas of these ops were decreased except op 402 fe vi attacks the ring of pecdps to form hydroxylated product op 370 pathway 2 shows the proposed mechanism for the fe vi oxidation of the aromatic ring the o of fe vi adds via a radical mechanism to the aromatic ring at the position ortho to the cl substituent this generates a cl stabilized aromatic radical and fe v a subsequent step possessing a higher rate abstracts the aromatic h via the other o radical to re aromatize the ring and reduce fe v to fe iv the aromatic o subsequently leaves the fe iv op 402 can form via oxidative pathway 1 occurring twice on op 370 further oxidation of op 370 may occur through two pathways to produce the products op 386a and op 386b an attack of fe vi on the sulfur moiety produces a sulfoxide group op 386a as described in pathway 1 similarly an oxidation of the sulfoxide group to the sulfone group forms op 402 via the same pathway 1 the hydroxylation of the ring of the op 370 by fe vi generates a di hydroxylated product op 386b via pathway 2 3 4 3 chlorine atom substitution by hydroxyl group op 336 shows the replacement of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group of the fe vi during the oxidation of pecdps fig 6 the hydroxyl group of fe vi could add to the aromatic ring leading to a sulfur stabilized radical after which a chlorine atom transfer can occur to the ferrate oxygen followed by water oxidation to hocl the selective oxidation of sulfur atom of op 336 resulted in sulfoxide containing product op 352a the hydroxylation of op 336 formed the di hydroxylation product op 352b significantly hydroxylation of generally deactivated benzene ring was observed in pathway 2 these hydroxylated products are minor and may be generated through intermediates iron v and iron iv when fe vi was reduced by pecdps this speculation is supported by observation of hydroxylation by the iron iv and iron v complexes in organic solvent cho et al 2016 nam et al 2014 oloo and que 2015 degradation of pecdps with concomitant growth of the peak areas of the products from pathway 3 was found fig s16 significantly the relative peak areas of ops in fig 6 compared to other ops of the oxidation of pecdps indicate that the products obtained from the substitution of chlorine atom were minor peak areas of fig s16 versus peak areas of fig s14 or s15 3 5 ecotoxicity evaluation finally the toxicity of ops obtained in pathways 1 3 see figs 4 6 was assessed using the ecosar program toxicity results are shown in table s4 fig 7 and figs s17 s19 the determined toxicity of pecdps is found in the category of very toxic i e 0 1 mg l to fish daphnia and algae comparatively evaluated toxicity of all ops is lower than the parent compound pecdps pathway 1 shows the major products of the oxidation of pedcps op 258 and op 274 fig 4 which are determined to be not harmful see figs 7a and 7b and fig s17 other intermediate products of the sulfur oxidation of pecdps op 372 and op 389 pathway 1 have lower toxicity than pecdps see figs 7a and 7b and fig s17 however excess of fe vi ensured that these intermediates degraded almost completely to not harmful products i e op 258 and op 274 fig s14 ops of the hydroxylation of benzene ring i e pathway 2 fig 5 op 370 op 386a op 386b and op 402 have lower toxicity than pecdps to fish daphnia and green algae see figs 7c and 7d and fig s18 significantly most of these ops except op 402 were fully eliminated in presence of excess fe vi see fig s15 other minor ops were op 336 op 352a and op 352b pathway 3 fig 6 which also have lower toxicity than pecdps see figs 7e and 7f and fig s19 ops having toxicity are minor products of the oxidation of pecdps based on the peak areas figs s15 and s16 and may not contribute much to the overall toxicity of ops to these three aquatic organisms it should be pointed out that the acute toxicity herein is the baseline toxicity and other type of toxicity may be involved which may be investigated in future studies 4 conclusions complete degradation of pcdpss in water can be accomplished in a short time scale e g 240 s for pentachlorodisphenyl sulfide at ph 8 0 time scale for degrading pcdpss would vary with solution ph and fe vi dose removal studies suggest that pcdpss in surface water and rivers may be degraded using fe vi results presented herein clearly demonstrate that pcdpss undergo major oxidations at the s ii moiety by fe vi to finally yield oxidized products which have been evaluated to be not harmful to aquatic organisms some of the minor products which are relatively polar and toxic may require additional treatment for their removal after oxidation of pcdpss by fe vi organic sulfur compounds e g thiophenes are generally present in heavy oil that decreases the quality of fuel aromatic sulfur compounds e g thiols also contribute to the odor of the wastewater sludge removal of sulfur compounds in the present study imply that fe vi may also be applicable in cleaning fossil fuel and in eliminating sludge odor acknowledgments this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 21577063 21607073
