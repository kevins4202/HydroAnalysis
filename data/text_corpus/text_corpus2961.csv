14805,the eutrophication and pharmaceutical residue are the key issues to the treatment of rural non point source pollution concerning risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health in this study a novel activated carbon zero valent iron calcium peroxide ac zvi cao2 catalytic system was constructed to remove simultaneously typical rural non point source pollutants phosphate and sulfamethazine smz the optimal mass ratio of the system was determined as 20 ac 48 zvi and 32 cao2 it was shown that the removal efficiency of phosphorus p and smz exceeded 65 and 40 in ph 2 11 respectively it worked well in the presence of typical anions and humic acid the mechanistic analyses for p removal indicated that ac zvi cao2 system can effectively load p by the formation of crystalline state ca p species and fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates under neutral and acidic conditions respectively the presence of ac in ac zvi cao2 system could form iron carbon micro electrolysis process for accelerating fenton reaction in acidic environment and ac also can produce reactive oxygen species for the smz degradation by relying on persistent free radicals graphitic carbon catalysis under environmental condition in addition we developed a low impact development stormwater filter for application feasibility verification of the system feasibility analysis showed that the system could save up to 50 cost in contrast with the price of phoslock a commercial p load product and presented advantages of non toxicity long acting stability and the potential to promote biodegradation by provision of aerobic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rural non point source pollution phosphate sulfamethazine heterogeneous catalytic system low impact development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the eutrophication and pharmaceutical residue as the typical water quality problems caused by rural non point source pollution can contribute to greatly declining aquatic ecosystem and potentially endanger the health of rural residents sun et al 2018 zou et al 2020 in aquatic environments phosphate the only type of phosphorus that can be absorbed by algae and bacteria can induce eutrophication even in the micrograms liter range so that get more attention park et al 2016 suresh kumar et al 2018 meanwhile as one type of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water environments sulfonamide antibiotics not only lead to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance genes but also cause potential toxicity to living organisms even at low concentrations sun et al 2018 it has been reported that p and antibiotics are ubiquitous and they always coexist with each other yang et al 2022 thus the simultaneous removal of p and sulfonamides are of great concern for the ecological safety of the rural water environment however little research has been concentrated on the removal of phosphate and sulfonamides synchronously especially without information about the removal mechanism and further application compared with the traditional fenton technologies fenton like technology exhibit wider application range milder reaction conditions cheaper cost and lower cycle time jiang et al 2022 the zero valent iron zvi coupled with calcium peroxide cao2 as an advanced fenton like technology that shows significant advantages e g non toxicity easy availability and inexpensive has been widely used in treating water contaminated by organics hou et al 2022 meanwhile the zvi cao2 not only promotes iron circulation but also prevents disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide comparing with the traditional fenton like technology chen et al 2021 hou et al 2022 notably the ph value of rural wastewater is usually close to 7 which is adverse to degradation of sulfonamides by fenton reaction zhou et al 2017 albeit several studies have reported that chelating agents can combine with the iron ions to broaden the working ph range in fenton process the complexing agents addition lead to reduce phosphate removal efficiency and increase iron concentration in water which can further result in eutrophication and iron contaminant ping et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 activated carbon ac and biochar have similar properties and have been proven as promising alternative sorbent to absorb various pollutants in wastewater treatment fang et al 2014 besides adsorption capacity ac and biochar have been reported that can catalyze and generate radical nonradical reactive species to degrade pharmaceuticals under neutral conditions fang et al 2014 meanwhile carbon can accelerate the formation of fe2 by contacting with iron to form microscopic galvanic cells under acidic conditions which can strengthen fenton degradation liu et al 2022 studies have shown that ac has higher catalytic performance than biochar because of the high sorption and dominance of radicals in solid phase of ac liang et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 for these reasons we envision that the presence of ac could improve the adaptability of the system to different environmental conditions and enhances the pollutants removal performance so that establish a novel heterogeneous catalytic system for environmental application in this research the detailed objectives were to 1 test the p and sulfamethazine smz simultaneous removal performance of ac zvi cao2 system in different conditions 2 investigate the p and smz possible removal mechanism of this system at various ph values 3 build a low impact development stormwater filter for the feasibility verification of system application and 4 evaluate the cost effectiveness and environmental implications of the ac zvi cao2 system this study can provide a new idea on rural non point source pollution treatment for stakeholders and policymakers 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials all chemicals and reagents used as received

one way analysis of variance conducted by the least significant difference test n 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination optimized mass ratio under neutral and acidic conditions the mass ratio of zvi cao2 from 3 1 to 1 3 was tested to find out the optimal mass ratio for the smz and p removal according to fig 1 a removal efficiencies of smz and p in all proportions ac zvi cao2 system are greater than 40 under neutral conditions the removal efficiency of p increased with the increasing cao2 proportion which has similar trend behavior with the final ph value in the solution the fluctuation of the final solution ph value was possibly due to the buffering effect of p wang et al 2021 as the zvi cao2 mass radio decreased to 1 2 the p removal reached the highest value 99 4 the smz removal efficiency peaked at 71 2 for the ratio of 3 2 but when the zvi cao2 radio exceeded 3 2 the removal performance of the ac zvi cao2 system on smz decreased slightly in comparison as shown in fig 1b the removal efficiency of smz and p in the ac zvi cao2 system was greatly improved more than 70 under acidic conditions this is mainly because under acidic conditions zvi was rapidly converted to fe2 by fe c micro electrolysis and then fenton reaction was triggered with h2o2 produced by cao2 to degrade smz hou et al 2022 meanwhile the releasing fe2 fe3 from zvi could be combined with the p for p removal in solution by formation of fe p species sun et al 2021 with the decrease of zvi ratio the performance of smz removal declined it should be noted that the smz and p were almost completely removed by the ac zvi cao2 system when zvi cao2 ratio was 3 1 or 3 2 meanwhile in the preliminary experiments fig s7 we determined the optimal percent of ac was 20 considering the removal efficiency of p smz thereby from the perspective of cost and efficiency the optimal ratio of ac zvi and cao2 were independently 20 48 and 32 and used throughout the research 3 2 kinetics analysis the performance of the smz p removal in ac zvi cao2 system and zvi cao2 system as a dynamic of time were evaluated fig 2 a showed that the addition of ac can signally enhance the zvi cao2 system on smz removal the total fe concentrations in solution of all the reaction system were tested as shown in fig s1 and found that at low ph values the higher total fe concentration was observed in ac zvi cao2 system than zvi cao2 system at the same stage which further confirmed the occurrence of fe c micro electrolysis under neutral ph the total fe concentration was no detected in all samples meanwhile there is no significant changes in fe 2p spectra under neutral conditions fig 5b which means that heterogeneous fenton reaction produced by interfacial iron cycling can be ignored it is further confirmed that under neutral conditions adsorption and catalytic capacity of ac were the main mechanisms in smz removal rather than the fenton degradation shown in fig 2b the kinetics data of smz removal are well fitted by the pseudo first order reaction model within the first 5 min the reaction kinetic rate 3 89 10 1 min of smz in ac zvi cao2 system is nearly twice of that in zvi cao2 system 2 06 10 1 min indicating the high efficiency synergic effects from ac zvi cao2 system after 5 min of reaction the smz removal performance in ac zvi cao2 system increased slowly and lower than zvi cao2 system the difference could be explained that at low ph values the smz in solution be degraded by fenton reaction to form concentration gradient reversal resulting in continuous desorption of smz on ac aschermann et al 2018 in fig 2c different from the changes in smz removal the addition of ac had no significant effect on p removal under either neutral or acidic conditions this implies that although ac can remove a small amount of p by adsorption the main mechanism of p removal is the formation of ca p and or fe p species in ac zvi cao2 system combined with fig 2a c indicates that 24 h is deemed sufficient to reach the obvious equilibrium minimum residual for smz and p therefore a reaction time of 24 h was chosen for the following effect study of reaction conditions table s2 lists the models of the pseudo first order adsorption kinetic and the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic were used to describe for p removal results indicate that the correlation coefficients r2 of the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic fitting 0 99 r2 1 00 were significantly higher than that of the pseudo first order adsorption kinetic fitting 0 07 r2 0 89 suggesting chemisorption as the main adsorption process of p by ac zvi cao2 lin et al 2017 comparing of the system pseudo 2nd kinetics model data in fig 2d ac showed a negligible effect on the rate constant k2 from 3 05 g mg 1 h 1 to 3 08 g mg 1 h 1 under initial ph 7 but markedly increased k2 form 24 08 g mg 1 h 1 to 49 00 g mg 1 h 1 at the acidic solution these results indicate that ac could accelerate the p removal by promoting the formation of fe p precipitation through fe c micro electrolysis process under favorable conditions more important than its adsorption capacity 3 3 effect of reaction conditions the influence of various initial smz p concentrations 5 mg l to 80 mg l on the removal performance of smz and p in ac zvi cao2 system was showed in fig 3 a when the initial reaction ph is neutral the removal efficiency of smz decreased from 78 5 to 41 5 with the initial concentration increasing of this parameter in principle the same ac zvi cao2 system has a fixed adsorption site for smz adsorption however when the initial concentration of smz increased from 10 mg l to 15 mg l the smz removal efficiency increased from 67 5 to 68 3 this can be explained that the ac may activate h2o2 released from cao2 and generate radical nonradical reactive species to remove smz under a neutral environment except for adsorption sun et al 2018 commonly the fenton like reaction can be triggered to yield ros through a series of corrosion reactions and thus degrade smz effectively under acidic environment hou et al 2022 some degradation by products were generated increasingly data not shown with the increasing of smz initial concentration even with effective smz removal all above 98 1 by the fenton like degradation capacity of the ac zvi cao2 system under acidic environment this is due to the consumption of ros by excessive smz 20 mg l and the ros generated in the limited ac zvi cao2 system are insufficient for complete degradation of the by products the removal efficiency of p in the ac zvi cao2 system was relatively high 60 regardless of the initial concentration 5 mg l and 30 mg l fig 3a still there was a decline in p removal rate at higher p concentrations due to the shortage of cao2 neutral conditions and zvi cao2 acidic conditions the evidence is given in section 3 4 the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were introduced for evaluating p removal ability of the ac zvi cao2 system by fitting the experimental data fig 3b results showed that the p adsorption capacities of the ac zvi cao2 system enhanced with the increase of initial p concentration but the increase gradually flattened out under acidic conditions p adsorption capacities are more suitable for the langmuir model r2 0 995 than the freundlich model r2 0 829 indicating the process is primarily a surface monolayer chemical sorption feng et al 2022a the separation factor rl values were calculated by langmuir model to evaluate whether the p adsorption process is favorable or not palansooriya et al 2021 the values of rl 1 in the langmuir model demonstrated that p adsorption was beneficial at acidic ph fig s2 meanwhile the maximum sorption capacity of the ac zvi cao2 system for p was calculated at 67 1 mg g 1 langmuir model fitting under the initial ph 2 higher than that of phoslock a commercial p load product at 9 0 mg g 1 xu et al 2017 unlike in acidic conditions the freundlich isotherm can better fit the p adsorption process at initial ph 7 0 meaning that the p sorption process is heterogeneous and the p binds preferentially with the stronger active sites ca2 in the ac zvi cao2 system liu et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 the n value was 51 02 for the ac zvi cao2 system demonstrating the system was also beneficial for p adsorption at neutral conditions wang et al 2022 in general solution ph plays an important role in processes including adsorption precipitation and degradation for zvi based wastewater treatment chen et al 2021 therefore the influence of initial ph from 1 to 11 on the smz p removal was experimentally studied fig 3c and the variation in solution ph was measured after 24 h reaction to be specific the removal efficiency of smz and p peaked both 100 at initial ph 2 except for extremely acidic conditions ph 1 the smz p removal rates were all higher than 40 at a wider ph range 2 11 in ac zvi cao2 system at relatively low solution ph 1 the solution ph value only raised to 1 1 after 24 h but the formation of the iron hydr oxides such as fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 need to be higher ph 5 85 and 2 00 respectively hence the p removal rate was particularly low 0 99 gang et al 2019 hou et al 2022 meanwhile the removal efficiency of smz at initial ph 1 was slightly lower than that of ph 2 since the ros such as oh consumption by excessive h koppenol and liebman 1984 on the other hand the smz removal process was controlled by fenton like degradation and transformed to ac adsorption and catalytic degradation controlling on account of the decreasing of the fe2 fe3 release as the initial ph increased so that the smz removal efficiency reduced to 44 4 at initial ph 11 hou et al 2022 different from smz the p removal efficiency first decreased and then increased gradually during ph 2 11 the first decrease is due to the lack of zvi dissolution thus difficult to remove p by forming fe p precipitate sun et al 2021 previous studies showed that the phosphate was mainly as h2po4 for 2 12 ph 7 21 and hpo4 2 for 7 21 ph 12 31 huang et al 2017 with initial ph above 3 oh can promote ca2 to form hydroxyapatite precipitates ca5 po4 3oh thus in ac zvi cao2 system the p removal efficiency gradually increased with the ph feng et al 2022a the water environment widely contains nom and co existing anions which may lead to poor smz p removal performance through free radical inhibition and adsorption sites competition wan et al 2020 accordingly typical nom humic acid and anions no3 so4 2 cl and co3 2 concentrations in the river were chosen to investigate their influence on smz p removal efficiency in ac zvi cao2 system fig 3d results showed that in acidic conditions the co existing anions had limited influence p 0 1 on the smz p removal performance which likely because of the sufficient ros and binding sites for removal of smz p however for neutral conditions nom significantly enhanced the removal performance of p p 0 05 this might be because the addition of nom can promote the ca p sorption capacity by delaying the formation of ca p precipitates ge et al 2020 perassi and borgnino 2014 despite the presence of nom on the smz removal having a negative influence the ac zvi cao2 system can still remove smz more than 40 which indicated high potential application value of the ac zvi cao2 system in the actual environment 3 4 mechanistic insights for p removal the esem eds images were introduced to observe changes in morphologies and surface elemental distributions of ac zvi cao2 system fig 4 compared with the initial the ac zvi cao2 system after reaction exhibits bigger particle sizes and rougher surface it indicated that p was absorbed effectivity on the surface of ac zvi cao2 content of p on ac zvi cao2 after reaction was higher 4 0wt than that of initial 0 7wt also identified the successful load of p on the material surface further compared with the distributions of ca and fe the distribution of p is highly coincident with that of ca at ph 7 which is distinct with the relatively even distribution of p on material surface at ph 2 it suggested that cao2 was the main contributor for p removal under neutral conditions while zvi and cao2 mainly contributed under acidic conditions to further investigate the mechanisms of p removal by ac zvi cao2 system changes in ca 2p fe 2p and p 2p particles were analyzed by high resolution xps spectra and shown in figs 5 a b and fig s3 the ca 2p spectra fig 5a showed that peak shifts from 346 5 ev to 347 1 ev ph7 and 346 8 ev ph2 respectively were observed after reaction compared with initial ac zvi cao2 materials the peaks shifts could be attributed to the formation of ca p species peaks at around 347 4 ev on the surface chen et al 2022 after p removed in ac zvi cao2 system fe 2p spectra fig 5b only showed new peaks at 710 7 ev and 724 8 ev under acidic condition which represents the generating of fe p species only occurred under acidic environment wan et al 2020 according to the comparison p 2p spectra fig s3 the new p 2p characteristic peaks were observed at 132 35 ev and 132 82 ev at ph 2 independently corresponds to fe p species and ca p species which quoted from nist x ray photoelectron spectroscopy database for neutral conditions only ca p characteristic peak was detected at 132 82 ev which was consistent with the fe 2p spectra results in addition the atomic concentration of p 2p increased form 1 41 raw materials to 4 91 ph7 ac zvi cao2 and 3 94 ph2 ac zvi cao2 which is consistent with eds results and further indicating that the p successfully removed form solution and loaded on the ac zvi cao2 by ca p and or fe p precipitation the ftir spectra results fig 5c showed that the bonds at 500 cm 1 620 cm 1 875 cm 1 and 1053 cm 1 1059 cm 1 were ascribed to stretching vibration of p species and transmission intensities decrease significantly after reaction which further confirmed the formation of p species zhang et al 2020 xrd spectra of changed materials before and after different reactions were analyzed for the possible fe p ca p species as seen in fig 5d the major peaks of raw ac zvi cao2 were conformed to the peak positions of fe pdf 06 0696 and cao2 pdf 03 0865 under neutral condition the peaks of ca5 po4 3 oh pdf 09 0423 appeared in xrd spectra in addition to the peaks of fe and cao2 which indicated the ca5 po4 3 oh may be the major ca p species however when there is acidic environment xrd spectra shown a wide amorphous peak in the 20 30 range and no distinctive p species xrd diffraction peaks meaning the high dispersion of p species and formation of fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates as major p species li et al 2019 above results showed that the main processes of p removal in the ac zvi cao2 system were achieved by the formation of crystalline state ca p species and fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates under neutral and acidic conditions respectively 3 5 mechanistic insights for smz removal early studies have suggested that ferryl ion feiv which can be generated from the fenton like reaction by eq 1 is capable of emerging organic contaminants e g smz degradation yin et al 2021 to identify whether the contribution of feiv was involved in the smz degradation methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso which can only be oxidized to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by feiv but cannot be formed through ros oxidation was selected as the chemical probe chen et al 2021 as shown in fig 6 a when the reaction proceeds for 24 h the residual concentration of pmso is 0 0 mm and 0 92 mm at initial ph 2 0 and 7 0 in the ac zvi cao2 system and both have no formation of pmso2 it suggests that irrespective of acidic condition or neutral condition feiv was hardly formed in the ac zvi cao2 system and its effect on smz degradation is negligible 1 fe2 h2o2 feivo2 h2o to probe the roles of ros which form through fenton like reaction or ac catalysis in smz degradation several radical scavenging experiments were carried out in the acidic and non acidic ac zvi cao2 system l histidine p benzoquinone p bq and furfuryl alcohol ffa 99 were selected as the quenching agent to certify oh o2 and 1o2 respectively kl histidine oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k p bq o 2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 and kffa 1 o2 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 chen et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 as shown in figs 6b c the presence of l histidine 3 mm and ffa 10 mm lead to the smz removal efficiencies of the ac zvi cao2 system reduced from 44 4 to 42 6 and 37 6 in the initial ph 7 and from 100 to 87 9 and 50 6 in initial ph 2 respectively this was likely to imply the oh and 1o2 as the crucial ros for smz degradation in the ac zvi cao2 system it should be pointed out that although the l histidine and ffa were often independently chosen as the classic scavenger for oh and 1o2 which are also highly reactive with 1o2 kl histidine 1 o2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 and oh kffa oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively chen et al 2021 li et al 2022 to further identify whether oh and 1o2 accounted for smz degradation dmpo and temp were used as a trapping agent of oh and 1o2 respectively as illustrated in fig 6d a distinct characteristic 1 2 2 1 quadruple signal of dmpo oh was recorded under acidic environment in the ac zvi cao2 system while in neutral solution the inapparent dmpo oh quadruple signal and relatively obvious dmpo ch3 six line spectrum 1 1 1 1 1 1 were obtained liu et al 2015 the signal of dmpo ch3 should be derived from the decomposition products of dmpo by oxidization of oh yoshioka et al 2001 these results can verify the formation of oh in the ac zvi cao2 system and the positive contribution of oh in smz degradation meanwhile fig 6f demonstrated that obvious triplet peaks of temp 1o2 relative intensities of 1 1 1 occur in the ac zvi cao2 system under both acidic and non acidic conditions in addition the comparison of fig 5b c showed that the quenching effect of ffa 49 4 and 6 8 under acidic and neutral condition respectively was more effective than of l histidine 12 1 and 1 8 hence it was rational to conclude that 1o2 was also partially involved in smz degradation the addition of p bq 1 mm demonstrates that a little beneficial effect on smz degradation in the ac zvi cao2 system figs 6b c different to the reported result of slight inhibition chen et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 theoretically the o2 was difficult to degrade smz as a result of relatively low redox potential e0 o2 0 33 v wu et al 2021 electron paramagnetic resonance spectra illustrated that an evident signal of dmpo o2 was obtained at acidic ph in fig 6e which verifies the formation and negligible influence of o2 on the smz degradation it is well known that the ac has abundant persistent free radicals pfrs which be formed by the pyrolysis of its own organic compounds e g quinones and can excellent activate h2o2 to generate ros for smz degradation fang et al 2014 feng et al 2022b luo et al 2021 additionally some studies have shown that semiquinone type free radical produced by p bq can induce peroxides and facilitate the formation of the highly reactive species e g ros for pollutant removal gu et al 2022 zhu et al 2007 the above results can explain the promotion effect of the addition of p bq 1 mm on smz degradation and the possible mechanism of ac catalysis in the ac zvi cao2 system epr spectra of d dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 adducts e dmpo o2 adduct and f temp 1o2 adducts experimental conditions smz 20 mg l ac loading 0 16 g l zvi 0 38 mg l cao2 0 26 mg l some studies reported that the ac could activate h2o2 effectively to generate ros due to including the pfrs and the graphitic carbon fang et al 2014 feng et al 2022b to further determine the catalytic mechanism of ac the species states of c on ac zvi cao2 system were observed before and after reaction by analyzing c 1 s spectra fig 7 a the peaks of c 1 s located at 283 5 284 0 284 6 285 6 and 288 4 ev are assigned to graphitic c amorphous c c oh c o and o c oh respectively feng et al 2022b the c o content of ac has been considered as an indicator of the activation capability by ac pfrs luo et al 2021 consequently the c o content of materials decreased from 19 4 raw state to 19 0 ph 7 and 16 1 ph 2 indicating pfrs of ac may react with h2o2 and involve in smz degradation luo et al 2021 meanwhile the graphitic c proportion reduced significantly from 23 6 to 18 8 under neutral conditions which represents the graphitic c was also involved in catalytic degradation and was damaged during reaction feng et al 2022b this significant decrease is different from the change under acidic conditions probably because the dominated role of smz degradation was ac catalysis instead of fenton reaction under non acidic conditions the degree of ac graphitization was further identified by raman spectra as shown in fig 7b the bands of d and g represented disorder c peak around 1350 cm 1 and graphitic c peak around 1590 cm 1 respectively in general the graphitization degree can be reflected by the intensity ratio of d and g id ig feng et al 2022b raman spectra results indicated that the graphitization degree of the materials decreased after the reaction which was consistent with the variation trend of c1s results the above results indicated that the ros oh and 1o2 as the main contributor to smz degradation were generated through fenton like reaction major process under acidic conditions and the ac catalysis major process under neutral conditions notably the quenching agent cannot completely consume ros produced by solid liquid reactions in this study because they are not fully available in the solution chen et al 2021 it indicates that the role of absorption for smz removal in the ac zvi cao2 system needs to be further discussed the positive effect of absorption for smz removal can be confirmed by two things 1 an accidental increase of smz concentration through desorption was observed in kinetic experiments fig 2a 2 s element possible from smz was detected on the surface of the material after the reaction fig 4 previous studies have shown that the co existence of smz showed no significant influence on p removal yang et al 2022 meanwhile it is found that the co existence of p can enhance the smz removal performance of the system by comparing smz removal kinetics in figs 2 and 5 a similar reinforcing effect was also reported by yang et al 2022 and zhu et al 2020 possibly contributed to the bridging effect and the change of surface charges additionally p as a weak acid may also facilitate the smz removal by buffering the ph of solution because the ph is an important influencing factor fig 3c the transformation products tps of smz in the ac zvi cao2 system were recorded by hplc ms and their possible structure information and mass spectra were given in table s3 and fig s4 due to the attack of ros oh and 1o2 the main degradation pathways of smz were s n bond cleavage tp 1 so2 extrusion tp 2 hydroxylation tp 3 and nh extrusion tp 5 jin et al 2022 these tps can further be degraded through c n bond cleavage demethylation hydroxylation and other degradation processes to generate other tps jin et al 2022 ultimately all the above products will be reacted to form some inorganic compounds such as co2 and h2o with further oxidation so that achieve the mineralization 3 6 feasibility of practice application stormwater filter as a sustainable low impact development system has been increasingly treated to contaminant in agricultural and urban non point runoff berger et al 2019 in order to further prove the practicability of the ac zvi cao2 system for p and smz removal batch column experiments shown in fig s5 were proceeded to simulate stormwater filters using real stormwater collected from nan jing in china as shown in fig s6 the p concentration of effluent from all the ac zvi cao2 system columns 5 10 and 20 remained consistent at 0 00 mg l during the experimental period 60 days different from pure quartz sand columns the effluent smz concentration of 5 system columns increased from time 0 00 mg l day 32 to 0 31 mg l day 60 due to the decline of ac catalytic capacity however the antibiotics concentrations of the waste water in most countries were at low μg l levels which were far below the setting concentration 2 mg l of the column experiment shimizu et al 2013 thus we assumed that the ac zvi cao2 system could support continuously stable operation throughout longer time span additionally dissolved oxygen do values increased with increases in ac zvi cao2 materials table s4 it has been shown that higher do values can facilitate the formation of aerobic microorganisms and promote antibiotic removal which indicates that do generation from cao2 might be able to accelerate the generation of biological communities and further extend the stable operation effect of the system wu et al 2022 therefore we will explore the relationship between the system and biodegradation in future studies in real practice an important consideration is the product cost which mainly involved the raw material consumption and processing charges including energy consumption and so on according to the unit prices of industrial grade products quoted from alibaba com the prices of ac zvi and cao2 70 were 285 200 and 855 usd ton respectively the processing charges was 243 usd ton made an inquiry from cooperative corporation nanjing nuowo environmental technology co ltd hence the cost of this product 50 functional materials as well as considering the material processing was 13 5 usd kg p which may save up to 50 cost in contrast with the price of phoslock 27 9 usd kg p xu et al 2017 the cost information of different reagents and methods are listed in table s6 additionally nontoxicity is another significant advantage of the ac zvi cao2 system in comparison to phoslock which has been demonstrated toxic to aquatic species by releasing of la3 xu et al 2017 nevertheless for iron based materials the who standard limit for maximum total iron concentration in drinking water is 0 3 mg l to prevent iron contamination chen et al 2021 therefore the total iron concentrations of the effluent from the various proportion 5 20 ac zvi cao2 system column experiments were continuously monitored during the experiment table s5 in order to determine whether the potential iron contamination exists in the system the column experiment results show that the total iron of all systems was no detected throughout the experiment indicating the reliable security of ac zvi cao2 system meanwhile previous studies have indicated that the nom which is widespread in natural water bodies will weaken the p removal of phoslock zhi et al 2021 for ac zvi cao2 system it can remove p effectively even in presence of nom fig 3d and has the capability in removing other residual contaminants such as smz to sum up the ac zvi cao2 system has a great utilization potentiality in the field of water treatment and further pilot studies are needed to assess its real effects on environmental responses considering the long term practical application 4 conclusion this study presents a novel heterogeneous catalytic system ac zvi cao2 for simultaneous removal of phosphate and sulfamethazine from aquatic systems in a wide ph application range of 2 to 11 the removal efficiencies of p and smz achieved beyond 65 and 40 using optimal mass ratio 20 ac 48 zvi and 32 cao2 respectively and were barely affected by the real wastewater matrix an investigation of mechanism for p removal demonstrated that the formation of crystalline state ca p species e g ca5 po4 3 oh and the fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates were major responsible for promoting of p removal in neutral and acidic solution respectively based on the results of reactive species identification and materials characterization it was confirmed that the ros oh and 1o2 through pfrs graphitic c catalysis and or fenton reaction of fe c micro electrolysis accelerating were main contributors for the smz degradation in the ac zvi cao2 system in addition the results of the low impact development application showed that the ac zvi cao2 system is considered to include low cost safe easy to obtain and stable to operate advantages after 60 days consecutive running the removal efficiencies of p smz were still close to 100 it can be a promising new strategy and provide a new idea on rural non point source pollution treatment for stakeholders and policymakers credit authorship contribution statement lei chen

14805,the eutrophication and pharmaceutical residue are the key issues to the treatment of rural non point source pollution concerning risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health in this study a novel activated carbon zero valent iron calcium peroxide ac zvi cao2 catalytic system was constructed to remove simultaneously typical rural non point source pollutants phosphate and sulfamethazine smz the optimal mass ratio of the system was determined as 20 ac 48 zvi and 32 cao2 it was shown that the removal efficiency of phosphorus p and smz exceeded 65 and 40 in ph 2 11 respectively it worked well in the presence of typical anions and humic acid the mechanistic analyses for p removal indicated that ac zvi cao2 system can effectively load p by the formation of crystalline state ca p species and fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates under neutral and acidic conditions respectively the presence of ac in ac zvi cao2 system could form iron carbon micro electrolysis process for accelerating fenton reaction in acidic environment and ac also can produce reactive oxygen species for the smz degradation by relying on persistent free radicals graphitic carbon catalysis under environmental condition in addition we developed a low impact development stormwater filter for application feasibility verification of the system feasibility analysis showed that the system could save up to 50 cost in contrast with the price of phoslock a commercial p load product and presented advantages of non toxicity long acting stability and the potential to promote biodegradation by provision of aerobic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rural non point source pollution phosphate sulfamethazine heterogeneous catalytic system low impact development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the eutrophication and pharmaceutical residue as the typical water quality problems caused by rural non point source pollution can contribute to greatly declining aquatic ecosystem and potentially endanger the health of rural residents sun et al 2018 zou et al 2020 in aquatic environments phosphate the only type of phosphorus that can be absorbed by algae and bacteria can induce eutrophication even in the micrograms liter range so that get more attention park et al 2016 suresh kumar et al 2018 meanwhile as one type of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in water environments sulfonamide antibiotics not only lead to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance genes but also cause potential toxicity to living organisms even at low concentrations sun et al 2018 it has been reported that p and antibiotics are ubiquitous and they always coexist with each other yang et al 2022 thus the simultaneous removal of p and sulfonamides are of great concern for the ecological safety of the rural water environment however little research has been concentrated on the removal of phosphate and sulfonamides synchronously especially without information about the removal mechanism and further application compared with the traditional fenton technologies fenton like technology exhibit wider application range milder reaction conditions cheaper cost and lower cycle time jiang et al 2022 the zero valent iron zvi coupled with calcium peroxide cao2 as an advanced fenton like technology that shows significant advantages e g non toxicity easy availability and inexpensive has been widely used in treating water contaminated by organics hou et al 2022 meanwhile the zvi cao2 not only promotes iron circulation but also prevents disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide comparing with the traditional fenton like technology chen et al 2021 hou et al 2022 notably the ph value of rural wastewater is usually close to 7 which is adverse to degradation of sulfonamides by fenton reaction zhou et al 2017 albeit several studies have reported that chelating agents can combine with the iron ions to broaden the working ph range in fenton process the complexing agents addition lead to reduce phosphate removal efficiency and increase iron concentration in water which can further result in eutrophication and iron contaminant ping et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 activated carbon ac and biochar have similar properties and have been proven as promising alternative sorbent to absorb various pollutants in wastewater treatment fang et al 2014 besides adsorption capacity ac and biochar have been reported that can catalyze and generate radical nonradical reactive species to degrade pharmaceuticals under neutral conditions fang et al 2014 meanwhile carbon can accelerate the formation of fe2 by contacting with iron to form microscopic galvanic cells under acidic conditions which can strengthen fenton degradation liu et al 2022 studies have shown that ac has higher catalytic performance than biochar because of the high sorption and dominance of radicals in solid phase of ac liang et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 for these reasons we envision that the presence of ac could improve the adaptability of the system to different environmental conditions and enhances the pollutants removal performance so that establish a novel heterogeneous catalytic system for environmental application in this research the detailed objectives were to 1 test the p and sulfamethazine smz simultaneous removal performance of ac zvi cao2 system in different conditions 2 investigate the p and smz possible removal mechanism of this system at various ph values 3 build a low impact development stormwater filter for the feasibility verification of system application and 4 evaluate the cost effectiveness and environmental implications of the ac zvi cao2 system this study can provide a new idea on rural non point source pollution treatment for stakeholders and policymakers 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials all chemicals and reagents used as received

esem eds xrd xps ftir and raman spectrum methods could be found in s5 of si 2 4 statistical analysis the spss 27 0 program was applied to identify significant differences among treatments through a one way analysis of variance conducted by the least significant difference test n 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination optimized mass ratio under neutral and acidic conditions the mass ratio of zvi cao2 from 3 1 to 1 3 was tested to find out the optimal mass ratio for the smz and p removal according to fig 1 a removal efficiencies of smz and p in all proportions ac zvi cao2 system are greater than 40 under neutral conditions the removal efficiency of p increased with the increasing cao2 proportion which has similar trend behavior with the final ph value in the solution the fluctuation of the final solution ph value was possibly due to the buffering effect of p wang et al 2021 as the zvi cao2 mass radio decreased to 1 2 the p removal reached the highest value 99 4 the smz removal efficiency peaked at 71 2 for the ratio of 3 2 but when the zvi cao2 radio exceeded 3 2 the removal performance of the ac zvi cao2 system on smz decreased slightly in comparison as shown in fig 1b the removal efficiency of smz and p in the ac zvi cao2 system was greatly improved more than 70 under acidic conditions this is mainly because under acidic conditions zvi was rapidly converted to fe2 by fe c micro electrolysis and then fenton reaction was triggered with h2o2 produced by cao2 to degrade smz hou et al 2022 meanwhile the releasing fe2 fe3 from zvi could be combined with the p for p removal in solution by formation of fe p species sun et al 2021 with the decrease of zvi ratio the performance of smz removal declined it should be noted that the smz and p were almost completely removed by the ac zvi cao2 system when zvi cao2 ratio was 3 1 or 3 2 meanwhile in the preliminary experiments fig s7 we determined the optimal percent of ac was 20 considering the removal efficiency of p smz thereby from the perspective of cost and efficiency the optimal ratio of ac zvi and cao2 were independently 20 48 and 32 and used throughout the research 3 2 kinetics analysis the performance of the smz p removal in ac zvi cao2 system and zvi cao2 system as a dynamic of time were evaluated fig 2 a showed that the addition of ac can signally enhance the zvi cao2 system on smz removal the total fe concentrations in solution of all the reaction system were tested as shown in fig s1 and found that at low ph values the higher total fe concentration was observed in ac zvi cao2 system than zvi cao2 system at the same stage which further confirmed the occurrence of fe c micro electrolysis under neutral ph the total fe concentration was no detected in all samples meanwhile there is no significant changes in fe 2p spectra under neutral conditions fig 5b which means that heterogeneous fenton reaction produced by interfacial iron cycling can be ignored it is further confirmed that under neutral conditions adsorption and catalytic capacity of ac were the main mechanisms in smz removal rather than the fenton degradation shown in fig 2b the kinetics data of smz removal are well fitted by the pseudo first order reaction model within the first 5 min the reaction kinetic rate 3 89 10 1 min of smz in ac zvi cao2 system is nearly twice of that in zvi cao2 system 2 06 10 1 min indicating the high efficiency synergic effects from ac zvi cao2 system after 5 min of reaction the smz removal performance in ac zvi cao2 system increased slowly and lower than zvi cao2 system the difference could be explained that at low ph values the smz in solution be degraded by fenton reaction to form concentration gradient reversal resulting in continuous desorption of smz on ac aschermann et al 2018 in fig 2c different from the changes in smz removal the addition of ac had no significant effect on p removal under either neutral or acidic conditions this implies that although ac can remove a small amount of p by adsorption the main mechanism of p removal is the formation of ca p and or fe p species in ac zvi cao2 system combined with fig 2a c indicates that 24 h is deemed sufficient to reach the obvious equilibrium minimum residual for smz and p therefore a reaction time of 24 h was chosen for the following effect study of reaction conditions table s2 lists the models of the pseudo first order adsorption kinetic and the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic were used to describe for p removal results indicate that the correlation coefficients r2 of the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic fitting 0 99 r2 1 00 were significantly higher than that of the pseudo first order adsorption kinetic fitting 0 07 r2 0 89 suggesting chemisorption as the main adsorption process of p by ac zvi cao2 lin et al 2017 comparing of the system pseudo 2nd kinetics model data in fig 2d ac showed a negligible effect on the rate constant k2 from 3 05 g mg 1 h 1 to 3 08 g mg 1 h 1 under initial ph 7 but markedly increased k2 form 24 08 g mg 1 h 1 to 49 00 g mg 1 h 1 at the acidic solution these results indicate that ac could accelerate the p removal by promoting the formation of fe p precipitation through fe c micro electrolysis process under favorable conditions more important than its adsorption capacity 3 3 effect of reaction conditions the influence of various initial smz p concentrations 5 mg l to 80 mg l on the removal performance of smz and p in ac zvi cao2 system was showed in fig 3 a when the initial reaction ph is neutral the removal efficiency of smz decreased from 78 5 to 41 5 with the initial concentration increasing of this parameter in principle the same ac zvi cao2 system has a fixed adsorption site for smz adsorption however when the initial concentration of smz increased from 10 mg l to 15 mg l the smz removal efficiency increased from 67 5 to 68 3 this can be explained that the ac may activate h2o2 released from cao2 and generate radical nonradical reactive species to remove smz under a neutral environment except for adsorption sun et al 2018 commonly the fenton like reaction can be triggered to yield ros through a series of corrosion reactions and thus degrade smz effectively under acidic environment hou et al 2022 some degradation by products were generated increasingly data not shown with the increasing of smz initial concentration even with effective smz removal all above 98 1 by the fenton like degradation capacity of the ac zvi cao2 system under acidic environment this is due to the consumption of ros by excessive smz 20 mg l and the ros generated in the limited ac zvi cao2 system are insufficient for complete degradation of the by products the removal efficiency of p in the ac zvi cao2 system was relatively high 60 regardless of the initial concentration 5 mg l and 30 mg l fig 3a still there was a decline in p removal rate at higher p concentrations due to the shortage of cao2 neutral conditions and zvi cao2 acidic conditions the evidence is given in section 3 4 the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were introduced for evaluating p removal ability of the ac zvi cao2 system by fitting the experimental data fig 3b results showed that the p adsorption capacities of the ac zvi cao2 system enhanced with the increase of initial p concentration but the increase gradually flattened out under acidic conditions p adsorption capacities are more suitable for the langmuir model r2 0 995 than the freundlich model r2 0 829 indicating the process is primarily a surface monolayer chemical sorption feng et al 2022a the separation factor rl values were calculated by langmuir model to evaluate whether the p adsorption process is favorable or not palansooriya et al 2021 the values of rl 1 in the langmuir model demonstrated that p adsorption was beneficial at acidic ph fig s2 meanwhile the maximum sorption capacity of the ac zvi cao2 system for p was calculated at 67 1 mg g 1 langmuir model fitting under the initial ph 2 higher than that of phoslock a commercial p load product at 9 0 mg g 1 xu et al 2017 unlike in acidic conditions the freundlich isotherm can better fit the p adsorption process at initial ph 7 0 meaning that the p sorption process is heterogeneous and the p binds preferentially with the stronger active sites ca2 in the ac zvi cao2 system liu et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 the n value was 51 02 for the ac zvi cao2 system demonstrating the system was also beneficial for p adsorption at neutral conditions wang et al 2022 in general solution ph plays an important role in processes including adsorption precipitation and degradation for zvi based wastewater treatment chen et al 2021 therefore the influence of initial ph from 1 to 11 on the smz p removal was experimentally studied fig 3c and the variation in solution ph was measured after 24 h reaction to be specific the removal efficiency of smz and p peaked both 100 at initial ph 2 except for extremely acidic conditions ph 1 the smz p removal rates were all higher than 40 at a wider ph range 2 11 in ac zvi cao2 system at relatively low solution ph 1 the solution ph value only raised to 1 1 after 24 h but the formation of the iron hydr oxides such as fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 need to be higher ph 5 85 and 2 00 respectively hence the p removal rate was particularly low 0 99 gang et al 2019 hou et al 2022 meanwhile the removal efficiency of smz at initial ph 1 was slightly lower than that of ph 2 since the ros such as oh consumption by excessive h koppenol and liebman 1984 on the other hand the smz removal process was controlled by fenton like degradation and transformed to ac adsorption and catalytic degradation controlling on account of the decreasing of the fe2 fe3 release as the initial ph increased so that the smz removal efficiency reduced to 44 4 at initial ph 11 hou et al 2022 different from smz the p removal efficiency first decreased and then increased gradually during ph 2 11 the first decrease is due to the lack of zvi dissolution thus difficult to remove p by forming fe p precipitate sun et al 2021 previous studies showed that the phosphate was mainly as h2po4 for 2 12 ph 7 21 and hpo4 2 for 7 21 ph 12 31 huang et al 2017 with initial ph above 3 oh can promote ca2 to form hydroxyapatite precipitates ca5 po4 3oh thus in ac zvi cao2 system the p removal efficiency gradually increased with the ph feng et al 2022a the water environment widely contains nom and co existing anions which may lead to poor smz p removal performance through free radical inhibition and adsorption sites competition wan et al 2020 accordingly typical nom humic acid and anions no3 so4 2 cl and co3 2 concentrations in the river were chosen to investigate their influence on smz p removal efficiency in ac zvi cao2 system fig 3d results showed that in acidic conditions the co existing anions had limited influence p 0 1 on the smz p removal performance which likely because of the sufficient ros and binding sites for removal of smz p however for neutral conditions nom significantly enhanced the removal performance of p p 0 05 this might be because the addition of nom can promote the ca p sorption capacity by delaying the formation of ca p precipitates ge et al 2020 perassi and borgnino 2014 despite the presence of nom on the smz removal having a negative influence the ac zvi cao2 system can still remove smz more than 40 which indicated high potential application value of the ac zvi cao2 system in the actual environment 3 4 mechanistic insights for p removal the esem eds images were introduced to observe changes in morphologies and surface elemental distributions of ac zvi cao2 system fig 4 compared with the initial the ac zvi cao2 system after reaction exhibits bigger particle sizes and rougher surface it indicated that p was absorbed effectivity on the surface of ac zvi cao2 content of p on ac zvi cao2 after reaction was higher 4 0wt than that of initial 0 7wt also identified the successful load of p on the material surface further compared with the distributions of ca and fe the distribution of p is highly coincident with that of ca at ph 7 which is distinct with the relatively even distribution of p on material surface at ph 2 it suggested that cao2 was the main contributor for p removal under neutral conditions while zvi and cao2 mainly contributed under acidic conditions to further investigate the mechanisms of p removal by ac zvi cao2 system changes in ca 2p fe 2p and p 2p particles were analyzed by high resolution xps spectra and shown in figs 5 a b and fig s3 the ca 2p spectra fig 5a showed that peak shifts from 346 5 ev to 347 1 ev ph7 and 346 8 ev ph2 respectively were observed after reaction compared with initial ac zvi cao2 materials the peaks shifts could be attributed to the formation of ca p species peaks at around 347 4 ev on the surface chen et al 2022 after p removed in ac zvi cao2 system fe 2p spectra fig 5b only showed new peaks at 710 7 ev and 724 8 ev under acidic condition which represents the generating of fe p species only occurred under acidic environment wan et al 2020 according to the comparison p 2p spectra fig s3 the new p 2p characteristic peaks were observed at 132 35 ev and 132 82 ev at ph 2 independently corresponds to fe p species and ca p species which quoted from nist x ray photoelectron spectroscopy database for neutral conditions only ca p characteristic peak was detected at 132 82 ev which was consistent with the fe 2p spectra results in addition the atomic concentration of p 2p increased form 1 41 raw materials to 4 91 ph7 ac zvi cao2 and 3 94 ph2 ac zvi cao2 which is consistent with eds results and further indicating that the p successfully removed form solution and loaded on the ac zvi cao2 by ca p and or fe p precipitation the ftir spectra results fig 5c showed that the bonds at 500 cm 1 620 cm 1 875 cm 1 and 1053 cm 1 1059 cm 1 were ascribed to stretching vibration of p species and transmission intensities decrease significantly after reaction which further confirmed the formation of p species zhang et al 2020 xrd spectra of changed materials before and after different reactions were analyzed for the possible fe p ca p species as seen in fig 5d the major peaks of raw ac zvi cao2 were conformed to the peak positions of fe pdf 06 0696 and cao2 pdf 03 0865 under neutral condition the peaks of ca5 po4 3 oh pdf 09 0423 appeared in xrd spectra in addition to the peaks of fe and cao2 which indicated the ca5 po4 3 oh may be the major ca p species however when there is acidic environment xrd spectra shown a wide amorphous peak in the 20 30 range and no distinctive p species xrd diffraction peaks meaning the high dispersion of p species and formation of fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates as major p species li et al 2019 above results showed that the main processes of p removal in the ac zvi cao2 system were achieved by the formation of crystalline state ca p species and fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates under neutral and acidic conditions respectively 3 5 mechanistic insights for smz removal early studies have suggested that ferryl ion feiv which can be generated from the fenton like reaction by eq 1 is capable of emerging organic contaminants e g smz degradation yin et al 2021 to identify whether the contribution of feiv was involved in the smz degradation methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso which can only be oxidized to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 by feiv but cannot be formed through ros oxidation was selected as the chemical probe chen et al 2021 as shown in fig 6 a when the reaction proceeds for 24 h the residual concentration of pmso is 0 0 mm and 0 92 mm at initial ph 2 0 and 7 0 in the ac zvi cao2 system and both have no formation of pmso2 it suggests that irrespective of acidic condition or neutral condition feiv was hardly formed in the ac zvi cao2 system and its effect on smz degradation is negligible 1 fe2 h2o2 feivo2 h2o to probe the roles of ros which form through fenton like reaction or ac catalysis in smz degradation several radical scavenging experiments were carried out in the acidic and non acidic ac zvi cao2 system l histidine p benzoquinone p bq and furfuryl alcohol ffa 99 were selected as the quenching agent to certify oh o2 and 1o2 respectively kl histidine oh 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k p bq o 2 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 and kffa 1 o2 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 chen et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 as shown in figs 6b c the presence of l histidine 3 mm and ffa 10 mm lead to the smz removal efficiencies of the ac zvi cao2 system reduced from 44 4 to 42 6 and 37 6 in the initial ph 7 and from 100 to 87 9 and 50 6 in initial ph 2 respectively this was likely to imply the oh and 1o2 as the crucial ros for smz degradation in the ac zvi cao2 system it should be pointed out that although the l histidine and ffa were often independently chosen as the classic scavenger for oh and 1o2 which are also highly reactive with 1o2 kl histidine 1 o2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 and oh kffa oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively chen et al 2021 li et al 2022 to further identify whether oh and 1o2 accounted for smz degradation dmpo and temp were used as a trapping agent of oh and 1o2 respectively as illustrated in fig 6d a distinct characteristic 1 2 2 1 quadruple signal of dmpo oh was recorded under acidic environment in the ac zvi cao2 system while in neutral solution the inapparent dmpo oh quadruple signal and relatively obvious dmpo ch3 six line spectrum 1 1 1 1 1 1 were obtained liu et al 2015 the signal of dmpo ch3 should be derived from the decomposition products of dmpo by oxidization of oh yoshioka et al 2001 these results can verify the formation of oh in the ac zvi cao2 system and the positive contribution of oh in smz degradation meanwhile fig 6f demonstrated that obvious triplet peaks of temp 1o2 relative intensities of 1 1 1 occur in the ac zvi cao2 system under both acidic and non acidic conditions in addition the comparison of fig 5b c showed that the quenching effect of ffa 49 4 and 6 8 under acidic and neutral condition respectively was more effective than of l histidine 12 1 and 1 8 hence it was rational to conclude that 1o2 was also partially involved in smz degradation the addition of p bq 1 mm demonstrates that a little beneficial effect on smz degradation in the ac zvi cao2 system figs 6b c different to the reported result of slight inhibition chen et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 theoretically the o2 was difficult to degrade smz as a result of relatively low redox potential e0 o2 0 33 v wu et al 2021 electron paramagnetic resonance spectra illustrated that an evident signal of dmpo o2 was obtained at acidic ph in fig 6e which verifies the formation and negligible influence of o2 on the smz degradation it is well known that the ac has abundant persistent free radicals pfrs which be formed by the pyrolysis of its own organic compounds e g quinones and can excellent activate h2o2 to generate ros for smz degradation fang et al 2014 feng et al 2022b luo et al 2021 additionally some studies have shown that semiquinone type free radical produced by p bq can induce peroxides and facilitate the formation of the highly reactive species e g ros for pollutant removal gu et al 2022 zhu et al 2007 the above results can explain the promotion effect of the addition of p bq 1 mm on smz degradation and the possible mechanism of ac catalysis in the ac zvi cao2 system epr spectra of d dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 adducts e dmpo o2 adduct and f temp 1o2 adducts experimental conditions smz 20 mg l ac loading 0 16 g l zvi 0 38 mg l cao2 0 26 mg l some studies reported that the ac could activate h2o2 effectively to generate ros due to including the pfrs and the graphitic carbon fang et al 2014 feng et al 2022b to further determine the catalytic mechanism of ac the species states of c on ac zvi cao2 system were observed before and after reaction by analyzing c 1 s spectra fig 7 a the peaks of c 1 s located at 283 5 284 0 284 6 285 6 and 288 4 ev are assigned to graphitic c amorphous c c oh c o and o c oh respectively feng et al 2022b the c o content of ac has been considered as an indicator of the activation capability by ac pfrs luo et al 2021 consequently the c o content of materials decreased from 19 4 raw state to 19 0 ph 7 and 16 1 ph 2 indicating pfrs of ac may react with h2o2 and involve in smz degradation luo et al 2021 meanwhile the graphitic c proportion reduced significantly from 23 6 to 18 8 under neutral conditions which represents the graphitic c was also involved in catalytic degradation and was damaged during reaction feng et al 2022b this significant decrease is different from the change under acidic conditions probably because the dominated role of smz degradation was ac catalysis instead of fenton reaction under non acidic conditions the degree of ac graphitization was further identified by raman spectra as shown in fig 7b the bands of d and g represented disorder c peak around 1350 cm 1 and graphitic c peak around 1590 cm 1 respectively in general the graphitization degree can be reflected by the intensity ratio of d and g id ig feng et al 2022b raman spectra results indicated that the graphitization degree of the materials decreased after the reaction which was consistent with the variation trend of c1s results the above results indicated that the ros oh and 1o2 as the main contributor to smz degradation were generated through fenton like reaction major process under acidic conditions and the ac catalysis major process under neutral conditions notably the quenching agent cannot completely consume ros produced by solid liquid reactions in this study because they are not fully available in the solution chen et al 2021 it indicates that the role of absorption for smz removal in the ac zvi cao2 system needs to be further discussed the positive effect of absorption for smz removal can be confirmed by two things 1 an accidental increase of smz concentration through desorption was observed in kinetic experiments fig 2a 2 s element possible from smz was detected on the surface of the material after the reaction fig 4 previous studies have shown that the co existence of smz showed no significant influence on p removal yang et al 2022 meanwhile it is found that the co existence of p can enhance the smz removal performance of the system by comparing smz removal kinetics in figs 2 and 5 a similar reinforcing effect was also reported by yang et al 2022 and zhu et al 2020 possibly contributed to the bridging effect and the change of surface charges additionally p as a weak acid may also facilitate the smz removal by buffering the ph of solution because the ph is an important influencing factor fig 3c the transformation products tps of smz in the ac zvi cao2 system were recorded by hplc ms and their possible structure information and mass spectra were given in table s3 and fig s4 due to the attack of ros oh and 1o2 the main degradation pathways of smz were s n bond cleavage tp 1 so2 extrusion tp 2 hydroxylation tp 3 and nh extrusion tp 5 jin et al 2022 these tps can further be degraded through c n bond cleavage demethylation hydroxylation and other degradation processes to generate other tps jin et al 2022 ultimately all the above products will be reacted to form some inorganic compounds such as co2 and h2o with further oxidation so that achieve the mineralization 3 6 feasibility of practice application stormwater filter as a sustainable low impact development system has been increasingly treated to contaminant in agricultural and urban non point runoff berger et al 2019 in order to further prove the practicability of the ac zvi cao2 system for p and smz removal batch column experiments shown in fig s5 were proceeded to simulate stormwater filters using real stormwater collected from nan jing in china as shown in fig s6 the p concentration of effluent from all the ac zvi cao2 system columns 5 10 and 20 remained consistent at 0 00 mg l during the experimental period 60 days different from pure quartz sand columns the effluent smz concentration of 5 system columns increased from time 0 00 mg l day 32 to 0 31 mg l day 60 due to the decline of ac catalytic capacity however the antibiotics concentrations of the waste water in most countries were at low μg l levels which were far below the setting concentration 2 mg l of the column experiment shimizu et al 2013 thus we assumed that the ac zvi cao2 system could support continuously stable operation throughout longer time span additionally dissolved oxygen do values increased with increases in ac zvi cao2 materials table s4 it has been shown that higher do values can facilitate the formation of aerobic microorganisms and promote antibiotic removal which indicates that do generation from cao2 might be able to accelerate the generation of biological communities and further extend the stable operation effect of the system wu et al 2022 therefore we will explore the relationship between the system and biodegradation in future studies in real practice an important consideration is the product cost which mainly involved the raw material consumption and processing charges including energy consumption and so on according to the unit prices of industrial grade products quoted from alibaba com the prices of ac zvi and cao2 70 were 285 200 and 855 usd ton respectively the processing charges was 243 usd ton made an inquiry from cooperative corporation nanjing nuowo environmental technology co ltd hence the cost of this product 50 functional materials as well as considering the material processing was 13 5 usd kg p which may save up to 50 cost in contrast with the price of phoslock 27 9 usd kg p xu et al 2017 the cost information of different reagents and methods are listed in table s6 additionally nontoxicity is another significant advantage of the ac zvi cao2 system in comparison to phoslock which has been demonstrated toxic to aquatic species by releasing of la3 xu et al 2017 nevertheless for iron based materials the who standard limit for maximum total iron concentration in drinking water is 0 3 mg l to prevent iron contamination chen et al 2021 therefore the total iron concentrations of the effluent from the various proportion 5 20 ac zvi cao2 system column experiments were continuously monitored during the experiment table s5 in order to determine whether the potential iron contamination exists in the system the column experiment results show that the total iron of all systems was no detected throughout the experiment indicating the reliable security of ac zvi cao2 system meanwhile previous studies have indicated that the nom which is widespread in natural water bodies will weaken the p removal of phoslock zhi et al 2021 for ac zvi cao2 system it can remove p effectively even in presence of nom fig 3d and has the capability in removing other residual contaminants such as smz to sum up the ac zvi cao2 system has a great utilization potentiality in the field of water treatment and further pilot studies are needed to assess its real effects on environmental responses considering the long term practical application 4 conclusion this study presents a novel heterogeneous catalytic system ac zvi cao2 for simultaneous removal of phosphate and sulfamethazine from aquatic systems in a wide ph application range of 2 to 11 the removal efficiencies of p and smz achieved beyond 65 and 40 using optimal mass ratio 20 ac 48 zvi and 32 cao2 respectively and were barely affected by the real wastewater matrix an investigation of mechanism for p removal demonstrated that the formation of crystalline state ca p species e g ca5 po4 3 oh and the fe p ca p amorphous state coprecipitates were major responsible for promoting of p removal in neutral and acidic solution respectively based on the results of reactive species identification and materials characterization it was confirmed that the ros oh and 1o2 through pfrs graphitic c catalysis and or fenton reaction of fe c micro electrolysis accelerating were main contributors for the smz degradation in the ac zvi cao2 system in addition the results of the low impact development application showed that the ac zvi cao2 system is considered to include low cost safe easy to obtain and stable to operate advantages after 60 days consecutive running the removal efficiencies of p smz were still close to 100 it can be a promising new strategy and provide a new idea on rural non point source pollution treatment for stakeholders and policymakers credit authorship contribution statement lei chen

14806,engineered nanoparticles including silver nanoparticles agnps are released into the environment mainly through wastewater treatment systems knowledge of the impact of agnps on the abundance and removal efficiency of antibiotic resistance genes args in wastewater treatment facilities including constructed wetlands cws is essential in the context of public health this study evaluated the effect of increased 100 fold collargol protein coated agnps and ionic ag in municipal wastewater on the structure abundance and removal efficiency of the antibiotic resistome integron integrase genes and pathogens in a hybrid cw using quantitative pcr and metagenomic approaches the abundance of args in wastewater and the removal efficiency of args in the hybrid system were significantly affected by higher ag concentrations especially with collargol treatment resulting in an elevated arg discharge of system effluent into the environment the accumulated ag in the filters had a more profound effect on the absolute and relative abundance of args in the treated water than the ag content in the water this study recorded significantly enhanced relative abundance values for tetracycline teta tetc tetq sulfonamide sul1 sul2 and aminoglycoside aada resistance genes which are frequently found on mobile genetic elements in collargol and to a lesser extent agno3 treated subsystems elevated plasmid and integron integrase gene levels especially inti1 in response to collargol presence indicated the substantial role of agnps in promoting horizontal gene transfer in the treatment system the pathogenic segment of the prokaryotic community was similar to a typical sewage community and strong correlations between pathogen and arg proportions were recorded in vertical subsurface flow filters furthermore the proportion of salmonella enterica was positively related to the ag content in these filter effluents the effect of agnps on the nature and characteristics of prominent resistance genes carried by mobile genetic elements in cws requires further investigation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment hybrid constructed wetland antibiotic resistance genes silver nanoparticles data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the last few decades the rapid development of technology that meets the consumption habits of an increasing population has resulted in a myriad of emerging contaminants released into waste streams daily the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args via waste streams has been recognized as a growing global concern who 2021 wastewater treatment plants wwtps act as reservoirs and major dissemination nodes for arb and args between anthropogenic and natural environments cacace et al 2019 uluseker et al 2021 the conditions in wwtps make them ideal hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt among environmental bacteria and human pathogens via plasmids integrons and transposons karkman et al 2018 furthermore the production and use of other emerging contaminants including engineered nanoparticles have greatly increased over the last two decades wu et al 2019 and are presumed to contribute to the selection and dissemination of args in wwtps ma et al 2016 silver nanoparticles agnps are extensively used in everyday consumer products mostly because of their antimicrobial properties cao et al 2018 these particles reach wwtps via sewer systems in the form of agnps or dissolved ionic ag huang et al 2019 and their effects on arb and args in wwtps are still poorly understood the effects of these ag fractions on args in treatment systems can be different for instance in sequencing batch reactors the increase in aminoglycoside resistance genes abundance was related to the presence of agnps while the increase in bacitracin and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls resistance genes abundance was explained by elevated ag content in the wastewater treatment system ma et al 2016 in addition some microbes including opportunistic pathogens in wwtps carry both args and metal resistance genes li et al 2017 which co selection and intraspecies spread via hgt can also be promoted by agnps causing increased bacterial cell membrane permeability by generating reactive oxygen species lu et al 2020 constructed wetlands cws are recognized worldwide as efficient and cost effective wastewater treatment alternatives for centralized high energy demanding active sludge wwtps hazra and durso 2022 the purification performance of cws is based on microbial biofilm activity on filter material substrate particles which is strongly affected by the system s properties truu et al 2009 different types of cws such as natural wetlands mimicking surface flow cws and subsurface flow ssf systems where water passes either vertically or horizontally through the porous filter material favor different purification processes and can be combined hybrid systems to enhance wastewater purification efficiency vymazal 2022 because cws have been efficient in removing micropollutants and emerging contaminant they are also used in the polishing step after conventional wastewater treatment sabri et al 2021 it has been suggested that ssf cws promote high levels of interactions between wastewater introduced arb including pathogens and substrate colonizing indigenous microbial communities with the possibility of regrowth of these critical groups in cw biofilms wu et al 2016 however knowledge of cw antibiotic resistomes and arg removal efficiency is still limited moreover the effect of wastewater borne agnps on the antibiotic resistome and arg removal efficiency remains mostly unknown and requires further investigation the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of increased concentrations of agnps and ionic ag in municipal wastewater on the structure abundance and removal efficiency of antibiotic resistomes integron integrase genes and pathogens in a pilot scale hybrid cw system consisting of sequential vertical and horizontal ssf units 2 material and methods 2 1 study system setup a 35 day experiment to evaluate the effect of increased agnps and ag ion concentrations on wwtp performance and the antibiotic resistome was conducted from the 1st of september to the 6th of october 2014 a pilot scale experimental system adjacent to the nõo wwtp tartu county estonia was established in 2013 the system consisted of a 2 m3 septic tank with an interim well and six parallel hybrid filter systems each comprising a 1 m3 vertical ssf filter vf and a 0 54 m3 horizontal ssf filter hf fig a 1 both of which were filled with lightweight expanded clay aggregates the system was fed raw municipal wastewater domestic wastewater combined with dairy and meat industry effluents pumped from an inlet of the wwtp to the septic tank the water retention time was two days after every two hours the pretreated wastewater was pumped into the interim well and subsequently spread to the surface of the vfs 5 l per filter the water passed through the vfs by gravity while the hfs were water saturated a water retention time of two days valves were installed before the inlets and after the outlets of the hfs enabling separate sampling of vf and hf effluents vfe s and hfe s respectively all subsystems were fed wastewater for one year prior to the experiment to stabilize the biofilm communities on the filter material particles during the 35 day experiment agnps 12 5 4 0 nm of casein coated collargol laboratories argenol s l zaragoza spain were added into two vf influents and a solution of agno3 sigma aldrich st louis usa was added into two other vf influents using a peristaltic pump heidolph model pd 5001 the final ag concentration 0 1 mg ag l in the influents of both treatments corresponded to the median lethal agnp concentration for several aquatic organisms shown by ecotoxicological tests kahru and dubourguier 2010 and to the threshold value that has been suggested to have effect on various biological processes in wastewater treatment brown 2017 the remaining two filter systems served as controls and received wastewater without any treatment a detailed description of the design and performance of the treatment system has been provided by truu et al 2022 2 2 sampling and chemical analysis a total of 78 water samples were collected from the vf influent in each vfe and hfe during the experiment the samples were collected before the addition of agnp and

processing of the sequence data is given in supplementary material a2 the technical characteristics of the metagenomes are presented in table a 1 the prokaryotic community composition was classified down to the species level using kaiju v 1 7 3 menzel et al 2016 with the ncbi nr database and is presented in supplementary material a4 figs a 2 and a 3 in parallel using the old nomenclature used by taxonomic classification programs and renewed nomenclature proposed by oren and garrity 2021 for antibiotic resistome profiling the water and fmb metagenomes were analyzed with args oap v 2 2 yin et

all water and fmb samples based on metagenomic data table a 2 a 3 the predominant args representing major antibiotic resistance types aada aminoglycoside baca bacitracin blactx m beta lactam catq chloramphenicol erm 35 ermf mls acrb mexf multiresistance sul1 sul2 sulfonamide teta tetc and tetq tetracycline were chosen as qpcr targets the qpcr primer characteristics and assay conditions are described in supplementary material a3 and table a 4 all target genes were normalized against the total prokaryotic 16s rrna gene abundance to represent the relative abundance of the target genes in the prokaryotic community the target gene removal efficiency re in wastewater during the treatment process was calculated as log removal log10 target gene abundance in filter influent target gene

and the quantified gene abundances were log transformed treatment system characteristics not reported in this paper but used in the statistical analysis are presented in truu et al 2022 differences in quantified gene abundances relative abundances and log removal dynamics between agnp and agno3 treatments and controls were assessed using repeated measures one way anova ranova followed by tukey s post hoc test partial correlation coefficients using total 16s rrna abundance as a covariable were used to find correlations between the abundance of args inti and agrgs in fmbs canonical correlation analysis was applied using system treatment efficiency te values as predictors of arg removal to evaluate the multivariate shared relationship between the two variable sets the ordination of the vf units based on the prokaryotic community structure of the vfe s was based on linear kernel principal component analysis compositional linear kpca the importance of the variables prokaryotic genera in the kpca was assessed using random permutations mariette and villa vialeneix 2018 support vector machine svm regression using compositional linear kernel and random forest regression was applied to assess the relationships between ag concentration and prokaryotic community composition the absolute abundances and relative abundances of args and inti genes and the composition of the pathogenic

subtypes and pathogen proportions were determined using pearson correlation coefficients extended description of data analysis is provided in supplementary material a5 3 results 3 1 the antibiotic resistome profile and integron integrases in the system 3 1 1 vertical flow filters influents and effluents based on metagenome analysis multidrug and tetracycline resistance types were prevalent in the antibiotic resistomes of in and all vfe s throughout the experiment moreover the resistome proportions in the prokaryotic communities of vfe s on day 35 were lower and less variable between different treatment units than on day 0 owing mainly to the decrease in aminoglycoside and beta lactam resistance types fig 1 a the prominent resistance mechanisms in in and vfe s on day 0 were antibiotic efflux especially the resistance nodulation division superfamily rnd and major facilitator superfamily mfs types and inactivation by day 35 the proportion of args utilizing the inactivation mechanism had substantially decreased in vfe s of all treatments and was replaced by target alteration becoming the second most prevalent resistance mechanism fig a 4a in total 311 arg subtypes were recorded from in metagenomes 61 of which persisted in vfe s irrespective of the applied treatment table a 2 on day 35 both the total and average number of detected arg subtypes of two replicate vfe s were 1 25 fold lower for agnp treatment and control filters and 1 40 fold lower for agno3 treatment filters compared to day 0 throughout the study the quantified arg abundances in in ranged from 103 copies ml sul2 to 107 copies ml tetc fig 2 and their relative abundances in the prokaryotic community were 0 0004 and 1 2 respectively fig a 5 table a 6 in all vfe s the abundances were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower compared to in fig 2 table a 7 however the relative abundances mostly stayed similar to in but erm 35 and baca were higher and aada and acrb were lower in vfe s fig a 5 table a 7 no significant differences in any arg abundances between the vfe s of different treatments were recorded during the treatment period however differences were revealed in the relative abundances of sul1 which were significantly higher in the vfe s of agnp treatment and erm 35 which was significantly lower in the vfe s of both ag treatments compared to the controls fig a 5 b c the ordination of the integrated community and arg data also separated day 0 and day 35 vfe s along the first axis of the mcia plot which captured the majority of the data variance and showed a similar shift between day 0 and day 35 samples for all filters irrespective of the treatment fig 3 a along this axis the proportions of arg mechanisms explained the most variance fig 3c highlighted by the opposite placement of inactivation and target alteration mechanisms fig a 6 d in addition a slight shift in the filter effluents from day 0 to day 35 was mostly related to the abundance and relative abundance of args fig 3c especially for catq and sul genes fig a 6 e f which was visible along the second axis with no notable difference between the treatments the ag content in vfe s and vfs explained 42 and 45 of the variation in the targeted gene abundance in vfe s respectively svm fig a 7 a e the abundances of aada baca blactx m catq sul1 sul2 teta and tetc in vfe s showed a strong positive relationship with ag concentration while catq sul2 and teta abundances were also strongly positively related to the ag content in the filter material fig a 7 the relative abundances of args in vfe s were more affected by ag concentration in filter material than vfe s svm 49 and 30 variance explained respectively the relative abundance of catq was strongly positively related to ag content in both vfe s and vfs while teta and sul1 were positively related to ag concentration in vfe s baca and blactx m were negatively related to ag content in the filter material fig a 7 d h the assembled contigs of in included 42 45 of plasmid sequences and 85 92 of the inti1 inti2 and inti3 reads were affiliated with plasmid sequences table a 8 throughout the experiment in the in the inti1 abundances were 2 20 107 1 66 107 copies ml and the relative abundance in the prokaryotic community was 1 49 0 53 the inti2 and inti3 genes were two and five orders of magnitude less abundant respectively table a 6 the metagenomes of all vfe s were characterized by a more variable plasmid content 30 46 and a lower proportion of inti1 3 sequences 0 14 0 26 compared to the in the affiliation rate of inti1 inti2 and inti3 reads with plasmid sequences rose from 75 to 89 on day 0 to 84 95 on day 35 with inti1 and inti2 showing slightly higher average plasmid affiliation 2 4 3 6 in vfe s of the agnp treatment table a 8 all quantified inti gene abundances in vfe s were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower whereas their relative abundances in the prokaryotic community remained mostly in a similar range as in with no significant differences between treatments table a 7 however boruta analysis indicated that inti1 and inti2 abundances as well as the relative abundance of inti1 in vfe s had strong positive correlations with ag concentration while the abundance of inti1 and inti3 had moderate and strong positive correlations respectively with the ag content in the filter material fig a 7 filter material biofilms according to the metagenome data the proportion of antibiotic resistomes in all fmbs of vfs increased 1 6 fold irrespective of the treatment by day 35 the ag treated filters showed slightly higher resistome proportions already before the treatments and this distinction persisted until the end of the experiment fig 1b at both time points all resistomes were dominated by multidrug and bacitracin resistance types followed by mls and sulfonamide resistance determinants rnd type efflux and target alteration were the dominant resistance mechanisms fig a 4b during the experiment 275 arg subtypes were recorded across vfs table a 3 both the total and average numbers of subtypes of the two replicate filters increased in all treatments by day 35 compared to day 0 however the increase was more pronounced 1 25 fold in the agnp treated filters than in the agno3 treated and control filters 1 05 1 12 fold the abundance and relative abundance of quantified args ranged from 104 copies g dw and 0 0001 catq to 108 copies g dw and 1 baca the abundances of ermf and acrb were below the limit of quantification loq in vfs table a 9 the summarized abundance of args increased threefold in ag treated vfs during the experiment and was on average 30 higher than that of the controls on day 35 fig 4 a while baca and mexf were abundant in all filters throughout the experiment sulfonamide encoding sul1 became prominent especially in the ag treated filters by day 35 figs 4a a 8a the summarized relative abundances decreased slightly during the experiment in all vfs and the decrease was higher in the control filters than in the ag treated filters fig a 8a the microbial genera and arg data integration also showed the separation of the day 0 and day 35 samples along the first axis of the mcia which explained the majority of the data variance fig 5 a arg and inti gene abundances and relative abundances especially those of sul1 sul2 aada and catq contributed the most to the variance along this axis figs 5c a 9e the shifts along the second axis mostly explained by antibiotic resistance mechanism proportions were not treatment specific the ag content in the filter material explained 34 of the variation in quantified arg abundances and 46 of the variation in their relative abundances svm fig a 10a c both the abundance and relative abundance of sul1 and sul2 showed strong positive relationships with this parameter in addition baca catq and teta abundances were positively related to ag whereas the relative abundance of mexf showed a strong negative relationship with ag content in vfs according to boruta analysis fig a 10b d the contigs of vfs on day 0 included 31 45 plasmid and 0 18 0 26 inti1 3 sequences by day 35 the ranges of these characteristics had increased to 41 51 and 0 21 0 29 respectively with all inti gene read proportions in contigs being slightly higher in agnp treated filters compared to other treatments table a 8 the affiliation of inti1 inti2 and inti3 reads with plasmid sequences also increased from 83 to 91 on day 0 to 88 94 on day 35 with no distinct differences between treatments the inti1 gene abundances on day 0 were 107 108 copies g dw and their relative abundances were 1 3 2 5 in the vfs compared to inti1 inti2 and inti3 exhibited on average two and five orders of magnitude lower abundances and relative abundances respectively table a 9 the abundances of inti1 and inti3 increased by more than an order of magnitude and their relative abundances increased 3 4 fold by day 35 while inti2 levels remained more stable however all inti gene abundances were in the order of agnp agno3 control on day 35 both the abundance and relative abundance of inti3 exhibited a significant positive relationship with the ag concentration in the filter material fig a 10 moreover a very strong positive partial correlation between inti1 and aada abundances was recorded in vf fmbs fig a 11 3 1 2 horizontal flow filters effluents the arg abundances ranged from 3 sul2 to 9 104 tetc copies ml with the respective relative abundances ranging from 0 0002 sul2 to 1 6 tetc in hfe s table a 10 the abundances of acrb in all hfe s ermf and catq in the control and baca in the control and agno3 treatment filter effluents remained unchanged table a 4 the abundances of all detected args in the agnp treated hfe s significantly exceeded the abundances in the control hfe s while the aada catq ermf mexf sul1 and sul2 abundances in the agnp treatment also exceeded the abundances of the agno3 treated hfe s during the treatment period fig 2 moreover the agno3 treated hfe s had significantly higher erm 35 sul1 teta and tetq abundances compared to the control filters the relative abundances of teta and tetq were higher in hfe s of both ag treatments compared to the controls whereas aada and tetc in the agnp treatment exceeded controls and both the control and agno3 treated hfe s respectively meanwhile the relative abundance of blactx m in the agno3 treatment and controls exceeded that of the agnp treated hfe s whereas sul2 in the agno3 treatment was relatively less abundant compared to the controls fig a 5 the ag content in the filter material explained considerably more of the variance in arg abundance and relative abundance in hfe s svm 50 than the ag content in hfe s 13 14 fig a 12 the abundances of aada blactx m sul1 teta tetc and tetq in hfe s showed strong positive correlations with the ag content in the filter material whereas no strong relationships between arg abundances and effluents ag content were recorded fig a 12b f the ag content in the filter material was also positively related to the relative abundance of teta and negatively related to blactx m relative abundance in hfe s fig a 12h and the relative abundance of tetc showed a strong positive relationship with the ag content of the effluents fig a 12d in all hfe s across the experimental period the inti1 abundances were four and two orders of magnitude lower and the relative abundances were 2 3 fold and 2 6 fold lower than those of the in and vfe s respectively table a 10 these parameters were significantly higher in agnp treated hfe s compared to controls figs 2c a 13 and the abundance also showed a strong positive relationship with the ag content in the filter material fig a 12 the inti2 and inti3 abundances were loq for all hfe s table a 4 filter material biofilms the range of antibiotic resistome proportions was similar in the prokaryotic communities of fmbs of the hfs on days 0 0 18 0 22 and 35 0 19 0 21 irrespective of treatment fig 1c the resistomes were dominated by multidrug bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance types as well as target alteration and rnd type efflux resistance mechanisms figs 1c a 4c in total 219 arg subtypes were detected across the hfs with virtually no differences between sampling times or treatments in the total and average subtype numbers of the two treatment replicates table a 3 among the quantified args baca erm 35 and sul1 were the most abundant 105 107 copies g dw while the abundance of ermf and acrb genes remained loq in all treatment units throughout the experiment table a 11 all args were markedly more abundant near the inlets of the hfs while the rest of the filters boasted approximately 10 fold lower arg levels fig 4b no clear spatial tendencies were observed in the relative abundance of args in the hfs fig a 8b the integration of microbial genera and arg data indicated less variation among day 35 samples compared to day 0 and a general shift from day 0 to day 35 irrespective of treatment was noted along the second axis of the mcia fig 5d the relative abundance of args had a major effect on sample ordination along the first and second axes while gene abundances contributed the most to the variance along the second axis fig 5f the individual variables with the strongest effect on the data variance from each analyzed dataset are depicted in fig a 14 the ag content in the hfs explained 36 of the variance in arg abundances and 30 of the variance in relative abundances in the fmbs of the hfs svm fig a 10e g the abundances of sul1 mexf catq and tetq showed strong positive correlations with ag content while no relationships were detected between the relative abundance of args and ag content in the hfs fig a 10f h the metagenomes of the hfs showed less variation between filters in integron integrase gene related parameters compared to vfs with almost no variation in time on both sampling occasions 38 42 of the obtained sequences were affiliated with plasmids 0 26 0 32 were found to be inti1 3 sequences and 80 87 of the latter were found from plasmid sequences with no differences between treatments table a 8 similar to the abundance of args the detected inti1 and inti3 genes showed an average abundance 10 fold higher near the inlets of the hfs compared to the rest of the filters table a 11 in the case of relative abundances a decreasing tendency from the inlet area toward the outlet area was also prevalent in hfe s except for filters 3 control and 4 agnp treatment no significant relationships with ag concentration in the hfe s or filter materials were found for the inti genes in the hfs fig a 10 however strong positive partial correlations between inti3 tetc and silp abundances in fmbs were recorded in these filters fig a 11 3 2 the removal efficiency of args and inti genes in the treatment system the removal of args and inti genes in the treated water in the vfs reached a reduction of 0 7 to 2 log for individual genes although no significant differences were recorded between the different treatments the average gene abundance reduction rate tended to be in the order of agnp agno3 control table 1 in all treatments aada acrb blactx m catq and inti2 were always reduced to 15 of the influent levels in some vfs regardless of the treatment an increase in erm 35 and inti3 gene abundance compared to the ins was recorded table a 12 canonical correlation analysis indicated that arg re was strongly related to the treatment efficiency of vfs the full model explained a substantial portion about 94 of the variance shared between the arg re and te variable sets table a 13 the canonical correlation analysis first function was negatively related to all measured args particularly blactx m sul2 catq and baca fig 6 a this function was also negatively related to all the measured te values the canonical variate based on the water te values especially toc and nh4 n and explained 59 9 of the arg te variation the re of target genes from water in hfs was of similar magnitude to that in vfs and the average reduction rates except for blactx m mexf and sul2 tended to follow the order of agnp agno3 control the removal of erm 35 genes was significantly lower in the agnp treated filters than in the control hfs table 1 the canonical correlation found a slightly weaker relationship between arg reduction and the te of hfs canonical r2 0 74 p 0 01 than that of vfs the canonical correlation analysis first function was positively related to all measured args however blactx m sul2 and catq had the highest structure coefficient values fig 6b in hfs the canonical variate based on the water te values especially toc and ntot explained three times less 18 9 of the arg te variation than in the case of vfs in the whole hybrid system the removal rates of targeted genes in some cases were 4 logs tet genes which exceeded the 16s rrna gene removal table a 12 contrary to the results of separate vf and hf analyses the analysis of the combined system revealed that the re of half of the targeted genes aada erm 35 sul1 teta tetc tetq and inti1 were significantly hampered with agnp treatment compared to the control in addition the re of teta and tetq remained significantly lower in agno3 treated systems compared to the control systems table 1 in the hybrid system effluents the levels of args and inti genes except baca and erm 35 were reduced to 0 9 with agnp treatment 0 4 with agno3 treatment and 0 3 in the control subsystems effluent compared with the system in the re of erm 35 and baca were the lowest among detected genes in the hybrid system reaching 5 of the in level table a 12 notably the re in the combined treatment system was more inert toward fluctuations than individual filters where poor arg removal in the vf was compensated for by high removal rates in the following hf and vice versa table a 12 according to canonical correlation analysis arg re was related to the te of the hybrid system canonical r2 0 90 p 0 001 the first function of the canonical correlation analysis was negatively related to blactx m sul2 and catq fig 6c the canonical variate based on the water te values especially toc and ntot explained 27 3 of the arg re variation 3 3 pathogens all 90 species of clinically relevant and potential pathogens from the card v 3 0 8 list were detected from the metagenomes of the in vfe s vfs and hfs on days 0 and 35 table a 14 a 15 with vf and hf fmbs forming distinct groups upon clustering fig 7 pathogens accounted for 0 84 0 07 of the prokaryotic community of the in with enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli being the most prevalent organisms at both times in vfe s on day 0 pathogens formed 0 78 0 08 of the community with e coli mycobacteroides abscessus and legionella pneumophila being prominent species on day 35 the pathogen proportions in all treatments were in the range of 0 62 0 98 and clustered separately from day 0 vfe s on the heat map with the most abundant pathogens being similar to those of the ins namely e faecium and e coli fig 7 among the major pathogens 0 02 in vfe s only salmonella enterica showed a strong positive relationship with ag content in vfe s while burkholderia pseudomallei exhibited moderate positive relationships and klebsiella pneumoniae moderate negative relationships with ag content both in the effluent and filter material of vfs in addition several low proportion pathogens in vfe s were affected by the ag content serratia liquefaciens and streptococcus pyogenes proportions were positively related to the ag content of both the effluent and filter material while streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus agalactiae exhibited a negative relationship with ag content in effluents fig a 15 the args showing strong positive correlations with pathogen proportions in vfe s most frequently were tetw tolc aada and teto fig a 16 in the fmbs of vfs pathogens formed 0 57 0 07 of the community on day 0 by day 35 the proportion of pathogens had increased slightly in most of the filters up to 0 63 0 05 predominantly due to an increase in the pseudomonas species proportion the heatmap shows a separate clustering of day 0 and day 35 samples by their pathogenic community structure at the time and reveals higher similarity between the two ag treatments than between ag treated and control filters fig 7 of the major pathogens burkholderia cenocepacia showed a moderate positive relationship and clostridium botulinum and m abscessus showed a moderate negative correlation with the ag content in the filter material among the low proportion pathogens clostridium tetani listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter coli were negatively correlated and burkholderia cepacia ralstonia mannitolytica and moraxella catarrhalis were positively correlated with the ag content in the filter material fig a 17 multidrug resistance encoding acrb and ceob showed strong positive correlations with pathogen proportions in the fmbs of vfs the correlations also suggest the presence of a multidrug mdtbc complex on neisseria gonorrhoeae and r mannitolilytica fig a 18 the proportion of pathogens in hf fmbs was similar on days 0 and 35 0 36 0 02 and 0 35 0 01 respectively and between the different treatment filters pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were the most prominently detected species fig 7 neither relationships between pathogen proportions and ag content nor strong positive correlations between pathogens and args were found in hfs 4 discussion this study assessed the effect of a 100 fold increase in ag concentration in the form of agnps and ionic ag on args removal from wastewater initially having ag content of typical contemporary urban wastewater cervantes aviles et al 2019 a previous study on this experiment showed that the carbon and nitrogen removal efficiency of the hybrid system was not affected by the increased ag content and most of the introduced ag was bound to the filter material particles of the upper 10 cm layer of vfs truu et al 2022 furthermore the agnps and ionic ag had no substantial effect on the microbial community structure of fmbs indicating the absence of significant selective pressure of ag compounds on microbes in the hybrid system this study showed that the removal rates of args in the hybrid system reached 2 4 5 logs and over 99 of the args were removed regardless of treatment comparable to or even exceeding the efficiencies of hybrid systems reported to date hazra and durso 2022 moreover the arg removal rates were comparable to those of the best conventional wwtps hazra and durso 2022 as well as with sewage treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration hiller et al 2019 although this study detected slightly lower removal 95 of bacitracin and mls resistance genes in all treatments compared to other args the re exceeded previous reports for these args in cws chen et al 2016 the arg re was strongly related to the re of other pollutants in the hybrid system particularly in vfs this finding complements previous knowledge that higher system te also includes more efficient removal of args in cws nõlvak et al 2013 however in the hybrid system the abundance and removal of args were susceptible to an increased ag concentration in wastewater and filter materials which elicited higher arg abundance and reduced arg re this effect probably stems from a combination of several contributing mechanisms in ag treated filters including the total prokaryotic community abundance related increase in args hosts numbers truu et al 2022 showed increased abundance of prokaryotic community in the effluents of ag treated filters of this experimental system caused by decreased efficiency of microbes removal or increased biofilm shearing the abundances of many args have shown simultaneous equivalent size reduction with the total microbial community abundance in treated water and stream water receiving treatment system effluent du et al 2020 tiirik et al 2021 in addition selective pressure of ag compounds on the antibiotic resistome and promotion of horizontal gene transfer frequency of arg carrying mobile genetic elements mges can be behind the higher arg abundances in effluences of ag treatments collargol had a stronger effect on the abundance of args in treated water than ionic ag possibly because of the slow and long term release of ag ions from agnps yang et al 2014 the arg abundances in the fmbs of all treatments were in a similar range to the previous cw studies sabri et al 2021 nevertheless a slightly higher diversity of arg subtypes within agnp treatment and an ag related increase in sulfonamide resistance encoding genes abundance in the resistomes of vf fmbs indicated the selective pressure of ag compounds on the antibiotic resistome of vfs of the studied hybrid system the following more inert hfs showed no differences between the fmb resistomes of different treatments and mitigated the spread of more diverse resistomes to the environment via final effluent however the data analysis revealed that the re of three args blactx m sul2 catq not affected by the addition of agnps was tightly linked to the system s re of organic matter and nitrogen compounds the args showing increased relative abundances in the effluents and filter material and significantly reduced re in water of this study system in response to elevated ag content in the wastewater have been found on mges including integrons sul1 aada conjugative plasmids and transposons teta tetc tetq often together with metal resistance genes gillings 2014 partridge et al 2018 smith et al 2001 moreover the number of integrons and plasmids can increase in microbial communities under the stress of environmental pollution including heavy metal pollution gillings 2014 in support of this observation this study found slightly elevated plasmid content and high inti1 and inti2 plasmid affiliation in all ag treated vfe s as well as high abundance and relative abundance of inti1 in the hfe s of collargol treated hybrid subsystems both agnps and ag can significantly increase the conjugative gene transfer frequency by increasing cell membrane permeability via the generation of reactive oxygen species with agnps enhancing conjugation at a lower initial concentration than ag lu et al 2020 in addition a stronger positive effect of agnps on integron abundance than ag was shown in sequencing batch reactors ma et al 2016 these results suggest that the increase in agnp concentration in wastewater reduces arg re and affects arg levels in hybrid system effluent probably by promoting the hgt potential of args located on mges and selectively boosting their proportion in the prokaryotic community resistome similar to the microbial communities of fmbs of hybrid system filters truu et al 2022 negative and positive correlations between ag content and prokaryotic genera several of them including pathogenic species were recorded in the vfe s the pathogenic segments of the prokaryotic communities of the system in and vfe s of all treatments were typical of sewage dominated by enteric bacteria of the genera escherichia salmonella enterococcus shigella and klebsiella de oliveira et al 2020 makowska et al 2021 which frequently carry args and metal resistance genes li et al 2017 numerous strong correlations between these pathogens and arg proportions recorded in vf fmbs and vfe s suggest an even wider spread of antibiotic resistance in the species of these genera than was known based on resistomes in the card database however non pathogenic strains may also contribute to this correlation since the species level resolution is insufficient to differentiate between closely related pathogenic and non pathogenic strains of the same species of the major pathogens a positive correlation between s enterica and ag content in vfe s was recorded whereas no strong relationships between pathogenic species proportions and args and ag concentrations were detected in hf fmbs suggesting a reduced risk of the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens from hybrid treatment systems regardless of the amount and form of ag in the treated water 5 conclusions the hybrid treatment system s arg re was comparable to that of other wastewater treatment systems and related to the system s te elevated wastewater ag concentration especially in the form of collargol promoted arg abundance and reduced their re resulting in significantly higher arg discharge to the environment via the hybrid system s effluent significantly enhanced relative abundances of sulfonamide sul1 sul2 aminoglycoside aada and tetracycline teta tetc tetq resistance genes in collargol and to a lesser extent agno3 treated subsystems indicated that args commonly found on mges gain a selective advantage in hybrid system microbial communities in the presence of elevated ag levels especially agnps in wastewater higher plasmid and integron integrase genes especially inti1 levels in response to collargol indicated the substantial role of agnps in the promotion of hgt in hybrid cws elevated ag content in wastewater promoted the proportion of several pathogenic microbial taxa in biofilm and effluent of vertical flow units of the treatment system the effect of agnps on

14806,engineered nanoparticles including silver nanoparticles agnps are released into the environment mainly through wastewater treatment systems knowledge of the impact of agnps on the abundance and removal efficiency of antibiotic resistance genes args in wastewater treatment facilities including constructed wetlands cws is essential in the context of public health this study evaluated the effect of increased 100 fold collargol protein coated agnps and ionic ag in municipal wastewater on the structure abundance and removal efficiency of the antibiotic resistome integron integrase genes and pathogens in a hybrid cw using quantitative pcr and metagenomic approaches the abundance of args in wastewater and the removal efficiency of args in the hybrid system were significantly affected by higher ag concentrations especially with collargol treatment resulting in an elevated arg discharge of system effluent into the environment the accumulated ag in the filters had a more profound effect on the absolute and relative abundance of args in the treated water than the ag content in the water this study recorded significantly enhanced relative abundance values for tetracycline teta tetc tetq sulfonamide sul1 sul2 and aminoglycoside aada resistance genes which are frequently found on mobile genetic elements in collargol and to a lesser extent agno3 treated subsystems elevated plasmid and integron integrase gene levels especially inti1 in response to collargol presence indicated the substantial role of agnps in promoting horizontal gene transfer in the treatment system the pathogenic segment of the prokaryotic community was similar to a typical sewage community and strong correlations between pathogen and arg proportions were recorded in vertical subsurface flow filters furthermore the proportion of salmonella enterica was positively related to the ag content in these filter effluents the effect of agnps on the nature and characteristics of prominent resistance genes carried by mobile genetic elements in cws requires further investigation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment hybrid constructed wetland antibiotic resistance genes silver nanoparticles data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction over the last few decades the rapid development of technology that meets the consumption habits of an increasing population has resulted in a myriad of emerging contaminants released into waste streams daily the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args via waste streams has been recognized as a growing global concern who 2021 wastewater treatment plants wwtps act as reservoirs and major dissemination nodes for arb and args between anthropogenic and natural environments cacace et al 2019 uluseker et al 2021 the conditions in wwtps make them ideal hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt among environmental bacteria and human pathogens via plasmids integrons and transposons karkman et al 2018 furthermore the production and use of other emerging contaminants including engineered nanoparticles have greatly increased over the last two decades wu et al 2019 and are presumed to contribute to the selection and dissemination of args in wwtps ma et al 2016 silver nanoparticles agnps are extensively used in everyday consumer products mostly because of their antimicrobial properties cao et al 2018 these particles reach wwtps via sewer systems in the form of agnps or dissolved ionic ag huang et al 2019 and their effects on arb and args in wwtps are still poorly understood the effects of these ag fractions on args in treatment systems can be different for instance in sequencing batch reactors the increase in aminoglycoside resistance genes abundance was related to the presence of agnps while the increase in bacitracin and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls resistance genes abundance was explained by elevated ag content in the wastewater treatment system ma et al 2016 in addition some microbes including opportunistic pathogens in wwtps carry both args and metal resistance genes li et al 2017 which co selection and intraspecies spread via hgt can also be promoted by agnps causing increased bacterial cell membrane permeability by generating reactive oxygen species lu et al 2020 constructed wetlands cws are recognized worldwide as efficient and cost effective wastewater treatment alternatives for centralized high energy demanding active sludge wwtps hazra and durso 2022 the purification performance of cws is based on microbial biofilm activity on filter material substrate particles which is strongly affected by the system s properties truu et al 2009 different types of cws such as natural wetlands mimicking surface flow cws and subsurface flow ssf systems where water passes either vertically or horizontally through the porous filter material favor different purification processes and can be combined hybrid systems to enhance wastewater purification efficiency vymazal 2022 because cws have been efficient in removing micropollutants and emerging contaminant they are also used in the polishing step after conventional wastewater treatment sabri et al 2021 it has been suggested that ssf cws promote high levels of interactions between wastewater introduced arb including pathogens and substrate colonizing indigenous microbial communities with the possibility of regrowth of these critical groups in cw biofilms wu et al 2016 however knowledge of cw antibiotic resistomes and arg removal efficiency is still limited moreover the effect of wastewater borne agnps on the antibiotic resistome and arg removal efficiency remains mostly unknown and requires further investigation the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of increased concentrations of agnps and ionic ag in municipal wastewater on the structure abundance and removal efficiency of antibiotic resistomes integron integrase genes and pathogens in a pilot scale hybrid cw system consisting of sequential vertical and horizontal ssf units 2 material and methods 2 1 study system setup a 35 day experiment to evaluate the effect of increased agnps and ag ion concentrations on wwtp performance and the antibiotic resistome was conducted from the 1st of september to the 6th of october 2014 a pilot scale experimental system adjacent to the nõo wwtp tartu county estonia was established in 2013 the system consisted of a 2 m3 septic tank with an interim well and six parallel hybrid filter systems each comprising a 1 m3 vertical ssf filter vf and a 0 54 m3 horizontal ssf filter hf fig a 1 both of which were filled with lightweight expanded clay aggregates the system was fed raw municipal wastewater domestic wastewater combined with dairy and meat industry effluents pumped from an inlet of the wwtp to the septic tank the water retention time was two days after every two hours the pretreated wastewater was pumped into the interim well and subsequently spread to the surface of the vfs 5 l per filter the water passed through the vfs by gravity while the hfs were water saturated a water retention time of two days valves were installed before the inlets and after the outlets of the hfs enabling separate sampling of vf and hf effluents vfe s and hfe s respectively all subsystems were fed wastewater for one year prior to the experiment to stabilize the biofilm communities on the filter material particles during the 35 day experiment agnps 12 5 4 0 nm of casein coated collargol laboratories argenol s l zaragoza spain were added into two vf influents and a solution of agno3 sigma aldrich st louis usa was added into two other vf influents using a peristaltic pump heidolph model pd 5001 the final ag concentration 0 1 mg ag l in the influents of both treatments corresponded to the median lethal agnp concentration for several aquatic organisms shown by ecotoxicological tests kahru and dubourguier 2010 and to the threshold value that has been suggested to have effect on various biological processes in wastewater treatment brown 2017 the remaining two filter systems served as controls and received wastewater without any treatment a detailed description of the design and performance of the treatment system has been provided by truu et al 2022 2 2 sampling and chemical analysis a total of 78 water samples were collected from the vf influent in each vfe and hfe during the experiment the samples were collected before the addition of agnp and agno3 on day 0 and then weekly on days 7 14 21 28 and 35 on each sampling day 50 ml of each water sample total volume of 2 l was centrifuged 4000 rpm 15 min the supernatant was then decanted and the biomass sample was stored at 20 c until dna extraction the remaining samples were stored at 4 c until further chemical analyses the temperature ph and dissolved oxygen content in the water samples

in the laboratory shortly after sampling using standard methods filter material samples were collected from the vfs and hfs 72 samples in total on days 0 and 35 of the experiment from each vf three samples 200 g were collected with a sterile shovel from the most active layer 0 10 cm below the influent wastewater distribution hose fig a 1 from each hf the samples were taken from the 40 to 60 cm layer of the inlet middle and outlet areas hfa hfb and hfc respectively with a soil auger ø 5 cm all filter material samples were placed in air tight plastic bags and stored under cooled conditions during transportation and at 20 c in the laboratory until dna extraction for the chemical analysis the subsamples were stored at 4 c the ag concentrations in the water and filter material samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy respectively a detailed description of the chemical analysis is provided in supplementary material a1 2 3 dna extraction dna was extracted from the biomass of the centrifuged water samples with a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca the homogenization step was conducted at 5000 rpm for 20 s using precellys 24 bertin technologies montigny le bretonneux france the dna of the filter material biofilms fmbs was extracted from 10 g of the filter material samples crushed with a sterile mortar and pestle using a powermax soil dna isolation kit mobio the quality and quantity of the dna extracts were assessed using spectrophotometry infinite m200 tecan ag grödig austria all dna extracts were stored at 20 c until further analysis 2 4 metagenomic analyses dna libraries 2 150 bp were prepared from 14 water samples in and vfe s on days 0 and 35 and 24 composite fmb samples six vfs and six hfs on day 0 and six vfs and six hfs on day 35 using the truseq dna pcr free library preparation kit illumina san diego ca and sequenced with a nextseq 500 system illumina the dna concentrations of hfe s were too low for sequencing and metagenomes were not obtained from these samples a detailed description of the sample preparation sequencing and general bioinformatics processing of the sequence data is given in supplementary material a2 the technical characteristics of the metagenomes are presented in table a 1 the prokaryotic community composition was classified down to the species level using kaiju v 1 7 3 menzel et al 2016 with the ncbi nr database and is presented in supplementary material a4 figs a 2 and a 3 in parallel using the old nomenclature used by taxonomic classification programs and renewed nomenclature proposed by oren and garrity 2021 for antibiotic resistome profiling the water and fmb metagenomes were analyzed with args oap v 2 2 yin et al 2018 the proportion of resistomes in the prokaryotic community was presented per number of 16s rrna reads args were assigned to resistance mechanism types according to their respective gene annotations in the card database v 3 0 8 pathogen profiling was based on the list of important pathogens in card v 3 0 8 plasmid sequences were determined from assembled contigs with kaiju using full plasmid sequences from the refseq database as references for the determination of integron integrase genes contigs were translated to their corresponding peptide sequences with prodigal v 2 6 3 hyatt

accession number prjeb37686 2 5 quantitative pcr analysis quantitative pcr qpcr was used to determine the abundance of predominant args and class 1 3 integron integrase genes inti inti1 inti2 inti3 in all water and fmb samples based on metagenomic data table a 2 a 3 the predominant args representing major antibiotic resistance types aada aminoglycoside baca bacitracin blactx m beta lactam catq chloramphenicol erm 35 ermf mls acrb mexf multiresistance sul1 sul2 sulfonamide teta tetc and tetq tetracycline were chosen as qpcr targets the qpcr primer characteristics and assay conditions are described in supplementary material a3 and table a 4 all target genes were normalized against the total prokaryotic 16s rrna gene abundance to represent the relative abundance of the target genes in the prokaryotic community the target gene removal efficiency re in wastewater during the treatment process was calculated as log removal log10 target gene abundance in filter influent target gene abundance in filter effluent 2 6 statistical analysis prior to the statistical analysis the prokaryotic genera data proportions in the prokaryotic community underwent centered log ratio transformation and the quantified gene abundances were log transformed treatment system characteristics not reported in this paper but used in the statistical analysis are presented in truu et al 2022 differences in quantified gene abundances relative abundances and log removal dynamics between agnp and agno3 treatments and controls were assessed using repeated measures one way anova ranova followed by tukey s post hoc test partial correlation coefficients using total 16s rrna abundance as a covariable were used to find correlations between the abundance of args inti and agrgs in fmbs canonical correlation analysis was applied using system treatment efficiency te values as predictors of arg removal to evaluate the multivariate shared relationship between the two variable sets the ordination of the vf units based on the prokaryotic community structure of the vfe s was based on linear kernel principal component analysis compositional linear kpca the importance of the variables prokaryotic genera in the kpca was assessed using random permutations mariette and villa vialeneix 2018 support vector machine svm regression using compositional linear kernel and random forest regression was applied to assess the relationships between ag concentration and prokaryotic community composition the absolute abundances and relative abundances of args and inti genes and the composition of the pathogenic segment of the prokaryotic community in the treatment system compartments using r packages caret kuhn 2008 and boruta kursa and rudnicki 2010 the direction of the relationships in the analyses was determined using pearson s correlation coefficients multiple co inertia analysis mcia was applied to integrate data from six vfe s vf fmb s or hf fmb specific datasets using the omicade4 package meng et al 2014 the proportions of major pathogens 0 02 in at least one sample were visualized as a heatmap using the clustvis program metsalu and vilo 2015 strong positive relationships r 0 90 between arg subtypes and pathogen proportions were determined using pearson correlation coefficients extended description of data analysis is provided in supplementary material a5 3 results 3 1 the antibiotic resistome profile and integron integrases in the system 3 1 1 vertical flow filters influents and effluents based on metagenome analysis multidrug and tetracycline resistance types were prevalent in the antibiotic resistomes of in and all vfe s throughout the experiment moreover the resistome proportions in the prokaryotic communities of vfe s on day 35 were lower and less variable between different treatment units than on day 0 owing mainly to the decrease in aminoglycoside and beta lactam resistance types fig 1 a the prominent resistance mechanisms in in and vfe s on day 0 were antibiotic efflux especially the resistance nodulation division superfamily rnd and major facilitator superfamily mfs types and inactivation by day 35 the proportion of args utilizing the inactivation mechanism had substantially decreased in vfe s of all treatments and was replaced by target alteration becoming the second most prevalent resistance mechanism fig a 4a in total 311 arg subtypes were recorded from in metagenomes 61 of which persisted in vfe s irrespective of the applied treatment table a 2 on day 35 both the total and average number of detected arg subtypes of two replicate vfe s were 1 25 fold lower for agnp treatment and control filters and 1 40 fold lower for agno3 treatment filters compared to day 0 throughout the study the quantified arg abundances in in ranged from 103 copies ml sul2 to 107 copies ml tetc fig 2 and their relative abundances in the prokaryotic community were 0 0004 and 1 2 respectively fig a 5 table a 6 in all vfe s the abundances were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower compared to in fig 2 table a 7 however the relative abundances mostly stayed similar to in but erm 35 and baca were higher and aada and acrb were lower in vfe s fig a 5 table a 7 no significant differences in any arg abundances between the vfe s of different treatments were recorded during the treatment period however differences were revealed in the relative abundances of sul1 which were significantly higher in the vfe s of agnp treatment and erm 35 which was significantly lower in the vfe s of both ag treatments compared to the controls fig a 5 b c the ordination of the integrated community and arg data also separated day 0 and day 35 vfe s along the first axis of the mcia plot which captured the majority of the data variance and showed a similar shift between day 0 and day 35 samples for all filters irrespective of the treatment fig 3 a along this axis the proportions of arg mechanisms explained the most variance fig 3c highlighted by the opposite placement of inactivation and target alteration mechanisms fig a 6 d in addition a slight shift in the filter effluents from day 0 to day 35 was mostly related to the abundance and relative abundance of args fig 3c especially for catq and sul genes fig a 6 e f which was visible along the second axis with no notable difference between the treatments the ag content in vfe s and vfs explained 42 and 45 of the variation in the targeted gene abundance in vfe s respectively svm fig a 7 a e the abundances of aada baca blactx m catq sul1 sul2 teta and tetc in vfe s showed a strong positive relationship with ag concentration while catq sul2 and teta abundances were also strongly positively related to the ag content in the filter material fig a 7 the relative abundances of args in vfe s were more affected by ag concentration in filter material than vfe s svm 49 and 30 variance explained respectively the relative abundance of catq was strongly positively related to ag content in both vfe s and vfs while teta and sul1 were positively related to ag concentration in vfe s baca and blactx m were negatively related to ag content in the filter material fig a 7 d h the assembled contigs of in included 42 45 of plasmid sequences and 85 92 of the inti1 inti2 and inti3 reads were affiliated with plasmid sequences table a 8 throughout the experiment in the in the inti1 abundances were 2 20 107 1 66 107 copies ml and the relative abundance in the prokaryotic community was 1 49 0 53 the inti2 and inti3 genes were two and five orders of magnitude less abundant respectively table a 6 the metagenomes of all vfe s were characterized by a more variable plasmid content 30 46 and a lower proportion of inti1 3 sequences 0 14 0 26 compared to the in the affiliation rate of inti1 inti2 and inti3 reads with plasmid sequences rose from 75 to 89 on day 0 to 84 95 on day 35 with inti1 and inti2 showing slightly higher average plasmid affiliation 2 4 3 6 in vfe s of the agnp treatment table a 8 all quantified inti gene abundances in vfe s were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower whereas their relative abundances in the prokaryotic community remained mostly in a similar range as in with no significant differences between treatments table a 7 however boruta analysis indicated that inti1 and inti2 abundances as well as the relative abundance of inti1 in vfe s had strong positive correlations with ag concentration while the abundance of inti1 and inti3 had moderate and strong positive correlations respectively with the ag content in the filter material fig a 7 filter material biofilms according to the metagenome data the proportion of antibiotic resistomes in all fmbs of vfs increased 1 6 fold irrespective of the treatment by day 35 the ag treated filters showed slightly higher resistome proportions already before the treatments and this distinction persisted until the end of the experiment fig 1b at both time points all resistomes were dominated by multidrug and bacitracin resistance types followed by mls and sulfonamide resistance determinants rnd type efflux and target alteration were the dominant resistance mechanisms fig a 4b during the experiment 275 arg subtypes were recorded across vfs table a 3 both the total and average numbers of subtypes of the two replicate filters increased in all treatments by day 35 compared to day 0 however the increase was more pronounced 1 25 fold in the agnp treated filters than in the agno3 treated and control filters 1 05 1 12 fold the abundance and relative abundance of quantified args ranged from 104 copies g dw and 0

vfs during the experiment and was on average 30 higher than that of the controls on day 35 fig 4 a while baca and mexf were abundant in all filters throughout the experiment sulfonamide encoding sul1 became prominent especially in the ag treated filters by day 35 figs 4a a 8a the summarized relative abundances decreased slightly during the experiment in all vfs and the decrease was higher in the control filters than in the ag treated filters fig a 8a the microbial genera and arg data integration also showed the separation of the day 0 and day 35 samples along the first axis of the mcia which explained the majority of the data variance fig 5 a arg and inti gene abundances and relative abundances especially those of sul1 sul2 aada and catq contributed the most to the variance along this axis figs 5c a 9e the shifts along the second axis mostly explained by antibiotic resistance mechanism proportions were not treatment specific the ag content in the filter material explained 34 of the variation in quantified arg abundances and 46 of the variation in their relative abundances svm fig a 10a c both the abundance and relative abundance of sul1 and sul2 showed strong positive relationships with this parameter in addition baca catq and teta abundances were positively related to ag whereas the relative abundance of mexf showed a strong negative relationship with ag content in vfs according to boruta analysis fig a 10b d the contigs of vfs on day 0 included 31 45 plasmid and 0 18 0 26 inti1 3 sequences by day 35 the ranges of these characteristics had increased to 41 51

reads with plasmid sequences also increased from 83 to 91 on day 0 to 88 94 on day 35 with no distinct differences between treatments the inti1 gene abundances on day 0 were 107 108 copies g dw and their relative abundances were 1 3 2 5 in the vfs compared to inti1 inti2 and inti3 exhibited on average two and five orders of magnitude lower abundances and relative abundances respectively table a 9 the abundances of inti1 and inti3 increased by more than an order of magnitude and their relative abundances increased 3 4 fold by day 35 while inti2 levels remained more stable however all inti gene abundances were in the order of agnp agno3 control on day 35 both the abundance and relative abundance of inti3 exhibited a significant positive relationship with the ag concentration in the filter material fig a 10 moreover a very strong positive partial correlation between inti1 and aada abundances was recorded in vf fmbs fig a 11 3 1 2 horizontal flow filters effluents the arg abundances ranged from 3 sul2 to 9 104 tetc copies ml with the respective relative abundances ranging from 0 0002 sul2 to 1 6 tetc in hfe s table a 10 the abundances of acrb in all hfe s ermf and catq in the control and baca in the control and agno3 treatment filter effluents remained unchanged table a 4 the abundances of all detected args in the agnp treated hfe s significantly exceeded the abundances in the control hfe s while the aada catq ermf mexf sul1 and sul2 abundances in the agnp treatment also exceeded the abundances of the agno3 treated hfe s during the treatment period fig 2 moreover the agno3 treated hfe s had significantly higher erm 35 sul1 teta and tetq abundances compared to the control filters the relative abundances of teta and tetq were higher in hfe s of both ag treatments compared to the controls whereas aada and tetc in the agnp treatment exceeded controls and both the control and agno3 treated hfe s respectively meanwhile the relative abundance of blactx m in the agno3 treatment and controls exceeded that of the agnp treated hfe s whereas sul2 in the agno3 treatment was relatively less abundant compared to the controls fig a 5 the ag content in the filter material explained considerably more of the variance in arg abundance and relative abundance in hfe s svm 50 than the ag content in hfe s 13 14 fig a 12 the abundances of aada blactx m sul1 teta tetc and tetq in hfe s showed strong positive correlations with the ag content in the filter material whereas no strong relationships between arg abundances and effluents ag content were recorded fig a 12b f the ag content in the filter material was also positively related to the relative abundance of teta and negatively related to blactx m relative abundance in hfe s fig a 12h and the relative abundance of tetc showed a strong positive relationship with the ag content of the effluents fig a 12d in all hfe s across the experimental period the inti1 abundances were four and two orders of magnitude lower and the relative abundances were 2 3 fold and 2 6 fold lower than those of the in and vfe s respectively table a 10 these parameters were significantly higher in agnp treated hfe s compared to controls figs 2c a 13 and the abundance also showed a strong positive relationship with the ag content in the filter material fig a 12 the inti2 and inti3 abundances were loq for all hfe s table a 4 filter material biofilms the range of antibiotic resistome proportions was similar in the prokaryotic communities of fmbs of the hfs on days 0 0 18 0 22 and 35 0 19 0 21 irrespective of treatment fig 1c the resistomes were dominated by multidrug bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance types as well as target alteration and rnd type efflux resistance mechanisms figs 1c a 4c in total 219 arg subtypes were detected across the hfs with virtually no differences between sampling times or treatments in the total and average subtype numbers of the two treatment replicates table a 3 among the quantified args baca erm 35 and sul1 were the most abundant 105 107 copies g dw while the abundance of ermf and acrb genes remained loq in all treatment units throughout the experiment table a 11 all args were markedly more abundant near the inlets of the hfs while the rest of the filters boasted approximately 10 fold lower arg levels fig 4b no clear spatial tendencies were observed in the relative abundance of args in the hfs fig a 8b the integration of microbial genera and arg data indicated less variation among day 35 samples compared to day 0 and a general shift from day 0 to day 35 irrespective of treatment was noted along the second axis of the mcia fig 5d the relative abundance of args had a major effect on sample ordination along the first and second axes while gene abundances contributed the most to the variance along the second axis fig 5f the individual variables with the strongest effect on the data variance from each analyzed dataset are depicted in fig a 14 the ag content in the hfs explained 36 of the variance in arg abundances and 30 of the variance in relative abundances in the fmbs of the hfs svm fig a 10e g the abundances of sul1 mexf catq and tetq showed strong positive correlations with ag content while no relationships were detected between the relative abundance of args and ag content in the hfs fig a 10f h the metagenomes of the hfs showed less variation between filters in integron integrase gene related parameters compared to vfs with almost no variation in time on both sampling occasions 38 42 of the obtained sequences were affiliated with plasmids 0 26 0 32 were found to be inti1 3 sequences and 80 87 of the latter were found from plasmid sequences with no differences between treatments table a 8 similar to the abundance of args the detected inti1 and inti3 genes showed an average abundance 10 fold higher near the inlets of the hfs compared to the rest of the filters table a 11 in the case of relative abundances a decreasing tendency from the inlet area toward the outlet area was also prevalent in hfe s except for filters 3 control and 4 agnp treatment no significant relationships with ag concentration in the hfe s or filter materials were found for the inti genes in the hfs fig a 10 however strong positive partial correlations between inti3 tetc and silp abundances in fmbs were recorded in these filters fig a 11 3 2 the removal efficiency of args and inti genes in the treatment system the removal of args and inti genes in the treated water in the vfs reached a reduction of 0 7 to 2 log for individual genes although no significant differences were recorded between the different treatments the average gene abundance reduction rate tended to be in the order of agnp agno3 control table 1 in all treatments aada acrb blactx m catq and inti2 were always reduced to 15 of the influent levels in some vfs regardless of the treatment an increase in erm 35 and inti3 gene abundance compared to the ins was recorded table a 12 canonical correlation analysis indicated that arg re was strongly related to the treatment efficiency of vfs the full model explained a substantial portion about 94 of the variance shared between the arg re and te variable sets table a 13 the canonical correlation analysis first function was negatively related to all measured args particularly blactx m sul2 catq and baca fig 6 a this function was also negatively related to all the measured te values the canonical variate based on the water te values especially toc and nh4 n and explained 59 9 of the arg te variation the re of target genes from water in hfs was of similar magnitude to that in vfs and the average reduction rates except for blactx m mexf and sul2 tended to follow the order of agnp agno3 control the removal of erm 35 genes was significantly lower in the agnp treated filters than in the control hfs table 1 the canonical correlation found a slightly weaker relationship between arg reduction and the te of hfs canonical r2 0 74 p 0 01 than that of vfs the canonical correlation analysis first function was positively related to all measured args however blactx m sul2 and catq had the highest structure coefficient values fig 6b in hfs the canonical variate based on the water te values especially toc and ntot explained three times less 18 9 of the arg te variation than in the case of vfs in the whole hybrid system the removal rates of targeted genes in some cases were 4 logs tet genes which exceeded the 16s rrna gene removal table a 12 contrary to the results of separate vf and hf analyses the analysis of the combined system revealed that the re of half of the targeted genes aada erm 35 sul1 teta tetc tetq and inti1 were significantly hampered with agnp treatment compared to the control in addition the re of teta and tetq remained significantly lower in agno3 treated systems compared to the control systems table 1 in the hybrid system effluents the levels of args and inti genes except baca and erm 35 were reduced to 0 9 with agnp treatment 0 4 with agno3 treatment and 0 3 in the control subsystems effluent compared with the system in the re of erm 35 and baca were the lowest among detected genes in the hybrid system reaching 5 of the in level table a 12 notably the re in the combined treatment system was more inert toward fluctuations than individual filters where poor arg removal in the vf was compensated for by high removal rates in the following hf and vice versa table a 12 according to canonical correlation analysis arg re was related to the te of the hybrid system canonical r2 0 90 p 0 001 the first function of the canonical correlation analysis was negatively related to blactx m sul2 and catq fig 6c the canonical variate based on the water te values especially toc and ntot explained 27 3 of the arg re variation 3 3 pathogens all 90 species of clinically relevant and potential pathogens from the card v 3 0 8 list were detected from the metagenomes of the in vfe s vfs and hfs on days 0 and 35 table a 14 a 15 with vf and hf fmbs forming distinct groups upon clustering fig 7 pathogens accounted for 0 84 0 07 of the prokaryotic community of the in with enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli being the most prevalent organisms at both times in vfe s on day 0 pathogens formed 0 78 0 08 of the community with e coli mycobacteroides abscessus and legionella pneumophila being prominent species on day 35 the pathogen proportions in all treatments were in the range of 0 62 0 98 and clustered separately from day 0 vfe s on the heat map with the most abundant pathogens being similar to those of the ins namely e faecium and e coli fig 7 among the major pathogens 0 02 in vfe s only salmonella enterica showed a strong positive relationship with ag content in vfe s while burkholderia pseudomallei exhibited moderate positive relationships and klebsiella pneumoniae moderate negative relationships with ag content both in the effluent and filter material of vfs in addition several low proportion pathogens in vfe s were affected by the ag content serratia liquefaciens and streptococcus pyogenes proportions were positively related to the ag content of both the effluent and filter material while streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus agalactiae exhibited a negative relationship with ag content in effluents fig a 15 the args showing strong positive correlations with pathogen proportions in vfe s most frequently were tetw tolc aada and teto fig a 16 in the fmbs of vfs pathogens formed 0 57 0 07 of the community on day 0 by day 35 the proportion of pathogens had increased slightly in most of the filters up to 0 63 0 05 predominantly due to an increase in the pseudomonas species proportion the heatmap shows a separate clustering of day 0 and day 35 samples by their pathogenic community structure at the time and reveals higher similarity between the two ag treatments than between ag treated and control filters fig 7 of the major pathogens burkholderia cenocepacia showed a moderate positive relationship and clostridium botulinum and m abscessus showed a moderate negative correlation with the ag content in the filter material among the low proportion pathogens clostridium tetani listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter coli were negatively correlated and burkholderia cepacia ralstonia mannitolytica and moraxella catarrhalis were positively correlated with the ag content in the filter material fig a 17 multidrug resistance encoding acrb and ceob showed strong positive correlations with pathogen proportions in the fmbs of vfs the correlations also suggest the presence of a multidrug mdtbc complex on neisseria gonorrhoeae and r mannitolilytica fig a 18 the proportion of pathogens in hf fmbs was similar on days 0 and 35 0 36 0 02 and 0 35 0 01 respectively and between the different treatment filters pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were the most prominently detected species fig 7 neither relationships between pathogen proportions and ag content nor strong positive correlations between pathogens and args were found in hfs 4 discussion this study assessed the effect of a 100 fold increase in ag concentration in the form of agnps and ionic ag on args removal from wastewater initially having ag content of typical contemporary urban wastewater cervantes aviles et al 2019 a previous study on this experiment showed that the carbon and nitrogen removal efficiency of the hybrid system was not affected by the increased ag content and most of the introduced ag was bound to the filter material particles of the upper 10 cm layer of vfs truu et al 2022 furthermore the agnps and ionic ag had no substantial effect on the microbial community structure of fmbs indicating the absence of significant selective pressure of ag compounds on microbes in the hybrid system this study showed that the removal rates of args in the hybrid system reached 2 4 5 logs and over 99 of the args were removed regardless of treatment comparable to or even exceeding the efficiencies of hybrid systems reported to date hazra and durso 2022 moreover the arg removal rates were comparable to those of the best conventional wwtps hazra and durso 2022 as well as with sewage treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration hiller et al 2019 although this study detected slightly lower removal 95 of bacitracin and mls resistance genes in all treatments compared to other args the re exceeded previous reports for these args in cws chen et al 2016 the arg re was strongly related to the re of other pollutants in the hybrid system particularly in vfs this finding complements previous knowledge that higher system te also includes more efficient removal of args in cws nõlvak et al 2013 however in the hybrid system the abundance and removal of args were susceptible to an increased ag concentration in wastewater and filter materials which elicited higher arg abundance and reduced arg re this effect probably stems from a combination of several contributing mechanisms in ag treated filters including the total prokaryotic community abundance related increase in args hosts numbers truu et al 2022 showed increased abundance of prokaryotic community in the effluents of ag treated filters of this experimental system caused by decreased efficiency of microbes removal or increased biofilm shearing the abundances of many args have shown simultaneous equivalent size reduction with the total microbial community abundance in treated water and stream water receiving treatment system effluent du et al 2020 tiirik et al 2021 in addition selective pressure of ag compounds on the antibiotic resistome and promotion of horizontal gene transfer frequency of arg carrying mobile genetic elements mges can be behind the higher arg abundances in effluences of ag treatments collargol had a stronger effect on the abundance of args in treated water than ionic ag possibly because of the slow and long term release of ag ions from agnps yang et al 2014 the arg abundances in the fmbs of all treatments were in a similar range to the previous cw studies sabri et al 2021 nevertheless a slightly higher diversity of arg subtypes within agnp treatment and an ag related increase in sulfonamide resistance encoding genes abundance in the resistomes of vf fmbs indicated the selective pressure of ag compounds on the antibiotic resistome of vfs of the studied hybrid system the following more inert hfs showed no differences between the fmb resistomes of different treatments and mitigated the spread of more diverse resistomes to the environment via final effluent however the data analysis revealed that the re of three args blactx m sul2 catq not affected by the addition of agnps was tightly linked to the system s re of organic matter and nitrogen compounds the args showing increased relative abundances in the effluents and filter material and significantly reduced re in water of this study system in response to elevated ag content in the wastewater have been found on mges including integrons sul1 aada conjugative plasmids and transposons teta tetc tetq often together with metal resistance genes gillings 2014 partridge et al 2018 smith et al 2001 moreover the number of integrons and plasmids can increase in microbial communities under the stress of environmental pollution including heavy metal pollution gillings 2014 in support of this observation this study found slightly elevated plasmid content and high inti1 and inti2 plasmid affiliation in all ag treated vfe s as well as high abundance and relative abundance of inti1 in the hfe s of collargol treated hybrid subsystems both agnps and ag can significantly increase the conjugative gene transfer frequency by increasing cell membrane permeability via the generation of reactive oxygen species with agnps enhancing conjugation at a lower initial concentration than ag lu et al 2020 in addition a stronger positive effect of agnps on integron abundance than ag was shown in sequencing batch reactors ma et al 2016 these results suggest that the increase in agnp concentration in wastewater reduces arg re and affects arg levels in hybrid system effluent probably by promoting the hgt potential of args located on mges and selectively boosting their proportion in the prokaryotic community resistome similar to the microbial communities of fmbs of hybrid system filters truu et al 2022 negative and positive correlations between ag content and prokaryotic genera several of them including pathogenic species were recorded in the vfe s the pathogenic segments of the prokaryotic communities of the system in and vfe s of all treatments were typical of sewage dominated by enteric bacteria of the genera escherichia salmonella enterococcus shigella and klebsiella de oliveira et al 2020 makowska et al 2021 which frequently carry args and metal resistance genes li et al 2017 numerous strong correlations between these pathogens and arg proportions recorded in vf fmbs and vfe s suggest an even wider spread of antibiotic resistance in the species of these genera than was known based on resistomes in the card database however non pathogenic strains may also contribute to this correlation since the species level resolution is insufficient to differentiate between closely related pathogenic and non pathogenic strains of the same species of the major pathogens a positive correlation between s enterica and ag content in vfe s was recorded whereas no strong relationships between pathogenic species proportions and args and ag concentrations were detected in hf fmbs suggesting a reduced risk of the spread of antibiotic resistant pathogens from hybrid treatment systems regardless of the amount and form of ag in the treated water 5 conclusions the hybrid treatment system s arg re was comparable to that of other wastewater treatment systems and related to the system s te elevated wastewater ag concentration especially in the form of collargol promoted arg abundance and reduced their re resulting in significantly higher arg discharge to the environment via the hybrid system s effluent significantly enhanced relative abundances of sulfonamide sul1 sul2 aminoglycoside aada and tetracycline teta tetc tetq resistance genes in collargol and to a lesser extent agno3 treated subsystems indicated that args commonly found on mges gain a selective advantage in hybrid system microbial communities in the presence of elevated ag levels especially agnps in wastewater higher plasmid and integron integrase genes especially inti1 levels in response to collargol indicated the substantial role of agnps in the promotion of hgt in hybrid cws elevated ag content in wastewater promoted the proportion of several pathogenic microbial taxa in biofilm and effluent of vertical flow units of the treatment system the effect of agnps on the nature and characteristics of prominent resistance genes located on mges in cws requires further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14807,recent studies have reported conflicting results on the effects of biofouling on the adsorption behavior of microplastics mps however the underlying mechanisms driving the adsorption of mps undergoing biofouling in aquatic environments remain unclear this study examined the interactions between polyamide pa polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene pe with two phytoplankton namely cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa and microalgae chlorella vulgaris results indicated that mp effects on phytoplankton were dose and crystalline type dependent with m aeruginosa being more sensitive to mp exposure than c vulgaris in the inhibitory order pa pe pvc analysis of antibiotic adsorption of the mps showed significant contributions from ch π interactions on pe and pvc and hydrogen bonding on pa which decreased with phytoplankton biofouling and aging meanwhile higher levels of extracellular polymeric substances on microalgae aged mps compared to cyanobacteria aged mps were conducive to adsorption of antibiotics mainly through hydrophobic interactions overall promotional and anti promotional adsorption of antibiotics on mps was induced by biofouling and aging of microalgae and cyanobacteria respectively this study provides deep insights into the specific mechanisms by which biofouling affects mp adsorption in aquatic environments thus advancing our understanding of this critical environmental issue graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics phytoplankton interactions specific biofouling antibiotics adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction improper disposal of plastic waste leads to massive accumulation in landfills and water bodies where it fragments into microplastics mps due to environmental factors amaral zettler et al 2020 aquatic biota including microalgae and cyanobacteria can be severely affected by mps with the extent depending on mp type and concentrations cell species and contact duration parsai et al 2022 for instance polyvinyl chloride pvc above 250 mg l disrupted electron transport in chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis flosaquae while polypropylene showed no effect wu et al 2019 similarly 100 mg l of polyamide pa inhibited the growth of microcystis aeruginosa by downregulating electron genes responsible for light capture and energy transfer zheng et al 2022 conversely in response to stress these phytoplankton produce extracellular polymeric substances epss harbored by mps leading to surface biofouling aging and metamorphosis of the intrinsic properties of mps and consequently altering their affinity for contaminant of emerging concerns cecs chia et al 2020 to date research on the effects of biofouling on mp adsorption potential has been ambiguous recently it was reviewed by he and colleagues that biofouling could enhance mp adsorption capacity by enriching their surfaces with functional groups that form hydrogen bondings with cec moieties j he et al 2022 microalgae induced biofouling on pe and pvc has shown to increase adsorption of bisphenols by 6 8 fold via hydrogen bonds kiki et al 2022 sewage and lake immersion of pe and polystyrene promoted metal adsorption through biofilm formation and surface hydrophobicity alteration wang et al 2020 in contrast zhang et al 2022a observed significantly lower adsorption of cecs on 3 biofilm covered mps after 55 days of lake immersion and aging similarly limited adsorption of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic cecs by microbial biofilm aged mps has been demonstrated ho et al 2020 therefore biofilm formation on mps can either increase or decrease their adsorption capacity which may depend on the parent biomolecule but remains unclear prokaryotic and eukaryotic biofilms have been observed on different mp substrates in aquatic environments miao et al 2022 which can alter mp adsorption in a cell specific manner as the interaction between mp and phytoplankton is specific there is a knowledge gap on how the specific factors modulate mp adsorption during biofouling in aquatic environments the eco toxicity of mp and the associated effects during exposure to phytoplankton could significantly affect adsorption potential of mp which is not yet understood in parallel anthropogenic activities contribute to increasing antibiotic loads in aquatic environments and their adsorption onto mps has been shown to increase their bioavailability to aquatic organisms which is amplified by mp aging zhang et al 2022b limited data exists on multiclass antibiotic adsorption on aged mps with specific biofilm influences and understanding this accumulation is crucial for ecological risk assessment as biofilm coatings can trigger olfactory foraging for ingestion savoca et al 2017 previous studies have focused on mp ecotoxicological effects on phytoplankton neglecting the fate and cec accumulation potential of mp after exposure to phytoplankton our hypothesis posits that phytoplankton mp interactions are specific and modulate mp adsorption with aims of comprehensively study the mutual interactions between mps and phytoplankton and implications on mp adsorption potential we exposed two class different phytoplankton namely microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris to three common mps polyethylene pe pvc and pa and performed the adsorption of antibiotics onto cyanobacterial microalgal aged mps emphasis were placed for investigating the mechanisms underlying the interactions between mps and each phytoplankton and examining the specific influence of phytoplankton species on mp biofouling and its subsequent influence on mp antibiotic adsorption this study would provide deep insights into the complex interactions between mps and aquatic organisms and important implications for a better understanding of mp fate and antibiotic accumulation behavior after specific biofouling and aging in aquatic environments 2 materials and

growth inhibition respectively fig 1e and f lower concentrations of pvc 10 100 mg l and pe 10 25 mg l stimulated the growth of c vulgaris while higher concentrations inhibited growth at 250 mg l pa pe and pvc inhibited c vulgaris growth rate by 56 40 and 13 respectively compared to 120 54 and 30 for m aeruginosa it was found that 250 mg l pa was lethal to m aeruginosa as it not only inhibited growth but also caused cell death a negative growth rate was observed and the reported inhibition rate 120 was not a measure of growth but a measure of the effect of 250 mg l pa on biomass 3 1 2 mps in cyanobacteria microalgae media v mps in contact with the phytoplankton cyanobacteria or microalgae exhibited remarkable surface changes including adhesion of cells and components deep ridges folds fractures and protrusions fig 2 biofilm formation on aged mps was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy which revealed variations in assembly depending on mp properties including particle size and surface smoothness fig 3 cv mps showed stronger and more fluorescent areas indicating polysaccharides in the surface attached biofilm than ma mps significantly higher p 0 01 content of polysaccharides and proteins was detected on cv mps than ma mps likely due to the varying biomass of cyanobacteria microalgae in each medium fig s2a after 30 day incubation the eps production of both phytoplankton in the control treatments showed no significant difference p 0 01 fig s2b fluorescence analysis of the eps revealed similar components in the adherent biofilm on ma mps and cv mps mainly composed of tryptophan and humic acid like table s2 excitation emission wavelengths ex em at 275 325 and 260 450 represent the presence of protein like and fluvic acid like on ma pa and ma pe respectively furthermore after 30 days incubation of v mps in cyanobacteria media a higher amount of mr lc toxin was adsorbed on ma pvc 1428 3 ng g than on ma pa 302 8 ng g and ma pe 29 28 ng g over aging fig s4 the chemical alteration of the v mps was investigated ft ir spectra 2d synchronous and asynchronous cos mapping correlation signs and possible aging pathways of the v mps by cyanobacteria microalgae are presented in figs s5 and s6 table s3 and fig 4 the specific analysis is presented in text s10 briefly conjunctive analysis revealed that v pa underwent bond cleavages in the sequence of n h bending n h stretching ch2 stretching c o stretching and c o stretching n h stretching ch2 stretching n h bending during exposure to cyanobacteria and microalgae respectively v pvc underwent bond cleavages in the order ch stretching c cl stretching c c bending during exposure to both phytoplankton and for pe the cleavages in the sequence c h bending c h rocking ch2 symmetric stretching appeared in both media in addition the main features of virgin and aged mps are summarized in table 1 with descriptive details in text s11 xrd patterns revealed increasing crystallinity of the v mps after contact with the phytoplankton suggesting that the aging process mainly targeted the glassy regions of the v mps the water contact angle of the v mps decreased significantly upon aging with a substantial loss of surface hydrophobicity the hr xps highlighted that phytoplankton biofouling and aging increased the o c ratio in the v mps 3 2 antibiotic adsorption 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics and isotherms fig 5 a displays the mean adsorption profile over time of 100 µg l mixed antibiotics by virgin and aged mps the v mps reached apparent equilibrium in 15 min with v pa showing a slightly higher adsorption capacity than v pvc and v pe ranging from 1 70 to 2 44 µg g fig s8 equilibrium adsorption values varied from 0 68 to 2 37 µg g for v pvc and from 0 67 to 2 09 µg g for v pe compared to the v mps adsorption equilibrium on ma mps and cv mps was delayed and antibiotic type dependent the adsorption of the most hydrophilic antibiotics such as smr smx and tmp was reduced after aging except of smx on aged pvc and pe fig s8 furthermore the cv mps showed a significantly t test p 0 001 faster rate of adsorption compared to ma mps for almost all antibiotics especially for the less hydrophilic antibiotics rox cla flu and lev fig 5a meanwhile the adsorption kinetics demonstrated relatively good correlation with pseudo first order and pseudo second order models fig s8 suggesting that both chemisorption and physisorption mechanisms occurred during the interactions of the antibiotics and the adsorbents adsorption isotherms fig 5b could provide valuable information on the interaction mechanisms between antibiotics and mps the langmuir model suggests homogeneous surface adsorption the freundlich model indicates heterogeneous surface adsorption and the linear model assumes adsorption proportional to antibiotic concentration a high fit of each of these models was observed fig s9 and tables s4 s6 implying occurrence of different interactions during antibiotic adsorption onto the mps the surface conformation bet type of pa and pvc was hardly changed during the aging data not shown reflecting a close race of multilayer and monolayer in the adsorption process antibiotic adsorption onto cv mps was 2 43 3 07 times higher than that on ma mps in the order cv mps v mps ma mps fig 5b besides hydrophobic interactions between antibiotics and mps were verified by plotting logkd versus antibiotic logkow fig s10 the cv mps showed a strong partitioning correlation with the antibiotics 94 for cv pe 92 for cv pvc and 67 for cv pa indicating that hydrophobic interactions played a key role in the adsorption of antibiotics onto cv mps 3 2 2 effect of ph the zeta potential test showed that the surface of v mps and aged mps was negatively charged at ph 7 and at all ph values respectively fig s11 the specific ph effect on the adsorption potential is presented in fig s12 which is discussed in text s12 the results showed that increasing ph hampered the adsorption of most compounds onto the aged mps suggesting that the adherent biofilm mediates the adsorption of antibiotics as alkalinity has been shown to disrupt biofilms nostro et al 2012 3 3 interaction mechanisms the ft ir spectra of the mps before and after adsorption are presented in fig 6 no new peaks were observed in the spectra of the pa family v pa ma pa and cv pa after adsorption while vibrational strains in the nh stretching region 3600 3800 cm 1 were detected suggesting the involvement of the amide group through hydrogen the spectra of v pvc and ma pvc showed more hints at 1450 1800 cm 1 region ch bending after adsorption for pe family vibrations at 720 and 1400 1700 cm 1 attributed to ch rocking and scissoring suggested ch π interactions between the alkyl groups and antibiotic aromatic rings during adsorption on v pe ma pe showed a prominent stretch at ch scissoring region in the post adsorption spectrum suggesting ch π interactions high resolution xps analysis revealed further insights into the adsorption mechanisms figs 7 and s14 for the pa family v pa and ma pa showed no significant changes in the c1s deconvolution spectra while o coh bonds were obtained after adsorption from the o c in deconvolution spectra of o1s suggesting the involvement of o c groups in hydrogen bond formation for v pvc and ma pvc a new peak in the c1s after adsorption assigned to o coh confirmed the contribution of ch to the adsorption from coh spectra of c1s the yield of c o in v pe and the area increment in ma pe indicated binding from the alkyl chains he et al 2022 furthermore the increased intensity of the cn hydrophobic in cv pa after adsorption indicates the prevalence of hydrophobic interactions 4 discussion 4 1 mutual pressure of mp and phytoplankton in aquatic environment 4 1 1 mp tension on phytoplankton community mps are in constant contact with phytoplankton in aquatic environments and mutual interactions depend on mp type phytoplankton community and physiology this study found that mp toxicity occurred in the order pa pe pvc with c vulgaris showing greater tolerance than m aeruginosa pa lethality on m aeruginosa and pvc hormesis on c vulgaris have been reported manzi et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 in the latter case mp could serve as a nutrient source mostly at low concentrations parsai et al 2022 since the average size of mps table 1 is larger than that of phytoplankton 10 μm inhibition by mp ingestion was not likely the smallest sized pa induced the highest inhibition indicating that mp size was not the main factor contributing to toxicity while pa particles were observed to affect m aeruginosa the leachates had no effect text s1 suggesting a physical rather than chemical effect of mp on the phytoplankton the mp crystallinity followed the order pa pe pvc amorphous fig s1 table 1 consistent with their inhibitory activity therefore the glassy nature of mps triggers the toxicity process in hydrodynamics mps interact with the phytoplankton through their cell wall which serves as the primary stressor barrier c vulgaris has a thicker cell wall 100 200 nm than m aeruginosa 10 20 nm and may show increased resistance to the effects of mps the smaller size and larger surface volume ratio of cyanobacteria make them vulnerable to hydrophobic toxic substances in eukaryotic cells pollutants would cross a double membrane chloroplasts and mitochondria to reach the site of action while chloroplasts are absent in cyanobacteria 4 1 2 phytoplankton biofouling mp eps the main component of biofilms self assembles on mps depending on mp surface energy roughness polarity and degree of charge reisser et al 2014 in this study v pe s larger size and smoother surface table 1 fig 2 led to dense biofilm formation on its surface fig 3 the eps attached to mp surface correlated with the toxicity induced by the mps suggesting that mp lethality inhibited not only the growth and functions of the phytoplankton community but also eps production and the extent of mp biofouling fluorescence analysis showed a slight difference between the eps component type harbored by both aged mps indicating that the variation in mp biofouling between m aeruginosa or c vulgaris was quantitative rather than qualitative the hepatotoxin mc lr released by m aeruginosa should not be overlooked as a result of biofouling mps could be potential vectors of mc lr and metabolites pestana et al 2021 v pvc caused less damage to m aeruginosa cells explaining the highest mc lr adsorption of ma pvc during co cultures intracellular mc lr could be released into water after cell death and lysis and adsorbed on the porous surface of ma pa while mc lr adsorption on ma pe might be ph dependent pestana et al 2021 in addition the release of active and reactive organic matters including enzymes and celluloses by the phytoplankton are capable of corroding aging and degrading v mp surfaces and pores chia et al 2020 spectroscopic analysis revealed cleavage of the main polymer bonds of the v mps fig 4 including scission dehydrogenation and dechlorination jiang et al 2020 which are important functional groups for adsorption of cecs in aquatic environment 4 2 impacts of biofouling on mp adsorption potential this study found no significant difference p 0 05 in the antibiotic adsorption capacity of virgin mps despite differences in surface texture and area similar observations were made by gonzález pleiter et al 2021 during adsorption of azithromycin and cla onto 4 mps while guo et al 2019 found higher adsorption of smx on pa than other mps possibly due to non competitive adsorption the absence of the benzene ring in the v mp structure would limit π π interactions that have been shown to govern sulfonamide adsorption zhao et al 2022 the expected higher absorption of macrolides cla and rox due to their lower hydrophilicity among the antibiotics was not evident in this study nevertheless mp biofouling could alter structure and adsorption behavior of v mps upon phytoplankton exposure there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the adsorption capacity of microalgae aged mps cv mps and cyanobacterial aged mps ma mps cv mps showed the highest maximum adsorption capacities qmax in the order cv mps v mps ma mps ftir and xps analysis revealed the role of the amide group through hydrogen bonding during antibiotic adsorption on v pa while ch acted as a proton donor for the formation of ch π bondings on v pvc and v pe ch π interactions are closely related to the van der wall interactions due to their weak binding energies hobza 2008 and have been shown to be an important mechanism involved in the adsorption of antibiotics on mps wang et al 2021 during contact with the phytoplankton the functional groups of v mps active in the adsorption of antibiotics were attacked and cleaved which would make the aged mps less prone to adsorption a substantial loss of surface hydrophobicity of the v mps was observed during the aging process table 1 jiang et al 2023 observed that the decrease in adsorption potential of mps was connected to their loss in hydrophobicity however the adherent biofilm on aged mps contains epss that could provide various functional groups for adsorption through bindings such as hydrophobic interactions electrostatic attraction and surface complexation the sturdy biofouling discovered on the cv mps was conducive to antibiotic adsorption for which the strong logkd and logkow relationship indicated hydrophobic interactions fig s10 this study found that adsorption of antibiotics onto c vulgaris and m aeruginosa cells was quasi non existent text s5 hence antibiotic adsorption onto the aged mps was relevant to the complex aged mp polymer matrix and biofilm cv mps showed faster rate of adsorption than ma mps for most antibiotics with adsorption promoted on cv mps and inhibited on ma mps previous studies emphasized on the hydrogen bonds in the enriched oxygen containing groups controlling interactions between biofouled mps and antibiotics or water matrices he et al 2022 wang et al 2021 antibiotic carbonyl groups engaging with mp biofilm s amine hydroxyl carboxyl groups could enhance antibiotic adsorption or the latter could enable hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules thereby reducing covalent interactions with antibiotics aged mp solutions may have behaved similarly with hydrophobic partitions only appearing on the cv mp surface likely due to the relatively high content of eps adhesives discovered on cv mp surface and pores the eps mediated conjugation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions could also favorably occur during antibiotic adsorption onto cv mps he et al 2022 investigation of the ph effect showed that with the exception of ma pe adsorption on aged mps was reduced under alkaline conditions fig s12 alkalinity has been shown to disrupt the structural stability of biofilms nostro et al 2012 highlighting the key role of the biofilm in the adsorption however a poor correlation between the logkd adsorption of ma mps and the logkow values of the antibiotics fig s10 may be due to the relatively lower amount of eps on ma mps which was insufficient for efficient hydrophobic interaction on their surface m aeruginosa cell debris and mc lr could potentially hinder the adsorption of polar antibiotics on ma mps by blocking their active sites mc lr is also known for its inhibitory potency on phosphatase specific binding activity in epss honkanen et al 1990 which might weaken the eps adhesive function in the biofilm on ma mp and make it less reactive in addition there may be competition during biofouling where pre colonizing components or pre adsorbed chemicals could weaken the activity of polysaccharides and proteins in the biofilm and lead to reduced electron transfer reactivity for external adsorption flemming et al 2016 4 3 implications mps can be mistaken for prey by filter feeders or inadvertently ingested along with mp adsorbed cecs adsorption of antibiotics to mps can increase their bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms this could potentially increase the bioavailability and uptake of mps and any adsorbed contaminants including antibiotics by these organisms concurrently biofouling and aging through bond scissions may undermine the potential of polymeric functional groups that are active during adsorption hydrogen bonding ch π electrostatic affinity were the interactions between antibiotics and mps discovered in this study which could be weakened by aging and bond scission during contact with phytoplankton meanwhile the complexity and richness of biofilm eps attached to mps may reinforce the surface or internal structure of the mps for restored and consequent adsorption the acute effect of mp observed on m aeruginosa resulted in repressed eps secretion and unimportant biofouling of mps while the greater tolerance of c vulgaris implied sufficient biofouling of mps conducive to hydrophobic adsorption of antibiotics in summary the responses of biofilm forming organisms to mp stress in aquatic environments would result in specific biofouling and aging that significantly affect the adsorption potential of mp depending on the organism s tolerance and the degree of mp biofouling enriched biofouling would promote the adsorption of cecs by the mps which could lead to further hazards and risks from food chain contamination and bioaccumulation this work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the ecological implications of mps and provides a basis for developing effective strategies to mitigate their impact on aquatic ecosystems and human health 5 conclusions this study illustrates the interplay between mps and phytoplankton and for the first time how it can affect mp adsorption of antibiotics in aquatic environments the differential response of m aeruginosa and c vulgaris to mp exposure suggested that different phytoplankton species may have varying levels of tolerance to mps and impact mp aging and biofouling which in turn affect mp ability to adsorb antibiotics the weakening of chemically active functional groups on mp surfaces due to phytoplankton aging could have significant implications for the fate and transport of antibiotics in aquatic environment furthermore the finding that hydrophobic interactions play a role in promoting antibiotic adsorption onto microalgae aged mps through the adherent biofilm underscores that the adsorption fate of mp undergoing biofouling depends on the tolerance of phytoplankton cells and the extent of mp biofouling our findings highlight the importance of considering the role of biofilms and aging in understanding the accumulation of pollutants on mps in aquatic environments further research is needed to better understand the coexistence of mps phytoplankton and cecs in aquatic environments credit authorship contribution statement claude kiki conceptualization methodology

14807,recent studies have reported conflicting results on the effects of biofouling on the adsorption behavior of microplastics mps however the underlying mechanisms driving the adsorption of mps undergoing biofouling in aquatic environments remain unclear this study examined the interactions between polyamide pa polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene pe with two phytoplankton namely cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa and microalgae chlorella vulgaris results indicated that mp effects on phytoplankton were dose and crystalline type dependent with m aeruginosa being more sensitive to mp exposure than c vulgaris in the inhibitory order pa pe pvc analysis of antibiotic adsorption of the mps showed significant contributions from ch π interactions on pe and pvc and hydrogen bonding on pa which decreased with phytoplankton biofouling and aging meanwhile higher levels of extracellular polymeric substances on microalgae aged mps compared to cyanobacteria aged mps were conducive to adsorption of antibiotics mainly through hydrophobic interactions overall promotional and anti promotional adsorption of antibiotics on mps was induced by biofouling and aging of microalgae and cyanobacteria respectively this study provides deep insights into the specific mechanisms by which biofouling affects mp adsorption in aquatic environments thus advancing our understanding of this critical environmental issue graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics phytoplankton interactions specific biofouling antibiotics adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction improper disposal of plastic waste leads to massive accumulation in landfills and water bodies where it fragments into microplastics mps due to environmental factors amaral zettler et al 2020 aquatic biota including microalgae and cyanobacteria can be severely affected by mps with the extent depending on mp type and concentrations cell species and contact duration parsai et al 2022 for instance polyvinyl chloride pvc above 250 mg l disrupted electron transport in chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis flosaquae while polypropylene showed no effect wu et al 2019 similarly 100 mg l of polyamide pa inhibited the growth of microcystis aeruginosa by downregulating electron genes responsible for light capture and energy transfer zheng et al 2022 conversely in response to stress these phytoplankton produce extracellular polymeric substances epss harbored by mps leading to surface biofouling aging and metamorphosis of the intrinsic properties of mps and consequently altering their affinity for contaminant of emerging concerns cecs chia et al 2020 to date research on the effects of biofouling on mp adsorption potential has been ambiguous recently it was reviewed by he and colleagues that biofouling could enhance mp adsorption capacity by enriching their surfaces with functional groups that form hydrogen bondings with cec moieties j he et al 2022 microalgae induced biofouling on pe and pvc has shown to increase adsorption of bisphenols by 6 8 fold via hydrogen bonds kiki et al 2022 sewage and lake immersion of pe and polystyrene promoted metal adsorption through biofilm formation and surface hydrophobicity alteration wang et al 2020 in contrast zhang et al 2022a observed significantly lower adsorption of cecs on 3 biofilm covered mps after 55 days of lake immersion and aging similarly limited adsorption of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic cecs by microbial biofilm aged mps has been demonstrated ho et al 2020 therefore biofilm formation on mps can either increase or decrease their adsorption capacity which may depend on the parent biomolecule but remains unclear prokaryotic and eukaryotic biofilms have been observed on different mp substrates in aquatic environments miao et al 2022 which can alter mp adsorption in a cell specific manner as the interaction between mp and phytoplankton is specific there is a knowledge gap on how the specific factors modulate mp adsorption during biofouling in aquatic environments the eco toxicity of mp and the associated effects during exposure to phytoplankton could significantly affect adsorption potential of mp which is not yet understood in parallel anthropogenic activities contribute to increasing antibiotic loads in aquatic environments and their adsorption onto mps has been shown to increase their bioavailability to aquatic organisms which is amplified by mp aging zhang et al 2022b limited data exists on multiclass antibiotic adsorption on aged mps with specific biofilm influences and understanding this accumulation is crucial for ecological risk assessment as biofilm coatings can trigger olfactory foraging for ingestion savoca et al 2017 previous studies have focused on mp ecotoxicological effects on phytoplankton neglecting the fate and cec accumulation potential of mp after exposure to phytoplankton our hypothesis posits that phytoplankton mp interactions are specific and modulate mp adsorption with aims of comprehensively study the mutual interactions between mps and phytoplankton and implications on mp adsorption potential we exposed two class different phytoplankton namely microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris to three common mps polyethylene pe pvc and pa and performed the adsorption of antibiotics onto cyanobacterial microalgal aged mps emphasis were placed for investigating the mechanisms underlying the interactions between mps and each phytoplankton and examining the specific influence of phytoplankton species on mp biofouling and its subsequent influence on mp antibiotic adsorption this study would provide deep insights into the complex interactions between mps and aquatic organisms and important implications for a better understanding of mp fate and antibiotic accumulation behavior after specific biofouling and aging in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae cyanobacteria mps and chemicals cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa fachb 915 and microalgae chlorella vulgaris fachb 24 were obtained from the institute of hydrobiology

acetonitrile 1 1 v v and stored at 20 c 2 2 effect of mp on m aeruginosa and c vulgaris the viability of m aeruginosa and c vulgaris was assessed in the presence of individual mp pa pvc and pe at concentrations of 0 10 25 50 100 and 250 mg l wu et al 2019 in 50 ml sterilized bg11 medium ph 7 2 7 6 for 96 h of 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks flasks were shaken at 120 rpm on an orbital shaker in the growth chamber conditioned as described in section 2 1 and rearranged randomly daily for even light distribution the initial phytoplankton cell density of 1 106 cells ml 1 was maintained phytoplankton chlorophyll a content and photosynthetic activity fv fm were determined daily using a fluorometer phyto pam walz germany and growth with a hemocytometer as previously described kiki et al 2020 chemical composition effects were assessed by exposing the phytoplankton to mp leachates text s1 2 3 microplastic simulated aging by cyanobacteria and microalgae microcosms of cyanobacteria and microalgae were simulated in 1 0 l erlenmeyer flasks with 500 ml of basal glucose solution bg 11 of m aeruginosa 04 flasks and c vulgaris 04 flasks to maintain a nutrient rich medium 2 ml concentrated bg 11 solution was added periodically at an approximate density of 4 107 cells ml 1 flasks with m aeruginosa or c vulgaris were individually immersed with 5 0 g of pa pvc and pe while one flask of each phytoplankton served as a control without any mp this dosage maintained an initial concentration of 250 mg l mp against 1 106 cells ml 1 during the 30 day co culture period the ph in the solutions varied between 7 70 and 8 92 and mp mixed liquor samples were collected on day 0 7 14 21 30 stored at 20 c for mp aging study on day 30 the aged mps were harvested rinsed thoroughly to remove any unattached substances dried at ambient temperature and stored at 4 c for the aging and adsorption study part the virgin mps the mps incubated in m aeruginosa and c vulgaris media were tagged as v mps v pa v pvc v pe ma mps ma pa ma pvc ma pe and cv mps cv pa cv pvc cv pe respectively 2 4 analysis of eps attached to the aged mps and adsorbed toxin mc lr eps attached to the aged mps was extracted by heating methods and analyzed on a spark spectrophotometer microplate reader tecan switzerland details are presented in text s2 desorption and quantification methods of mc lr adsorbed by the ma mps during co culture are described in text s3 2 5 characterization methods the mps sampled at time intervals were dried at ambient temperature for structural characterization the characterization methods are described in text s4 2 6 antibiotic adsorption experiments adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the antibiotics were evaluated by placing 0 1 g v mps ma mps cv mps and 10 0 ml milli q ph 7 0 in a series of 40 3 ml amber glass vials spiked with 100 μg l and 50 1000 μg l of the mixed antibiotics respectively the antibiotic adsorption potential by the phytoplankton cells was also investigated details are given in text s5 the vials were placed in a thermostatic oscillator 150 rpm 25 c in the dark for 12 h at specific time the mixture suspension was collected centrifuged and the supernatant was carefully retrieved and stored in lc vial at 4 c the effects of solution acidity ph on the adsorption behavior were carried out with 100 μg l mixed antibiotics analytes in solution was detected by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry with details given in text s6 2 7 data processing and statistical analysis specific growth and inhibition rates were calculated according to oecd guidelines oecd 2011 with details in text s7 the 2d correlation spectroscopy 2d cos technique text s8 was used for the timely sample ft ir data to explore the aging mechanisms of v mps during phytoplankton exposure kinetics and isotherms adsorption of the mps were studied using classical models which are detailed in text s9 experimental results were presented as average standard error of the mean a t test dunnett and turkey test analysis were performed to determine significant difference using graphpad prism 9 0 3 results 3 1 interactions between mps and m aeruginosa or c vulgaris 3 1 1 effects of mps on m aeruginosa or c vulgaris mp effects were tested on chlorophyll a photosynthetic activity and growth rate of m aeruginosa and c vulgaris over 96 h incubation period increasing mp concentrations were found to impair these indicators with m aeruginosa being more affected than c vulgaris particularly by pa and pe fig 1 m aeruginosa exhibited significant p 0 001 chlorophyll a inhibition 2 64 9 41 and 8 13 by pa pe and pvc respectively while c vulgaris showed less reduction 4 18 2 8 and 8 14 in chlorophyll a fig 1a b the photosynthetic activity fv fm of m aeruginosa was more affected by mp exposure p 0 001 than c vulgaris particularly at mp dosage of 50 250 mg l fig 1c d m aeruginosa experienced a decrease in fv fm of 67 21 and 29 when exposed to 250 mg l of pa pvc and pe respectively while pa and pe affected c vulgaris fv fm by 7 26 and 1 13 c vulgaris was stimulated at a lower pvc concentration 10 50 mg l but showed 5 inhibition at 250 mg l likewise m aeruginosa growth was significantly p 0 001 inhibited by pa with inhibition ranging from 17 to 120 pe and pvc exposure resulted in 11 54 and 5 30 growth inhibition respectively fig 1e and f lower concentrations of pvc 10 100 mg l and pe 10 25 mg l stimulated the growth of c vulgaris while higher concentrations inhibited growth at 250 mg l pa pe and pvc inhibited c vulgaris growth rate by 56 40 and 13 respectively compared to 120 54 and 30 for m aeruginosa it was found that 250 mg l pa was lethal to m aeruginosa as it not only inhibited growth but also caused cell death a negative growth rate was observed and the reported inhibition rate 120 was not a measure of growth but a measure of the effect of 250 mg l pa on biomass 3 1 2 mps in cyanobacteria microalgae media v mps in contact with the phytoplankton cyanobacteria or microalgae exhibited remarkable surface changes including adhesion of cells and components deep ridges folds fractures and protrusions fig 2 biofilm formation on aged mps was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy which revealed variations in assembly depending on mp properties including particle size and surface smoothness fig 3 cv mps showed stronger and more fluorescent areas indicating polysaccharides in the surface attached biofilm than ma mps significantly higher p 0 01 content of polysaccharides and proteins was detected on cv mps than ma mps likely due to the varying biomass of cyanobacteria microalgae in each medium fig s2a after 30 day incubation the eps production of both phytoplankton in the control treatments showed no significant difference p 0 01 fig s2b fluorescence analysis of the eps revealed similar components in the adherent biofilm on ma mps and cv mps mainly composed of tryptophan and humic acid like table s2 excitation emission wavelengths ex em at 275 325 and 260 450 represent the presence of protein like and fluvic acid like on ma pa and ma pe respectively furthermore after 30 days incubation of v mps in cyanobacteria media a higher amount of mr lc toxin was adsorbed on ma pvc 1428 3 ng g than on ma pa 302 8 ng g and ma pe 29 28 ng g over aging fig s4 the chemical alteration of the v mps was investigated ft ir spectra 2d synchronous and asynchronous cos mapping correlation signs and possible aging pathways of the v mps by cyanobacteria microalgae are presented in figs s5 and s6 table s3 and fig 4 the specific analysis is presented in text s10 briefly conjunctive analysis revealed that v pa underwent bond cleavages in the sequence of n h bending n h stretching ch2 stretching c o stretching and c o stretching n h stretching ch2 stretching n h bending during exposure to cyanobacteria and microalgae respectively v pvc underwent bond cleavages in the order ch stretching c cl stretching c c bending during exposure to both phytoplankton and for pe the cleavages in the sequence c h bending c h rocking ch2 symmetric stretching appeared in both media in addition the main features of virgin and aged mps are summarized in table 1 with descriptive details in text s11 xrd patterns revealed increasing crystallinity of the v mps after contact with the phytoplankton suggesting that the aging process mainly targeted the glassy regions of the v mps the water contact angle of the v mps decreased significantly upon aging with a substantial loss of surface hydrophobicity the hr xps highlighted that phytoplankton biofouling and aging increased the o c ratio in the v mps 3 2 antibiotic adsorption 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics and isotherms fig 5 a displays the mean adsorption profile over time of 100 µg l mixed antibiotics by virgin and aged mps the v mps reached apparent equilibrium in 15 min with v pa showing a slightly higher adsorption capacity than v pvc and v pe ranging from 1 70 to 2 44 µg g fig s8 equilibrium adsorption values varied from 0 68 to 2 37 µg g for v pvc and from 0 67 to 2 09 µg g for v pe compared to the v mps adsorption equilibrium on ma mps and cv mps was delayed and antibiotic type dependent the adsorption of the most hydrophilic antibiotics such as smr smx and tmp was reduced after aging except of smx on aged pvc and pe fig s8 furthermore the cv mps showed a significantly t test p 0 001 faster rate of adsorption compared to ma mps for almost all antibiotics especially for the less hydrophilic antibiotics rox cla flu and lev fig 5a meanwhile the adsorption kinetics demonstrated relatively good correlation with pseudo first order and pseudo second order models fig s8 suggesting that both chemisorption and physisorption mechanisms occurred during the interactions of the antibiotics and the adsorbents adsorption isotherms fig 5b could provide valuable information on the interaction mechanisms between antibiotics and mps the langmuir model suggests homogeneous surface adsorption the freundlich model indicates heterogeneous surface adsorption and the linear model assumes adsorption proportional to antibiotic concentration a high fit of each of these models was observed fig s9 and tables s4 s6 implying occurrence of different interactions during antibiotic adsorption onto the mps the surface conformation bet type of pa and pvc was hardly changed during the aging data not shown reflecting a close race of multilayer and monolayer in the adsorption process antibiotic adsorption onto cv mps was 2 43 3 07 times higher than that on ma mps in the order cv mps v mps ma mps fig 5b besides hydrophobic interactions between antibiotics and mps were verified by plotting logkd versus antibiotic logkow fig s10 the cv mps showed a strong partitioning correlation with the antibiotics 94 for cv pe 92 for cv pvc and 67 for cv pa indicating that hydrophobic interactions played a key role in the adsorption of antibiotics onto cv mps 3 2 2 effect of ph the zeta potential test showed that the surface of v mps and aged mps was negatively charged at ph 7 and at all ph values respectively fig s11 the specific ph effect on the adsorption potential is presented in fig s12 which is discussed in text s12 the results showed that increasing ph hampered the adsorption of most compounds onto the aged mps suggesting that the adherent biofilm mediates the adsorption of antibiotics as alkalinity has been shown to disrupt biofilms nostro et al 2012 3 3 interaction mechanisms the ft ir spectra of the mps before and after adsorption are presented in fig 6 no new peaks were observed in the spectra of the pa family v pa ma pa and cv pa after adsorption while vibrational strains in the nh stretching region 3600 3800 cm 1 were detected suggesting the involvement of the amide group through hydrogen the spectra of v pvc and ma pvc showed more hints at 1450 1800 cm 1 region ch bending after adsorption for pe family vibrations at 720 and 1400 1700 cm 1 attributed to ch rocking and scissoring suggested ch π interactions between the alkyl groups and antibiotic aromatic rings during adsorption on v pe ma pe showed a prominent stretch at ch scissoring region in the post adsorption spectrum suggesting ch π interactions high resolution xps analysis revealed further insights into the adsorption mechanisms figs 7 and s14 for the pa family v pa and ma pa showed no significant changes in the c1s deconvolution spectra while o coh bonds were obtained after adsorption from the o c in deconvolution spectra of o1s suggesting the involvement of o c groups in hydrogen bond formation for v pvc and ma pvc a new peak in the c1s after adsorption assigned to o coh confirmed the contribution of ch to the adsorption from coh spectra of c1s the yield of c o in v pe and the area increment in ma pe indicated binding from the alkyl chains he et al 2022 furthermore the increased intensity of the cn hydrophobic in cv pa after adsorption indicates the prevalence of hydrophobic interactions 4 discussion 4 1 mutual pressure of mp and phytoplankton in aquatic environment 4 1 1 mp tension on phytoplankton community mps are in constant contact with phytoplankton in aquatic environments and mutual interactions depend on mp type phytoplankton community and physiology this study found that mp toxicity occurred in the order pa pe pvc with c vulgaris showing greater tolerance than m aeruginosa pa lethality on m aeruginosa and pvc hormesis on c vulgaris have been reported manzi et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 in the latter case mp could serve as a nutrient source mostly at low concentrations parsai et al 2022 since the average size of mps table 1 is larger than that of phytoplankton 10 μm inhibition by mp ingestion was not likely the smallest sized pa induced the highest inhibition indicating that mp size was not the main factor contributing to toxicity while pa particles were observed to affect m aeruginosa the leachates had no effect text s1 suggesting a physical rather than chemical effect of mp on the phytoplankton the mp crystallinity followed the order pa pe pvc amorphous fig s1 table 1 consistent with their inhibitory activity therefore the glassy nature of mps triggers the toxicity process in hydrodynamics mps interact with the phytoplankton through their cell wall which serves as the primary stressor barrier c vulgaris has a thicker cell wall 100 200 nm than m aeruginosa 10 20 nm and may show increased resistance to the effects of mps the smaller size and larger surface volume ratio of cyanobacteria make them vulnerable to hydrophobic toxic substances in eukaryotic cells pollutants would cross a double membrane chloroplasts and mitochondria to reach the site of action while chloroplasts are absent in cyanobacteria 4 1 2 phytoplankton biofouling mp eps the main component of biofilms self assembles on mps depending on mp surface energy roughness polarity and degree of charge reisser et al 2014 in this study v pe s larger size and smoother surface table 1 fig 2 led to dense biofilm formation on its surface fig 3 the eps attached to mp surface correlated with the toxicity induced by the mps suggesting that mp lethality inhibited not only the growth and functions of the phytoplankton community but also eps production and the extent of mp biofouling fluorescence analysis showed a slight difference between the eps component type harbored by both aged mps indicating that the variation in mp biofouling between m aeruginosa or c vulgaris was quantitative rather than qualitative the hepatotoxin mc lr released by m aeruginosa should not be overlooked as a result of biofouling mps could be potential vectors of mc lr and metabolites pestana et al 2021 v pvc caused less damage to m aeruginosa cells explaining the highest mc lr adsorption of ma pvc during co cultures intracellular mc lr could be released into water after cell death and lysis and adsorbed on the porous surface of ma pa while mc lr adsorption on ma pe might be ph dependent pestana et al 2021 in addition the release of active and reactive organic matters including enzymes and celluloses by the phytoplankton are capable of corroding aging and degrading v mp surfaces and pores chia et al 2020 spectroscopic analysis revealed cleavage of the main polymer bonds of the v mps fig 4 including scission dehydrogenation and dechlorination jiang et al 2020 which are important functional groups for adsorption of cecs in aquatic environment 4 2 impacts of biofouling on mp adsorption potential this study found no significant difference p 0 05 in the antibiotic adsorption capacity of virgin mps despite differences in surface texture and area similar observations were made by gonzález pleiter et al 2021 during adsorption of azithromycin and cla onto 4 mps while guo et al 2019 found higher adsorption of smx on pa than other mps possibly due to non competitive adsorption the absence of the benzene ring in the v mp structure would limit π π interactions that have been shown to govern sulfonamide adsorption zhao et al 2022 the expected higher absorption of macrolides cla and rox due to their lower hydrophilicity among the antibiotics was not evident in this study nevertheless mp biofouling could alter structure and adsorption behavior of v mps upon phytoplankton exposure there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the adsorption capacity of microalgae aged mps cv mps and cyanobacterial aged mps ma mps cv mps showed the highest maximum adsorption capacities qmax in the order cv mps v mps ma mps ftir and xps analysis revealed the role of the amide group through hydrogen bonding during antibiotic adsorption on v pa while ch acted as a proton donor for the formation of ch π bondings on v pvc and v pe ch π interactions are closely related to the van der wall interactions due to their weak binding energies hobza 2008 and have been shown to be an important mechanism involved in the adsorption of antibiotics on mps wang et al 2021 during contact with the phytoplankton the functional groups of v mps active in the adsorption of antibiotics were attacked and cleaved which would make the aged mps less prone to adsorption a substantial loss of surface hydrophobicity of the v mps was observed during the aging process table 1 jiang et al 2023 observed that the decrease in adsorption potential of mps was connected to their loss in hydrophobicity however the adherent biofilm on aged mps contains epss that could provide various functional groups for adsorption through bindings such as hydrophobic interactions electrostatic attraction and surface complexation the sturdy biofouling discovered on the cv mps was conducive to antibiotic adsorption for which the strong logkd and logkow relationship indicated hydrophobic interactions fig s10 this study found that adsorption of antibiotics onto c vulgaris and m aeruginosa cells was quasi non existent text s5 hence antibiotic adsorption onto the aged mps was relevant to the complex aged mp polymer matrix and biofilm cv mps showed faster rate of adsorption than ma mps for most antibiotics with adsorption promoted on cv mps and inhibited on ma mps previous studies emphasized on the hydrogen bonds in the enriched oxygen containing groups controlling interactions between biofouled mps and antibiotics or water matrices he et al 2022 wang et al 2021 antibiotic carbonyl groups engaging with mp biofilm s amine hydroxyl carboxyl groups could enhance antibiotic adsorption or the latter could enable hydrogen bonds with surrounding water molecules thereby reducing covalent interactions with antibiotics aged mp solutions may have behaved similarly with hydrophobic partitions only appearing on the cv mp surface likely due to the relatively high content of eps adhesives discovered on cv mp surface and pores the eps mediated conjugation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions could also favorably occur during antibiotic adsorption onto cv mps he et al 2022 investigation of the ph effect showed that with the exception of ma pe adsorption on aged mps was reduced under alkaline conditions fig s12 alkalinity has been shown to disrupt the structural stability of biofilms nostro et al 2012 highlighting the key role of the biofilm in the adsorption however a poor correlation between the logkd adsorption of ma mps and the logkow values of the antibiotics fig s10 may be due to the relatively lower amount of eps on ma mps which was insufficient for efficient hydrophobic interaction on their surface m aeruginosa cell debris and mc lr could potentially hinder the adsorption of polar antibiotics on ma mps by blocking their active sites mc lr is also known for its inhibitory potency on phosphatase specific binding activity in epss honkanen et al 1990 which might weaken the eps adhesive function in the biofilm on ma mp and make it less reactive in addition there may be competition during biofouling where pre colonizing components or pre adsorbed chemicals could weaken the activity of polysaccharides and proteins in the biofilm and lead to reduced electron transfer reactivity for external adsorption flemming et al 2016 4 3 implications mps can be mistaken for prey by filter feeders or inadvertently ingested along with mp adsorbed cecs adsorption of antibiotics to mps can increase their bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms this could potentially increase the bioavailability and uptake of mps and any adsorbed contaminants including antibiotics by these organisms concurrently biofouling and aging through bond scissions may undermine the potential of polymeric functional groups that are active during adsorption hydrogen bonding ch π electrostatic affinity were the interactions between antibiotics and mps discovered in this study which could be weakened by aging and bond scission during contact with phytoplankton meanwhile the complexity and richness of biofilm eps attached to mps may reinforce the surface or internal structure of the mps for restored and consequent adsorption the acute effect of mp observed on m aeruginosa resulted in repressed eps secretion and unimportant biofouling of mps while the greater tolerance of c vulgaris implied sufficient biofouling of mps conducive to hydrophobic adsorption of antibiotics in summary the responses of biofilm forming organisms to mp stress in aquatic environments would result in specific biofouling and aging that significantly affect the adsorption potential of mp depending on the organism s tolerance and the degree of mp biofouling enriched biofouling would promote the adsorption of cecs by the mps which could lead to further hazards and risks from food chain contamination and bioaccumulation this work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the ecological implications of mps and provides a basis for developing effective strategies to mitigate their impact on aquatic ecosystems and human health 5 conclusions this study illustrates the interplay between mps and phytoplankton and for the first time how it can affect mp adsorption of antibiotics in aquatic environments the differential response of m aeruginosa and c vulgaris to mp exposure suggested that different phytoplankton species may have varying levels of tolerance to mps and impact mp aging and biofouling which in turn affect mp ability to adsorb antibiotics the weakening of chemically active functional groups on mp surfaces due to phytoplankton aging could have significant implications for the fate and transport of antibiotics in aquatic environment furthermore the finding that hydrophobic interactions play a role in promoting antibiotic adsorption onto microalgae aged mps through the adherent biofilm underscores that the adsorption fate of mp undergoing biofouling depends on the tolerance of phytoplankton cells and the extent of mp biofouling our findings highlight the importance of considering the role of biofilms and aging in understanding the accumulation of pollutants on mps in aquatic environments further research is needed to better understand the coexistence of mps phytoplankton and cecs in aquatic environments credit authorship contribution statement claude kiki conceptualization methodology

14808,the occurrence and transformation of microplastics mps remaining in the water treatment plants has recently attracted considerable attention however few efforts have been made to investigate the behavior of dissolved organic matter dom derived from mps during oxidation processes in this study the characteristics of dom leached from mps during typical ultraviolet uv based oxidation was focused on the toxicity and disinfection byproduct dbp formation potentials of mp derived dom were further investigated overall uv based oxidation significantly enhanced the aging and fragmentation of highly hydroscopic mps the mass scales of leachates to mps increased from 0 03 0 18 at initial stage to 0 09 0 71 after oxidation which were significantly higher than those leached by natural light exposure combined fluorescence analysis with high resolution mass spectrometer scan confirmed that the dominant mp derived dom are chemical additives pet derived dom and pa6 derived dom showed inhibition of vibrio fischeri activity with corresponding ec50 of 2 84 mg l and 4 58 mg l of doc bioassay testing with chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa showed that high concentrations of mp derived dom inhibited algal growth by disrupting the cell membrane permeability and integrity mp derived dom had a similar chlorine consumption 1 63 0 41 mg doc as surface water 1 0 2 0 mg doc and mp derived dom mainly served as precursors for the investigated dbps contrary to the results of previous studies the dbp yields from mp derived dom were relatively lower than those of aquatic dom under simulated distribution system conditions this suggests that mp derived dom itself rather than serving as dbp precursor might be potential toxic concern graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic water treatment advanced oxidation processes disinfection byproducts toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important organic synthetic polymer industrial plastics have developed rapidly since the 1940s with annual global production reaching 359 million tonnes in 2018 huang et al 2021 however due to the low reuse rates 30 poor management and the high stability of plastics geyer et al 2017 large amounts of plastic waste were discharged into the aquatic environment which in turn are transformed into microplastics mps upon prolonged exposure to irradiation and weathering alimi et al 2018 water insoluble solid polymer particles with a diameter of less than 5 mm are usually defined as mps thompson et al 2004 which are widely distributed in the aquatic environment with abundances ranging from 1 10 2 to 1 106 items m3 lebreton et al 2017 the organic pollutants e g pesticides and perfluorochemicals heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms tended to adsorb and accumulate on mps due to their large specific surface area and hydrophobic properties oliveira et al 2019 causing mps to act as carriers for the migration and transformation of pollutants in addition the natural degradation of mps can also release potentially hazardous chemicals such as copolymers additives and plasticisers wang et al 2018 posing a potential environmental risk water and wastewater treatment plants wtps are the starting and ending points of the social water cycle which also serve as broad barriers to ensure the safety of drinking water and aquatic environment respectively the occurrence and fate of mps in wtps have gradually attracted people s attention na et al 2021 the most frequently detected mps in wtps are polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp which are positively correlated with their global demand and production koelmans et al 2019 in addition polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyamide 6 pa6 are also commonly detected mps wang et al 2020 the quantitative concentration of mps in source water of wtps ranged from 1 0 103 to 1 0 106 items m3 with a median concentration of 2 2 103 items m3 koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 conventional treatment processes represented by coagulation sedimentation filtration and membrane bioreactor are effective in removing mps with large particle sizes 10 µm with a mean removal rate of 95 li et al 2020 however the high levels of mps 1 103 to 9 3 105 items m3 detected in the effluents indicated that there are still many small particle sized mps throughout the whole water treatment processes which will inevitably have a potential impact on the water treatment processes ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are widely applied in the advanced treatment unit of wtps which can efficiently degrade various organic pollutants and inactivate the pathogenic microorganisms through the oxidative effects of oxidants and reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radical oh chu et al 2015 du et al 2020 the presences of oxidants and reactive oxygen species inevitably interfere with the aging behavior of mps thus affecting the leaching process of mp derived dissolved organic matter dom although a growing number of studies demonstrated that mp derived dom can serve as potential precursors of disinfection by products dbps ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020b little information is available on the leaching characteristics of dom during typical oxidation processes in water treatment and the composition toxicity and dbp formation potential dbp fp of mp derived dom should be further investigated the objectives of this study are therefore to elucidate the fragmentation of mps and characterize the leaching of dom from three mps pp pet and pa6 during uv aops uv uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and uv ozone uv o3 and to explore dom associated ecotoxicity and dbp fps trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms during subsequent chlorination the finding of this study might contribute to provide a reference for clarifying the influence of mps treated with aops on water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pp and pa6 were obtained from sinopec beijing china and pet was purchased from far eastern industries shanghai ltd with the average particle sizes of 200 mesh the detailed information about three industrial plastic polymers was shown in table s1 limited by the confidentiality of the manufacturer only the physical properties and additive types of each mp were obtained and the specific additive content was unknown the used chemicals in this study were all at least of analytical grade and the detailed information for chemicals were shown in text s1 ultrapure water was prepared by milli q gradient water purification device millipore billerica usa the details of dbp standards were given in table s2 2 2 experimental procedures uv irradiation experiments were performed using a collimated beam apparatus trojan canada consisting of a low pressure mercury lamp 253 7 nm with an average light intensity of 0 133 mw cm2 over a quiescent stirred crystallization dish 500 0 ml the light intensity was calibrated using a light intensity calibrator ilt 2400 international light technologies peabody usa mps were placed in 10 0 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 with a concentration range of 50 500 mg l specifically mp dosages were based on the ranges observed in a previous study suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 nevertheless this study was conducted to investigate the properties of mp derived dom if the simulation is carried out based on actual mp concentration in wtps 0 5 5600 µg l the leachate concentration will be below the instrumental detection limit and cannot be accurately quantified therefore the higher mp dose applied in this study than those reported in the effluents of filtration units in wtps higher than 0 5 170 µg l was used to amplify experiment results cheng et al 2021 relevant studies also applied similar method to meet the objective conditions of the instrument lee et al 2020a 2020b lin and su 2022 liu et al 2019 in addition all plastic particles are cleaned three times with ultrapure water before use to remove possible impurities h2o2 and o3 were introduced into the reaction system in the form of aqueous solution the uv dose was controlled by adjusting the irradiation time the reaction time of the control group no light corresponds to the reaction time of the uv reaction dbp fp experiments were performed under simulated distribution system sds conditions and the detailed information can be found in text s2 2 3 analytical methods detailed information on the analytical methods is given in test s1 2 4 bioassay test ecotoxicity toxicity was evaluated using a microplate chemiluminescence apparatus lb960 centrocentro xs3 berthold germany to detect the relative luminosity of vibrio fischeri algal cell damage was detected by flow cytometry bd facscanto ⅱ becton dickinson usa the predicted cytotoxicity of one dbp was calculated by dividing the measured concentration by the corresponding lc50 values and the dbp associated cytotoxicity index cti of disinfected mp derived dom samples was calculated by summing the predicted cytotoxicity of each dbp as a recent study confirmed that dbp associated cytotoxicity was additive rather than synergistic or antagonistic lau et al 2020 the lc50 values which refer to the specific dbp concentration capable of activating half of the chinese hamster ovary cells after 72 h exposure used in this study are summarized in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of uv aops on the fragmentation of mps 3 1 1 morphology change of mps figs 1 a c presented the morphology changes of mps after uv based oxidation compared with the control group the oxidized mp particles all showed different degrees of fragmentation and the uv o3 oxidized particles were more fragmented than the uv h2o2 and uv oxidized particles the particle size of pp after aops was obviously larger than that of pet and pa6 to further clarify the fragmentation differences for mps after aops imagej software was used to quantify the particle sizes of the mps identified by sem and the results were shown in figs 1d e the average particle size of pp pa6 and pet after uv irradiation decreased accordingly from 76 4 µm 78 5 µm and 62 1 µm to 68 3 µm 56 5 µm and 47 7 µm the proportions of pa6 and pet with the particle sizes less than 10 µm after uv o3 oxidation reached to 53 9 and 70 2 respectively in contrast the corresponding proportion for pp was only 6 9 this phenomenon was due to the difference in molecular structure between the three mps pp does not contain any unsaturated double bonds in the polymer backbones which was expected to be less affected by uv based oxidation n grassie 1988 besides the carbon atoms of the pet backbone attached to the benzene ring were more susceptible to free radical attack than the secondary carbon in pa6 dole 1983 gewert et al 2015 therefore pet showed higher fragmentation than pa6 and pp figure s1 showed the detailed surface morphology of the mps the cracks were not observed on the surface of pa6 and pet particles which was not consistent with previous studies jiang et al 2021 the relatively short uv irradiation time may have prevented photo oxidation and hydrolysis from causing cracks on the mp surfaces in contrast the free radicals generated by uv aops triggered polymer reactions that resulted in the appearance of holes and cracks as well as the fragmentation of the attached fine plastic particles this phenomenon demonstrated that uv aops were more aggressive than direct uv irradiation and uv derived photocatalytic reactions on the mp surfaces similarly a previous study also confirmed that fenton oxidation can effectively oxidase plastic waste to recover valuable plastics guo et al 2018 the fragmentation of the mp surface structures was more pronounced under uv o3 than with uv h2o2 indicating that the synergistic oxidation of ozone with oh accelerated the leaching of mp derived dom in addition to the appearance of porosity and fragmentation the surface roughness of pet increased after oxidation and these changes were probably triggered by the ester exchange of pet functional groups sang et al 2020 3 1 2 ftir spectral figure s2 presented the ftir spectral characteristics of mps uv based oxidation did not significantly change the surface ftir spectra of mps but the spectral intensities of the functional groups were slightly different three strong absorption bands figure s2a at 3024 cm 1 2935 cm 1 and 2847 cm 1 were characteristic peaks of pp matrix which could be attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of methyl and methylene groups compared to the control group the carbonyl absorption bands carboxylic acid 1693 cm 1 ketone 1715 cm 1 and anhydride 1845 cm 1 in the experimental group confirmed the appearance of oxidation products valadez gonzalez et al 1999 and the spectral intensity increase of ester 1735 cm 1 and γ lactone 1780 cm 1 indicated the possible exposure of plastic additives e g phthalic acid esters the original pa6 has an intermediate absorption peak 3300 cm 1 corresponding to the nh stretching vibration of the secondary amine figure s2b a stronger absorption at 1655 cm 1 for secondary amide represented the amide i v co coupling between δnh and vcn resulted in the amide ii band v nh 1534 cm 1 and the amide iii band v cn 1265 cm 1 as shown the absorption peaks corresponding to the secondary amine were positively correlated with the intensity of oxidation with the peak areas ordered as uv o3 uv h2o2 uv which can be attributed to the exposure of the nitrogen groups caused by fragmentation the characteristic absorption of δch at 1400 cm 1 1340 cm 1 confirmed the presence of the hydrolysis reaction grime and ward 1958 for pet figure s2c the absorption peaks at 3427 cm 1 oh represented the occurrence of the oxidation reaction priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 the absorption band at 1720 cm 1 corresponded to the ester group while the absorption band at 1534 cm 1 corresponded to the vco stretching present in the vcc bond the absorption peaks of vco 1240 cm 1 and vco c 1100 cm 1 were assigned to the torsion angle in the o co ch2 ester group of pet ioakeimidis et al 2016 the peak at 1454 cm 1 belonged to the benzene ring of the terephthalic acid monomer that makes up pet priyanka et al found that the benzene ring may be one of the reasons for limiting the oxidation of pet during fenton oxidation priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 and there are similar findings in the process of chemical degradation of pet wang et al 2019 the carbonyl index ci was used to characterize the degree of aging of the mps fechine et al 2007 the ci values of the mps did not significantly increase after uv irradiation compared to the original mps figure s3 which can be explained by the fact that the low dose of uv irradiation was unable to significantly age the mps in contrast both uv o3 and uv h2o2 were able to age the mps to a greater extent and the cracks and holes created by oxidation exposed more reactive sites further increasing the degree of aging of the mps the very small carbonyl peak area resulted in a non statistically significant ci index for pp compared to the original mps the ci values of pa6 and pet after uv h2o2 oxidation increased by 17 71 and 18 90 respectively while the corresponding values of pa6 and pet after uv o3 oxidation were 25 30 and 26 8 respectively which were in line with their fragmentation degrees 3 2 effect of uv aops on dom leaching of mps 3 2 1 quantify of mp derived dom mp derived dom was quantified by doc value and the results were shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the doc values did not increase significantly at the uv doses of 20 40 mj cm2 indicating that the uv disinfection process commonly used in wtps would not promote the leaching of mp derived dom in contract uv aops significantly stimulated the leaching of dom at uv doses 400 800 mj cm2 for actual engineering applications iua 2021 the mass scales of leachates to mps increased from 0 03 0 18 at initial stage to 0 09 0 71 after oxidation which were significantly higher than those leached by simulated natural light exposure and chlorination lee et al 2020b lin and su 2022 specifically the doc values of pa6 derived dom leached after 800 mj cm2 of uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 oxidation were 1 52 2 04 and 4 23 mg l which were 2 8 1 5 and 2 2 times higher than those of pet derived dom 0 54 1 36 and 1 92 mg l and 3 6 4 0 and 7 7 times higher than those of pp derived dom 0 42 0 51 and 0 55 mg l respectively at the same mp dose of 500 mg l this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the hydrophilic amide group conh which constituted pa6 was highly susceptible to hydrolysis reactions leading to the cleavage of the amide group li et al 2018 furthermore the amide group was a class of chromogenic groups that were susceptible to degradation under uv irradiation ni et al 2021 which in turn released more dom during the hydrolysis phase therefore pa6 showed the highest hydrolysis rate moreover the concentration of pp derived dom was relatively low 0 18 0 55 mg l and the doc value did not increase significantly after uv h2o2 and uv o3 oxidation indicating that the advanced oxidation system did not promote the leaching of pp derived dom this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the water absorption of pp 0 01 was significantly lower than those of pet 0 3 0 4 and pa6 1 8 the lower water absorption led to the difficulty of the hydrolysis reaction which in turn caused the low leaching rate of dom do et al 2016 besides the contents and types of anti oxidation additives could affect the leaching behaviors of mps bridson et al 2023 do et al 2022 which may also cause the differences in doc contents for uv o3 the direct oxidation of ozone and the indirect oxidation of reactive oxygen acted together on mps du et al 2021 thus accelerating the fragmentation of mps selective oxidation of ozone resulted in a higher reaction preference with amide group monomer of pa6 than with aromatic hydrocarbon monomer of pet hubner et al 2015 consequently pa6 oxidized by uv o3 showed the highest dom leaching behavior however the low reaction rate of ozone with single bonded compounds e g alkanes also meant that uv o3 oxidation did not significantly increase the dom release rate of pp figures s4a 4b showed the effect of oxidant dose on the leaching of mp derived dom as the h2o2 dose increased the leaching of dom from all three mps showed a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the excess h2o2 will reacts with the oh generated in the solution to form ho2 which has a lower redox potential than oh thus leading to a decrease in doc in contrast as the ozone dose was increased uv o3 showed no obvious inhibition indicating that mps have a higher reactivity with ozone in conclusion uv based oxidation which is commonly used in water treatment accelerated the leaching of dom from highly water absorbent mps represented by pet and pa6 therefore it is necessary to investigate the changes of highly water absorbent mps during uv based oxidation to clarify the leaching principle of mp derived dom as the leaching of pp derived dom was largely unaffected by uv based oxidation the analysis of pp derived dom was not carried out 3 2 2 identification of mp derived dom fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis parafac can elucidate the fluorescent fraction and in turn clarify the possible components of mp derived dom four fluorescent components were identified from the model of eem parafac and the results of split half analysis and residual analysis were shown in figure s5 the maximum ex em wavelengths for component 1 c1 component 2 c2 component 3 c3 and component 4 c4 were at 235 350 nm 225 270 350 nm 270 420 nm and 225 350 nm figure s6a respectively prominent peaks c1 c2 and c4 appeared in the protein phenol like fluorescence region of mp derived dom regardless of oxidation conditions and plastic types carstea et al 2016 which were similar to other reports for leached solutions of plastic materials lee et al 2020a recently studies also confirmed that the phenol like region showed fluorescence peaks after uv oxidation regardless of the type of mps collins et al 2023 lee et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 figure s6b showed the fluorescence intensity of each component the fluorescence intensities of mp derived dom were positively correlated with doc values r 2 0 89 p 0 05 the protein phenol like substances were abundantly represented in the mp derived dom accounting for approximately 85 4 96 2 of the total fluorescence intensity however it should be noted that the fluorescence response of the protein phenol like region cannot confirm the presence of nitrogenous organics such as protein due to the very different dom sources which has been confirmed by previous study du et al 2022 and its fluorescence characteristics are more likely to be the response of phenol like plastic additives to further investigate clarify the possible components of phenol like substances detected in mp derived dom the fluorescence responses of the typical plastic additives were clarified figure s7 the maximum ex em wavelengths of the typical plastic additives appeared at 275 300 350 nm 225 300 350 nm suggesting the correlation between the release of plastic additives and the phenol like substances to explore the linear correlation between the fluorescence intensities expressed as fmax values of each component and the independent variables of the oxidation reaction the results were shown in table s3 phenol like substances showed significant linear correlations with the independent variables of oxidation reaction r2 0 85 p 0 05 while humic like substances showed weaker correlations with the uv dose and the h2o2 dose the components that correlated well with the oxidation conditions could be served as fluorescent markers to fingerprint the mp derived dom therefore fluorescence responses in phenol like fractions which may reflect the contents of plastic additives were considered as characteristic fluorescence peaks for tracking mp derived dom leached during oxidation in water treatment to further clarify the molecular composition of mp derived dom gc q orbitrap hrms was used to characterize the constituents of pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom fig 3 and molecular formula assignment was performed using the mass spectral databases of national institute of standards and technology nist a total of 186 and 152 molecular formulae were identified from pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively among them the sum of the intensity values of the top ten molecular formulae accounted for 95 2 and 91 2 of the total intensity of pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively and the detailed information of those molecular formulae was shown in table s5 as shown almost all the scores and high retardation factor hrf scores were greater than 90 which proved the high accuracy of molecular formula assignment although plastic additives only account for only 5 10 of the plastic products beach et al 2013 they are important constituents of the mp leachates plastic additives include plasticizers phthalic acid esters 1 3 dioxane hydroxymethyl 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropionate etc flame retardants 4 p fluorophenyl 2h 1 3 3h oxazine 2 6 dione release agents 4 pentene 2 ol 2 methyl 2 6 diisopropylnaphthalene foaming agent neopentane and crosslinking agent tert butyl hydroperoxide bridson et al 2021 gunaalan et al 2020 were pervasively identified throughout both pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom which were in line with the additive types of pa6 and pet table s1 in contrast the monomers of pa6 caprolactam and pet dimethyl terephthalate glycol ester or their oxidized products were not identified which again confirming the conclusion that the dominant condiments released during fragmentation of mps were plastic additives previous studies have also confirmed the presence of chemical additives in mp derived dom capolupo et al 2020 3 3 potential toxicological risks of mp derived dom figs 4 a and b presented the relative luminescence of vibrio fischeri after 15 min of exposure to mp derived dom a strong inhibitory effect of mp derived dom on luminescence activity was observed and the acute toxicity was positively correlated with doc levels r 2 0 82 p 0 05 pet derived dom showed higher acute toxicity than pa6 derived dom with ec50 values of 2 84 mg l and 4 58 mg l respectively related studies have reported that plastic additives especially those compounds containing benzene ring structures were highly toxic to organisms and the toxicity was usually realized by affecting the metabolic response gao 1994 huang et al 2021 it is speculated that the toxicological effect of mp derived dom on luminescent bacteria was achieved by inhibiting the metabolic process associated with the luminescence reaction li et al 2015 figs 4c and d showed the growth curves of chlorella vulgaris exposed to pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively mp derived dom did not cause acute toxicity damage to chlorella vulgaris and the od680 values of each group did not show significant differences during the first 6 days remaining at 0 213 0 16 cm 1 from day 8 onwards the inhibition of on chlorella vulgaris growth appeared and reached its maximum level around day 20 the od680 values did not increase significantly on the day 29 and remained at 1 402 0 32 cm 1 mp derived dom leached by different mps and different oxidation processes all showed inhibitory effects on the growth of chlorella vulgaris and the inhibition rate was correlated with the doc values r 2 0 76 p 0 01 select od values of the exponential growth period 15th day as dependent variables the damage of chlorella vulgaris was further characterized by flow cytometry and the results were shown in figure s8 p3 marked in blue represented live cells while the rest marked in red were broken cells and damaged cells with disrupted cell membrane permeability stained by the propidium iodide the number of damaged cells was significantly higher in chlorella vulgaris exposed to mp derived dom compared to the control group the majority of the cells in red were those that still had chlorophyll fluorescence intensity but with disrupted cell membrane permeability thus although mp derived dom caused an increase in the number of damaged cells in chlorella vulgaris the od680 values did not change significantly in addition the above phenomenon indicated that mp derived dom inhibited the growth of chlorella vulgaris mainly by disrupting permeability and integrity of the cell membrane which was different from the mechanism of damage caused by antibiotics and pesticides qian et al found that aminoglutethimide inhibited the growth of chlorella vulgaris by interfering with photosynthesis oxidative damage and energy metabolism which in turn reduced chlorophyll content qian et al 2018 the presence of oxytetracycline has been shown to inhibit chlorophyll synthesis in chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa siedlewicz et al 2020 fig 4e presented the calculated values of cell density and growth inhibition based on the results of the flow cytometry assays compared with the control group the cell density of chlorella vulgaris exposed to mp derived dom decreased and the percentage of live cells decreased from 84 2 for the control group to 82 4 83 8 80 4 80 6 and 78 6 80 1 for mp derived dom leached by uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 respectively this indicated that the inhibitory effect of mp derived dom on the growth of chlorella vulgaris was mainly through cell damage which in turn reduced its proliferation rate but had no significant effect on its population mortality figs 4f and g showed the growth curves of microcystis aeruginosa exposed to mp derived dom in contrast to the growth trend of chlorella vulgaris microcystis aeruginosa basically lost all its activity after 6 days of incubation after exposure to mp derived dom microcystis aeruginosa showed an increasing trend in the initial phase the od680 values reached the highest value of 0 90 0 01 cm 1 on day 4 with a difference of 0 03 0 01 cm 1 from the control group subsequently the od680 values decreased sharply on days 5 and 6 indicating significant mortality of microcystis aeruginosa and the od680 value remained at 0 28 0 04 cm 1 when the concentration of mp derived dom exceeds the tolerance limit of the algal cell the structure of the algal cell breaks down in this case the algal cells will be in a state of zero growth or even negative growth and in severe cases mass mortality of algal cells will occur in addition the inhibition rate of mp derived dom on the growth of microcystis aeruginosa was proportional to its doc concentration since the concentration of pet derived dom leached by uv oxidation was relatively low it did not cause massive algal cell death but showed a significant inhibition of algal proliferation figure s9 presented the results of the flow cytometry assay for microcystis aeruginosa overall the fraction of viable cells of microcystis aeruginosa exposed to mp derived dom was significantly lower than that of the control group which was consistent with the growth curve for microcystis aeruginosa exposed to mp derived dom oxidized leached by uv o3 and uv h2o2 almost no algal cells survived whereas some algal cells still survived in the algal solution exposed to mp derived dom leached by uv oxidation cell density and growth inhibition rates were calculated and the results were shown in fig 4h mp derived dom has an extremely obvious inhibitory effect on the growth of microcystis aeruginosa in which the viable cell ratios decreased from 90 87 of the control group to 0 17 3 10 for pa6 and 0 14 46 90 for pet respectively the proportion of damaged cells was extremely high which was quite different from that of chlorella vulgaris suggesting that mp derived dom has a more inhibitory effect on prokaryotes represented by microcystis aeruginosa 3 4 dbp formation during chlorination of mp derived dom figs 5 a and b presented the dbp fps during chlorination of pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively the formation potentials and yields of specific c dbps and n dbps were shown in figure s10 mp derived dom exhibit similar chlorine consumption 1 63 0 41 mg cl2 mg doc mean sd compared to dom of surface water 1 0 2 0 mg cl2 mg doc chlorination of mp derived dom after uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 treatment produced tox of 40 9 5 3 110 2 8 4 and 164 5 13 9 μg l as cl which are 2 1 5 8 and 8 6 times as much as that of control group 19 1 1 3 μg l the same trends were also observed for pet derived dom this phenomenon was mainly attributed to the higher doc concentration in mp derived dom which resulted in the higher disinfectant consumption in particular due to the different dom constitution the proportions of each type of dbp to aggregate dbps on a mass weight basis differed from that of surface water specifically unknown tox utox accounted for 19 6 28 9 of aggregate dbps figure s11 whereas the corresponding proportion for chlorinated surface water were 70 zhang et al 2018 therefore mp derived dom mainly served as precursors for known dbps thms haas and hals predominated in the chlorinated mp derived dom and their formation potentials were positively correlated with doc values r 2 0 82 p 0 05 the highest concentrations of thms haas and hals reached 61 8 4 9 μg l 40 5 3 1 μg l and 17 3 2 6 μg l respectively as for the dbp yields μg dbps mg doc the yields of thms and haas from pet derived dom figure s12 were higher than those from pa6 derived dom but were all lower than those from surface water du et al 2022 this phenomenon can be attributed to the low aromaticity of mp derived dom a previous study had shown that humic like substances were the dominant precursors of thms and haas ding et al 2019 in terms of hal yields there was a significant difference between mp derived dom 5 2 2 4 μg hals mg doc and surface water 8 9 4 2 μg hals mg doc du et al 2022 indicating that the main precursors of hals for mp derived dom are not the same as natural organic matter a previous study had shown that aldehydes ketones and amino acids appeared to be the principal hal precursors which were rarely found in mp derived dom table s4 du et al 2022 the mean n dbp concentrations in chlorinated pa6 derived dom leached by uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 treatments were 6 2 0 6 μg l 9 8 0 8 μg l and 12 7 0 7 μg l respectively the same trends were also observed for pet derived dom with the corresponding concentrations of 2 0 0 3 μg l 3 9 0 4 μg l and 4 9 0 7 μg l compared to n dbp fps from surface water du et al 2022 the production of n dbps from mp derived dom was lower except for a few samples from uv o3 in terms of n dbp yields figure s12 chlorinated pa dom and chlorinated pet derived dom showed similar n dbp yields but all were lower than that of surface water notably compared to the control group the yield of dbps for chlorinated mp derived dom increased significantly after uv based oxidation figure s12 indicating that the lower yields of dbps for chlorinated mp derived dom was due to different organic properties rather than the degradation effects of uv based oxidation on dom the formation of hams and hans have certain homology the concerted decarboxylation reaction and the substitution reaction of the α amine terminus of free amino acids are the main pathways for the formation of hans during the chlorination process shah and mitch 2012 further hydrolysis of hans can produce corresponding hams glezer et al 1999 and the formation of hnms was related to the don content bond et al 2011 the absence of typical precursors and the low levels of don resulted in the low yield of n dbps toxicity indexes were more suitable to express the potential dbp associated risks than dbp concentration and yields cti values of chlorinated mp derived dom were calculated and the results were shown in fig 5c the total cti values on chlorinated mp derived dom increased with the increases of doc which was consistent with the variation of aggregate dbp concentration the cti values of pet derived dom were lower than pa6 derived dom due to the less dbp concentration mean cti values for pa6 derived dom leached by uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 were 4 1 0 4 10 3 7 4 0 4 10 3 and 9 5 0 6 10 3 respectively which were 2 0 3 7 and 4 8 times of that from control group among these dbps hans and hals were the forcing agents of dbp associated toxicity fig 5d accounting for 75 of total dbp associated toxicity of chlorinated mp derived dom however due to the lower yields of hals and hans the cti yields of mp derived dom were also lower than those of surface water in summary mp derived dom released by uv based aops can serve as dbp precursors during chlorination process while their underlying impaction would be rare due to the lower dbp yields and dbp associated cytotoxicity 4 conclusions in this study the effects of uv based oxidation on the fragmentation dom release toxicity and dbp formation characteristics of three mps pp pa6 and pet were systematically investigated specific findings are listed below 1 uv aops significantly enhanced the aging and fragmentation of mps from larger particle sizes to smaller particle sizes with the following order uv o3 uv h2o2 uv which was ascribed to the specific reactive oxygen species the fragmentation degree of mps upon uv aops were dependent on monomer chemical structure of mps 2 doc content leached from mps after uv aops treatment ranged from 0 41 mg l to 4 23 mg l and uv o3 treatment produced most dom leaching compared with uv h2o2 and uv treatment combined fluorescence analysis with hrms confirmed that the dominant mp derived dom are chemical additives 3 pet derived dom and pa6 derived dom showed inhibition of vibrio fischeri activity with corresponding ec50 of 2 84 mg l and 4 58 mg l of doc bioassay test with chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa showed that mp derived dom inhibits the growth of chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa by disrupting the cell membrane permeability and integrity 4 chlorine consumption for mp derived dom 1 6 0 4 mg doc were comparable to that for surface water 1 0 2 0 mg doc whereas dbp yields from mp derived dom were relatively lower than that from aquatic dom this suggests that mp derived dom itself rather than serving as dbp precursor might be potential toxic concern appendix a supplementary data supplementary data related to this article is available in this appendix declaration of competing interest the

14808,the occurrence and transformation of microplastics mps remaining in the water treatment plants has recently attracted considerable attention however few efforts have been made to investigate the behavior of dissolved organic matter dom derived from mps during oxidation processes in this study the characteristics of dom leached from mps during typical ultraviolet uv based oxidation was focused on the toxicity and disinfection byproduct dbp formation potentials of mp derived dom were further investigated overall uv based oxidation significantly enhanced the aging and fragmentation of highly hydroscopic mps the mass scales of leachates to mps increased from 0 03 0 18 at initial stage to 0 09 0 71 after oxidation which were significantly higher than those leached by natural light exposure combined fluorescence analysis with high resolution mass spectrometer scan confirmed that the dominant mp derived dom are chemical additives pet derived dom and pa6 derived dom showed inhibition of vibrio fischeri activity with corresponding ec50 of 2 84 mg l and 4 58 mg l of doc bioassay testing with chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa showed that high concentrations of mp derived dom inhibited algal growth by disrupting the cell membrane permeability and integrity mp derived dom had a similar chlorine consumption 1 63 0 41 mg doc as surface water 1 0 2 0 mg doc and mp derived dom mainly served as precursors for the investigated dbps contrary to the results of previous studies the dbp yields from mp derived dom were relatively lower than those of aquatic dom under simulated distribution system conditions this suggests that mp derived dom itself rather than serving as dbp precursor might be potential toxic concern graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

polymer industrial plastics have developed rapidly since the 1940s with annual global production reaching 359 million tonnes in 2018 huang et al 2021 however due to the low reuse rates 30 poor management and the high stability of plastics geyer et al 2017 large amounts of plastic waste were discharged into the aquatic environment which in turn are transformed into microplastics mps upon prolonged exposure to irradiation and weathering alimi et al 2018 water insoluble solid polymer particles with a diameter of less than 5 mm are usually defined as mps thompson et al 2004 which are widely distributed in the aquatic environment with abundances ranging from 1 10 2 to 1 106 items m3 lebreton et al 2017 the organic pollutants e g pesticides and perfluorochemicals heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms tended to adsorb and accumulate on mps due to their large specific surface area and hydrophobic properties oliveira et al 2019 causing mps to act as carriers for the migration and transformation of pollutants in addition the natural degradation of mps can also release potentially hazardous chemicals such as copolymers additives and plasticisers wang et al 2018 posing a potential environmental risk water and wastewater treatment plants wtps are the starting and ending points of the social water cycle which also serve as broad barriers to ensure the safety of drinking water and aquatic environment respectively the occurrence and fate of mps in wtps have gradually attracted people s attention na et al 2021 the most frequently detected mps in wtps are polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp which are positively correlated with their global demand and production koelmans et al 2019 in addition polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyamide 6 pa6 are also commonly detected mps wang et al 2020 the quantitative concentration of mps in source water of wtps ranged from 1 0 103 to 1 0 106 items m3 with a median concentration of 2 2 103 items m3 koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 conventional treatment processes represented by coagulation sedimentation filtration and membrane bioreactor are effective in removing mps with large particle sizes 10 µm with a mean removal rate of 95 li et al 2020 however the high levels of mps 1 103 to 9 3 105 items m3 detected in the effluents indicated that there are still many small particle sized mps throughout the whole water treatment processes which will inevitably have a potential impact on the water treatment processes ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are widely applied in the advanced treatment unit of wtps which can efficiently degrade various organic pollutants and inactivate the pathogenic microorganisms through the oxidative effects of oxidants and reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radical oh chu et al 2015 du et al 2020 the presences of oxidants and reactive oxygen species inevitably interfere with the aging behavior of mps thus affecting the leaching process of mp derived dissolved organic matter dom although a growing number of studies demonstrated that mp derived dom can serve as potential precursors of disinfection by products dbps ateia et al 2020 lee et al 2020b little information is available on the leaching characteristics of dom during typical oxidation processes in water treatment and the composition toxicity and dbp formation potential dbp fp of mp derived dom should be further investigated the objectives of this study are therefore to elucidate the fragmentation of mps and characterize the leaching of dom from three mps pp pet and pa6 during uv aops uv uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and uv ozone uv o3 and to explore dom associated ecotoxicity and dbp fps trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans and halonitromethanes hnms during subsequent chlorination the finding of this study might contribute to provide a reference for clarifying the influence of mps treated with aops on water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pp and pa6 were obtained from sinopec beijing china and pet was purchased from far eastern industries shanghai ltd with the average particle sizes of 200 mesh the detailed information about three industrial plastic polymers was shown in table s1 limited by the confidentiality of the manufacturer only the physical properties and additive types of each mp were obtained and the specific additive content was unknown the used chemicals in this study were all at least of analytical grade and the detailed information for chemicals were shown in text s1 ultrapure water was prepared by milli q gradient water purification device millipore billerica usa the details of dbp standards were given in table s2 2 2 experimental procedures uv irradiation experiments were performed using a collimated beam apparatus trojan canada consisting of a low pressure mercury lamp 253 7 nm with an average light intensity of 0 133 mw cm2 over a quiescent stirred crystallization dish 500 0 ml the light intensity was calibrated using a light intensity calibrator ilt 2400 international light technologies peabody usa mps were placed in 10 0 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 with a concentration range of 50 500 mg l specifically mp dosages were based on the ranges observed in a previous study suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 nevertheless this study was conducted to investigate the properties of mp derived dom if the simulation is carried out based on actual mp concentration in wtps 0 5 5600 µg l the leachate concentration will be below the instrumental detection limit and cannot be accurately quantified therefore the higher mp dose applied in this study than those reported in the effluents of filtration units in wtps higher than 0 5 170 µg l was used to amplify experiment results cheng et al 2021 relevant studies also applied similar method to meet the objective conditions of the instrument lee et al 2020a 2020b lin and su 2022 liu et al 2019 in addition all plastic particles are cleaned three times with ultrapure water before use to remove possible impurities h2o2 and o3 were introduced into the reaction system in the form of aqueous solution the uv dose was controlled by adjusting the irradiation time the reaction time of the control group no light corresponds to the reaction time of the uv reaction dbp fp experiments were performed under simulated distribution system sds conditions and the detailed information can be found in text s2 2 3 analytical methods detailed information on the analytical methods is given in test s1 2 4 bioassay test ecotoxicity toxicity was evaluated using a microplate chemiluminescence apparatus lb960 centrocentro xs3 berthold germany to detect the relative luminosity of vibrio fischeri algal cell damage was detected by flow cytometry bd facscanto ⅱ becton dickinson usa the predicted cytotoxicity of one dbp was calculated by dividing the measured concentration by the corresponding lc50 values and the dbp associated cytotoxicity index cti of disinfected mp derived dom samples was calculated by summing the predicted cytotoxicity of each dbp as a recent study confirmed that dbp associated cytotoxicity was additive rather than synergistic or antagonistic lau et al 2020 the lc50 values which refer to the specific dbp concentration capable of activating half of the chinese hamster ovary cells after 72 h exposure used in this study are summarized in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of uv aops on the fragmentation of mps 3 1 1 morphology change of mps figs 1 a c presented the morphology changes of mps after uv based oxidation compared with the control group the oxidized mp particles all showed different degrees of fragmentation and the uv o3 oxidized particles were more fragmented than the uv h2o2 and uv oxidized particles the particle size of pp after aops was obviously larger than that of pet and pa6 to further clarify the fragmentation differences for mps after aops imagej software was used to quantify the particle sizes of the mps identified by sem and the results were shown in figs 1d e the average particle size of pp pa6 and pet after uv irradiation decreased accordingly from 76 4 µm 78 5 µm and 62 1 µm to 68 3 µm 56 5 µm and 47 7 µm the proportions of pa6 and pet with the particle sizes less than 10 µm after uv o3 oxidation reached to 53 9 and 70 2 respectively in contrast the corresponding proportion for pp was only 6 9 this phenomenon was due to the difference in molecular structure between the three mps pp does not contain any unsaturated double bonds in the polymer backbones which was expected to be less affected by uv based oxidation n grassie 1988 besides the carbon atoms of the pet backbone attached to the benzene ring were more susceptible to free radical attack than the secondary carbon in pa6 dole 1983 gewert et al 2015 therefore pet showed higher fragmentation than pa6 and pp figure s1 showed the detailed surface morphology of the mps the cracks were not observed on the surface of pa6 and pet particles which was not consistent with previous studies jiang et al 2021 the relatively short uv irradiation time may have prevented photo oxidation and hydrolysis from causing cracks on the mp surfaces in contrast the free radicals generated by uv aops triggered polymer reactions that resulted in the appearance of holes and cracks as well as the fragmentation of the attached fine plastic particles this phenomenon demonstrated that uv aops were more aggressive than direct uv irradiation and uv derived photocatalytic reactions on the mp surfaces similarly a previous study also confirmed that fenton oxidation can effectively oxidase plastic waste to recover valuable plastics guo et al 2018 the fragmentation of the mp surface structures was more pronounced under uv o3 than with uv h2o2 indicating that the synergistic oxidation of ozone with oh accelerated the leaching of mp derived dom in addition to the appearance of porosity and fragmentation the surface roughness of pet increased after oxidation and these changes were probably triggered by the ester exchange of pet functional groups sang et al 2020 3 1 2 ftir spectral figure s2 presented the ftir spectral characteristics of mps uv based oxidation did not significantly change the surface ftir spectra of mps but the spectral intensities of the functional groups were slightly different three strong absorption bands figure s2a at 3024 cm 1 2935 cm 1 and 2847 cm 1 were characteristic peaks of pp matrix which could be attributed to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of methyl and methylene groups compared to the control group the carbonyl absorption bands carboxylic acid 1693 cm 1 ketone 1715 cm 1 and anhydride 1845 cm 1 in the experimental group confirmed the appearance of oxidation products valadez gonzalez et al 1999 and the spectral intensity increase of ester 1735 cm 1 and γ lactone 1780 cm 1 indicated the possible exposure of plastic additives e g phthalic acid esters the original pa6 has an intermediate absorption peak 3300 cm 1 corresponding to the nh stretching vibration of the secondary amine figure s2b a stronger absorption at 1655 cm 1 for secondary amide represented the amide i v co coupling between δnh and vcn resulted in the amide ii band v nh 1534 cm 1 and the amide iii band v cn 1265 cm 1 as shown the absorption peaks corresponding to the secondary amine were positively correlated with the intensity of oxidation with the peak areas ordered as uv o3 uv h2o2 uv which can be attributed to the exposure of the nitrogen groups caused by fragmentation the characteristic absorption of δch at 1400 cm 1 1340 cm 1 confirmed the presence of the hydrolysis reaction grime and ward 1958 for pet figure s2c the absorption peaks at 3427 cm 1 oh represented the occurrence of the oxidation reaction priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 the absorption band at 1720 cm 1 corresponded to the ester group while the absorption band at 1534 cm 1 corresponded to the vco stretching present in the vcc bond the absorption peaks of vco 1240 cm 1 and vco c 1100 cm 1 were assigned to the torsion angle in the o co ch2 ester group of pet ioakeimidis et al 2016 the peak at 1454 cm 1 belonged to the benzene ring of the terephthalic acid monomer that makes up pet priyanka et al found that the benzene ring may be one of the reasons for limiting the oxidation of pet during fenton oxidation priyanka and saravanakumar 2022 and there are similar findings in the process of chemical degradation of pet wang et al 2019 the carbonyl index ci was used to characterize the degree of aging of the mps fechine et al 2007 the ci values of the mps did not significantly increase after uv irradiation compared to the original mps figure s3 which can be explained by the fact that the low dose of uv irradiation was unable to significantly age the mps in contrast both uv o3 and uv h2o2 were able to age the mps to a greater extent and the cracks and holes created by oxidation exposed more reactive sites further increasing the degree of aging of the mps the very small carbonyl peak area resulted in a non statistically significant ci index for pp compared to the original mps the ci values of pa6 and pet after uv h2o2 oxidation increased by 17 71 and 18 90 respectively while the corresponding values of pa6 and pet after uv o3 oxidation were 25 30 and 26 8 respectively which were in line with their fragmentation degrees 3 2 effect of uv aops on dom leaching of mps 3 2 1 quantify of mp derived dom mp derived dom was quantified by doc value and the results were shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the doc values did not increase significantly at the uv doses of 20 40 mj cm2 indicating that the uv disinfection process commonly used in wtps would not promote the leaching of mp derived dom in contract uv aops significantly stimulated the leaching of dom at uv doses 400 800 mj cm2 for actual engineering applications iua 2021 the mass scales of leachates to mps increased from 0 03 0 18 at initial stage to 0 09 0 71 after oxidation which were significantly higher than those leached by simulated natural light exposure and chlorination lee et al 2020b lin and su 2022 specifically the doc values of pa6 derived dom leached after 800 mj cm2 of uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 oxidation were 1 52 2 04 and 4 23 mg l which were 2 8 1 5 and 2 2 times higher than those of pet derived dom 0 54 1 36 and 1 92 mg l and 3 6 4 0 and 7 7 times higher than those of pp derived dom 0 42 0 51 and 0 55 mg l respectively at the same mp dose of 500 mg l this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the hydrophilic amide group conh which constituted pa6 was highly susceptible to hydrolysis reactions leading to the cleavage of the amide group li et al 2018 furthermore the amide group was a class of chromogenic groups that were susceptible to degradation under uv irradiation ni et al 2021 which in turn released more dom during the hydrolysis phase therefore pa6 showed the highest hydrolysis rate moreover the concentration of pp derived dom was relatively low 0 18 0 55 mg l and the doc value did not increase significantly after uv h2o2 and uv o3 oxidation indicating that the advanced oxidation system did not promote the leaching of pp derived dom this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the water absorption of pp 0 01 was significantly lower than those of pet 0 3 0 4 and pa6 1 8 the lower water absorption led to the difficulty of the hydrolysis reaction which in turn caused the low leaching rate of dom do et al 2016 besides the contents and types of anti oxidation additives could affect the leaching behaviors of mps bridson et al 2023 do et al 2022 which may also cause the differences in doc contents for uv o3 the direct oxidation of ozone and the indirect oxidation of reactive oxygen acted together on mps du et al 2021 thus accelerating the fragmentation of mps selective oxidation of ozone resulted in a higher reaction preference with amide group monomer of pa6 than with aromatic hydrocarbon monomer of pet hubner et al 2015 consequently pa6 oxidized by uv o3 showed the highest dom leaching behavior however the low reaction rate of ozone with single bonded compounds e g alkanes also meant that uv o3 oxidation did not significantly increase the dom release rate of pp figures s4a 4b showed the effect of oxidant dose on the leaching of mp derived dom as the h2o2 dose increased the leaching of dom from all three mps showed a firstly increasing and then decreasing trend this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that the excess h2o2 will reacts with the oh generated in the solution to form ho2 which has a lower redox potential than oh thus leading to a decrease in doc in contrast as the ozone dose was increased uv o3 showed no obvious inhibition indicating that mps have a higher reactivity with ozone in conclusion uv based oxidation which is commonly used in water treatment accelerated the leaching of dom from highly water absorbent mps represented by pet and pa6 therefore it is necessary to investigate the changes of highly water absorbent mps during uv based oxidation to clarify the leaching principle of mp derived dom as the leaching of pp derived dom was largely unaffected by uv based oxidation the analysis of pp derived dom was not carried out 3 2 2 identification of mp derived dom fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis parafac can elucidate the fluorescent fraction and in turn clarify the possible components of mp derived dom four fluorescent components were identified from the model of eem parafac and the results of split half analysis and residual analysis were shown in figure s5 the maximum ex em wavelengths for component 1 c1 component 2 c2 component 3 c3 and component 4 c4 were at 235 350 nm 225 270 350 nm 270 420 nm and 225 350 nm figure s6a respectively prominent peaks c1 c2 and c4 appeared in the protein phenol like fluorescence region of mp derived dom regardless of oxidation conditions and plastic types carstea et al 2016 which were similar to other reports for leached solutions of plastic materials lee et al 2020a recently studies also confirmed that the phenol like region showed fluorescence peaks after uv oxidation regardless of the type of mps collins et al 2023 lee et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 figure s6b showed the fluorescence intensity of each component the fluorescence intensities of mp derived dom were positively correlated with doc values r 2 0 89 p 0 05 the protein phenol like substances were abundantly represented in the mp derived dom accounting for approximately 85 4 96 2 of the total fluorescence intensity however it should be noted that the fluorescence response of the protein phenol like region cannot confirm the presence of nitrogenous organics such as protein due to the very different dom sources which has been confirmed by previous study du et al 2022 and its fluorescence characteristics are more likely to be the response of phenol like plastic additives to further investigate clarify the possible components of phenol like substances detected in mp derived dom the fluorescence responses of the typical plastic additives were clarified figure s7 the maximum ex em wavelengths of the typical plastic additives appeared at 275 300 350 nm 225 300 350 nm suggesting the correlation between the release of plastic additives and the phenol like substances to explore the linear correlation between the fluorescence intensities expressed as fmax values of each component and the independent variables of the oxidation reaction the results were shown in table s3 phenol like substances showed significant linear correlations with the independent variables of oxidation reaction r2 0 85 p 0 05 while humic like substances showed weaker correlations with the uv dose and the h2o2 dose the components that correlated well with the oxidation conditions could be served as fluorescent markers to fingerprint the mp derived dom therefore fluorescence responses in phenol like fractions which may reflect the contents of plastic additives were considered as characteristic fluorescence peaks for tracking mp derived dom leached during oxidation in water treatment to further clarify the molecular composition of mp derived dom gc q orbitrap hrms was used to characterize the constituents of pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom fig 3 and molecular formula assignment was performed using the mass spectral databases of national institute of standards and technology nist a total of 186 and 152 molecular formulae were identified from pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively among them the sum of the intensity values of the top ten molecular formulae accounted for 95 2 and 91 2 of the total intensity of pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively and the detailed information of those molecular formulae was shown in table s5 as shown almost all the scores and high retardation factor hrf scores were greater than 90 which proved the high accuracy of molecular formula assignment although plastic additives only account for only 5 10 of the plastic products beach et al 2013 they are important constituents of the mp leachates plastic additives include plasticizers phthalic acid esters 1 3 dioxane hydroxymethyl 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropionate etc flame retardants 4 p fluorophenyl 2h 1 3 3h oxazine 2 6 dione release agents 4 pentene 2 ol 2 methyl 2 6 diisopropylnaphthalene foaming agent neopentane and crosslinking agent tert butyl hydroperoxide bridson et al 2021 gunaalan et al 2020 were pervasively identified throughout both pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom which were in line with the additive types of pa6 and pet table s1 in contrast the monomers of pa6 caprolactam and pet dimethyl terephthalate glycol ester or their oxidized products were not identified which again confirming the conclusion that the dominant condiments released during fragmentation of mps were plastic additives previous studies have also confirmed the presence of chemical additives in mp derived dom capolupo et al 2020 3 3 potential toxicological risks of mp derived dom figs 4 a and b presented the relative luminescence of vibrio fischeri after 15 min of exposure to mp derived dom a strong inhibitory effect of mp derived dom on luminescence activity was observed and the acute toxicity was positively correlated with doc levels r 2 0 82 p 0 05 pet derived dom showed higher acute toxicity than pa6 derived dom with ec50 values of 2 84 mg l and 4 58 mg l respectively related studies have reported that plastic additives especially those compounds containing benzene ring structures were highly toxic to organisms and the toxicity was usually realized by affecting the metabolic response gao 1994 huang et al 2021 it is speculated that the toxicological effect of mp derived dom on luminescent bacteria was achieved by inhibiting the metabolic process associated with the luminescence reaction li et al 2015 figs 4c and d showed the growth curves of chlorella vulgaris exposed to pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively mp derived dom did not cause acute toxicity damage to chlorella vulgaris and the od680 values of each group did not show significant differences during the first 6 days remaining at 0 213 0 16 cm 1 from day 8 onwards the inhibition of on chlorella vulgaris growth appeared and reached its maximum level around day 20 the od680 values did not increase significantly on the day 29 and remained at 1 402 0 32 cm 1 mp derived dom leached by different mps and different oxidation processes all showed inhibitory effects on the growth of chlorella vulgaris and the inhibition rate was correlated with the doc values r 2 0 76 p 0 01 select od values of the exponential growth period 15th day as dependent variables the damage of chlorella vulgaris was further characterized by flow cytometry and the results were shown in figure s8 p3 marked in blue represented live cells while the rest marked in red were broken cells and damaged cells with disrupted cell membrane permeability stained by the propidium iodide the number of damaged cells was significantly higher in chlorella vulgaris exposed to mp derived dom compared to the control group the majority of the cells in red were those that still had chlorophyll fluorescence intensity but with disrupted cell membrane permeability thus although mp derived dom caused an increase in the number of damaged cells in chlorella vulgaris the od680 values did not change significantly in addition the above phenomenon indicated that mp derived dom inhibited the growth of chlorella vulgaris mainly by disrupting permeability and integrity of the cell membrane which was different from the mechanism of damage caused by antibiotics and pesticides qian et al found that aminoglutethimide inhibited the growth of chlorella vulgaris by interfering with photosynthesis oxidative damage and energy metabolism which in turn reduced chlorophyll content qian et al 2018 the presence of oxytetracycline has been shown to inhibit chlorophyll synthesis in chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa siedlewicz et al 2020 fig 4e presented the calculated values of cell density and growth inhibition based on the results of the flow cytometry assays compared with the control group the cell density of chlorella vulgaris exposed to mp derived dom decreased and the percentage of live cells decreased from 84 2 for the control group to 82 4 83 8 80 4 80 6 and 78 6 80 1 for mp derived dom leached by uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 respectively this indicated that the inhibitory effect of mp derived dom on the growth of chlorella vulgaris was mainly through cell damage which in turn reduced its proliferation rate but had no significant effect on its population mortality figs 4f and g showed the growth curves of microcystis aeruginosa exposed to mp derived dom in contrast to the growth trend of chlorella vulgaris microcystis aeruginosa basically lost all its activity after 6 days of incubation after exposure to mp derived dom microcystis aeruginosa showed an increasing trend in the initial phase the od680 values reached the highest value of 0 90 0 01 cm 1 on day 4 with a difference of 0 03 0 01 cm 1 from the control group subsequently the od680 values decreased sharply on days 5 and 6 indicating significant mortality of microcystis aeruginosa and the od680 value remained at 0 28 0 04 cm 1 when the concentration of mp derived dom exceeds the tolerance limit of the algal cell the structure of the algal cell breaks down in this case the algal cells will be in a state of zero growth or even negative growth and in severe cases mass mortality of algal cells will occur in addition the inhibition rate of mp derived dom on the growth of microcystis aeruginosa was proportional to its doc concentration since the concentration of pet derived dom leached by uv oxidation was relatively low it did not cause massive algal cell death but showed a significant inhibition of algal proliferation figure s9 presented the results of the flow cytometry assay for microcystis aeruginosa overall the fraction of viable cells of microcystis aeruginosa exposed to mp derived dom was significantly lower than that of the control group which was consistent with the growth curve for microcystis aeruginosa exposed to mp derived dom oxidized leached by uv o3 and uv h2o2 almost no algal cells survived whereas some algal cells still survived in the algal solution exposed to mp derived dom leached by uv oxidation cell density and growth inhibition rates were calculated and the results were shown in fig 4h mp derived dom has an extremely obvious inhibitory effect on the growth of microcystis aeruginosa in which the viable cell ratios decreased from 90 87 of the control group to 0 17 3 10 for pa6 and 0 14 46 90 for pet respectively the proportion of damaged cells was extremely high which was quite different from that of chlorella vulgaris suggesting that mp derived dom has a more inhibitory effect on prokaryotes represented by microcystis aeruginosa 3 4 dbp formation during chlorination of mp derived dom figs 5 a and b presented the dbp fps during chlorination of pa6 derived dom and pet derived dom respectively the formation potentials and yields of specific c dbps and n dbps were shown in figure s10 mp derived dom exhibit similar chlorine consumption 1 63 0 41 mg cl2 mg doc mean sd compared to dom of surface water 1 0 2 0 mg cl2 mg doc chlorination of mp derived dom after uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 treatment produced tox of 40 9 5 3 110 2 8 4 and 164 5 13 9 μg l as cl which are 2 1 5 8 and 8 6 times as much as that of control group 19 1 1 3 μg l the same trends were also observed for pet derived dom this phenomenon was mainly attributed to the higher doc concentration in mp derived dom which resulted in the higher disinfectant consumption in particular due to the different dom constitution the proportions of each type of dbp to aggregate dbps on a mass weight basis differed from that of surface water specifically unknown tox utox accounted for 19 6 28 9 of aggregate dbps figure s11 whereas the corresponding proportion for chlorinated surface water were 70 zhang et al 2018 therefore mp derived dom mainly served as precursors for known dbps thms haas and hals predominated in the chlorinated mp derived dom and their formation potentials were positively correlated with doc values r 2 0 82 p 0 05 the highest concentrations of thms haas and hals reached 61 8 4 9 μg l 40 5 3 1 μg l and 17 3 2 6 μg l respectively as for the dbp yields μg dbps mg doc the yields of thms and haas from pet derived dom figure s12 were higher than those from pa6 derived dom but were all lower than those from surface water du et al 2022 this phenomenon can be attributed to the low aromaticity of mp derived dom a previous study had shown that humic like substances were the dominant precursors of thms and haas ding et al 2019 in terms of hal yields there was a significant difference between mp derived dom 5 2 2 4 μg hals mg doc and surface water 8 9 4 2 μg hals mg doc du et al 2022 indicating that the main precursors of hals for mp derived dom are not the same as natural organic matter a previous study had shown that aldehydes ketones and amino acids appeared to be the principal hal precursors which were rarely found in mp derived dom table s4 du et al 2022 the mean n dbp concentrations in chlorinated pa6 derived dom leached by uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 treatments were 6 2 0 6 μg l 9 8 0 8 μg l and 12 7 0 7 μg l respectively the same trends were also observed for pet derived dom with the corresponding concentrations of 2 0 0 3 μg l 3 9 0 4 μg l and 4 9 0 7 μg l compared to n dbp fps from surface water du et al 2022 the production of n dbps from mp derived dom was lower except for a few samples from uv o3 in terms of n dbp yields figure s12 chlorinated pa dom and chlorinated pet derived dom showed similar n dbp yields but all were lower than that of surface water notably compared to the control group the yield of dbps for chlorinated mp derived dom increased significantly after uv based oxidation figure s12 indicating that the lower yields of dbps for chlorinated mp derived dom was due to different organic properties rather than the degradation effects of uv based oxidation on dom the formation of hams and hans have certain homology the concerted decarboxylation reaction and the substitution reaction of the α amine terminus of free amino acids are the main pathways for the formation of hans during the chlorination process shah and mitch 2012 further hydrolysis of hans can produce corresponding hams glezer et al 1999 and the formation of hnms was related to the don content bond et al 2011 the absence of typical precursors and the low levels of don resulted in the low yield of n dbps toxicity indexes were more suitable to express the potential dbp associated risks than dbp concentration and yields cti values of chlorinated mp derived dom were calculated and the results were shown in fig 5c the total cti values on chlorinated mp derived dom increased with the increases of doc which was consistent with the variation of aggregate dbp concentration the cti values of pet derived dom were lower than pa6 derived dom due to the less dbp concentration mean cti values for pa6 derived dom leached by uv uv h2o2 and uv o3 were 4 1 0 4 10 3 7 4 0 4 10 3 and 9 5 0 6 10 3 respectively which were 2 0 3 7 and 4 8 times of that from control group among these dbps hans and hals were the forcing agents of dbp associated toxicity fig 5d accounting for 75 of total dbp associated toxicity of chlorinated mp derived dom however due to the lower yields of hals and hans the cti yields of mp derived dom were also lower than those of surface water in summary mp derived dom released by uv based aops can serve as dbp precursors during chlorination process while their underlying impaction would be rare due to the lower dbp yields and dbp associated cytotoxicity 4 conclusions in this study the effects of uv based oxidation on the fragmentation dom release toxicity and dbp formation characteristics of three mps pp pa6 and pet were systematically investigated specific findings are listed below 1 uv aops significantly enhanced the aging and fragmentation of mps from larger particle sizes to smaller particle sizes with the following order uv o3 uv h2o2 uv which was ascribed to the specific reactive oxygen species the fragmentation degree of mps upon uv aops were dependent on monomer chemical structure of mps 2 doc content leached from mps after uv aops treatment ranged from 0 41 mg l to 4 23 mg l and uv o3 treatment produced most dom leaching compared with uv h2o2 and uv treatment combined fluorescence analysis with hrms confirmed that the dominant mp derived dom are chemical additives 3 pet derived dom and pa6 derived dom showed inhibition of vibrio fischeri activity with corresponding ec50 of 2 84 mg l and 4 58 mg l of doc bioassay test with chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa showed that mp derived dom inhibits the growth of chlorella vulgaris and microcystis aeruginosa by disrupting the cell membrane permeability and integrity 4 chlorine consumption for mp derived dom 1 6 0 4 mg doc were comparable to that for surface water 1 0 2 0 mg doc whereas dbp yields from mp derived dom were relatively lower than that from aquatic dom this suggests that mp derived dom itself rather than serving as dbp precursor might be potential toxic concern appendix a supplementary data supplementary data related to this article is available in this appendix declaration of competing interest the

14809,river regulation by dams can alter flow regimes and organic matter dynamics but less is known about how unregulated tributaries regulate organic matter composition and processing in the regulated river below the confluence this study reports on water chemistry especially dissolved organic matter dom concentration and composition dissolved organic carbon doc organic nitrogen don organic phosphorus dop and combined amino acids dcaa along the regulated tumut and unregulated goobarragandra tributary rivers under different flow conditions base flow vs storm event in south east australia the tributary was significantly different from regulated and downstream sites during base flow conditions with higher temperature ph buffering capacity doc and nutrient concentrations don dop dcaa dom characterisation by spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography revealed that the tributary contained a higher proportion of terrestrially derived humic like and fulvic like dom in contrast regulated and downstream sites contained higher proportion of microbially derived dom such as low molecular weight neutrals and protein like components storm pulses of tributary flows into the regulated system influenced both concentration and composition of dom at the downstream site which more strongly resembled the tributary site than the regulated site during the storm event additionally we found that the tributary supplied fresh dom including small organic molecules to the regulated system during storm events the presence of these different types of labile dom can increase primary productivity and ecological functioning within regulated river reaches downstream of tributary junctions this has important implications for the protection of unregulated tributary inflows within regulated river basins graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords hydrology river management organic matter dynamics fluorescence flood data availability data will be made

benefits e g drinking water supply energy and irrigation protection against flood in the context of changing climate and population growth dams have been linked with adverse effects on physico chemical and ecological functioning of downstream ecosystems mor et al 2018 the serial discontinuity concept is a theoretical framework that describes how the longitudinal profile of physical and biogeochemical parameters down river systems is disrupted by dams and or reservoirs ward and stanford 1983 these discontinuities tend to be restored gradually by tributary inflows further downstream for example om cycling including c n and p is often significantly altered immediately downstream of dams due to different rates of storage and cycling of carbon and nutrients within the reservoir tranvik et al 2009 ulseth and hall 2015 dams isolate headwater catchments trapping terrestrial om allochthonous for extended periods of time leading to microbial and photo chemical processing of terrestrial om kothawala et al 2014 production of labile algal and microbial dom autochthonous and deposition within the reservoir thereby altering both the quality and quantity of dom to downstream ecosystems mash et al 2004 ulseth and hall 2015 dams also attenuate peak flows dampening snowmelt and or rain associated runoff and om pulses goodman et al 2011 rohlfs et al 2016 reduction of peak flows can isolate downstream ecosystems but also alter the relative contribution of tributary inflows e g when mainstem flows are reduced tributaries may have a disproportionally large effect on om cycling and vice versa all these processes are likely to modify om dynamics downstream of dams and subsequent tributary junctions the effect of river regulation by dams on dom dynamics has been studied previously with contrasting findings for instance both dom composition and bioavailability were altered below dams in the colorado river basin ulseth and hall 2015 whereas no effect was observed on dom composition of pristine boreal rivers nadon et al 2015 the altered dom composition of regulated river systems can be influenced by unregulated tributaries due to their unaltered continuum and direct connectivity with catchment characteristics and processes previous research has shown the recovery of key water chemistry parameters e g water temperature kiffney et al 2006 sediment sabo et al 2012 organic carbon rohlfs et al 2015 in a regulated river downstream from tributaries thus ameliorating the impact of upstream impoundments however the magnitude of recovery or tributary effect depends on many factors such as tributary size its distance from the dam tributary catchment area and ratio of tributary water volume to mainstem channel benda et al 2004 kiffney et al 2006 despite ample studies on dom dynamics in regulated river systems a significant knowledge gap still exists in the molecular understanding of how tributaries influence dom composition in the regulated reaches downstream of tributary confluences this study aims to determine i differences in water chemistry especially dom concentration and composition between a regulated and unregulated river and ii the role of an unregulated tributary in restoring water chemistry in a regulated river during base flow and storm flow conditions our study provides a comprehensive analysis of how dom responds to different flow conditions and river management practices which will help to understand the role of tributaries in alleviating the effects of dams on dom dynamics and downstream ecosystem health it is increasingly important to address this knowledge gap given the increasing rates of dam construction and growing pressures on unregulated systems from increased water scarcity the region studied in this work experienced a wide spread wildfire in the summer 2019 20 the potential impacts of this fire are considered here in terms of the impacts on water chemistry from fire affected catchments particularly under high flow conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the regulated tumut and unregulated goobarragandra tributary rivers in new south wales australia fig 1 the tumut river starts from the toolong range west of mount jagungal 2061 m and receives inflows from its mountainous and largely forested catchment the upper reaches of the tumut river are impounded to create the tumut pond reservoir which also receives water from lake eucumbene and the headwaters of the upper murrumbidgee and tooma rivers via the snowy mountains hydroelectric scheme green et al 2011 the waters then flow through a series of dams and reservoirs i e tumut 2 pondage talbingo dam jounama dam and blowering dam before being released back into the tumut river the retention time of water in blowering dam ranges from 166 to 270 days in contrast the goobarrangandra river originates below peppercorn hill in fiery range 1330 m and joins the tumut river at tumut township approximately 13 km downstream of blowering reservoir fig 1 the regulated tumut and unregulated goobarragandra rivers have a catchment area of 1630 km2 and 667 9 km2 respectively the study area is underlain by a large continuous granite rock and granitic gneiss peischl et al 2012 soils within the catchments are classified as sandy and sandy loam the headwater of both rivers lies within national parks and nature reserves dominated by forest peischl et al 2012 the forest vegetation comprises of snow gums eucalyptus pauciflora with native herbs and grasses in the higher elevations while the lower elevations especially riparian areas are covered by river red gums eucalyptus camaldulensis and some exotic species such as willows salix sp slattery 2015 the lower part of both catchments is covered by grazing land 2 2 sampling sites sample collection and analysis a total of 8 sampling sites were initially selected fig 1 two tributary sites along the goobarragandra river tu td and six along the tumut river two sites upstream of talbingo reservoir uu ud two middle regulated sites downstream from blowering reservoir mu md and two downstream sites after the confluence of the tumut river with the goobarragandra river du dd each pair of sites were approximately 6 km apart a preliminary examination of the first sampling dataset showed that paired sites were very similar to each other fig s1 s2 thus only 4 sites ud md td and dd were subsequently sampled field work was carried out from october 2019 to march 2020 during base flow and high discharge storm conditions there were 9 sampling occasions in total 5 during base flow and 4 during high discharge events to assist in understanding change over seasonal timescales base flow sampling occasions were categorised into late spring early summer mid summer late summer and early autumn and the corresponding dates are shown in table s1 high discharge events were named as event 1 event 2 and event 3 table s1 extra samples were collected every 6 hours during event 3 using autosamplers at each site the extensive wildfires in south east australia over summer 2019 20 burnt the upper catchment of the tumut and goobarragandra rivers and prevented access to site ud after january 2020 therefore our study ultimately focused on results obtained from 3 main sites md td and dd and referred to as regulated tributary and downstream hereafter despite this set back analysis of late spring and early summer data showed that the upstream site was similar to the tributary site while different to the regulated and downstream sites fig s3 discharge results at the regulated tributary and downstream sites were obtained from gauging stations maintained by waternsw https realtimedata

using factominer package le et al 2008 all other data are presented as boxplots in r using the ggplot2 package wickham 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrology during the study period discharge in the goobarragandra river varied from 0 4 18 3 m3 s 1 with an average flow of 1 9 m3 s 1 the unregulated goobarragandra river exhibits a natural hydrograph with low flows in summer and high flows in the winter spring period with episodic high flows corresponding to rain events fig 2 in contrast discharge in the regulated tumut river varied from 6 5 84 8 m3 s 1 and showed the reverse seasonal pattern with high flows during spring summer time to support the water demands for downstream irrigation and low flows in winter as the storages are refilled tributaries can influence the water volume of regulated rivers rice et al 2006 however flows in the studied tributary goobarragandra river did not contribute a substantial volume of water to the main channel at the downstream site within the study period thus the ratio of tributary to regulated flow qt qr was low for the entire spring autumn period apart from occasional high flow events in the tributary and during winter when regulated flows were at minimum fig 2 3 2 physical water quality physical water quality parameters showed similarity between regulated and downstream sites however both sites were distinctly different to the tributary during base flow conditions fig 3 a table s2 on average the tributary had higher temperatures 19 1 4 8 c higher ph 7 7 0 2 and higher specific conductance 67 9 9 7 µs cm 1 than the regulated site temp 13 5 3 1 c ph 7 1 0 4 cond 32 1 1 5 µs cm 1 or downstream site temp 13 9 2 3 c ph 7 1 0 3 cond 34 7 3 8 µs cm 1 mean do concentration was higher at the regulated 11 0 1 3 mg l 1 and downstream sites 10 5 1 1 mg l 1 compared to the tributary site 9 1 0 9 mg l 1 which is linked to lower temperatures in these systems with similar do saturation values across all sites table s2 turbidity was generally low 3 ntu at all sites under base flow conditions however tributary inflows contributed to increased turbidity temperature and conductivity in the downstream site during storm events table s3 3 3 ionic composition ionic composition showed distinct differences among regulated tributary and downstream sites during base flow conditions fig 3b despite broad similarity in catchment lithology and soil types concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 and cl were higher in the tributary with strong buffering capacity as indicated by higher charge balance alkalinity cbalk fig s4 in contrast two anions no3 and so4 were higher in the regulated and downstream sites the observed difference in ionic composition is likely derived from a reservoir effect ahearn et al 2005 rather than the geographical differences the connectivity of the tumut river within the land scape is largely altered by a complex hydropower design as a result water within this system receives minimum contact with the underlying geology and is further impacted by reservoir processes thus oxidation of reduced nitrogen and sulfur in om trapped within the reservoir may explain higher concentration of no3 and so4 in the regulated site ahearn et al 2005 holmer and storkholm 2001 the concentrations of most ions increased in the tributary except na and mg2 and downstream sites during high flow events compared to base flows fig s5 given that wildfire occurred before the pulse event sampling the strong export of these ions are likely associated with post fire runoff reflecting mobilisation of solutes from burnt soil and ash material johnston and maher 2022 the decreased concentrations of base cations na and mg2 within the tributary might have resulted from dilution due to high runoff flows concentrations of all ions including cbalk at the downstream site shifted to levels similar to the tributary under pulse flow reflecting the dominant contribution of tributary inflows fig s5 3 4 doc and nutrient concentrations doc concentrations ranged between 0 4 3 7 mg c l 1 during base flow with significant differences between sampling sites and times p 0 01 the highest and lowest doc concentrations were observed in the tributary and regulated sites respectively fig 3c 4 a lower doc concentrations downstream of dams has been documented previously rohlfs et al 2015 ulseth and hall 2015 and attributed to a variety of biotic e g heterotrophic consumption of labile doc koehler et al 2012 and abiotic factors e g photo mineralization burial of doc due to longer water residence time in reservoirs hanson et al 2011 knoll et al 2013 tributaries can be a potential source of carbon to the doc poor regulated reaches however similar doc concentrations between the regulated 1 35 0 35 mg c l 1 and downstream 1 62 0 62 mg c l 1 sites were observed in this study due to lower qt qr ratio under base flow conditions doc was highest in late spring and lowest in early summer across all sites concentrations of don 70 197 µg n l 1 and dop 1 14 µg p l 1 also showed spatial and temporal variation with significant interaction between sampling sites and seasons p 0 05 both don and dop were generally higher within the tributary site except don in early autumn and dop in early summer fig 4a don showed increasing trends towards summer across all sites whereas dop showed strong seasonal variations especially at the tributary the significant increase in dop at the tributary from mid summer to early autumn is likely derived from wildfire johnston and maher 2022 however the same phenomenon was not visible in the regulated and downstream sites longer water retention time within the reservoirs is suspected to dampened immediate fire impacts delaying the increase in dop concentrations until early autumn the variations in doc and don concentrations are reflected in c n ratios which can describe the bioavailability and composition of dom yates et al 2019 an elevated c n ratio within the tributary in late spring indicates transport of terrestrial dom into the catchment similar c n ratios in the regulated and downstream sites during same period could have derived from preferential removal of n containing dom lowest don fig 4a by heterotrophic bacteria for longer periods in the reservoir takaki et al 2022 lower c n ratios across all sites during summer suggests shift in dom composition towards more autochthonous sources due to warmer temperatures and favourable light conditions mattsson et al 2005 dcaa concentrations ranged between 3 24 µg n l 1 during base flow with significantly higher concentrations within the tributary fig 5 a concentrations of dcaa showed general increasing trends towards summer within the tributary site and are likely derived from photodegradation of dom and autochthonous activities edokpa et al 2018 dcaa accounted for 3 23 of don n dcaa and n dcaa followed similar seasonal trends to dcaa regardless of site as observed in other river systems duan and bianchi 2007 kaiser et al 2017 the level of n dcaa observed in this study is comparable to previous studies including the lower mississippi river 5 13 pearl river 8 23 duan and bianchi 2007 and alpine peatland streams 5 16 silvester et al 2021 besides these readily available low molecular weight compounds high molecular weight don is mainly of humic origin edokpa et al 2018 in this study hs accounted for 25 52 of don n hs with lower amounts observed during summer at all sites fig 5a the lower n hs in summer is likely due to photochemical and microbial degradation of humic substances which can release n rich compounds edokpa et al 2018 this is further supported by the increased don and dcaa concentrations in summer concentrations of tn 93 200 µg n l 1 and tp 6 22 µg p l 1 were only slightly higher than tdn 77 165 µg n l 1 and tdp 2 17 µg p l 1 respectively indicating that these nutrients were strongly partitioned to their dissolved forms these nutrients were higher at the tributary site compared to regulated and downstream sites fig s6 on average the dominant form of dissolved nitrogen was don 84 5 11 6 with very low levels of inorganic nitrogens nh4 3 9 1 7 and nox 11 6 10 9 although inorganic nitrogens were present at lower concentrations our study showed that nox 1 84 µg n l 1 was significantly higher within the regulated site fig s6 while some dams act as a nox source as suggested by the results in this study others play a crucial role in retention of nutrients including nox and po4 3 kelly 2001 maavara et al 2015 nox showed strong seasonal variation at the regulated site with lowest concentrations in summer especially early summer the lowest nox concentrations could have occurred due to algal uptake during the productive season sprague 2002 even though concentrations of po4 3 2 17 µg p l 1 were very low across all sites significantly lower concentrations within the regulated reaches likely resulted from absorption of phosphorus within the reservoir sediment maavara et al 2015 overall tributary inflows could not restore nutrient concentrations within the regulated system during base flow conditions both doc and nutrient concentrations increased significantly within the tributary and downstream sites during storm events fig 4b fig s7 s8 doc concentration within the tributary was 2 1 mg c l 1 before the event then doc increased in the rising limb and reached 10 8 mg c l 1 after peak discharge fig s9 a similar trend was observed at the downstream site 1 7 9 3 mg c l 1 but a time lag occurred in flow and in the resultant increase in doc concentration in contrast there was no change in flow or doc concentration at the regulated site discharge has also been previously shown to increase doc concentrations in other australian rivers burford et al 2012 rohlfs et al 2015 westhorpe and mitrovic 2012 and demonstrates a shift in doc pool sources and hydrological pathways with increase transport from the terrestrial environment fellman et al 2009b inamdar et al 2011 the elevated concentrations of tn 2 times tdn and tp 3 times tdp at the tributary site suggests higher transport of particulate materials during storm events keeping in mind that these catchment responses are likely influenced by post fire runoff effects with enhanced transport of carbon and nutrient from burned soil surfaces johnston and maher 2022 uzun et al 2020 the decreased proportion of n dcaa during storm events fig 5b also support post fire runoff effect which increases transport of heteroaromatics compounds uzun et al 2020 there was very little change in water chemistry at the regulated site during storm events apart from a transient increase in nh4 concentrations during event 3 given that the discharge at regulated site decreased over the storm periods any changes in water chemistry are probably due to instream processes rather than runoff effects significantly higher concentrations of doc dcaa tp and tdp all p 0 01 at the downstream site compared to the regulated site during storm events fig 4b fig 5b fig s8 indicates the influence of tributary inflows into a regulated system the study conducted by rohlfs et al 2015 in the regulated snowy river also reported distinct doc pulses below the tributary confluence during tributary releases 3 5 dom characterisation 3 5 1 dom characterisation by absorbance and florescence spectroscopy five major components c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 were identified via parafac analysis fig s10 all components were compared in the openfluor database with tucker s congruence coefficient of 0 90 or greater peak locations description and number of models matched in openfluor database against each component are shown in table s4 excitation and emission characteristics of c1 is similar to terrestrially derived humic like dom originating from soil and or forested environments fellman et al 2009a c2 is also terrestrially derived dom but has characteristics similar to fulvic acid fellman et al 2009a both c1 27 8 and c2 34 8 were the most dominant components in the tumut goobarragandra catchment and generally higher within the tributary fig s11 c3 matches the spectral characteristics of microbial humic like dom and represents the labile fraction produced from microbial degradation of om borisover et al 2011 c4 and c5 have been characterised as protein like dom c4 tyrosine like c5 tryptophan like yamashita and tanoue 2004 which may have originated either from the presence of proteinaceous materials yamashita and tanoue 2004 or from the phenolic compounds including tannins and lignins maie et al 2007 moreover zhuang et al 2021 categorised c5 component as benzoic like acid which is highly bioavailable and found in plant leachate suva254 ranged between 1 0 6 6 l mg 1 m 1 across the study sites and generally observed higher within the tributary site fig s12 the range of suva254 reported in this study is comparable to previous studies chen et al 2019 holland et al 2018 sr and e2 e3 ranged between 0 7 3 0 and 3 2 8 3 respectively and showed the opposite trend to the suva254 higher suva254 and lower sr and e2 e3 values within the tributary suggest presence of aromatic high molecular weight dom de haan and de boer 1987 helms et al 2008 weishaar et al 2003 fi ranged between 1 3 1 7 suggesting the mixture of terrestrial and microbial dom cory and mcknight 2005 hix ranged between 0 2 0 9 and bix ranged between 0 5 0 9 and showed opposite trends to each other fig s12 higher hix and lower bix values within the tributary reflects strongly humified dom with lower proportion of freshly produced autochthonous om huguet et al 2009 ohno 2002 3 5 2 dom characterisation by lc ocd ond characterisation of dom by lc ocd ond comprised six different fractions bp hs bb lmwn lmwa and hoc lc ocd ond also revealed that hs 56 7 was the most dominant fraction and observed higher within the tributary fig s13 significant positive correlation of hs with suva254 and negative correlations with sr and fi suggest that hs consists of terrestrially derived aromatic high molecular weight compounds table s5 bp was the least abundant fraction accounting 5 across all sites higher abundances of bb 14 3 and lmwn 8 3 were observed at the regulated and downstream sites and positive correlations of these molecules with sr and bix reflects that they are recently produced low molecular weight compounds hoc 17 8 were generally similar across all sites slightly higher at regulated and downstream sites whereas lmwa were only observed during storm pulses at the tributary and downstream sites in extremely low proportions 1 3 5 3 dissolved combined amino acids dcaa composition in total sixteen aas were identified fig 6 a where glycine threonine serine glx glutamine and glutamic acid asx asparagine and aspartic acid and alanine were the major constituents contributing up to 59 of dcaa these aas have been reported as the dominant components of dcaa in previous studies duan and bianchi 2007 silvester et al 2021 cystine and histidine were the least abundant aas each accounting 1 at all sites 3 5 4 spatio temporal variation of overall dom composition dom composition showed spatial and temporal variations under base flow conditions with a significant interaction between sampling sites and seasons pseudo f 2 16 p 0 004 the tributary contained more humified terrestrial dom of high molecular weight lower sr and e2 e3 higher mn and aromaticity high suva254 consisting of hs humic like c1 and fulvic like c2 components fig 3d fig s11 14 the regulated and downstream sites contained more autochthonous higher fi recently produced higher bix low molecular weight dom higher sr and e2 e3 lower mn with higher amounts of bb lmwn and protein like c4 component these differences in dom composition between the regulated and tributary sites are likely derived from longer water residence time sedimentation of om increased microbial processing and production along with photodegradation of dom within the reservoir differences in dom composition have been reported previously in hydrologically modified river systems mash et al 2004 spencer et al 2012 ulseth and hall 2015 however none of the previous studies combine spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography techniques for in depth characterisation of dom both carbon and nitrogen together with exploring the role of tributary inflows in restoring dom quality and quantity within the regulated systems dcaa composition also differed between sites during base flow conditions pseudo f 2 25 p 0 01 with higher abundance of isoleucine leucine proline threonine and valine at the tributary fig 6b fig s15 these aa are rich in leaf litter harris et al 2016 ylla et al 2011 thus their higher proportion within the tributary is attributed to mobilisation from decomposed leaf materials in contrast aas such as alanine glycine and lysine were higher at the regulated site the higher proportion of glycine at the regulated site reflect its resistance during decomposition together with its minor food value to micro and macroconsumers dauwe and middelburg 1998 with the beginning of summer proportions of microbial humic like c3 component increased fig s11 the increased proportion of this c3 component especially at the tributary site suggests higher autochthonous productivity due to favourable summer temperatures this is further supported by an increased percentage of lmwn and aas in summer fig s13 s15 s16 as microbes are able to breakdown hs into smaller labile molecules e g bb and lmwn either through microbial pathways or photodegradation holland et al 2019 relatively increased proportions of these molecules likely reflect the higher level of microbial activities in summer additionally increased proportion of tyrosine phenylalanine and histidine within the tributary in early summer indicate generation of fresh labile om due to autochthonous activities cowie and hedges 1992 increased proportions of hoc in early autumn fig s13 are likely attributed from extra polymeric substances derived from algal and bacterial activities lichner et al 2013 here correlation of hoc with bix r 0 4 p 0 001 further suggests that hoc reflects recently derived autochthonous material as the tributary discharge increased in response to rainfall events increasing qt qr ratio a tributary effect was strongly visible resulting in significant variations in dom composition between the regulated and downstream sites table s6 in general high flow events can affect the overall composition of dom due to mobilisation of different dom rich terrestrial sources that are not available under base flow conditions chen et al 2019 inamdar et al 2011 our results showed that dom becomes more terrestrially derived i e higher hs aromaticity and molecular weight within the tributary and downstream sites during events fig s17 18 this change in dom composition can be explained by transport of organic material from upstream forested areas the decreased of n hs fig 5b presence of lmwa and increased of several aas linked to leaf degradation fig s19 20 aryal et al 2016 duan and bianchi 2007 further supports mobilisation of terrestrial degraded organic material from the catchment during storm events these results are consistent with other studies conducted in the forested catchments chen et al 2019 inamdar et al 2011 we further recorded increased proportions of fulvic like c2 component and microbial humic like c3 component at the tributary site during the first event shortly after fire in the upper catchments fig s21 as mentioned earlier due to the unexpected fire half way through this study results likely reflect a mixture of storm and fire effects during high flow events this result is consistent with that reported by uzun et al 2020 and suggests the release of significantly higher fulvic like and microbial like components from fire and or post fire biological activities overall the shift in dom composition within the tributary significantly altered dom composition within the downstream site during high flow events altering its water chemistry to be more representative of the tributary than the regulated site 3 6 environmental significance artificial dams reservoirs in the tumut river have considerably modified natural flow regimes compared to the unregulated goobarragandra river fig 2 this modification has significantly altered thermal regimes and water chemistry including transport of carbon and nutrient below the reservoir fig 3 doc and nutrient concentrations were higher in the tributary and dom composed of terrestrially derived high molecular weight aromatic components such as hs indicating that dom within the tributary is mainly controlled by upstream catchment processes and inputs in contrast the regulated system was dominated by newly produced autochthonous low molecular weight dom the tributary could not restore water chemistry at the downstream site during base flow conditions due to extremely low qt qr ratio however under high flow storm conditions increasing qt qr ratio doc and nutrient concentrations and composition altered significantly at the downstream site and closely resembled the tributary site compared to the regulated site as such tributary inflows re connect regulated downstream reaches with catchment characteristics and processes during high flow events input of limiting nutrient such as p e g dop po4 3 from tributary can increase the primary productivity of nutrient poor regulated systems the mixing of terrestrial carbon from tributary and autochthonous carbon from reservoir can broaden the resource base for downstream communities allowing more diverse trophic pathways sabo et al 2018 and partially restoring the broken continuum in regulated rivers additionally fresh supply of labile organic molecules as indicated by aa and lmwa in this study can support bacterial carbon demand berggren et al 2010 dietary needs dwyer et al 2018 and decomposition of recalcitrant dom that is otherwise unavailable guenet et al 2010 to our knowledge this is the first study to show that tributaries can restore dom and nutrient dynamics within regulated systems during storm events and this has important implications for restoring productivity and overall ecosystem function within downstream reaches of regulated systems 4 conclusions this study provides comprehensive insights into water chemistry and dom characteristics within a regulated and unregulated river system under different flow conditions dams in the tumut river modified natural flow regimes with a ramification for downstream water chemistry in line with the serial discontinuity concept the regulated tumut river possessed lower dom concentrations doc don dop dcaa and was dominated by autochthonous dom of a lower molecular weight in contrast the unregulated tributary contained higher dom concentrations with aromatic high molecular weight dom of terrestrial origin extremely low qt qr ratios within this system contributed to the lack of a tributary effect under base flow conditions however during storm events high flow pulses within the tributary substantially increased doc dcaa tp and tdp concentrations and altered dom composition with fresh supply of large and small terrestrial organic molecules at the downstream site thus tributaries can temporarily dampen the impact of dams and restore nutrient and dom quality as well as quantity during high flow storm events therefore judicial planning and protection of tributaries and natural flow regimes within regulated systems should be prioritized for maintaining and improving integrity of downstream ecosystems

14809,river regulation by dams can alter flow regimes and organic matter dynamics but less is known about how unregulated tributaries regulate organic matter composition and processing in the regulated river below the confluence this study reports on water chemistry especially dissolved organic matter dom concentration and composition dissolved organic carbon doc organic nitrogen don organic phosphorus dop and combined amino acids dcaa along the regulated tumut and unregulated goobarragandra tributary rivers under different flow conditions base flow vs storm event in south east australia the tributary was significantly different from regulated and downstream sites during base flow conditions with higher temperature ph buffering capacity doc and nutrient concentrations don dop dcaa dom characterisation by spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography revealed that the tributary contained a higher proportion of terrestrially derived humic like and fulvic like dom in contrast regulated and downstream sites contained higher proportion of microbially derived dom such as low molecular weight neutrals and protein like components storm pulses of tributary flows into the regulated system influenced both concentration and composition of dom at the downstream site which more strongly resembled the tributary site than the regulated site during the storm event additionally we found that the tributary supplied fresh dom including small organic molecules to the regulated system during storm events the presence of these different types of labile dom can increase primary productivity and ecological functioning within regulated river reaches downstream of tributary junctions this has important implications for the protection of unregulated tributary inflows within regulated river basins graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords hydrology river management organic matter dynamics fluorescence flood data availability data will be made

benefits e g drinking water supply energy and irrigation protection against flood in the context of changing climate and population growth dams have been linked with adverse effects on physico chemical and ecological functioning of downstream ecosystems mor et al 2018 the serial discontinuity concept is a theoretical framework that describes how the longitudinal profile of physical and biogeochemical parameters down river systems is disrupted by dams and or reservoirs ward and stanford 1983 these discontinuities tend to be restored gradually by tributary inflows further downstream for example om cycling including c n and p is often significantly altered immediately downstream of dams due to different rates of storage and cycling of carbon and nutrients within the reservoir tranvik et al 2009 ulseth and hall 2015 dams isolate headwater catchments trapping terrestrial om allochthonous for extended periods of time leading to microbial and photo chemical processing of terrestrial om kothawala et al 2014 production of labile algal and microbial dom autochthonous and deposition within the reservoir thereby altering both the quality and quantity of dom to downstream ecosystems mash et al 2004 ulseth and hall 2015 dams also attenuate peak flows dampening snowmelt and or rain associated runoff and om pulses goodman et al 2011 rohlfs et al 2016 reduction of peak flows can isolate downstream ecosystems but also alter the relative contribution of tributary inflows e g when mainstem flows are reduced tributaries may have a disproportionally large effect on om cycling and vice versa all these processes are likely to modify om dynamics downstream of dams and subsequent tributary junctions the effect of river regulation by dams on dom dynamics has been studied previously with contrasting findings for instance both dom composition and bioavailability were altered below dams in the colorado river basin ulseth and hall 2015 whereas no effect was observed on dom composition of pristine boreal rivers nadon et al 2015 the altered dom composition of regulated river systems can be influenced by unregulated tributaries due to their unaltered continuum and direct connectivity with catchment characteristics and processes previous research has shown the recovery of key water chemistry parameters e g water temperature kiffney et al 2006 sediment sabo et al 2012 organic carbon rohlfs et al 2015 in a regulated river downstream from tributaries thus ameliorating the impact of upstream impoundments however the magnitude of recovery or tributary effect depends on many factors such as tributary size its distance from the dam tributary catchment area and ratio of tributary water volume to mainstem channel benda et al 2004 kiffney et al 2006 despite ample studies on dom dynamics in regulated river systems a significant knowledge gap still exists in the molecular understanding of how tributaries influence dom composition in the regulated reaches downstream of tributary confluences this study aims to determine i differences in water chemistry especially dom concentration and composition between a regulated and unregulated river and ii the role of an unregulated tributary in restoring water chemistry in a regulated river during base flow and storm flow conditions our study provides a comprehensive analysis of how dom responds to different flow conditions and river management practices which will help to understand the role of tributaries in alleviating the effects of dams on dom dynamics and downstream ecosystem health it is increasingly important to address this knowledge gap given the increasing rates of dam construction and growing pressures on unregulated systems from increased water scarcity the region studied in this work experienced a wide spread wildfire in the summer 2019 20 the potential impacts of this fire are considered here in terms of the impacts on water chemistry from fire affected catchments particularly under high flow conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the regulated tumut and unregulated goobarragandra tributary rivers in new south wales australia fig 1 the tumut river starts from the toolong range west of mount jagungal 2061 m and receives inflows from its mountainous and largely forested catchment the upper reaches of the tumut river are impounded to create the tumut pond reservoir which also receives water from lake eucumbene and the headwaters of the upper murrumbidgee and tooma rivers via the snowy mountains hydroelectric scheme green et al 2011 the waters then flow through a series of dams and reservoirs i e tumut 2 pondage talbingo dam jounama dam and blowering dam before being released back into the tumut river the retention time of water in blowering dam ranges from 166 to 270 days in contrast the goobarrangandra river originates below peppercorn hill in fiery range 1330 m and joins the tumut river at tumut township approximately 13 km downstream of blowering reservoir fig 1 the regulated tumut and unregulated goobarragandra rivers have a catchment area of 1630 km2 and 667 9 km2 respectively the study area is underlain by a large continuous granite rock and granitic gneiss peischl et al 2012 soils within the catchments are classified as sandy and sandy loam the headwater of both rivers lies within national parks and nature reserves dominated by forest peischl et al 2012 the forest vegetation comprises of snow gums eucalyptus pauciflora with native herbs and grasses in the higher elevations while the lower elevations especially riparian areas are covered by river red gums eucalyptus camaldulensis and some exotic species such as willows salix sp slattery 2015 the lower part of both catchments is covered by grazing land 2 2 sampling sites sample collection and analysis a total of 8 sampling sites were initially selected fig 1 two tributary sites along the goobarragandra river tu td and six along the tumut river two sites upstream of talbingo reservoir uu ud two middle regulated sites downstream from blowering reservoir mu md and two downstream sites after the confluence of the tumut river with the goobarragandra river du dd each pair of sites were approximately 6 km apart a preliminary examination of the first sampling dataset showed that paired sites were very similar to each other fig s1 s2 thus only 4 sites ud md td and dd were subsequently sampled field work was carried out from october 2019 to march 2020 during base flow and high discharge storm conditions there were 9 sampling occasions in total 5 during base flow and 4 during high discharge events to assist in understanding change over seasonal timescales base flow sampling occasions were categorised into late spring early summer mid summer late summer and early autumn and the corresponding dates are shown in table s1 high discharge events were named as event 1 event 2 and event 3 table s1 extra samples were collected every 6 hours during event 3 using autosamplers at each site the extensive wildfires in south east australia over summer 2019 20 burnt the upper catchment of the tumut and goobarragandra rivers and prevented access to site ud after january 2020 therefore our study ultimately focused on results obtained from 3 main sites md td and dd and referred to as regulated tributary and downstream hereafter despite this set back analysis of late spring and early summer data showed that the upstream site was similar to the tributary site while

the goobarragandra river varied from 0 4 18 3 m3 s 1 with an average flow of 1 9 m3 s 1 the unregulated goobarragandra river exhibits a natural hydrograph with low flows in summer and high flows in the winter spring period with episodic high flows corresponding to rain events fig 2 in contrast discharge in the regulated tumut river varied from 6 5 84 8 m3 s 1 and showed the reverse seasonal pattern with high flows during spring summer time to support the water demands for downstream irrigation and low flows in winter as the storages are refilled tributaries can influence the water volume of regulated rivers rice et al 2006 however flows in the studied tributary goobarragandra river did not contribute a substantial volume of water to the main channel at the downstream site within the study period thus the ratio of tributary to regulated flow qt qr was low for the entire spring autumn period apart from occasional high flow events in the tributary and during winter when regulated flows were at minimum fig 2 3 2 physical water quality physical water quality parameters showed similarity between regulated and downstream sites however both sites were distinctly different to the tributary during base flow conditions fig 3 a table s2 on average the tributary had higher temperatures 19 1 4 8 c higher ph 7 7 0 2 and higher specific conductance 67 9 9 7 µs cm 1 than the regulated

downstream sites 10 5 1 1 mg l 1 compared to the tributary site 9 1 0 9 mg l 1 which is linked to lower temperatures in these systems with similar do saturation values across all sites table s2 turbidity was generally low 3 ntu at all sites under base flow conditions however tributary inflows contributed to increased turbidity temperature and conductivity in the downstream site during storm events table s3 3 3 ionic composition ionic composition showed distinct differences among regulated tributary and downstream sites during base flow conditions fig 3b despite broad similarity in catchment lithology and soil types concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 and cl were higher in the tributary with strong buffering capacity as indicated by higher charge balance alkalinity cbalk fig s4 in contrast two anions no3 and so4 were higher in the regulated and downstream sites the observed difference in ionic composition is likely derived from a reservoir effect ahearn et al 2005 rather than the geographical differences the connectivity of the tumut river within the land scape is largely altered by a complex hydropower design as a result water within this system receives minimum contact with the underlying geology and is further impacted by reservoir processes thus oxidation of reduced nitrogen and sulfur in om trapped within the reservoir may explain higher concentration of no3 and so4 in the regulated site ahearn et al 2005 holmer and storkholm 2001 the concentrations of most ions increased in the tributary except na and mg2 and downstream sites during high flow events compared to base flows fig s5 given that wildfire occurred before the pulse event sampling the strong export of these ions are likely associated with post fire runoff reflecting mobilisation of solutes from burnt soil and ash material johnston and maher 2022 the decreased concentrations of base cations na and mg2 within the tributary might have resulted from dilution due to high runoff flows concentrations of all ions including cbalk at the downstream site shifted to levels similar to the tributary under pulse flow reflecting the dominant contribution of tributary inflows fig s5 3 4 doc and nutrient concentrations doc concentrations ranged between 0 4 3 7 mg c l 1 during base flow with significant differences between sampling sites and times p 0 01 the highest and lowest doc concentrations were observed in the tributary and regulated sites respectively fig 3c 4 a lower doc concentrations downstream of dams has been documented previously rohlfs et al 2015 ulseth and hall 2015 and attributed to a variety of biotic e g heterotrophic consumption of labile doc koehler et al 2012 and abiotic factors e g photo mineralization burial of doc due to longer water residence time in reservoirs hanson et al 2011 knoll et al 2013 tributaries can be a potential source of carbon to the doc poor regulated reaches however similar doc concentrations between the regulated 1 35 0 35 mg c l 1 and downstream 1 62 0 62 mg c l 1 sites were observed in this study due to lower qt qr ratio under base flow conditions doc was highest in late spring and lowest in early summer across all sites concentrations of don 70 197 µg n l 1 and dop 1 14 µg p l 1 also showed spatial and temporal variation with significant interaction between sampling sites and seasons p 0 05 both don and dop were generally higher within the tributary site except don in early autumn and dop in early summer fig 4a don showed increasing trends towards summer across all sites whereas dop showed strong seasonal variations especially at the tributary the significant increase in dop at the tributary from mid summer to early autumn is likely derived from wildfire johnston and maher 2022 however the same phenomenon was not visible in the regulated and downstream sites longer water retention time within the reservoirs is suspected to dampened immediate fire impacts delaying the increase in dop concentrations until early autumn the variations in doc and don concentrations are reflected in c n ratios which can describe the bioavailability and composition of dom yates et al 2019 an elevated c n ratio within the tributary in late spring indicates transport of terrestrial dom into the catchment similar c n ratios in the regulated and downstream sites during same period could have derived from preferential removal of n containing dom lowest don fig 4a by heterotrophic bacteria for longer periods in the reservoir takaki et al 2022 lower c n ratios across all sites during summer suggests shift in dom composition towards more autochthonous sources due to warmer temperatures and favourable light conditions mattsson et al 2005 dcaa concentrations ranged between 3 24 µg n l 1 during base flow with significantly higher concentrations within the tributary fig 5 a concentrations of dcaa showed general increasing trends towards summer within the tributary site and are likely derived from photodegradation of dom and autochthonous activities edokpa et al 2018 dcaa accounted for 3 23 of don n dcaa and n dcaa followed similar seasonal trends to dcaa regardless of site as observed in other river systems duan and bianchi 2007 kaiser et al 2017 the level of n dcaa observed in this study is comparable to previous studies including the lower mississippi river 5 13 pearl river 8 23 duan and bianchi 2007 and alpine peatland streams 5 16 silvester et al 2021 besides these readily available low molecular weight compounds high molecular weight don is mainly of humic origin edokpa et al 2018 in this study hs accounted for 25 52 of don n hs with lower amounts observed during summer at all sites fig 5a the lower n hs in summer is likely due to photochemical and microbial degradation of humic substances which can release n rich compounds edokpa et al 2018 this is further supported by the increased don and dcaa concentrations in summer concentrations of tn 93 200 µg n l 1 and tp 6 22 µg p l 1 were only slightly higher than tdn 77 165 µg n l 1 and tdp 2 17 µg p l 1 respectively indicating that these nutrients were strongly partitioned to their dissolved forms these nutrients were higher at the tributary site compared to regulated and downstream sites fig s6 on average the dominant form of dissolved nitrogen was don 84 5 11 6 with very low levels of inorganic nitrogens nh4 3 9 1 7 and nox 11 6 10 9 although inorganic nitrogens were present at lower concentrations our study showed that nox 1 84 µg n l 1 was significantly higher within the regulated site fig s6 while some dams act as a nox source as suggested by the results in this study others play a crucial role in retention of nutrients including nox and po4 3 kelly 2001 maavara et al 2015 nox showed strong seasonal variation at the regulated site with lowest concentrations in summer especially early summer the lowest nox concentrations could have occurred due to algal uptake during the productive season sprague 2002 even though concentrations of po4 3 2 17 µg p l 1 were very low across all sites significantly lower concentrations within the regulated reaches likely resulted from absorption of phosphorus within the reservoir sediment maavara et al 2015 overall tributary inflows could not restore nutrient concentrations within the regulated system during base flow conditions both doc and nutrient concentrations increased significantly within the tributary and downstream sites during storm events fig 4b fig s7 s8 doc concentration within the tributary was 2 1 mg c l 1 before the event then doc increased in the rising limb and reached 10 8 mg c l 1 after peak discharge fig s9 a similar trend was observed at the downstream site 1 7 9 3 mg c l 1 but a time lag occurred in flow and in the resultant increase in doc concentration in contrast there was no change in flow or doc concentration at the regulated site discharge has also been previously shown to increase doc concentrations in other australian rivers burford et al 2012 rohlfs et al 2015 westhorpe and mitrovic 2012 and demonstrates a shift in doc pool sources and hydrological pathways with increase transport from the terrestrial environment fellman et al 2009b inamdar et al 2011 the elevated concentrations of tn 2 times tdn and tp 3 times tdp at the tributary site suggests higher transport of particulate materials during storm events keeping in mind that these catchment responses are likely influenced by post fire runoff effects with enhanced transport of carbon and nutrient from burned soil surfaces johnston and maher 2022 uzun et al 2020 the decreased proportion of n dcaa during storm events fig 5b also support post fire runoff effect which increases transport of heteroaromatics compounds uzun et al 2020 there was very little change in water chemistry at the regulated site during storm events apart from a transient increase in nh4 concentrations during event 3 given that the discharge at regulated site decreased over the storm periods any changes in water chemistry are probably due to instream processes rather than runoff effects significantly higher concentrations of doc dcaa tp and tdp all p 0 01 at the downstream site compared to the regulated site during storm events fig 4b fig 5b fig s8 indicates the influence of tributary inflows into a regulated system the study conducted by rohlfs et al 2015 in the regulated snowy river also reported distinct doc pulses below the tributary confluence during tributary releases 3 5 dom characterisation 3 5 1 dom characterisation by absorbance and florescence spectroscopy five major components c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 were identified via parafac analysis fig s10 all components were compared in the openfluor database with tucker s congruence coefficient of 0 90 or greater peak locations description and number of models matched in openfluor database against each component are shown in table s4 excitation and emission characteristics of c1 is similar to terrestrially derived humic like dom originating from soil and or forested environments fellman et al 2009a c2 is also terrestrially derived dom but has characteristics similar to fulvic acid fellman et al 2009a both c1 27 8 and c2 34 8 were the most dominant components in the tumut goobarragandra catchment and generally higher within the tributary fig s11 c3 matches the spectral characteristics of microbial humic like dom and represents the labile fraction produced from microbial degradation of om borisover et al 2011 c4 and c5 have been characterised as protein like dom c4 tyrosine like c5 tryptophan like yamashita and tanoue 2004 which may have originated either from the presence of proteinaceous materials yamashita and tanoue 2004 or from the phenolic compounds including tannins and lignins maie et al 2007 moreover zhuang et al 2021 categorised c5 component as benzoic like acid which is highly bioavailable and found in plant leachate suva254 ranged between 1 0 6 6 l mg 1 m 1 across the study sites and generally observed higher within the tributary site fig s12 the range of suva254 reported in this study is comparable to previous studies chen et al 2019 holland et al 2018 sr and e2 e3 ranged between 0 7 3 0 and 3 2 8 3 respectively and showed the opposite trend to the suva254 higher suva254 and lower sr and e2 e3 values within the tributary suggest presence of aromatic high molecular weight dom de haan and de boer 1987 helms et al 2008 weishaar et al 2003 fi ranged between 1 3 1 7 suggesting the mixture of terrestrial and microbial dom cory and mcknight 2005 hix ranged between 0 2 0 9 and bix ranged between 0 5 0 9 and showed opposite trends to each other fig s12 higher hix and lower bix values within the tributary reflects strongly humified dom with lower proportion of freshly produced autochthonous om huguet et al 2009 ohno 2002 3 5 2 dom characterisation by lc ocd ond characterisation of dom by lc ocd ond comprised six different fractions bp hs bb lmwn lmwa and hoc lc ocd ond also revealed that hs 56 7 was the most dominant fraction and observed higher within the tributary fig s13 significant positive correlation of hs with suva254 and negative correlations with sr and fi suggest that hs consists of terrestrially derived aromatic high molecular weight compounds table s5 bp was the least abundant fraction accounting 5 across all sites higher abundances of bb 14 3 and lmwn 8 3 were observed at the regulated and downstream sites and positive correlations of these molecules with sr and bix reflects that they are recently produced low molecular weight compounds hoc 17 8 were generally similar across all sites slightly higher at regulated and downstream sites whereas lmwa were only observed during storm pulses at the tributary and downstream sites in extremely low proportions 1 3 5 3 dissolved combined amino acids dcaa composition in total sixteen aas were identified fig 6 a where glycine threonine serine glx glutamine and glutamic acid asx asparagine and aspartic acid and alanine were the major constituents contributing up to 59 of dcaa these aas have been reported as the dominant components of dcaa in previous studies duan and bianchi 2007 silvester et al 2021 cystine and histidine were the least abundant aas each accounting 1 at all sites 3 5 4 spatio temporal variation of overall dom composition dom composition showed spatial and temporal variations under base flow conditions with a significant interaction between sampling sites and seasons pseudo f 2 16 p 0 004 the tributary contained more humified terrestrial dom of high molecular weight lower sr and e2 e3 higher mn and aromaticity high suva254 consisting of hs humic like c1 and fulvic like c2 components fig 3d fig s11 14 the regulated and downstream sites contained more autochthonous higher fi recently produced higher bix low molecular weight dom higher sr and e2 e3 lower mn with higher amounts of bb lmwn and protein like c4 component these differences in dom composition between the regulated and tributary sites are likely derived from longer water residence time sedimentation of om increased microbial processing and production along with photodegradation of dom within the reservoir differences in dom composition have been reported previously in hydrologically modified river systems mash et al 2004 spencer et al 2012 ulseth and hall 2015 however none of the previous studies combine spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography techniques for in depth characterisation of dom both carbon and nitrogen together with exploring the role of tributary inflows in restoring dom quality and quantity within the regulated systems dcaa composition also differed between sites during base flow conditions pseudo f 2 25 p 0 01 with higher abundance of isoleucine leucine proline threonine and valine at the tributary fig 6b fig s15 these aa are rich in leaf litter harris et al 2016 ylla et al 2011 thus their higher proportion within the tributary is attributed to mobilisation from decomposed leaf materials in contrast aas such as alanine glycine and lysine were higher at the regulated site the higher proportion of glycine at the regulated site reflect its resistance during decomposition together with its minor food value to micro and macroconsumers dauwe and middelburg 1998 with the beginning of summer proportions of microbial humic like c3 component increased fig s11 the increased proportion of this c3 component especially at the tributary site suggests higher autochthonous productivity due to favourable summer temperatures this is further supported by an increased percentage of lmwn and aas in summer fig s13 s15 s16 as microbes are able to breakdown hs into smaller labile molecules e g bb and lmwn either through microbial pathways or photodegradation holland et al 2019 relatively increased proportions of these molecules likely reflect the higher level of microbial activities in summer additionally increased proportion of tyrosine phenylalanine and histidine within the tributary in early summer indicate generation of fresh labile om due to autochthonous activities cowie and hedges 1992 increased proportions of hoc in early autumn fig s13 are likely attributed from extra polymeric substances derived from algal and bacterial activities lichner et al 2013 here correlation of hoc with bix r 0 4 p 0 001 further suggests that hoc reflects recently derived autochthonous material as the tributary discharge increased in response to rainfall events increasing qt qr ratio a tributary effect was strongly visible resulting in significant variations in dom composition between the regulated and downstream sites table s6 in general high flow events can affect the overall composition of dom due to mobilisation of different dom rich terrestrial sources that are not available under base flow conditions chen et al 2019 inamdar et al 2011 our results showed that dom becomes more terrestrially derived i e higher hs aromaticity and molecular weight within the tributary and downstream sites during events fig s17 18 this change in dom composition can be explained by transport of organic material from upstream forested areas the decreased of n hs fig 5b presence of lmwa and increased of several aas linked to leaf degradation fig s19 20 aryal et al 2016 duan and bianchi 2007 further supports mobilisation of terrestrial degraded organic material from the catchment during storm events these results are consistent with other studies conducted in the forested catchments chen et al 2019 inamdar et al 2011 we further recorded increased proportions of fulvic like c2 component and microbial humic like c3 component at the tributary site during the first event shortly after fire in the upper catchments fig s21 as mentioned earlier due to the unexpected fire half way through this study results likely reflect a mixture of storm and fire effects during high flow events this result is consistent with that reported by uzun et al 2020 and suggests the release of significantly higher fulvic like and microbial like components from fire and or post fire biological activities overall the shift in dom composition within the tributary significantly altered dom composition within the downstream site during high flow events altering its water chemistry to be more representative of the tributary than the regulated site 3 6 environmental significance artificial dams reservoirs in the tumut river have considerably modified natural flow regimes compared to the unregulated goobarragandra river fig 2 this modification has significantly altered thermal regimes and water chemistry including transport of carbon and nutrient below the reservoir fig 3 doc and nutrient concentrations were higher in the tributary and dom composed of terrestrially derived high molecular weight aromatic components such as hs indicating that dom within the tributary is mainly controlled by upstream catchment processes and inputs in contrast the regulated system was dominated by newly produced autochthonous low molecular weight dom the tributary could not restore water chemistry at the downstream site during base flow conditions due to extremely low qt qr ratio however under high flow storm conditions increasing qt qr ratio doc and nutrient concentrations and composition altered significantly at the downstream site and closely resembled the tributary site compared to the regulated site as such tributary inflows re connect regulated downstream reaches with catchment characteristics and processes during high flow events input of limiting nutrient such as p e g dop po4 3 from tributary can increase the primary productivity of nutrient poor regulated systems the mixing of terrestrial carbon from tributary and autochthonous carbon from reservoir can broaden the resource base for downstream communities allowing more diverse trophic pathways sabo et al 2018 and partially restoring the broken continuum in regulated rivers additionally fresh supply of labile organic molecules as indicated by aa and lmwa in this study can support bacterial carbon demand berggren et al 2010 dietary needs dwyer et al 2018 and decomposition of recalcitrant dom that is otherwise unavailable guenet et al 2010 to our knowledge this is the first study to show that tributaries can restore dom and nutrient dynamics within regulated systems during storm events and this has important implications for restoring productivity and overall ecosystem function within downstream reaches of regulated systems 4 conclusions this study provides comprehensive insights into water chemistry and dom characteristics within a regulated and unregulated river system under different flow conditions dams in the tumut river modified natural flow regimes with a ramification for downstream water chemistry in line with the serial discontinuity concept the regulated tumut river possessed lower dom concentrations doc don dop dcaa and was dominated by autochthonous dom of a lower molecular weight in contrast the unregulated tributary contained higher dom concentrations with aromatic high molecular weight dom of terrestrial origin extremely low qt qr ratios within this system contributed to the lack of a tributary effect under base flow conditions however during storm events high flow pulses within the tributary substantially increased doc dcaa tp and tdp concentrations and altered dom composition with fresh supply of large and small terrestrial organic molecules at the downstream site thus tributaries can temporarily dampen the impact of dams and restore nutrient and dom quality as well as quantity during high flow storm events therefore judicial planning and protection of tributaries and natural flow regimes within regulated systems should be prioritized for maintaining and improving integrity of downstream ecosystems
