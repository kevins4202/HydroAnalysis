14915,enriching and detecting the trace pollutants in actual matrices are critical to evaluating the water quality herein a novel nanofibrous membrane named pan sio2 tppa was prepared by in situ growing β ketoenamine linked covalent organic frameworks cof tppa on the aminated polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers and adopted for enriching the trace polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in various natural water body river lake and sea water through the solid phase micro extraction spme process the resulted nanofibrous membrane owned abundant functional groups nh oh and aromatic groups outstandingly thermal and chemical stability and excellent ability in extracting pcbs congeners based on the spme process the pcbs congeners could be quantitatively analyzed by the traditional gas chromatography gc method with the satisfactory linear relationship r2 0 99 low detection limit lods 0 1 5 ng l 1 high enrichment factors efs 2714 3949 and multiple recycling 150 runs meanwhile when pan sio2 tppa was adopted in the real water samples the low matrix effects on the enrichment of pcbs at both 5 and 50 ng l 1 over pan sio2 tppa membrane firmly revealed the feasibility of enriching the trace pcbs in real water besides the related mechanism of extracting pcbs on pan sio2 tppa mainly involved the synergistic effect of hydrophobic effect π π stacking and hydrogen bonding graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanofibrous membrane covalent organic frameworks enrichment trace pollutants solid phase micro extraction data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as one of the man made chlorinated organic compounds xie et al 2021 and the polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs have been widely used as plasticizers flame retardants insecticide extenders in various fields tian et al 2022 meanwhile the used pcbs also entered the natural environment along with the wastes and numerous investigations have confirmed that exposure to pcbs can cause serious diseases ye et al 2020 wang et al 2021a currently pcbs were recognized as the banned persistent organic pollutants pops by the stockholm convention stuart smith and jepson 2017 due to their extremely good stability and hydrophobicity the degradation or mineralization of pcbs under natural conditions is usually ignored šrédlová and cajthaml 2021 and the concentrations of pcbs in the real water were rather low ppb or ppt level even though the trace pcbs in the environment can still be enriched in organisms donets et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 and human tissues alsefri et al 2021 kofoed and sørig 2021 through the food chain causing some potential environmental and human health issues therefore monitoring the trace pcbs in natural water is essential to assess the water quality and predict the potential risk to humans as an efficient simple and cheap technology the solid phase micro extraction spme coupled with gas chromatography gc liquid chromatography lc has been proved to detect various micro organic pollutants in water such as polycyclic promatic hydrocarbons pahs beiranvand and ghiasvand 2020 perfluorinated and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass yuqian jia 2021 organochlorine pesticides ocps gutie rrez serpa et al 2017 phenols bagheri et al 2017 and so on besides updating the gc lc equipment developing novel absorbents for extracting the micro organic pollutants is also considered the most effective way to enhance the ability of traditional gc in detecting the micropollutants nowadays plenty of materials have been reported to be able to effectively extract the micro organic pollutants from water like covalent organic frameworks cofs wang et al 2018 khataei et al 2020 metal organic frameworks mofs hu et al 2018 tian et al 2018a molecularly imprinted polymers mips bazmandegan shamili et al 2016 chen et al 2015 membrane amiri and ghaemi 2016 feng et al 2016 etc in addition owing to their simple synthesis process easy modification outstanding porosity good mechanical properties and interconnected pore structure zhang et al 2019 the membrane materials have received extensive attention in the field of micro pollutant adsorption cao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 notably the electrospun nanofibrous membrane as a functional nanofiber membrane with a 3d structure owned the advantages of both bulk materials easy to separate from water and nanomaterials high specific surface area li et al 2021a which was considered to be an adsorbent for efficiently separating the trace organic pollutants from the matrix for instance liu et al s group liu et al 2019 prepared a mussel inspired membrane adsorber with thiol ligand sh membrane adsorber and they found the sh membrane showed rather a high adsorption capacity and reusability during the removal of patulin moreover mehrani et al 2020 also designed aloin based and rosin based electrospun nanofiber membranes as natural nano adsorbents for extracting the pahs and phenoxyacetic acid herbicides caps their results showed that the membrane had a strong sensitivity to the detection of pollutants and could be easily and reliably used to analyze pahs and caps in the farm industrial sea water samples besides in our previous work lv et al 2021a liu et al 2020 the electrospun cellulose membrane modified porous β cyclodextrin and polyvinylamine pvam effectively adsorbed the trace bisphenols and phenylarsonic acid pollutants in water through the synergistic effects of hydrophobic effect hydrogen bond interaction and π π stacking interaction although the chemical modified electrospun membrane exhibited good performance in the adsorption of trace micro organic pollutants the detection limits for these pollutants were unsatisfactory because of the limited adsorption sites on the modified membrane given the large specific areas and rich functional groups porous nanoparticles like mofs and cofs displayed a promising application for the enrichment of trace organic pollutants gonzález sálamo et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 recently introducing the nanoparticles into the electrospun membrane has been confirmed a good strategy to promote the ability in adsorbing the trace organic pollutants because the introduced porous nanoparticles could greatly provide sufficient adsorption sites for the pollutants zhao et al 2021 resulting in a promotion of adsorption speed and capacity according to asiabi et al s investigation asiabi et al 2015 the methyl modified mof 5 pan nanofibers could efficiently concentrate the estrogenic drugs like levonorgestrel and megestrol acetate in urine samples through solid phase extraction spe process similarly xu et al 2022 proposed the nanofibrous pan composite by introducing the aptamer functionalized uio2 mof pan uio uio2 n3 aptamer due to the high aptamer coverage density on the surface the material exhibited excellent selectivity for extracting the trace microcystin lr mc lr good matrix resistance ability in the real water and high resolution for detection ying et al 2019 also found that molecularly imprinted nanofiber composite membrane can effectively adsorb the putrescine with excellent adsorption performance 33 16 μg cm 2 and good imprinting efficiency 2 30 in addition in our previous work ma et al 2021 we designed a polyacrylonitrile electrospun nanofiber membrane through in situ growing cofs for efficient enrichment of trace ocps the outstanding enrichment performance stability and reusability strongly verified the feasibility of pan cofs for detecting the trace ocps in natural water notably it was found that apart from the hydrophobic effects the h cl hydrogen bonds between the cl atom and h atom played an important role during the extraction of ocps on the pan cofs thus consider the presence of numerous cl atoms with strong electronegativity in the pcbs molecules we supposed that it was possible to promote the h cl hydrogen bonds though introducing a cofs with abundant h donors on the membrane thus enhanced the extraction of trace pcbs in water according to previous literature kandambeth et al 2012 wang et al 2021a the β ketoenamine linked covalent organic frameworks was regarded as an ideal h donor due to the presence of abundant oh and nh2 groups herein we fabricated a functional pan nanofiber membrane named as pan sio2 tppa by introducing a β ketoenamine linked covalent organic frameworks cof tppa for the enrichment of trace pcbs in the spme process the microstructure and physicochemical properties of pan sio2 tppa were well characterized and the enrichment performance on trace pcbs in actual water were systematically evaluated furthermore the enrichment mechanism of o pcbs over pan sio2 tppa were deeply investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals used in this work were analytically pure polyacrylonitrile pan 150 000 da was purchased from shanghai macklin

shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd additional 1 3 5 triformylphoroglucinol tp was purchased from zhengzhou acme chemical co ltd the reagents used for enrichment experiments include chromatographically pure n hexane and premium grade sodium chloride nacl shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs standard solution 10 mg l 1 j k chemical ltd six pcbs congeners were pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 101 pcb 138 pcb 153 and pcb 180 whose specific physical and chemical information was provided in table s1 the ultra pure water used was treated by the milli q integral 5 purification system merck millipore usa all the chemicals and reagents were employed without further purification 2 1 2 preparation of standard working solutions and real samples the working solution of pcbs 6 congeners was obtained through the dilution of the pcbs standard solution 10 mg l 1 firstly the pcbs standard solution was gradually diluted with n hexane to obtain the low concentration pcbs stock solution after that the final working solution with the desired concentration was obtained by adding stoichiometric pcbs stock solution the actual water samples used in the extraction experiment were river water lake water and sea water which came from the min river in the fuzhou basin qishan lake in the minhou region fuzhou china and the taiwan strait near jinjiang respectively these natural water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass filters for experimental use three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy fig s1 revealed that many dissolved organic matters dom presented in the real environmental water samples 2 2 fabrication of tppa modified pan sio2 electrospun nanofiber membrane pan sio2 tppa 2 2 1 preparation of aminated pan sio2 electrospun nanofiber membrane 1 20 g of polyacrylonitrile powder and 0 24 g of sio2 nano powder 7 40 nm was added to a 25 ml single necked flask then 12 ml of dmf solution was poured into the flask the mixture was magnetically stirred overnight at 60 c to obtain a homogeneous spinning solution after that the pan sio2 electrospun nanofiber membrane was prepared through the electrostatic spinning machine et 2535h ucalery china based on the parameters reported in our previous work ma et al 2021 the main parameters included a positive voltage of 13 kv and a negative voltage of 5 kv after spinning the aluminum foil paper covered with the pan sio2 nanofibers was removed from the roller and dried overnight at 60 c to ensure the thermal stability of the membrane during the subsequent application the nanofiber membrane was peeled from the aluminum foil paper and calcined in the tube furnace at 250 c under a nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h 0 50 g of heat treated pan sio2 nanocomposite and 0 50 ml of kh 550 was added to the flask containing 20 ml of ethanol and then the mixture was condensed and refluxed under magnetic stirring at 78 c for 6 h after washing and drying the aminated pan sio2 nanofiber membrane was synthesized 2 2 2 preparation of cof tppa modified pan sio2 pan sio2 tppa nanofiber membrane aminated pan sio2 nanofiber 4 10 cm 0 0850 g and tp 0 0315 g were firstly mixed into a 20 ml ethanol and the mixed solution was stirred for 30 min subsequently pa 0 0243 g was dissolved in the solution and the mixture was stirred at 25 c for 6 h finally the orange pan sio2 tppa nanofiber membrane was obtained after washing three times with acetone and tetrahydrofuran respectively and drying at 60 c for 2 h as a control tppa linked by β ketoenamine bond tppa was synthesized through reversible aldimine reaction and a rapid irreversible enol to keto tautomerization between tp and pa a molar ratio of 2 3 under room temperature based on the previous report wang et al 2021a 2 3 preparation of the solid phase micro extraction spme fiber the solid phase micro extraction spme fiber was obtained by coating the pan sio2 tppa nanofiber membrane on a stainless steel wire and the detailed procedure can been in our previous work ma et al 2021 firstly one end of the stainless steel wire 20 cm length 0 3 mm diameter was soaked in aqua regia for about 5 min followingly rinsed with acetone and ultra pure water several times then the corroded end was dipped into the resin glue and rotated gently to make the glue form a thin layer on the surface after that a piece of pan sio2 tppa membrane was stuck on the stainless steel wire to attain the required thickness finally the pan sio2 tppa coated stainless steel wire was installed into the injection needle to assemble the spme device meanwhile pan sio2 coated spme fiber was also prepared in the same way for the control before extraction it was necessary to calcine for 4 h under an n2 atmosphere at 250 c to quickly age the obtained spme fiber 2 4 enrichment experiment for pcbs 2 4 1 enrichment procedure the enrichment and analysis procedures were shown in fig s2 the enrichment experiments were performed in a 25 ml headspace bottle containing 20 ml of pcbs water solution the micro injection needle containing the spme fiber was inserted into the rubber stopper of the headspace bottle and then the fiber was pushed out to make the extraction coating deep under the solution surface subsequently the extraction was carried out at 30 c for 30 min after the extraction under the designed condition the fiber was pulled out of the headspace bottle and immediately inserted into the gc inlet for thermal desorption and the desorption process lasted 5 min in this work the main parameters like the ionic strength 0 20 w v time 10 60 min temperature 30 70 c and ph 2 10 during the enrichment experiments were optimized with 0 0001 mg l 1 of initial pcbs concentration 2 4 2 gas chromatograph conditions the desorbed pcbs from the spme fiber were analyzed by the gas chromatograph 7890 a agilent company usa equipped with an ecd detector and an hp 5 column 30 m 320 μm 0 25 μm the temperature of the injection port was 250 c and the carrier gas high purity nitrogen flow rate was 1 2 ml min 1 when the standard was injected the volume was 1 μl with splitless the detector temperature was 320 c additionally the temperature program of the pcbs analysis was as follows the temperature was initially set 120 c and firstly rose to 250 c at 6 c min 1 and then up to 270 c with a rate of 5 c min 1 and finally kept at 270 c for 2 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pan sio2 tppa and pan sio2 tppa fig 1 showed the surface morphology of pan sio2 heat treated pan sio2 aminated pan sio2 tppa and pan sio2 tppa the pristine pan sio2 electrospinning membrane fig 1 a c displayed a macroscopic block based material consisting of numerous uniform network fibers 200 nm of diameter while the sio2 nanoparticles distributed along the nanofibers fig s3 after heated at 250 c for 3 h the pan sio2 nanofiber membrane turned from white to yellow which was attributed to the partial carbonization but the nanofibers did not change at all fig 1 d f meanwhile no evident changes were observed in the surface morphology after the subsequent amination fig 1 g i after cof tppa growing it was clearly observed that the membrane turned orange which was close to the orange yellow tppa powder with dendritic clusters microstructure suggesting that cof tppa was successfully introduced into the membrane as demonstrated in fig 1 j l a large number of cof tppa nano clusters grew along the nanofibers besides the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds mapping images fig 1 p t clearly revealed that the c n o and si elements were uniformly distributed along the fibers moreover the cross sections of the aminated pan sio2 fig 1u w and pan sio2 tppa membrane fig 1x z were also observed to further analyze the structural variation of the membrane before the cof tppa growth the interior of the aminated pan sio2 membrane was loose with ample holes between the nanofibers and some sio2 nanoparticles were present on the surface of the nanofibers once the cof tppa grew on the nanofibers the thickness of the membrane increased from 64 8 3 3 nm to 112 5 2 7 nm table s2 meanwhile the interior of the membrane became dese and plenty of cof tppa appeared on the nanofibers notably due to the growth of cof tppa 450 m2 g 1 of bet area on the membrane the bet area average pore size and pore volume of the pan sio2 tppa changed from 33 to 108 m2 g 1 35 1 5 1 to 9 8 1 3 nm and 0 009 to 0 104 cm³ g 1 respectively fig s4 and table s2 furthermore xrd was employed to analyze the variation of a material structure during the synthesis process fig 2 a in the xrd pattern of the obtained tppa two evident peaks appeared at 2θ 7 9 and 26 7 belonging to the 200 and 001 planes of the cof tppa respectively as reported in previous literature kandambeth et al 2012 wang et al 2021b meanwhile it was worth noting that two weakened peaks also turned up at the same position in the xrd pattern of pan sio2 tppa suggesting the presence of cof tppa on the membrane in addition the intensity of the peak at 2θ 26 7 greatly weakened and broadened which may be due to the impacts of the widened band of the amorphous sio2 at 2θ 23 3 li et al 2021b the variation of the functional groups on the surface and composition of the cof tppa modified pan sio2 nanofiber membrane during the preparation process were analyzed by ft ir as depicted in the ft ir spectra of pan sio2 fig 2 b the characteristic peaks mainly included the cyano peak at 2240 cm 1 and the si o si group peaks at 1070 cm 1 and 795 cm 1 dai et al 2020 corresponding to pan and sio2 respectively after the heating treatment no changes in the ft ir spectra also indicated an inapparent impact of heating on the main groups on the membrane surface the broadband of aminated pan sio2 at 3300 cm 1 was the nh stretching vibration peak from kh 550 akhlaghi et al 2020 after the reaction between tp and pa at the membrane interface under room temperature the stretching vibration of cyano groups 2240 cm 1 and si o si groups 1070 cm 1 and 795 cm 1 on the pan sio2 tppa spectrum weakened which might be due to the coverage of cofs tppa on the surface of pan sio2 the c o stretching peak appeared at 1612 cm 1 and the c c stretching signal at 1579 cm 1 revealed the transformation from enol to keto tautomerism he et al 2017 meanwhile the absorption band of pan sio2 tppa appeared at 1252 cm 1 which also originated from the cn bond of the β ketoenamine unit of tp pa the stability was also a considerable index to evaluate the performance of the pan sio2 tppa tg analysis fig 3 a and dtg analysis data fig 3 b recorded the heat loss and the rate of pan sio2 tppa cof tppa and pan sio2 along with the temperature pan sio2 nanofiber membrane almost maintained a constant mass when the temperature increased from 30 c to 288 c and only underwent a single instant weight loss after 288 c which might be related to the pyrolysis of the cyclization of the nitrile group on pan pirzada et al 2014 the first mass loss of pan sio2 tppa and tppa occurred from 30 c to 98 c with a weight loss of about 2 which may be caused by the release of water and solvent when the temperature rose to 327 c pan sio2 tppa and tppa experienced a second mass loss which might be associated with the thermal decomposition of certain functional groups of tppa after the second stage tppa maintained their weight residue at around 92 the third stage of tppa occurred at 394 c which was ascribed to the collapse of the tppa skeleton structure li and zhang 2019 correspondingly pan sio2 tppa also lost weight rapidly at this stage meanwhile as illustrated in the dtg curves fig 3 b both tppa and pan sio2 tppa showed the first weight loss peak at 66 c while their second weight loss peaks appeared at 335 c and 361 c respectively the last mass loss peak of tppa appears at 469 c based on the above thermal analysis results it could be inferred that pan sio2 tppa had excellent thermal stability and was suitable for high temperature thermal desorption at the gc inlet at 250 c after treated with water organic solvents acetone methanol thf alkaline naoh buffer and acidic solution hcl buffer there was no significant change in the ft ir spectra of pan sio2 tppa fig 3 c when compared to the fresh pan sio2 tppa it was worth noting that pan sio2 tppa was a little unstable in the strong alkaline ph 11 solution because the silica in the nanofiber would react with alkali 3 2 enrichment performance of pan sio2 tppa on pcbs 3 2 1 comparison of enrichment capacity between pan sio2 and pan sio2 tppa the chromatogram fig 4 a revealed that both pan sio2 tppa and pan sio2 nanofiber membranes exhibited the ability to extract 6 pcbs congeners 0 0001 mg l 1 from water while the signal intensities of the pcbs congeners in the pan sio2 tppa group were 2 21 3 29 times higher than those of pan sio2 membrane group fig 4 b indicating that the introduced cof tppa could greatly enhance the enrichment performance on trace pcbs 3 2 2 optimization of extraction conditions it has been reported that some factors during the spme process greatly impacted the extraction efficiency balasubramanian and panigrahi 2011 herein for the sake of acquiring the optimal conditions of the spme process the single factor optimization experiments were carried out and the main factors involved the ionic strength 0 20 w v extraction time 10 60 min temperature 30 70 c and ph 2 10 fig s5 a illustrated the effects of the salt concentration on pcbs enrichment and the results revealed an evident negative correlation was observed between the salt concentration and pcbs extraction efficiency when the ionic strength increased from 0 to 20 the peak areas of all pcbs significantly declined this might be because increasing ionic strength would result in the viscosity of the solution increasing which severely hindered the mass transfer process and resulted in a decline in the extraction efficiency wu et al 2016 besides the adsorption of the salt ions on the nanofibers might also cause the occupation of the adsorption sites leading to the decline in the extraction efficiency fig s5 b demonstrated the change of pcbs extraction peak area along the extraction time in the first 30 min of extraction the peak area gradually increased along the time when the extraction time further prolonged the peak areas of pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 101 and pcb 153 tended to a platform suggesting that the absorption of pcbs reached dynamic equilibrium in 30 min although the adsorption of pcb 138 and pcb 180 continued to proceed after 30 min the adsorption rate tended to decline thus considering the service life of the fiber coatings and working efficiency 30 min was set as the working time in the following experiments besides the extraction temperature was also a notable factor in the extraction process on the one hand the high temperature promoted the transfer and diffusion of the analyte in the matrix solution ma et al 2021 on the other hand too high temperature was not conducive to the exothermic adsorption of the analyte on the extraction coating yu et al 2021 in the temperature range of 30 c to 70 c fig s5 c the peak areas of all pcbs indicated a downward trend since the extraction of pcbs by pan sio2 tppa was an exothermic process low temperature was favorable to the progress of adsorption guo et al 2019 consequently the best extraction temperature was 30 c the ph value could also cause changes in the partition coefficient of the analytes in the fiber and liquid phase leading to variation in extraction efficiency from fig s5 d it could be seen that compared with neutral conditions the peak area of all the pcbs obviously declined under both acidic and alkaline conditions consider the situation in the real water the following experiments were done under neutral conditions 3 2 3 enrichment of trace pcbs with pan sio2 tppa membranes the main parameters for evaluating the enrichment capability for contaminants usually included the detection of limits lods s n 3 the quantification of limits loqs s n 10 and enrichment factors efs table 1 listed the obtained parameters under the optimal conditions the high regression coefficients r 0 9965 0 9993 revealed that the work curves for pcbs based on the gc were able to quantitatively analyze the trace pcbs in water even the pcbs levels were as low as 1 5 ng l 1 moreover the lods of the pan sio2 tppa for pcbs extraction were as low as 0 1 5 ng l 1 importantly the enrichment factors efs of the pan sio2 tppa for six pcb congeners maintained at 2714 3949 manifesting outstanding enrichment efficiency meanwhile the relative standard deviation rsd was adopted to evaluate the reproducibility of intra day and inter day extraction which were 0 81 8 63 and 1 71 5 08 respectively verifying the stable duplicability of the method based on pan sio2 tppa fiber the service life of the pan sio2 tppa fiber was evaluated by the reusing experiments as demonstrated in fig s6 after 150 runs the peak area of each pcb congener did not descend significantly indicating that the coating owned the fabulous stability and reusability likewise no evident variation was observed in both ft ir spectra fig s7 a and xrd pattern fig s7 b of pan sio2 tppa after recycling which also confirmed the good stability of pan sio2 tppa fiber to clearly confirm the adsorption of pcbs on the pan sio2 tppa membrane the xps data of the membrane before and after spde process were recorded as depicted in the xps spectra of the spent pan sio2 tppa membrane fig s8 the presence of cl clearly revealed the successful adsorption of pcbs on the membrane 3 3 enrichment of trace pcbs in real samples the enrichment performance in the real water was also evaluated by using three natural water samples as the background water river lake and sea water at different pcbs levels 5 and 50 ng l 1 the three dimensional fluorescence images fig s1 of the natural water samples clearly displayed higher signals than that of the ultra water revealing the presence of ample dissolved organic matters dom in the natural water samples to determine the initial pcbs levels in the natural water the pan sio2 tppa was first employed to extract the pcbs in these water samples unfortunately no pcbs signals were detected in the gc chromatogram fig 5 suggesting no pcbs in the water samples when the stoichiometric pcbs congeners were added to the natural water the significant pcbs signals in the gc chromatogram fig 5 strongly manifested that the pan sio2 tppa could efficiently extract the trace pcbs in three natural water samples even the pcbs level was as low as 5 ng l 1 meanwhile the obtained parameters based on the gc method also proved the feasibility of pan sio2 tppa for enriching the pcbs in real water as listed in table 2 when the river lake and sea water samples were spiked with 5 ng l 1 the spiked recovery was 84 49 101 32 84 38 109 25 and 72 39 97 55 respectively while the enrichment factors were 3387 5964 3603 6362 and 3186 5611 separately similarly when 50 ng l 1 of pcbs was spiked it also showed a reasonable recovery with 85 69 119 66 of river samples and 109 11 126 11 of lake samples 88 57 119 27 of sea samples and decent enrichment factors with 2602 3551 2994 4524 2723 3910 furthermore considering the presence of dom in the real water it was necessary to evaluate the matrix effects of the dom in the real water on the extraction performance the matrix effect me was defined as the ratio of the pcbs peak areas in the real water and the standard solvent me peak area matrix standard peak area solvent standard 1 100 in addition the matrix effects mainly involved three levels low 20 to 20 medium 20 50 and 20 to 50 and high 50 or 50 ekins daukes et al 2018 as depicted in fig 6 it could be observed that when the spiked concentration of pcbs was 5 ng l 1 both river water and lake water manifested low matrix effects which were 11 83 0 90 and 10 58 6 23 respectively however for seawater most pcbs exhibited a weak matrix inhibitory effect at 5 ng l 1 and the matrix effect ranged from 22 71 to 0 27 besides the matrix effect of pcb 101 was 22 71 indicating the medium matrix effect when the spiked concentration was 50 ng l 1 the matrix effect of river water fig 6 a was between 13 08 and 18 80 which confirmed the weak matrix effect for lake water fig 6 b all six pcbs exhibited a matrix enhancement effect which was 8 74 24 88 in the sea water matrix fig 6 c except pcb 28 exhibiting a moderate matrix effect 24 18 the other pcbs belonged to a weak matrix effect with a range of 10 97 12 22 the above results marked that the method was not greatly interfered with by the natural water matrix thus pan sio2 tppa fiber could be employed to extract pcbs in the actual environment therefore the prepared pan sio2 tppa coating had the fantastic potential for enrichment and determination of pcbs in actual environmental water samples to well understand the advantages of pan sio2 tppa membrane the reported materials for extracting pcbs were listed in table s3 for the comparison compared with other analytical methods table s3 the method based on pan sio2 tppa membrane exhibited higher enrichment factor lower detection limit and shorter extraction time than those of most materials except tfpb bd considering the simple operation outstanding enrichment performance in the real water samples good reusability easy recycling and no secondary pollution our material was still a competitive alternative for extracting and detecting the trace pcbs in the environmental water 3 4 plausible adsorption mechanism 3 4 1 hydrophobic effects as one of the most important interactions the hydrophobic effects between the organic pollutants and materials usually played an important role during the adsorption of the hydrophobic organic pollutants to analyze the hydrophobic properties of the absorbents the static contact angles of the original pan sio2 nanofibers heat treated pan sio2 membrane tppa powder and the pan sio2 tppa were tested as revealed in fig 7 a the pristine pan sio2 nanofiber membrane 45 9 was partially hydrophilic however after heated at 250 c the high contact angle 122 7 revealed the strong hydrophobicity of the membrane base indicating the heating treatment significantly enhanced the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface which was attributed into the partial carbonization on the membrane surface sun et al 2016 meanwhile the raman spectra were recorded to confirm the carbonization fig 7 b compared with the pristine pan sio2 membrane the higher d band 1370 cm 1 related to the defects or distortions in the graphite lattice structure of disordered sp3 hybrid carbon and g band 1611 cm 1 linked to highly ordered pyrolytic graphite peaks clearly confirmed the surface graphitization of the pan sio2 membrane bao et al 2021 in addition in the xps spectra fig 7 c d after heating the higher c c c c percentage 57 51 in c1s spectra also verified the carbonization nevertheless when the cof tppa was introduced on the nanofibers the contact angle sharply descended from 122 7 to 16 8 suggesting strongly hydrophilic surface of pan sio2 tppa membrane due to the presence of ample hydrophilic groups like carbonyl and secondary amine groups on the surface the cof tppa displayed strong hydrophilicity which also resulted in a sharp decline in the static contact angle fig 7 a based on these results it could be concluded that pan sio2 tppa membrane was an amphiphilic material with the hydrophilic end cof tppa and hydrophobic base heat treated pan sio2 according to table s1 the octanol water partition coefficients log kow of six pcbs ranged from 5 31 to 7 16 implying the target analytes were relatively hydrophobic according to our previous results ma et al 2022 the hydrophobic membrane tended to adsorb the hydrophobic analytes through the hydrophobic effects thus it can be inferred that the hydrophobic effects probably occurred between the heat treated pan sio2 membrane base and pcbs molecule meanwhile the enrichment experiments fig s7 clearly showed that the pcbs enrichment factors for the heat treated pan sio2 membrane were 1 5 2 3 folders larger than those of the pristine membrane suggesting that the hydrophobic effect played an important role in pcbs extraction over the pan sio2 tppa membrane 3 4 2 π π stacking interaction based on the findings of hunter and sanders hunter and sanders 1990 the π π stacking interaction widely existed between the aromatic groups given the presence of an abundant aromatic nucleus in both tppa and pcbs it was inferred that the pan sio2 tppa could easily absorb pcbs through π π stacking interaction owing to the fact that a large number of aromatic rings were present in both the cofs tppa and pcbs molecules pan sio2 tppa membrane could easily adsorb pcbs via π π stacking interaction between the aromatic rings as demonstrated in c1s xps spectrum of pan sio2 tppa membrane fig 8 a there were five main functional groups including c c c c at 284 80 ev c n at 286 13 ev c n at 287 64 ev and the c o at 289 17 ev and the π π group at 291 90 ev tian et al 2018b after pcbs enrichment fig 8 b the proportion of c c c c increased slightly from 45 15 to 46 14 while the π π groups dropped from 3 38 to 2 29 which manifested that the interaction between π π groups was involved in the enrichment of pcbs 3 4 3 hydrogen bonding apart from π π stacking hydrogen bonding is also a crucial adsorption mechanism during the adsorption of organic pollutants as depicted in fig 8 b after pcbs enrichment the c cl characteristic peak at 286 23 ev appeared on the c1s xps spectrum confirming the adsorption of pcbs on the membrane as an element with strong electronegativity the cl atom usually acted as a good proton acceptor and easily captured the hydrogen atom from other groups feng et al 2006 wang and englert 2017 considering sufficient h donors nh nh2 and oh groups in the pan sio2 tppa the cl atom in pcbs tended to migrate to the pan sio2 tppa and formed abundant hydrogen bonds like o h cl and n h cl between pan sio2 tppa and pcbs moreover as shown in the n1s spectra of pan sio2 tppa fig 8 c there were four main functional n species including c n 398 5 ev dementjev et al 2000 nh2 n h 399 5 ev lv et al 2021b n h x 400 2 ev liu et al 2020 and graphitic n 402 2 ev ayiania et al 2020 after pcbs enrichment fig 8 d the proportion of nh2 n h groups decreased from 17 34 to 14 70 while the proportion of n h x increased from 2 19 to 11 13 suggesting that the nh2 nh groups participated in the formation of hydrogen bonds during the adsorption of pcbs on pan sio2 tppa similarly during the adsorption of halogenated organic matters in previous work wang and englert 2017 scholfield et al 2013 the o n h x f cl br hydrogen bonds have been proved to play a rather important role 3 4 4 synergistic mechanism of pan sio2 tppa adsorption of pcbs based on the above results there were three interactions hydrophobic effect π π interaction and hydrogen bonding during the enrichment of pcbs on the pan sio2 tppa nanofibrous membrane as described in the characterization results fig 7 the resulting cof tppa on the pan sio2 tppa membrane is composed of the hydrophilic end cof tppa and hydrophobic base heat treated pan sio2 during the adsorption of pcbs due to the strong hydrophilic surface the pan sio2 tppa membrane could be easily mixed with the water molecule and then the pcbs molecule could quickly enter the pores of the membrane along the water once the pcbs contacted the cof tppa the pcbs molecule tended to migrate into the surface of the membrane through the h cl hydrogen bonds between the cl and h donors nh nh2 and oh groups meanwhile due to the strong attraction between the π electron clouds among the aromatic rings the pcbs molecule also could be adsorbed on the membrane besides the high log kow values of the pcbs congeners table s1 revealed the strong hydrophobicity according to the principle of similar compatibility the hydrophobic pcbs molecules tended to migrate to the hydrophobic heat treated pan sio2 base resulting in the adsorption of pcbs which has been confirmed in fig s9 as reported in previous studies lv et al 2021a schmid 2001 the strong hydrophobic effects could greatly reduce the steric hindrance between the adsorbent and the adsorbate and then promoted the π π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding which greatly improved the adsorption of organic pollutants on the materials in summary the extraction mechanism of pcbs on pan sio2 tppa mainly involved the synergistic effects of the hydrophobic effect π π stacking and hydrogen bonding the hydrophilic tppa on the nanofiber membrane helped the pcbs molecules enter the pores of the membrane then the strong hydrophobic effects between pcbs and pan sio2 tppa membrane base would lower the steric hindrance resulting in an improvement in the π π stacking and hydrogen bonding which greatly enhanced the enrichment of pcbs on the membrane 4 conclusions in this work a novel pan sio2 nanofiber membrane coupled with cofs tppa pan sio2 tppa was designed for the extraction of trace pcbs in water the pan sio2 tppa owned abundant functional groups and exhibited excellent stability fabulous enrichment efficiency efs 2602 and good reusability 150 runs during the enrichment of trace pcbs as low as 5 ng l 1 in various real water samples the main enrichment mechanisms of the pan sio2 tppa on pcbs included the hydrophobic effects π π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding our finding provided a new

14915,enriching and detecting the trace pollutants in actual matrices are critical to evaluating the water quality herein a novel nanofibrous membrane named pan sio2 tppa was prepared by in situ growing β ketoenamine linked covalent organic frameworks cof tppa on the aminated polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers and adopted for enriching the trace polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in various natural water body river lake and sea water through the solid phase micro extraction spme process the resulted nanofibrous membrane owned abundant functional groups nh oh and aromatic groups outstandingly thermal and chemical stability and excellent ability in extracting pcbs congeners based on the spme process the pcbs congeners could be quantitatively analyzed by the traditional gas chromatography gc method with the satisfactory linear relationship r2 0 99 low detection limit lods 0 1 5 ng l 1 high enrichment factors efs 2714 3949 and multiple recycling 150 runs meanwhile when pan sio2 tppa was adopted in the real water samples the low matrix effects on the enrichment of pcbs at both 5 and 50 ng l 1 over pan sio2 tppa membrane firmly revealed the feasibility of enriching the trace pcbs in real water besides the related mechanism of extracting pcbs on pan sio2 tppa mainly involved the synergistic effect of hydrophobic effect π π stacking and hydrogen bonding graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanofibrous membrane covalent organic frameworks enrichment trace pollutants solid phase micro extraction data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as one of the man made chlorinated organic compounds xie et al 2021 and the polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs have been widely used as plasticizers flame retardants insecticide extenders in various fields tian et al 2022 meanwhile the used pcbs also entered the natural environment along with the wastes and numerous investigations have confirmed that exposure to pcbs can cause serious diseases ye et al 2020 wang et al 2021a currently pcbs were recognized as the banned persistent organic pollutants pops by the stockholm convention stuart smith and jepson 2017 due to their extremely good stability and hydrophobicity the degradation or mineralization of pcbs under natural conditions is usually ignored šrédlová and cajthaml 2021 and the concentrations of pcbs in the real water were rather low ppb or ppt level even though the trace pcbs in the environment can still be enriched in organisms donets et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 and human tissues alsefri et al 2021 kofoed and sørig 2021 through the food chain causing some potential environmental and human health issues therefore monitoring the trace pcbs in natural water is essential to assess the water quality and predict the potential risk to humans as an efficient simple and cheap technology the solid phase micro extraction spme coupled with gas chromatography gc liquid chromatography lc has been proved to detect various micro organic pollutants in water such as polycyclic promatic hydrocarbons pahs beiranvand and ghiasvand 2020 perfluorinated and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass yuqian jia 2021 organochlorine pesticides ocps gutie rrez serpa et al 2017 phenols bagheri et al 2017 and so on besides updating the gc lc equipment developing novel absorbents for extracting the micro organic pollutants is also considered the most effective way to enhance the ability of traditional gc in detecting the micropollutants nowadays plenty of materials have been reported to be able to effectively extract the micro organic pollutants from water like covalent organic frameworks cofs wang et al 2018 khataei et al 2020 metal organic frameworks mofs hu et al 2018 tian et al 2018a molecularly imprinted polymers mips bazmandegan shamili et al 2016 chen et al 2015 membrane amiri and ghaemi 2016 feng et al 2016 etc in addition owing to their simple synthesis process easy modification outstanding porosity good mechanical properties and interconnected pore structure zhang et al 2019 the membrane materials have received extensive attention in the field of micro pollutant adsorption cao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 notably the electrospun nanofibrous membrane as a functional nanofiber membrane with a 3d structure owned the advantages of both bulk materials easy to separate from water and nanomaterials high specific surface area li et al 2021a which was considered to be an adsorbent for efficiently separating the trace organic pollutants from the matrix for instance liu et al s group liu et al 2019 prepared a mussel inspired membrane adsorber with thiol ligand sh membrane adsorber and they found the sh membrane showed rather a high adsorption capacity and reusability during the removal of patulin moreover mehrani et al 2020 also designed aloin based and rosin based electrospun nanofiber membranes as natural nano adsorbents for extracting the pahs and phenoxyacetic acid herbicides caps their results showed that the membrane had a strong sensitivity to the detection of pollutants and could be easily and reliably used to analyze pahs and caps in the farm industrial sea water samples besides in our previous work lv et al 2021a liu et al 2020 the electrospun cellulose membrane modified porous β cyclodextrin and polyvinylamine pvam effectively adsorbed the trace bisphenols and phenylarsonic acid pollutants in water through the synergistic effects of hydrophobic effect hydrogen bond interaction and π π stacking interaction although the chemical modified electrospun membrane exhibited good performance in the adsorption of trace micro organic pollutants the detection limits for these pollutants were unsatisfactory because of the limited adsorption sites on the modified membrane given the large specific areas and rich functional groups porous nanoparticles like mofs and cofs displayed a promising application for the enrichment of trace organic pollutants gonzález sálamo et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 recently introducing the nanoparticles into the electrospun membrane has been confirmed a good strategy to promote the ability in adsorbing the trace organic pollutants because the introduced porous nanoparticles could greatly provide sufficient adsorption sites for the pollutants zhao et al 2021 resulting in a promotion of adsorption speed and capacity according to asiabi et al s investigation asiabi et al 2015 the methyl modified mof 5 pan nanofibers could efficiently concentrate the estrogenic drugs like levonorgestrel and megestrol acetate in urine samples through solid phase extraction spe process similarly xu et al 2022 proposed the nanofibrous pan composite by introducing the aptamer functionalized uio2 mof pan uio uio2 n3 aptamer due to the high aptamer coverage density on the surface the material exhibited excellent selectivity for extracting the trace microcystin lr mc lr good matrix resistance ability in the real water and high resolution for detection ying et al 2019 also found that molecularly imprinted nanofiber composite membrane can effectively adsorb the putrescine with excellent adsorption performance 33 16 μg cm 2 and good imprinting efficiency 2 30 in addition in our previous work ma et al 2021 we designed a polyacrylonitrile electrospun nanofiber membrane through in situ growing cofs for efficient enrichment of trace ocps the outstanding enrichment performance stability and reusability strongly verified the feasibility of pan cofs for detecting the trace ocps in natural water notably it was found that apart from the hydrophobic effects the h cl hydrogen bonds between the cl atom and h atom played an important role during the extraction of ocps on the pan cofs thus consider the presence of numerous cl atoms with strong electronegativity in the pcbs molecules we supposed that it was possible to promote the h cl hydrogen bonds though introducing a cofs with abundant h donors on the membrane thus enhanced the extraction of trace pcbs in water according to previous literature kandambeth et al 2012 wang et al 2021a the β ketoenamine linked covalent organic frameworks was regarded as an ideal h donor due to the presence of abundant oh and nh2 groups herein we fabricated a functional pan nanofiber membrane named as pan sio2 tppa by introducing a β ketoenamine linked covalent organic frameworks cof tppa for the enrichment of trace pcbs in the spme process the microstructure and physicochemical properties of pan sio2 tppa were well characterized and the enrichment performance on trace pcbs in actual water were systematically evaluated furthermore the enrichment mechanism of o pcbs over pan sio2 tppa were deeply investigated

shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd additional 1 3 5 triformylphoroglucinol tp was purchased from zhengzhou acme chemical co ltd the reagents used for enrichment experiments include chromatographically pure n hexane and premium grade sodium chloride nacl shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs standard solution 10 mg l 1 j k chemical ltd six pcbs congeners were pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 101 pcb 138 pcb 153 and pcb 180 whose specific physical and chemical information was provided in table s1 the ultra pure water used was treated by the milli q integral 5 purification system merck millipore usa all the chemicals and reagents were employed without further purification 2 1 2 preparation of standard working solutions and real samples the working solution of pcbs 6 congeners was obtained through the dilution of the pcbs standard solution 10 mg l 1 firstly the pcbs standard solution was gradually diluted with n hexane to obtain the low concentration pcbs stock solution after that the final working solution with the desired concentration was obtained by adding stoichiometric pcbs stock solution the actual water samples used in the extraction experiment were river water lake water and sea water which came from the min river in the fuzhou basin qishan lake in the minhou region fuzhou china and the taiwan strait near jinjiang respectively these natural water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass filters for experimental use three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy fig s1 revealed that many dissolved organic matters dom presented in the real environmental water samples 2 2 fabrication of tppa modified pan sio2 electrospun nanofiber membrane pan sio2 tppa 2 2 1 preparation of aminated pan sio2 electrospun nanofiber membrane 1 20 g of polyacrylonitrile powder and 0 24 g of sio2 nano powder 7 40 nm was added to a 25 ml single necked flask then 12 ml of dmf solution was poured into the flask the mixture was magnetically stirred overnight at 60 c to obtain a homogeneous spinning solution after that the pan sio2 electrospun nanofiber membrane was prepared through the electrostatic spinning machine et 2535h ucalery china based on the parameters reported in our previous work ma et al 2021 the main parameters included a positive voltage of 13 kv and a negative voltage of 5 kv after spinning the aluminum foil paper covered with the pan sio2 nanofibers was removed from the roller and dried overnight at 60 c to ensure the thermal stability of the membrane during the subsequent application the nanofiber membrane was peeled from the aluminum foil paper and calcined in the tube furnace at 250 c under a nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h 0 50 g of heat treated pan sio2 nanocomposite and 0 50 ml of kh 550 was added to the flask containing 20 ml of ethanol and then the mixture was condensed and refluxed under magnetic stirring at 78 c for 6 h after washing and drying the aminated pan sio2 nanofiber membrane was synthesized 2 2 2 preparation of cof tppa modified pan sio2 pan sio2 tppa nanofiber membrane aminated pan sio2 nanofiber 4 10 cm 0 0850 g and tp 0 0315 g were firstly mixed into a 20 ml ethanol and the mixed solution was stirred for 30 min subsequently pa 0 0243 g was dissolved in the solution and the mixture was stirred at 25 c for 6 h finally the orange pan sio2 tppa nanofiber membrane was obtained after washing three times with acetone and tetrahydrofuran respectively and drying at 60 c for 2 h as a control tppa linked by β ketoenamine bond tppa was synthesized through reversible aldimine reaction and a rapid irreversible enol to keto tautomerization between tp and pa a molar ratio of 2 3 under room temperature based on the previous report wang et al 2021a 2 3 preparation of the solid phase micro extraction spme fiber the solid phase micro extraction spme fiber was obtained by coating the pan sio2 tppa nanofiber membrane on a stainless steel wire and the detailed procedure can been in our previous work ma et al 2021 firstly one end of the stainless steel wire 20 cm length 0 3 mm diameter was soaked in aqua regia for about 5 min followingly rinsed with acetone and ultra pure water several times then the corroded end was dipped into the resin glue and rotated gently to make the glue form a thin layer on the surface after that a piece of pan sio2 tppa membrane was stuck on the stainless steel wire to attain the required thickness finally the pan sio2 tppa coated stainless steel wire was installed into the injection needle to assemble the spme device meanwhile pan sio2 coated spme fiber was also prepared in the same way for the control before extraction it was necessary to calcine for 4 h under an n2 atmosphere at 250 c to quickly age the obtained spme fiber 2 4 enrichment experiment for pcbs 2 4 1 enrichment procedure the enrichment and analysis procedures were shown in fig s2 the enrichment experiments were performed in a 25 ml headspace bottle containing 20 ml of pcbs water solution the micro injection needle containing the spme fiber was inserted into the rubber stopper of the headspace bottle and then the fiber was pushed out to make the extraction coating deep under the solution surface subsequently the extraction was carried out at 30 c for 30 min after the extraction under the designed condition the fiber was pulled out of the headspace bottle and immediately inserted into the gc inlet for thermal desorption and the desorption process lasted 5 min in this work the main parameters like the ionic strength 0 20 w v time 10 60 min temperature 30 70 c and ph 2 10 during the enrichment experiments were optimized with 0 0001 mg l 1 of initial pcbs concentration 2 4 2 gas chromatograph conditions the desorbed pcbs from the spme fiber were analyzed by the gas chromatograph 7890 a agilent company usa equipped with an ecd detector and an hp 5 column 30 m 320 μm 0 25 μm the temperature of the injection port was 250 c and the carrier gas high purity nitrogen flow rate was 1 2 ml min 1 when the standard was injected the volume was 1 μl with splitless the detector temperature was 320 c additionally the temperature program of the pcbs analysis was as follows the temperature was initially set 120 c and firstly rose to 250 c at 6 c min 1 and then up to 270 c with a rate of 5 c min 1 and finally kept at 270 c for 2 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pan sio2 tppa and pan sio2 tppa fig 1 showed the surface morphology of pan sio2 heat treated pan sio2 aminated pan sio2 tppa and pan sio2 tppa the pristine pan sio2 electrospinning membrane fig 1 a c displayed a macroscopic block based material consisting of numerous uniform network fibers 200 nm of diameter while the sio2 nanoparticles distributed along the nanofibers fig s3 after heated at 250 c for 3 h the pan sio2 nanofiber membrane turned from white to yellow which was attributed to the partial carbonization but the nanofibers did not change at all fig 1 d f meanwhile no evident changes were observed in the surface morphology after the subsequent amination fig 1 g i after cof tppa growing it was clearly observed that the membrane turned orange which was close to the orange yellow tppa powder with dendritic clusters microstructure suggesting that cof tppa was successfully introduced into the membrane as demonstrated in fig 1 j l a large number of cof tppa nano clusters grew along the nanofibers besides the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds mapping images fig 1 p t clearly revealed that the c n o and si elements were uniformly distributed along the fibers moreover the cross sections of the aminated pan sio2 fig 1u w and pan sio2 tppa membrane fig 1x z were also observed to further analyze the structural variation of the membrane before the cof tppa growth the interior of the aminated pan sio2 membrane was loose with ample holes between the nanofibers and some sio2 nanoparticles were present on the surface of the nanofibers once the cof tppa grew on the nanofibers the thickness of the membrane increased from 64 8 3 3 nm to 112 5 2 7 nm table s2 meanwhile the interior of the membrane became dese and plenty of cof tppa appeared on the nanofibers notably due to the growth of cof tppa 450 m2 g 1 of bet area on the membrane the bet area average pore size and pore volume of the pan sio2 tppa changed from 33 to 108 m2 g 1 35 1 5 1 to 9 8 1 3 nm and 0 009 to 0 104 cm³ g 1 respectively fig s4 and table s2 furthermore xrd was employed to analyze the variation of a material structure during the synthesis process fig 2 a in the xrd pattern of the obtained tppa two evident peaks appeared at 2θ 7 9 and 26 7 belonging to the 200 and 001 planes of the cof tppa respectively as reported in previous literature kandambeth et al 2012 wang et al 2021b meanwhile it was worth noting that two weakened peaks also turned up at the same position in the xrd pattern of pan sio2 tppa suggesting the presence of cof tppa on the membrane in addition the intensity of the peak at 2θ 26 7 greatly weakened and broadened which may be due to the impacts of the widened band of the amorphous sio2 at 2θ 23 3 li et al 2021b the variation of the functional groups on the surface and composition of the cof tppa modified pan sio2 nanofiber membrane during the preparation process were analyzed by ft ir as depicted in the ft ir spectra of pan sio2 fig 2 b the characteristic peaks mainly included the cyano peak at 2240 cm 1 and the si o si group peaks at 1070 cm 1 and 795 cm 1 dai et al 2020 corresponding to pan and sio2 respectively after the heating treatment no changes in the ft ir spectra also indicated an inapparent impact of heating on the main groups on the membrane surface the broadband of aminated pan sio2 at 3300 cm 1 was the nh stretching vibration peak from kh 550 akhlaghi et al 2020 after the reaction between tp and pa at the membrane interface under room temperature the stretching vibration of cyano groups 2240 cm 1 and si o si groups 1070 cm 1 and 795 cm 1 on the pan sio2 tppa spectrum weakened which might be due to the coverage of cofs tppa on the surface of pan sio2 the c o stretching peak appeared at 1612 cm 1 and the c c stretching signal at 1579 cm 1 revealed the transformation from enol to keto tautomerism he et al 2017 meanwhile the absorption band of pan sio2 tppa appeared at 1252 cm 1 which also originated from the cn bond of the β ketoenamine unit of tp pa the stability was also a considerable index to evaluate the performance of the pan sio2 tppa tg analysis fig 3 a and dtg analysis data fig 3 b recorded the heat loss and the rate of pan sio2 tppa cof tppa and pan sio2 along with the temperature pan sio2 nanofiber membrane almost maintained a constant mass when the temperature increased from 30 c to 288 c and only underwent a single instant weight loss after 288 c which might be related to the pyrolysis of the cyclization of the nitrile group on pan pirzada et al 2014 the first mass loss of pan sio2 tppa and tppa occurred from 30 c to 98 c with a weight loss of about 2 which may be caused by the release of water and solvent when the temperature rose to 327 c pan sio2 tppa and tppa experienced a second mass loss which might be associated with the thermal decomposition of certain functional groups of tppa after the second stage tppa maintained their weight residue at around 92 the third stage of tppa occurred at 394 c which was ascribed to the collapse of the tppa skeleton structure li and zhang 2019 correspondingly pan sio2 tppa also lost weight rapidly at this stage meanwhile as illustrated in the dtg curves fig 3 b both tppa and pan sio2 tppa showed the first weight loss peak at 66 c while their second weight loss peaks appeared at 335 c and 361 c respectively the last mass loss peak of tppa appears at 469 c based on the above thermal analysis results it could be inferred that pan sio2 tppa had excellent thermal stability and was suitable for high temperature thermal desorption at the gc inlet at 250 c after treated with water organic solvents acetone methanol thf alkaline naoh buffer and acidic solution hcl buffer there was no significant change in the ft ir spectra of pan sio2 tppa fig 3 c when compared to the fresh pan sio2 tppa it was worth noting that pan sio2 tppa was a little unstable in the strong alkaline ph 11 solution because the silica in the nanofiber would react with alkali 3 2 enrichment performance of pan sio2 tppa on pcbs 3 2 1 comparison of enrichment capacity between pan sio2 and pan sio2 tppa the chromatogram fig 4 a revealed that both pan sio2 tppa and pan sio2 nanofiber membranes exhibited the ability to extract 6 pcbs congeners 0 0001 mg l 1 from water while the signal intensities of the pcbs congeners in the pan sio2 tppa group were 2 21 3 29 times higher than those of pan sio2 membrane group fig 4 b indicating that the introduced cof tppa could greatly enhance the enrichment performance on trace pcbs 3 2 2 optimization of extraction conditions it has been reported that some factors during the spme process greatly impacted the extraction efficiency balasubramanian and panigrahi 2011 herein for the sake of acquiring the optimal conditions of the spme process the single factor optimization experiments were carried out and the main factors involved the ionic strength 0 20 w v extraction time 10 60 min temperature 30 70 c and ph 2 10 fig s5 a illustrated the effects of the salt concentration on pcbs enrichment and the results revealed an evident negative correlation was observed between the salt concentration and pcbs extraction efficiency when the ionic strength increased from 0 to 20 the peak areas of all pcbs significantly declined this might be because increasing ionic strength would result in the viscosity of the solution increasing which severely hindered the mass transfer process and resulted in a decline in the extraction efficiency wu et al 2016 besides the adsorption of the salt ions on the nanofibers might also cause the occupation of the adsorption sites leading to the decline in the extraction efficiency fig s5 b demonstrated the change of pcbs extraction peak area along the extraction time in the first 30 min of extraction the peak area gradually increased along the time when the extraction time further prolonged the peak areas of pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 101 and pcb 153 tended to a platform suggesting that the absorption of pcbs reached dynamic equilibrium in 30 min although the adsorption of pcb 138 and pcb 180 continued to proceed after 30 min the adsorption rate tended to decline thus considering the service life of the fiber coatings and working efficiency 30 min was set as the working time in the following experiments besides the extraction temperature was also a notable factor in the extraction process on the one hand the high temperature promoted the transfer and diffusion of the analyte in the matrix solution ma et al 2021 on the other hand too high temperature was not conducive to the exothermic adsorption of the analyte on the extraction coating yu et al 2021 in the temperature range of 30 c to 70 c fig s5 c the peak areas of all pcbs indicated a downward trend since the extraction of pcbs by pan sio2 tppa was an exothermic process low temperature was favorable to the progress of adsorption guo et al 2019 consequently the best extraction temperature was 30 c the ph value could also cause changes in the partition coefficient of the analytes in the fiber and liquid phase leading to variation in extraction efficiency from fig s5 d it could be seen that compared with neutral conditions the peak area of all the pcbs obviously declined under both acidic and alkaline conditions consider the situation in the real water the following experiments were done under neutral conditions 3 2 3 enrichment of trace pcbs with pan sio2 tppa membranes the main parameters for evaluating the enrichment capability for contaminants usually included the detection of limits lods s n 3 the quantification of limits loqs s n 10 and enrichment factors efs table 1 listed the obtained parameters under the optimal conditions the high regression coefficients r 0 9965 0 9993 revealed that the work curves for pcbs based on the gc were able to quantitatively analyze the trace pcbs in water even the pcbs levels were as low as 1 5 ng l 1 moreover the lods of the pan sio2 tppa for pcbs extraction were as low as 0 1 5 ng l 1 importantly the enrichment factors efs of the pan sio2 tppa for six pcb congeners maintained at 2714 3949 manifesting outstanding enrichment efficiency meanwhile the relative standard deviation rsd was adopted to evaluate the reproducibility of intra day and inter day extraction which were 0 81 8 63 and 1 71 5 08 respectively verifying the stable duplicability of the method based on pan sio2 tppa fiber the service life of the pan sio2 tppa fiber was evaluated by the reusing experiments as demonstrated in fig s6 after 150 runs the peak area of each pcb congener did not descend significantly indicating that the coating owned the fabulous stability and reusability likewise no evident variation was observed in both ft ir spectra fig s7 a and xrd pattern fig s7 b of pan sio2 tppa after recycling which also confirmed the good stability of pan sio2 tppa fiber to clearly confirm the adsorption of pcbs on the pan sio2 tppa membrane the xps data of the membrane before and after spde process were recorded as depicted in the xps spectra of the spent pan sio2 tppa membrane fig s8 the presence of cl clearly revealed the successful adsorption of pcbs on the membrane 3 3 enrichment of trace pcbs in real samples the enrichment performance in the real water was also evaluated by using three natural water samples as the background water river lake and sea water at different pcbs levels 5 and 50 ng l 1 the three dimensional fluorescence images fig s1 of the natural water samples clearly displayed higher signals than that of the ultra water revealing the presence of ample dissolved organic matters dom in the natural water samples to determine the initial pcbs levels in the natural water the pan sio2 tppa was first employed to extract the pcbs in these water samples unfortunately no pcbs signals were detected in the gc chromatogram fig 5 suggesting no pcbs in the water samples when the stoichiometric pcbs congeners were added to the natural water the significant pcbs signals in the gc chromatogram fig 5 strongly manifested that the pan sio2 tppa could efficiently extract the trace pcbs in three natural water samples even the pcbs level was as low as 5 ng l 1 meanwhile the obtained parameters based on the gc method also proved the feasibility of pan sio2 tppa for enriching the pcbs in real water as listed in table 2 when the river lake and sea water samples were spiked with 5 ng l 1 the spiked recovery was 84 49 101 32 84 38 109 25 and 72 39 97 55 respectively while the enrichment factors were 3387 5964 3603 6362 and 3186 5611 separately similarly when 50 ng l 1 of pcbs was spiked it also showed a reasonable recovery with 85 69 119 66 of river samples and 109 11 126 11 of lake samples 88 57 119 27 of sea samples and decent enrichment factors with 2602 3551 2994 4524 2723 3910 furthermore considering the presence of dom in the real water it was necessary to evaluate the matrix effects of the dom in the real water on the extraction performance the matrix effect me was defined as the ratio of the pcbs peak areas in the real water and the standard solvent me peak area matrix standard peak area solvent standard 1 100 in addition the matrix effects mainly involved three levels low 20 to 20 medium 20 50 and 20 to 50 and high 50 or 50 ekins daukes et al 2018 as depicted in fig 6 it could be observed that when the spiked concentration of pcbs was 5 ng l 1 both river water and lake water manifested low matrix effects which were 11 83 0 90 and 10 58 6 23 respectively however for seawater most pcbs exhibited a weak matrix inhibitory effect at 5 ng l 1 and the matrix effect ranged from 22 71 to 0 27 besides the matrix effect of pcb 101 was 22 71 indicating the medium matrix effect when the spiked concentration was 50 ng l 1 the matrix effect of river water fig 6 a was between 13 08 and 18 80 which confirmed the weak matrix effect for lake water fig 6 b all six pcbs exhibited a matrix enhancement effect which was 8 74 24 88 in the sea water matrix fig 6 c except pcb 28 exhibiting a moderate matrix effect 24 18 the other pcbs belonged to a weak matrix effect with a range of 10 97 12 22 the above results marked that the method was not greatly interfered with by the natural water matrix thus pan sio2 tppa fiber could be employed to extract pcbs in the actual environment therefore the prepared pan sio2 tppa coating had the fantastic potential for enrichment and determination of pcbs in actual environmental water samples to well understand the advantages of pan sio2 tppa membrane the reported materials for extracting pcbs were listed in table s3 for the comparison compared with other analytical methods table s3 the method based on pan sio2 tppa membrane exhibited higher enrichment factor lower detection limit and shorter extraction time than those of most materials except tfpb bd considering the simple operation outstanding enrichment performance in the real water samples good reusability easy recycling and no secondary pollution our material was still a competitive alternative for extracting and detecting the trace pcbs in the environmental water 3 4 plausible adsorption mechanism 3 4 1 hydrophobic effects as one of the most important interactions the hydrophobic effects between the organic pollutants and materials usually played an important role during the adsorption of the hydrophobic organic pollutants to analyze the hydrophobic properties of the absorbents the static contact angles of the original pan sio2 nanofibers heat treated pan sio2 membrane tppa powder and the pan sio2 tppa were tested as revealed in fig 7 a the pristine pan sio2 nanofiber membrane 45 9 was partially hydrophilic however after heated at 250 c the high contact angle 122 7 revealed the strong hydrophobicity of the membrane base indicating the heating treatment significantly enhanced the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface which was attributed into the partial carbonization on the membrane surface sun et al 2016 meanwhile the raman spectra were recorded to confirm the carbonization fig 7 b compared with the pristine pan sio2 membrane the higher d band 1370 cm 1 related to the defects or distortions in the graphite lattice structure of disordered sp3 hybrid carbon and g band 1611 cm 1 linked to highly ordered pyrolytic graphite peaks clearly confirmed the surface graphitization of the pan sio2 membrane bao et al 2021 in addition in the xps spectra fig 7 c d after heating the higher c c c c percentage 57 51 in c1s spectra also verified the carbonization nevertheless when the cof tppa was introduced on the nanofibers the contact angle sharply descended from 122 7 to 16 8 suggesting strongly hydrophilic surface of pan sio2 tppa membrane due to the presence of ample hydrophilic groups like carbonyl and secondary amine groups on the surface the cof tppa displayed strong hydrophilicity which also resulted in a sharp decline in the static contact angle fig 7 a based on these results it could be concluded that pan sio2 tppa membrane was an amphiphilic material with the hydrophilic end cof tppa and hydrophobic base heat treated pan sio2 according to table s1 the octanol water partition coefficients log kow of six pcbs ranged from 5 31 to 7 16 implying the target analytes were relatively hydrophobic according to our previous results ma et al 2022 the hydrophobic membrane tended to adsorb the hydrophobic analytes through the hydrophobic effects thus it can be inferred that the hydrophobic effects probably occurred between the heat treated pan sio2 membrane base and pcbs molecule meanwhile the enrichment experiments fig s7 clearly showed that the pcbs enrichment factors for the heat treated pan sio2 membrane were 1 5 2 3 folders larger than those of the pristine membrane suggesting that the hydrophobic effect played an important role in pcbs extraction over the pan sio2 tppa membrane 3 4 2 π π stacking interaction based on the findings of hunter and sanders hunter and sanders 1990 the π π stacking interaction widely existed between the aromatic groups given the presence of an abundant aromatic nucleus in both tppa and pcbs it was inferred that the pan sio2 tppa could easily absorb pcbs through π π stacking interaction owing to the fact that a large number of aromatic rings were present in both the cofs tppa and pcbs molecules pan sio2 tppa membrane could easily adsorb pcbs via π π stacking interaction between the aromatic rings as demonstrated in c1s xps spectrum of pan sio2 tppa membrane fig 8 a there were five main functional groups including c c c c at 284 80 ev c n at 286 13 ev c n at 287 64 ev and the c o at 289 17 ev and the π π group at 291 90 ev tian et al 2018b after pcbs enrichment fig 8 b the proportion of c c c c increased slightly from 45 15 to 46 14 while the π π groups dropped from 3 38 to 2 29 which manifested that the interaction between π π groups was involved in the enrichment of pcbs 3 4 3 hydrogen bonding apart from π π stacking hydrogen bonding is also a crucial adsorption mechanism during the adsorption of organic pollutants as depicted in fig 8 b after pcbs enrichment the c cl characteristic peak at 286 23 ev appeared on the c1s xps spectrum confirming the adsorption of pcbs on the membrane as an element with strong electronegativity the cl atom usually acted as a good proton acceptor and easily captured the hydrogen atom from other groups feng et al 2006 wang and englert 2017 considering sufficient h donors nh nh2 and oh groups in the pan sio2 tppa the cl atom in pcbs tended to migrate to the pan sio2 tppa and formed abundant hydrogen bonds like o h cl and n h cl between pan sio2 tppa and pcbs moreover as shown in the n1s spectra of pan sio2 tppa fig 8 c there were four main functional n species including c n 398 5 ev dementjev et al 2000 nh2 n h 399 5 ev lv et al 2021b n h x 400 2 ev liu et al 2020 and graphitic n 402 2 ev ayiania et al 2020 after pcbs enrichment fig 8 d the proportion of nh2 n h groups decreased from 17 34 to 14 70 while the proportion of n h x increased from 2 19 to 11 13 suggesting that the nh2 nh groups participated in the formation of hydrogen bonds during the adsorption of pcbs on pan sio2 tppa similarly during the adsorption of halogenated organic matters in previous work wang and englert 2017 scholfield et al 2013 the o n h x f cl br hydrogen bonds have been proved to play a rather important role 3 4 4 synergistic mechanism of pan sio2 tppa adsorption of pcbs based on the above results there were three interactions hydrophobic effect π π interaction and hydrogen bonding during the enrichment of pcbs on the pan sio2 tppa nanofibrous membrane as described in the characterization results fig 7 the resulting cof tppa on the pan sio2 tppa membrane is composed of the hydrophilic end cof tppa and hydrophobic base heat treated pan sio2 during the adsorption of pcbs due to the strong hydrophilic surface the pan sio2 tppa membrane could be easily mixed with the water molecule and then the pcbs molecule could quickly enter the pores of the membrane along the water once the pcbs contacted the cof tppa the pcbs molecule tended to migrate into the surface of the membrane through the h cl hydrogen bonds between the cl and h donors nh nh2 and oh groups meanwhile due to the strong attraction between the π electron clouds among the aromatic rings the pcbs molecule also could be adsorbed on the membrane besides the high log kow values of the pcbs congeners table s1 revealed the strong hydrophobicity according to the principle of similar compatibility the hydrophobic pcbs molecules tended to migrate to the hydrophobic heat treated pan sio2 base resulting in the adsorption of pcbs which has been confirmed in fig s9 as reported in previous studies lv et al 2021a schmid 2001 the strong hydrophobic effects could greatly reduce the steric hindrance between the adsorbent and the adsorbate and then promoted the π π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding which greatly improved the adsorption of organic pollutants on the materials in summary the extraction mechanism of pcbs on pan sio2 tppa mainly involved the synergistic effects of the hydrophobic effect π π stacking and hydrogen bonding the hydrophilic tppa on the nanofiber membrane helped the pcbs molecules enter the pores of the membrane then the strong hydrophobic effects between pcbs and pan sio2 tppa membrane base would lower the steric hindrance resulting in an improvement in the π π stacking and hydrogen bonding which greatly enhanced the enrichment of pcbs on the membrane 4 conclusions in this work a novel pan sio2 nanofiber membrane coupled with cofs tppa pan sio2 tppa was designed for the extraction of trace pcbs in water the pan sio2 tppa owned abundant functional groups and exhibited excellent stability fabulous enrichment efficiency efs 2602 and good reusability 150 runs during the enrichment of trace pcbs as low as 5 ng l 1 in various real water samples the main enrichment mechanisms of the pan sio2 tppa on pcbs included the hydrophobic effects π π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding our finding provided a new

14916,the widely distributed antibiotic resistance genes args were unevenly proliferated in various habitats great endeavors are needed to resolve the resistome features that can differentiate or connect different habitats this study retrieved a broad spectrum of resistome profiles from 1723 metagenomes categorized into 13 habitats encompassing industrial urban agricultural and natural environments and spanning most continents and oceans the resistome features arg types subtypes indicator args and emerging mobilizable args mcr and tet x in these habitats were benchmarked via a standardized workflow we found that wastewater and wastewater treatment works were characterized to be reservoirs of more diverse genotypes of args than any other habitats including human and livestock fecal samples while fecal samples were with higher arg abundance bacterial taxonomy composition was significantly correlated with resistome composition across most habitats moreover the source sink connectivities were disentangled by developing the resistome based microbial attribution prediction model environmental surveys with standardized bioinformatic workflow proposed in this study will help comprehensively understand the transfer of args in the environment thus prioritizing the critical environments with high risks for intervention to tackle the problem of args graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability the datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article and its additional files 1 introduction pathogenic bacteria with multiple antibiotic resistance genes args poses a major threat to public health and has caused an estimated 1 27 million death in 2019 due to the failure of traditional antibiotic therapeutics laxminarayan et al 2020 murray et al 2022 o neill 2014 the dissemination of both antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs and args across environmental habitats elevates the severity of this pollution issue and reinforces the need for its better management kumarasamy et al 2010 liu et al 2016 fecal waste discharged by human and food producing animals carries abundant args he et al 2020 li et al 2015 looft et al 2012 ma et al 2016 even worse livestock feces and manure are critical sites with selection pressure from antibiotics due to the fact that 73 of antibiotics on the global market are applied to animals raised for food van boeckel et al 2019 the application of human or animal waste as a valued fertilizer will disseminate args in surrounding soils groundwater and even crops that are consumed by humans or animals koutsoumanis et al 2021 scott et al 2022 van den meersche et al 2019 urban sewage that collects the discharged feces together with urban runoff is either piped out directly to the nearby aquatic environments or treated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps karkman et al 2017 wwtps are arg hotspots where the activated sludge mixed with concentrated sewage provides conditions that are favorable for horizontal gene transfer ju et al 2019 effluent from wwtps carries args and arbs downstream of rivers or nearby oceans lorenzo et al 2018 aquatic environments are greatly concerned with arg pollution where multiple exposure pathways exist for human beings including drinking water and bathing fresia et al 2019 jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 industrial wastewater especially those from the biological treatment plants treating pharmaceutical manufacturing wastes is another important arg reservoir bengtsson palme et al 2019 zhai et al 2016 landfill sites are critical for arg development due to bacteria from diverse sources including discarded sludges or urban wastes interacting intensively under anaerobic environments zhao et al 2018 at a policy relevant landscape scale there can be multiple sources of args that can contaminate the environment however the relationships of resistome from different pollution sources are not clear including whether one type of habitat is connected with another connectivities or any resistome feature significantly differentiates sources distinction thus challenging the development of efficacious mitigation of environmental resistome previous efforts have explored the distribution and diversity of args across environments of only 2 escudeiro et al 2019 or 4 li et al 2020 habitats which provided rather roughly comparative analysis in low resolution in 2016 pal et al characterized resistome and taxonomic composition in 13 sample types 6 of which were human body sites while the other 7 sample types were animal associated or environment habitats pal et al 2016 there has been a boom of metagenomic sequencing studies on a wide variety of environments in the past decades cuadrat et al 2020 ma et al 2019 nayfach et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 supplementing the current database with more valuable novel sample collections for conducting benchmarking analysis especially those datasets from low income areas are critical for understanding the global arg profile because args have been reported to be significantly associated with social economic factors hendriksen et al 2019 pehrsson et al 2016 however there still lacks a quantitative exploration of global resistome across broad environments such a reliable global scale analysis largely relied on strict quality control of datasets as public databases contain datasets of different quality e g comprehensiveness and accuracy of metadata and from different sequencing strategies e g length depth thus in this study a broad range of categories including 13 different habitats was collected to benchmark the global resistome features under standardized bioinformatic workflow the habitat specialty of resistome in different perspectives arg types subtypes indicator args and emerging args was characterized based on which a robust source tracking model was constructed to decipher the resistome attributions of various sources for targeted sinks 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of environmental metagenomic datasets the proposed standardized bioinformatic framework annotating and quantifying args in this study was summarized in fig s1 in detail a total of 1723 metagenomic datasets with over 10 m in size and over 100 bp in read length generated from the illumina platform after random library selection and paired library layout were collected by using customized scripts from public databases version jan 12 2023 differences in the library preparation process whether random selection or targeted pcr paired or single ended may lead to unpredicted bias in the read distribution of bacterial community analysis as well as the quantification of resistome in the downstream analysis most importantly the accurate information on habitats for each dataset was collected and manually curated to minimize the ambiguities the high quality datasets were then linked with their country information and geographical coordinates using the archived metadata from the ncbi sra database and mg rast database moreover the environmental habitat classification of samples was conducted based on the description in the method section of the corresponding publication which results in 13 habitat categories in addition landfill includes landfill leachate and landfill soils natural water contains both inland surface water and groundwater detailed information including habitat classifications doi links and geographical locations is summarized in table s1 2 2 arg annotation and quantification the collected raw reads were downloaded using sratoolkit fasterq dump and low quality reads were filtered out with trimmomatic leading 3 trailing 3 slidingwindow 4 20 minlen 100 bolger et al 2014 the clean reads then went through the most updated version of args oap v3 2 2 for arg identification with a cut off of similarity of 80 query length coverage ratio of 75 and e value of 1e 7 moreover the identified args were classified at types subtypes gene levels and quantified by a universal unit of copies of arg per cell by normalizing against the cell counts in the analyzed metagenome based on the identification of essential single copy marker genes yin et al 2022 this large collection of environmental metagenomes undergone the same analysis procedure quantifying in a unified unit arg copy per cell number provides a valuable reference for researchers in different fields the entire profile of arg abundance and diversity has been uploaded to the website of args osp v2 0 and is freely accessible https smile hku hk args args osp zhang et al 2020a providing a valuable resource for researchers in relevant fields 2 3 taxonomy classification the bacterial taxonomic composition was classified from clean reads using kraken 2 v2 0 8 with a customized database based on the k mer of complete genomes wood and salzberg 2014 the quantification was furtherly calculated by bracken 2 0 to get the relative abundances of the bacterial genus in each sample lu et al 2017 an annotated genus with relative abundances lower than 0 05 was removed from the taxonomic profile to avoid ambiguous classification and then the quantification results were adjusted sun et al 2021 2 4 ordination analysis and procrustes analysis to compare the resistome profile among habitats 3d 2d principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted based on the bray curtis dissimilarity of the relative abundances of args at the subtype level in all samples and the bacterial composition at the genus level to deduce the relationship between the resistome and bacterial composition the correlations between the arg subtype abundance profile with the relative abundance of the genus were furtherly explored for each habitat plotly sievert et al 2019 vegan oksanen et al 2019 and biodiversityr kindt and kindt 2019 were packages applied to conduct the above analysis in the rstudio 2 5 identification of indicator args to further explore the contributing features that significantly differentiate the sample clusters revealed by ordination analyses we identified indicator args across habitats by applying the r package indval the top 51 arg subtypes with the highest indicator values were ranked within the list of indicator args across the 13 habitats the abundances of these 51 indicator args varied across habitats and were compared with the list of the most abundant args 2 6 args as features in microbial source tracking modeling of microbial source tracking mst was conducted in r using random forest rf classification feast and sourcetracker respectively for rf classification and sourcetracker analysis the leave one out test with five runs was applied on training datasets n 862 which is half of the samples randomly selected and default parameters were applied on model construction i e rf the number of trees grown was set as 500 while the number of predictor samples for splitting at each node was set as 109 liaw and wiener 2014 sourcetracker burnin 100 nrestarts 10 alpha 0 001 beta 0 01 rare fraction depth 1000 knights et al 2011 the rest of the samples n 861 were applied as the test dataset in assessing the prediction performance for each query sink sample the predictive proportions of 13 habitats with one additional unknown source were calculated and the source with the highest proportion was assigned as the predicted source the average predicted proportion of samples from each habitat with the premise of correct predicted sources was treated as the general prediction precision for that habitat standard deviation sd was also calculated across the samples within each habitat for feast the default number of estimation maximization iterations 1000 was used and the same list of sources for all source sink assignments shenhav et al 2019 the leave one out approach was applied to assess the prediction performance of feast i e when one sample was chosen as the test sink the rest of the samples n 1722 were treated as sources to calculate the contributing proportions then the sum of the proportion within the same habitat was calculated to represent the proportion of that habitat and the predicted source of this test sample is the habitat with the highest predictive proportion 3 results 3 1 global distribution of args metagenomic datasets n 1723 from diverse habitats were collected from 102 independent studies representing 8 geographical regions covering 83 countries fig 1 a b the habitats were classified into 13 categories including chicken feces cattle feces swine feces human feces municipal sewage industrial wwtps municipal wwtps soil landfill drinking water natural sediment natural water and marine water samples were distributed in seven continents asia north america south america europe africa australia and antarctica and covered both high income e g u s u k germany japan and low income e g nigeria senegal countries regions the marine water samples were collected from tara oceans expedition and the ocean sampling day consortium there were more municipal wwtps n 328 natural sediment n 280 soil n 198 and marine water n 193 than other metagenomes available which may lead to potential biases however rarefaction curves of the number of detected arg subtypes almost reached the plateau for some of the studied habitats and clearly displayed the distinction of arg diversity in these habitats fig 1c indicating the sufficient sequencing depth of this collection for characterizing habitat features thus the currently available resources were utilized in the best practice in this study to decipher the distinction and association of arg profiles abundance and diversity in various habitats across the globe the total resistome abundance varied across habitats ranging from 0 42 to 5 55 copies of args per cell fig 1d table s2 the highest resistome levels were found in chicken feces followed by swine feces and human feces while sewage samples were comparable to human feces in contrast to animal human associated samples natural habitats including soil natural water and natural sediment had relatively low levels of resistome and the lowest end of the abundance spectrum was marine water a similar trend of arg abundance levels in these habitats has been reported by previous studies ya et al he et al 2020 reviewed the resistome in livestock feces and found that arg abundance in chicken feces and pig feces are much higher than in hospital and municipal waste while cattle feces are similar to the arg abundance level of hospital and municipal waste bing et al li et al 2015 clustered ten typical environments into four groups with significantly different arg abundance the group with the most abundant args included livestock waste followed by the group including wwtp influent and human feces with a 0 5 1 order of magnitude decrease in total arg abundance which is consistent with this study a total of 2384 different arg subtypes out of 2842 reference subtypes were detected at least once in the 1723 metagenomes fig 1c among the detected args subtypes 2134 were identified from municipal sewage samples which were the habitats with the highest resistome diversity although their total resistome abundance was not the highest municipal wwtps also contained very diverse arg subtypes n 1334 than other habitats the sewage and the downstream treatment facilities were therefore considered as the most potential reservoirs of args which has also been highlighted by previous reports on a global collection of wwtp effluent samples yin et al 2021 and a long term sampling of wwtp activated sludges spanning nine years yin et al 2019 3 2 global diversity and clustering of resistome the resistome structures were distinct between different environments figs 2 and s2 revealed by the relative abundance percentage of arg types and subtypes livestock feces including chicken feces swine feces and cattle feces together with human feces had a high proportion of tetracycline resistance genes while soil samples had a higher proportion of vancomycin resistance genes compared with other habitats meantime multidrug resistance genes were observed as the dominant arg type in low arg abundant habitats including natural sediment and marine water municipal sewage and wwtp with the highest resistome diversity had an even distribution of multiple arg types including aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls multidrug sulfonamide and tetracycline results were different in the arg subtype level where twenty three arg subtypes accounted for more than 30 of the total abundance in fecal samples and sewage related samples and over 50 of natural samples we observed the dominant arg subtypes for different habitat categories e g tetw in livestock feces vanxo in soil macb in natural sediment marine water and baca in wwtp industrial wwtp drinking water natural water interestingly although livestock feces and marine water samples shared tetracycline resistance genes as the arg type with a high proportion they were featured by different tetracycline resistant subtypes i e tetw and tetp respectively to visualize the dissimilarity of different habitats coordinate analyses were conducted on the bray curtis dissimilarity of the relative abundance profile at the arg reference gene level in the 2d 3d pcoa those samples from the same habitat were clustered together although the collection covered several independent studies and diverse geographies fig 3 the overall explanation proportion in the three axes in 3d pcoa was summed up to 37 52 for discriminating the resistome among habitats there were sub clusters found for soil and natural sediment which were close to each other while another sub cluster was fecal samples including human feces chicken feces swine feces and cattle feces the sub cluster members had a relatively lower distance from each other compared with the distance to the rest habitats the clustering results demonstrated the obvious separation and connectivity of resistome structures across habitats the clustering of habitats was mainly attributed to several arg types including beta lactam multidrug tetracycline mls and vancomycin as shown by indicator analysis the indicator args were selected features in disentangling the datasets with different labels i e habitats in this study which outperformed the full arg profile or the list of dominant args in finding the true clusters a total of 51 indicator args were detected with the least indicator value of 0 16 efm 1 and the most indicator value of 0 96 tet 39 fig 4 and table s3 of note it was found that not all of the indicator args were among the most abundant fig 2b some less abundant arg subtypes for example fez 1 beta lactam rcp 1 beta lactam ecm 1 beta lactam vat b mls ole c mls and sul4 tetracycline were important gene markers to resolve different habitats 3 3 emerging mobilizable args mcr and tet x colistin resistance genes had long been regarded as chromosomally encoded genes before the discovery of mcr 1 which was carried by plasmids in escherichia coli isolated from a swine farm in china in 2015 liu et al 2016 since then the high prevalence of the mcr 1 genes was reported by studies on isolates from europe north america and africa mulvey et al 2016 tijet et al 2017 wang et al 2018 different from isolate based surveillance we quantified the mcr genes variants mcr 1 to mcr 9 on a global scale through metagenomes and results showed that 49 of studied samples were detected with mcr genes moreover we found the prevalence of mcr in a much broader range of habitats than in previous isolation based studies wang et al reported 92 of mcr 1 positive isolates from animals or humans while few were from environments wang et al 2018 this study showed that sewage and wwtp samples were dominant reservoirs with 97 and 71 of the samples detected with mcr genes respectively especially in europe countries fig 5 b surprisingly relatively low percentages in fecal samples e g 19 of chicken feces and 25 of human feces were detected with mcr genes table s4 moreover the total abundance of mcr genes ranged from 0 to 0 087 china copies per cell fig 5a martiny et al martiny et al 2022 reported different results that australia was detected with particularly higher mcr abundance than other countries which was doubted due to potential bias caused by lack of effective quality control of the raw data e g including datasets generated from different sequencing platforms and unqualified metagenomes of isolates or fragments similar results were found for emerging plasmid borne tet x genes including variants tet x3 tet x4 and tet x5 other tet x variants tet x tet x1 and tet x2 were not included for lack of evidence of plasmid borne activities although they also confer the tigecycline resistance our results showed a broad prevalence of mobilizable tet x in different continents and diverse habitats fig s3 totally 35 of studied samples were found with mobilizable tet x genes table s5 sewage 98 and wwtp 75 were reservoirs with a high percentage of detection different from mcr genes which were only detected in a limited number of swine feces and chicken feces mobilizable tet x was widely found in swine feces 90 where the tet x4 gene was originally discovered he et al 2019 to our knowledge this is the first study on global surveillance of mobilizable tet x across diverse ecosystems previous studies only considered limited countries or specific types of samples for example surveillance and source tracking of tet x in human microbiome samples zhang et al 2021b as well as phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis on isolates carrying tet x from clinical settings in china zhang et al 2020b 3 4 resistome and taxonomy association a total of 1789 bacterial genera were identified at least once in the metagenome but the alpha diversity at genus level exhibited clear distinction among different samples ranging from 15 samples categorized as human feces to 484 samples categorized as natural sediments the average alpha diversity of some habitats showed significant differences table s6 s7 a limited number of bacterial genera were found to be abundant fig s4 some of these dominant bacteria were widely distributed in most of the habitats for example streptomyces were detected in 12 out of all habitats other prevalent genera included aerobic e g pseudomonas e and anaerobic e g bifidobacteria bacteria by analyzing the bray curtis dissimilarity of bacterial taxonomic composition genus level clear separation was shown for different habitats which were similar to the clusters of the resistome fig s5 thus it was interesting to know the correlation between resistome and taxonomy which was furtherly estimated by procrustes analysis for each habitat fig 6 nine habitats were observed with a significant p 0 001 m2 0 35 correlation between args subtypes and bacterial genera composition including chicken feces swine feces human feces sewage wwtp soil natural water natural sediment and marine water however other habitats including drinking water and industrial wwtp were estimated with less correlation while cattle feces and landfill were biased in the analysis considering the limited number of metagenomes 3 5 source attribution prediction by mst tools except for the distinction features of resistome across different environments the relationship among them needs further exploration in fact the environmental sample as a sink usually is a mixture of multiple sources especially in contaminated environments for example the microbial profile in polluted surface water might be contributed by urban sewage and farm activities the microbial source tracking used for fecal contamination could be applied for predicting source attribution of arg pollution when taking the overall arg profile and the above mentioned features across diverse habitats into account li et al 2020 based on the abundance and diversity of resistome reported above the microbial source tracking models were constructed on the same collection of global data the prediction performance of three models was assessed and results showed that sourcetracker outperformed rf and feast in the resistome source tracking fig 7 eleven habitats were predicted with high precision 80 when applying sourcetracker while limited habitats were effectively predicted by rf n 3 or feast n 5 thus sourcetracker was more efficient in disentangling the source sink relationship of massive environmental metagenomic datasets with acceptable running time in contrast feast was low accuracy and highly time consuming which might be due to the dissimilarity of the community features of the samples and the large sample size applied in this environmental surveillance shenhav et al 2019 thus the sourcetracker stood out to be the best tool to implement resistom source tracking from diverse habitats and the model in this study with sourcetracker was named mst v2 0 for public access via https smile hku hk sargs to demonstrate the application of mst v2 0 the source tracking of arg pollution in river waters was conducted by reanalyzing metagenomic datasets from a series of samples along the yangtze river liu et al 2018 results showed there was a pollution gradient in the river the arg profile upstream of the river has 5 7 wwtps contribution 19 24 at the middle stream and 37 downstream while the main classifications of all these samples were natural water with 52 94 contribution fig s6 this demonstrates the reliability of the reference samples collected in mst v2 0 and the feasibility of this tool with high accuracy 4 discussion as crucial components under the one health concept environments are reservoirs and dissemination venues of a broad spectrum of args and arbs to understand the distinction and connectivity of resistome in different habitats including livestock feces human feces natural environments and others benchmarking of resistome analysis in these habitat categories is required the present study was significantly more comprehensive than previous reports concerning the environmental prevalence survey of resistomes li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a in particular this study especially covered hotspots of args like industrial wwtps and landfills even though the sample numbers were limited since the industrial wwtps and landfills have been reported to be critical reservoirs of args bengtsson palme et al 2019 zhai et al 2016 in fact more metagenomic datasets of these currently understudied habitats are needed in the future for a better representation of environmental samples importantly the characterization of specific habitats was for the first time achieved in this study for example we found that unlike other habitats with one or two dominant arg types municipal sewage and wwtps contain relatively more evenly distributed arg types including aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam mls multidrug sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes previous studies focusing on municipal wwtps also supported the observation of dominance of tetracycline and sulfonamide auerbach et al 2007 but did not highlight the features of even distribution of multiple dominant arg types as here the characteristics of wwtps with multiple dominant args might be the results of high biomass concentration diverse bacterial communities and active horizontal genetic transfers in activated sludges in wwtps additionally we found that all of the selected args for discriminating habitats were abundantly detected in sewage samples making sewage the most general reservoir of diverse args than other habitats in this study the distinction of arg abundance and diversity across various environments including arg hotspots under anthropogenic effects and other natural environments were compared the reason for the consistent result that the abundance of args is much higher in fecal samples and sewage related samples than in natural environments is the selection of resistance genes in clinical settings or feedlots with wide application of antibiotics zhang et al 2021a another reason may be the prevalence of pathogens in those arg reservoirs karkman et al 2019 per arg diversity the high possibility of horizontal gene transfer hgt with the accumulation of resistance genes in sewage and wwtp explains the much higher diversity of args in sewage and wwtp than in other samples yin et al yin et al 2019 reported a higher hgt potential in wwtp than in soil samples by estimating the hgt potential based on the distance of args and mges on complete genomes from the perspective of microbial source tracking samples were connected in a source sink relationship args in pollution sites can be tracked from possible sources while the attributions of different sources were calculated based on unique and common features between habitats our resistome mst v2 0 model provides a promising reference in resolving a sink sample with uncertain sources using 13 habitats as potential pollution sources indeed a collection of representative local sources will be the ideal solution for interpreting a locally polluted sample however the global tracking model also exhibited an excellent prediction performance in this study which excluded intra habitat geographical variance and thus featured more general inter habitat discriminatory characteristics than local collections thus the resistome mst v2 0 will facilitate the source tracking process especially when lacking local data we emphasize that a reliable collection of high quality datasets and standardized quantification of resistome are essential to accurately describe the arg profile in habitats both locally and globally ko et al pointed out that sensitivity specificity and standardization of an assay are critical considerations for metagenomic application on pathogen surveillance as well as antibiotic resistance control ko et al 2022 this study is an attempt to reduce the potential bias introduced by method variability from many aspects including sequencing methods dataset quality control bioinformatic workflow and classification of habitats a perspective in future studies of resistome surveillance will lie in the development of absolute quantification for resistome analysis across different sample types which takes microbial density into consideration thus opening up new avenues for arg control on the environmental dimension results of this study provide metagenomics derived evidence for a few observations in previous experiments which are based on traditional culture based methods for example we found that compared with other habitats natural environments had an unexpectedly higher proportion of various arg types including fosfomycin and trimethoprim resistance genes these genes were considered ancient as pawlowski et al pawlowski et al 2016 found that 70 of the cultured strains from lechuguilla cave isolated from human activities for approximately 4 million years were resistant to over three different antibiotic types including fosfomycin sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim the consistent findings with previous studies provide the promising scales that the proposed environmental benchmark from this study could be applied for future studies there has been international antibiotic resistance surveillance based on cultural isolates including glass which is actively conducted and updated who 2020 however metagenome collection has still been an important supplement to such environmental benchmark which has benefits in two aspects 1 broad coverage of various habitats is available in metagenome collection ransom et al 2020 2 bacterial communities characterized by metagenomes are not limited to culturable species klümper et al 2019 moreover as demonstrated by this study in surveying emerging mobilizable genes mcr and tet x when novel args continuously being discovered in the future the collection of metagenomes has great value in the fast screening of target genes in a broad spectrum of habitats globally 5 conclusions we found that wastewater and wastewater treatment works were characterized to be reservoirs of more diverse genotypes of args than any other habitats including human and livestock fecal samples while fecal samples were with higher arg abundance bacterial taxonomy composition was significantly correlated with resistome composition across most habitats a microbial source tracking model regarding resistome has been developed to mst v2 0 which can be applied in resistome pollution source prediction environmental surveys with standardized bioinformatic workflow proposed in this study help comprehensively understand the difference and connections among 13 habitats encompassing industrial urban agricultural and natural environments and spanning most continents and oceans the resistome features arg types subtypes indicator args and emerging mobilizable args mcr and tet x in these habitats were benchmarked via a

14916,the widely distributed antibiotic resistance genes args were unevenly proliferated in various habitats great endeavors are needed to resolve the resistome features that can differentiate or connect different habitats this study retrieved a broad spectrum of resistome profiles from 1723 metagenomes categorized into 13 habitats encompassing industrial urban agricultural and natural environments and spanning most continents and oceans the resistome features arg types subtypes indicator args and emerging mobilizable args mcr and tet x in these habitats were benchmarked via a standardized workflow we found that wastewater and wastewater treatment works were characterized to be reservoirs of more diverse genotypes of args than any other habitats including human and livestock fecal samples while fecal samples were with higher arg abundance bacterial taxonomy composition was significantly correlated with resistome composition across most habitats moreover the source sink connectivities were disentangled by developing the resistome based microbial attribution prediction model environmental surveys with standardized bioinformatic workflow proposed in this study will help comprehensively understand the transfer of args in the environment thus prioritizing the critical environments with high risks for intervention to tackle the problem of args graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability the datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article and its additional files 1 introduction pathogenic bacteria with multiple antibiotic resistance genes args poses a major threat to public health and has caused an estimated 1 27 million death in 2019 due to the failure of traditional antibiotic therapeutics laxminarayan et al 2020 murray et al 2022 o neill 2014 the dissemination of both antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs and args across environmental habitats elevates the severity of this pollution issue and reinforces the need for its better management kumarasamy et al 2010 liu et al 2016 fecal waste discharged by human and food producing animals carries abundant args he et al 2020 li et al 2015 looft et al 2012 ma et al 2016 even worse livestock feces and manure are critical sites with selection pressure from antibiotics due to the fact that 73 of antibiotics on the global market are applied to animals raised for food van boeckel et al 2019 the application of human or animal waste as a valued fertilizer will disseminate args in surrounding soils groundwater and even crops that are consumed by humans or animals koutsoumanis et al 2021 scott et al 2022 van den meersche et al 2019 urban sewage that collects the discharged feces together with urban runoff is either piped out directly to the nearby aquatic environments or treated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps karkman et al 2017 wwtps are arg hotspots where the activated sludge mixed with concentrated sewage provides conditions that are favorable for horizontal gene transfer ju et al 2019 effluent from wwtps carries args and arbs downstream of rivers or nearby oceans lorenzo et al 2018 aquatic environments are greatly concerned with arg pollution where multiple exposure pathways exist for human beings including drinking water and bathing fresia et al 2019 jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 industrial wastewater especially those from the biological treatment plants treating pharmaceutical manufacturing wastes is another important arg reservoir bengtsson palme et al 2019 zhai et al 2016 landfill sites are critical for arg development due to bacteria from diverse sources including discarded sludges or urban wastes interacting intensively under anaerobic environments zhao et al 2018 at a policy relevant landscape scale there can be multiple sources of args that can contaminate the environment however the relationships of resistome from different pollution sources are not clear including whether one type of habitat is connected with another connectivities or any resistome feature significantly differentiates sources distinction thus challenging the development of efficacious mitigation of environmental resistome previous efforts have explored the distribution and diversity of args across environments of only 2 escudeiro et al 2019 or 4 li et al 2020 habitats which provided rather roughly comparative analysis in low resolution in 2016 pal et al characterized resistome and taxonomic composition in 13 sample types 6 of which were human body sites while the other 7 sample types were animal associated or environment habitats pal et al 2016 there has been a boom of metagenomic sequencing studies on a wide variety of environments in the past decades cuadrat et al 2020 ma et al 2019 nayfach et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 supplementing the current database with more valuable novel sample collections for conducting benchmarking analysis especially those datasets from low income areas are critical for understanding the global arg profile because args have been reported to be significantly associated with social economic factors hendriksen et al 2019 pehrsson et al 2016 however there still lacks a quantitative exploration of global resistome across broad environments such a reliable global scale analysis largely relied on strict quality control of datasets as public databases contain datasets of different quality e g comprehensiveness and accuracy of metadata and from different sequencing strategies e g length depth thus in this study a broad range of categories including 13 different habitats was collected to benchmark the global resistome features under standardized bioinformatic workflow the habitat specialty of resistome in different perspectives arg types subtypes indicator args and emerging args was characterized based on which a robust source tracking model was constructed to decipher the resistome attributions of various sources for targeted sinks 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of environmental metagenomic datasets the proposed standardized bioinformatic framework annotating and quantifying args in this study was summarized in fig s1 in detail a total of 1723 metagenomic datasets with over 10 m in size and over 100 bp in read length generated from the illumina platform after random library selection and paired library layout were collected by using customized scripts from public databases version jan 12 2023 differences in the library preparation process whether random selection or targeted pcr paired or single ended may lead to unpredicted bias in the read distribution of bacterial community analysis as well as the quantification of resistome in the downstream analysis most importantly the accurate information on habitats for each dataset was collected and manually curated to minimize the ambiguities the high quality datasets were then linked with their country information and geographical coordinates using the archived metadata from the ncbi sra database and mg rast database moreover the environmental habitat classification of samples was conducted based on the description in the method section of the corresponding publication which results in 13 habitat categories in addition landfill includes landfill leachate and landfill soils natural water contains both inland surface water and groundwater detailed information including habitat classifications doi links and geographical locations is summarized in table s1 2 2 arg annotation and quantification the collected raw reads were downloaded using sratoolkit fasterq dump and low quality reads were filtered out with trimmomatic leading 3 trailing 3 slidingwindow 4 20 minlen 100 bolger et al 2014 the clean reads then went through the most updated version of args oap v3 2 2 for arg identification with a cut off of similarity of 80 query length coverage ratio of 75 and e value of 1e 7 moreover the identified args were classified at types subtypes gene levels and quantified by a universal unit of copies of arg per cell by normalizing against the cell counts in the analyzed metagenome based on the identification of essential single copy marker genes yin et al 2022 this large collection of environmental metagenomes undergone the same analysis procedure quantifying in a unified unit arg copy per cell number provides a valuable reference for researchers in different fields the entire profile of arg abundance and diversity has been uploaded to the website of args osp v2 0 and is freely accessible https smile hku hk args args osp zhang et al 2020a providing a valuable resource for researchers in relevant fields 2 3 taxonomy classification the bacterial taxonomic composition was classified from clean reads using kraken 2 v2 0 8 with a customized database based on the k mer of complete genomes wood and salzberg 2014 the quantification was furtherly calculated by bracken 2 0 to get the relative abundances of the bacterial genus in each sample lu et al 2017 an annotated genus with relative abundances lower than 0 05 was removed from the taxonomic profile to avoid ambiguous classification and then the quantification results were adjusted sun et al 2021 2 4 ordination analysis and procrustes analysis to compare the resistome profile among habitats 3d 2d principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted based on the bray curtis dissimilarity of the relative abundances of args at the subtype level in all samples and the bacterial composition at the genus level to deduce the relationship between the resistome and bacterial composition the correlations between the arg subtype abundance profile with the relative abundance of the genus were furtherly explored for each habitat plotly sievert et al 2019 vegan oksanen et al 2019 and biodiversityr kindt and kindt 2019 were packages applied to conduct the above analysis in the rstudio 2 5 identification of indicator args to further explore the contributing features that significantly differentiate the sample clusters revealed by ordination analyses we identified indicator args across habitats by applying the r package indval the top 51 arg subtypes with the highest indicator values were ranked within the list of indicator args across the 13 habitats the abundances of these 51 indicator args varied across habitats and were compared with the list of the most abundant args 2 6 args as features in microbial source tracking modeling of microbial source tracking mst was conducted in r using random forest rf classification feast and sourcetracker respectively for rf classification and sourcetracker analysis the leave one out test with five runs was applied on training datasets n 862 which is half of the samples randomly selected and default parameters were applied on model construction i e rf the number of trees grown was set as 500 while the number of predictor samples for splitting at each node was set as 109 liaw and wiener 2014 sourcetracker burnin 100 nrestarts 10 alpha 0 001 beta 0 01 rare fraction depth 1000 knights et al 2011 the rest of the samples n 861 were applied as the test dataset in assessing the prediction performance for each query sink sample the predictive proportions of 13 habitats with one additional unknown source were calculated and the source with the highest proportion was assigned as the predicted source the average predicted proportion of samples from each habitat with the premise of correct predicted sources was treated as the general prediction precision for that habitat standard deviation sd was also calculated across the samples within each habitat for feast the default number of estimation maximization iterations 1000 was used and the same list of sources for all source sink assignments shenhav et al 2019 the leave one out approach was applied to assess the prediction performance of feast i e when one sample was chosen as the test sink the rest of the samples n 1722 were treated as sources to calculate the contributing proportions then the sum of the proportion within the same habitat was calculated to represent the proportion of that habitat and the predicted source of this test sample is the habitat with the highest predictive proportion 3 results 3 1 global distribution of args metagenomic datasets n 1723 from diverse habitats were collected from 102 independent studies representing 8 geographical regions covering 83 countries fig 1 a b the habitats were classified into 13 categories including chicken feces cattle feces swine feces human feces municipal sewage industrial wwtps municipal wwtps soil landfill drinking water natural sediment natural water and marine water samples were distributed in seven continents asia north america south america europe africa australia and antarctica and covered both high income e g u s u k germany japan and low income e g nigeria senegal countries regions the marine water samples were collected from tara oceans expedition and the ocean sampling day consortium there were more municipal wwtps n 328 natural sediment n 280 soil n 198 and marine water n 193 than other metagenomes available which may lead to potential biases however rarefaction curves of the number of detected arg subtypes almost reached the plateau for some of the studied habitats and clearly displayed the distinction of arg diversity in these habitats fig 1c indicating the sufficient sequencing depth of this collection for characterizing habitat features thus the currently available resources were utilized in the best practice in this study to decipher the distinction and association of arg profiles abundance and diversity in various habitats across the globe the total resistome abundance varied across habitats ranging from 0 42 to 5 55 copies of args per cell fig 1d table s2 the highest resistome levels were found in chicken feces followed by swine feces and human feces while sewage samples were comparable to human feces in contrast to animal human associated samples natural habitats including soil natural water and natural sediment had relatively low levels of resistome and the lowest end of the abundance spectrum was marine water a similar trend of arg abundance levels in these habitats has been reported by previous studies ya et al he et al 2020 reviewed the resistome in livestock feces and found that arg abundance in chicken feces and pig feces are much higher than in hospital and municipal waste while cattle feces are similar to the arg abundance level of hospital and municipal waste bing et al li et al 2015 clustered ten typical environments into four groups with significantly different arg abundance the group with the most abundant args included livestock waste followed by the group including wwtp influent and human feces with a 0 5 1 order of magnitude decrease in total arg abundance which is consistent with this study a total of 2384 different arg subtypes out of 2842 reference subtypes were detected at least once in the 1723 metagenomes fig 1c among the detected args subtypes 2134 were identified from municipal sewage samples which were the habitats with the highest resistome diversity although their total resistome abundance was not the highest municipal wwtps also contained very diverse arg subtypes n 1334 than other habitats the sewage and the downstream treatment facilities were therefore considered as the most potential reservoirs of args which has also been highlighted by previous reports on a global collection of wwtp effluent samples yin et al 2021 and a long term sampling of wwtp activated sludges spanning nine years yin et al 2019 3 2 global diversity and clustering of resistome the resistome structures were distinct between different environments figs 2 and s2 revealed by the relative abundance percentage of arg types and subtypes livestock feces including chicken feces swine feces and cattle feces together with human feces had a high proportion of tetracycline resistance genes while soil samples had a higher proportion of vancomycin resistance genes compared with other habitats meantime multidrug resistance genes were observed as the dominant arg type in low arg abundant habitats including natural sediment and marine water municipal sewage and wwtp with the highest resistome diversity had an even distribution of multiple arg types including aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls multidrug sulfonamide and tetracycline results were different in the arg subtype level where twenty three arg subtypes accounted for more than 30 of the total abundance in fecal samples and sewage related samples and over 50 of natural samples we observed the dominant arg subtypes for different habitat categories e g tetw in livestock feces vanxo in soil macb in natural sediment marine water and baca in wwtp industrial wwtp drinking water natural water interestingly although livestock feces and marine water samples shared tetracycline resistance genes as the arg type with a high proportion they were featured by different tetracycline resistant subtypes i e tetw and tetp respectively to visualize the dissimilarity of different habitats coordinate analyses were conducted on the bray curtis dissimilarity of the relative abundance profile at the arg reference gene level in the 2d 3d pcoa those samples from the same habitat were clustered together although the collection covered several independent studies and diverse geographies fig 3 the overall explanation proportion in the three axes in 3d pcoa was summed up to 37 52 for discriminating the resistome among habitats there were sub clusters found for soil and natural sediment which were close to each other while another sub cluster was fecal samples including human feces chicken feces swine feces and cattle feces the sub cluster members had a relatively lower distance from each other compared with the distance to the rest habitats the clustering results demonstrated the obvious separation and connectivity of resistome structures across habitats the clustering of habitats was mainly attributed to several arg types including beta lactam multidrug tetracycline mls and vancomycin as shown by indicator analysis the indicator args were selected features in disentangling the datasets with different labels i e habitats in this study which outperformed the full arg profile or the list of dominant args in finding the true clusters a total of 51 indicator args were detected with the least indicator value of 0 16 efm 1 and the most indicator value of 0 96 tet 39 fig 4 and table s3 of note it was found that not all of the indicator args were among the most abundant fig 2b some less abundant arg subtypes for example fez 1 beta lactam rcp 1 beta lactam ecm 1 beta lactam vat b mls ole c mls and sul4 tetracycline were important gene markers to resolve different habitats 3 3 emerging mobilizable args mcr and tet x colistin resistance genes had long been regarded as chromosomally encoded genes before the discovery of mcr 1 which was carried by plasmids in escherichia coli isolated from a swine farm in china in 2015 liu et al 2016 since then the high prevalence of the mcr 1 genes was reported by studies on isolates from europe north america and africa mulvey et al 2016 tijet et al 2017 wang et al 2018 different from isolate based surveillance we quantified the mcr genes variants mcr 1 to mcr 9 on a global scale through metagenomes and results showed that 49 of studied samples were detected with mcr genes moreover we found the prevalence of mcr in a much broader range of habitats than in previous isolation based studies wang et al reported 92 of mcr 1 positive isolates from animals or humans while few were from environments wang et al 2018 this study showed that sewage and wwtp samples were dominant reservoirs with 97 and 71 of the samples detected with mcr genes respectively especially in europe countries fig 5 b surprisingly relatively low percentages in fecal samples e g 19 of chicken feces and 25 of human feces were detected with mcr genes table s4 moreover the total abundance of mcr genes ranged from 0 to 0 087 china copies per cell fig 5a martiny et al martiny et al 2022 reported different results that australia was detected with particularly higher mcr abundance than other countries which was doubted due to potential bias caused by lack of effective quality control of the raw data e g including datasets generated from different sequencing platforms and unqualified metagenomes of isolates or fragments similar results were found for emerging plasmid borne tet x genes including variants tet x3 tet x4 and tet x5 other tet x variants tet x tet x1 and tet x2 were not included for lack of evidence of plasmid borne activities although they also confer the tigecycline resistance our results showed a broad prevalence of mobilizable tet x in different continents and diverse habitats fig s3 totally 35 of studied samples were found with mobilizable tet x genes table s5 sewage 98 and wwtp 75 were reservoirs with a high percentage of detection different from mcr genes which were only detected in a limited number of swine feces and chicken feces mobilizable tet x was widely found in swine feces 90 where the tet x4 gene was originally discovered he et al 2019 to our knowledge this is the first study on global surveillance of mobilizable tet x across diverse ecosystems previous studies only considered limited countries or specific types of samples for example surveillance and source tracking of tet x in human microbiome samples zhang et al 2021b as well as phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis on isolates carrying tet x from clinical settings in china zhang et al 2020b 3 4 resistome and taxonomy association a total of 1789 bacterial genera were identified at least once in the metagenome but the alpha diversity at genus level exhibited clear distinction among different samples ranging from 15 samples categorized as human feces to 484 samples categorized as natural sediments the average alpha diversity of some habitats showed significant differences table s6 s7 a limited number of bacterial genera were found to be abundant fig s4 some of these dominant bacteria were widely distributed in most of the habitats for example streptomyces were detected in 12 out of all habitats other prevalent genera included aerobic e g pseudomonas e and anaerobic e g bifidobacteria bacteria by analyzing the bray curtis dissimilarity of bacterial taxonomic composition genus level clear separation was shown for different habitats which were similar to the clusters of the resistome fig s5 thus it was interesting to know the correlation between resistome and taxonomy which was furtherly estimated by procrustes analysis for each habitat fig 6 nine habitats were observed with a significant p 0 001 m2 0 35 correlation between args subtypes and bacterial genera composition including chicken feces swine feces human feces sewage wwtp soil natural water natural sediment and marine water however other habitats including drinking water and industrial wwtp were estimated with less correlation while cattle feces and landfill were biased in the analysis considering the limited number of metagenomes 3 5 source attribution prediction by mst tools except for the distinction features of resistome across different environments the relationship among them needs further exploration in fact the environmental sample as a sink usually is a mixture of multiple sources especially in contaminated environments for example the microbial profile in polluted surface water might be contributed by urban sewage and farm activities the microbial source tracking used for fecal contamination could be applied for predicting source attribution of arg pollution when taking the overall arg profile and the above mentioned features across diverse habitats into account li et al 2020 based on the abundance and diversity of resistome reported above the microbial source tracking models were constructed on the same collection of global data the prediction performance of three models was assessed and results showed that sourcetracker outperformed rf and feast in the resistome source tracking fig 7 eleven habitats were predicted with high precision 80 when applying sourcetracker while limited habitats were effectively predicted by rf n 3 or feast n 5 thus sourcetracker was more efficient in disentangling the source sink relationship of massive environmental metagenomic datasets with acceptable running time in contrast feast was low accuracy and highly time consuming which might be due to the dissimilarity of the community features of the samples and the large sample size applied in this environmental surveillance shenhav et al 2019 thus the sourcetracker stood out to be the best tool to implement resistom source tracking from diverse habitats and the model in this study with sourcetracker was named mst v2 0 for public access via https smile hku hk sargs to demonstrate the application of mst v2 0 the source tracking of arg pollution in river waters was conducted by reanalyzing metagenomic datasets from a series of samples along the yangtze river liu et al 2018 results showed there was a pollution gradient in the river the arg profile upstream of the river has 5 7 wwtps contribution 19 24 at the middle stream and 37 downstream while the main classifications of all these samples were natural water with 52 94 contribution fig s6 this demonstrates the reliability of the reference samples collected in mst v2 0 and the feasibility of this tool with high accuracy 4 discussion as crucial components under the one health concept environments are reservoirs and dissemination venues of a broad spectrum of args and arbs to understand the distinction and connectivity of resistome in different habitats including livestock feces human feces natural environments and others benchmarking of resistome analysis in these habitat categories is required the present study was significantly more comprehensive than previous reports concerning the environmental prevalence survey of resistomes li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a in particular this study especially covered hotspots of args like industrial wwtps and landfills even though the sample numbers were limited since the industrial wwtps and landfills have been reported to be critical reservoirs of args bengtsson palme et al 2019 zhai et al 2016 in fact more metagenomic datasets of these currently understudied habitats are needed in the future for a better representation of environmental samples importantly the characterization of specific habitats was for the first time achieved in this study for example we found that unlike other habitats with one or two dominant arg types municipal sewage and wwtps contain relatively more evenly distributed arg types including aminoglycoside bacitracin beta lactam mls multidrug sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes previous studies focusing on municipal wwtps also supported the observation of dominance of tetracycline and sulfonamide auerbach et al 2007 but did not highlight the features of even distribution of multiple dominant arg types as here the characteristics of wwtps with multiple dominant args might be the results of high biomass concentration diverse bacterial communities and active horizontal genetic transfers in activated sludges in wwtps additionally we found that all of the selected args for discriminating habitats were abundantly detected in sewage samples making sewage the most general reservoir of diverse args than other habitats in this study the distinction of arg abundance and diversity across various environments including arg hotspots under anthropogenic effects and other natural environments were compared the reason for the consistent result that the abundance of args is much higher in fecal samples and sewage related samples than in natural environments is the selection of resistance genes in clinical settings or feedlots with wide application of antibiotics zhang et al 2021a another reason may be the prevalence of pathogens in those arg reservoirs karkman et al 2019 per arg diversity the high possibility of horizontal gene transfer hgt with the accumulation of resistance genes in sewage and wwtp explains the much higher diversity of args in sewage and wwtp than in other samples yin et al yin et al 2019 reported a higher hgt potential in wwtp than in soil samples by estimating the hgt potential based on the distance of args and mges on complete genomes from the perspective of microbial source tracking samples were connected in a source sink relationship args in pollution sites can be tracked from possible sources while the attributions of different sources were calculated based on unique and common features between habitats our resistome mst v2 0 model provides a promising reference in resolving a sink sample with uncertain sources using 13 habitats as potential pollution sources indeed a collection of representative local sources will be the ideal solution for interpreting a locally polluted sample however the global tracking model also exhibited an excellent prediction performance in this study which excluded intra habitat geographical variance and thus featured more general inter habitat discriminatory characteristics than local collections thus the resistome mst v2 0 will facilitate the source tracking process especially when lacking local data we emphasize that a reliable collection of high quality datasets and standardized quantification of resistome are essential to accurately describe the arg profile in habitats both locally and globally ko et al pointed out that sensitivity specificity and standardization of an assay are critical considerations for metagenomic application on pathogen surveillance as well as antibiotic resistance control ko et al 2022 this study is an attempt to reduce the potential bias introduced by method variability from many aspects including sequencing methods dataset quality control bioinformatic workflow and classification of habitats a perspective in future studies of resistome surveillance will lie in the development of absolute quantification for resistome analysis across different sample types which takes microbial density into consideration thus opening up new avenues for arg control on the environmental dimension results of this study provide metagenomics derived evidence for a few observations in previous experiments which are based on traditional culture based methods for example we found that compared with other habitats natural environments had an unexpectedly higher proportion of various arg types including fosfomycin and trimethoprim resistance genes these genes were considered ancient as pawlowski et al pawlowski et al 2016 found that 70 of the cultured strains from lechuguilla cave isolated from human activities for approximately 4 million years were resistant to over three different antibiotic types including fosfomycin sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim the consistent findings with previous studies provide the promising scales that the proposed environmental benchmark from this study could be applied for future studies there has been international antibiotic resistance surveillance based on cultural isolates including glass which is actively conducted and updated who 2020 however metagenome collection has still been an important supplement to such environmental benchmark which has benefits in two aspects 1 broad coverage of various habitats is available in metagenome collection ransom et al 2020 2 bacterial communities characterized by metagenomes are not limited to culturable species klümper et al 2019 moreover as demonstrated by this study in surveying emerging mobilizable genes mcr and tet x when novel args continuously being discovered in the future the collection of metagenomes has great value in the fast screening of target genes in a broad spectrum of habitats globally 5 conclusions we found that wastewater and wastewater treatment works were characterized to be reservoirs of more diverse genotypes of args than any other habitats including human and livestock fecal samples while fecal samples were with higher arg abundance bacterial taxonomy composition was significantly correlated with resistome composition across most habitats a microbial source tracking model regarding resistome has been developed to mst v2 0 which can be applied in resistome pollution source prediction environmental surveys with standardized bioinformatic workflow proposed in this study help comprehensively understand the difference and connections among 13 habitats encompassing industrial urban agricultural and natural environments and spanning most continents and oceans the resistome features arg types subtypes indicator args and emerging mobilizable args mcr and tet x in these habitats were benchmarked via a

alb alc resulted in very slow floc formation and little turbidity removal in raw water with low concentrations of sulfate ions the performance of the hb pacl was inferior to that of normal basicity pacl nb pacl although the charge neutralization capacity of the hb pacl was higher rates of floc formation were strongly correlated with the rate of aluminum precipitation by hydrolysis reaction which was identified as an indicator for evaluating the compatibility of raw water with pacl treatment among the common ions in natural water the sulfate ion had the greatest ability to hydrolyze and precipitate pacl because of its divalency and tetrahedral structure this conclusion followed from experimental results showing similar effects for selenate and chromate ions as for sulfate ions and somewhat smaller effects for thiosulfate ions bicarbonate ions and natural organic matter affected pacl hydrolysis precipitation but chloride ions nitrate ions and cations had little effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation interestingly the abilities of sulfate ions to hydrolyze hb pacl and nb pacl were very similar but bicarbonate ions were less effective in hydrolyzing hb pacl than nb pacl and bicarbonate ions contributed little to the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl in raw water with normal alkalinity therefore sufficient coagulation with hb pacl therefore usually requires a certain concentration of sulfate ions in water to be treated the implication is that which anions are most influential to the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl and thus to pacl s coagulation ability depends on the constituents of the pacl graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrolysis basicity sulfate ion additive effect floc pacl data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coagulation flocculation is a fundamental process in water treatment and is applied worldwide as a pretreatment not only for traditional sedimentation rapid sand filtration but also for membrane filtration edzwald 2011 at the beginning of coagulation flocculation coagulant is dosed to destabilize particles during coagulation which plays an important role in the formation of floc particles and particle removal in subsequent processes such as sedimentation and filtration bratby 2016 among various types of inorganic coagulants polyaluminum chloride pacl which was first used as a coagulant in japan has been applied and is popular in water treatment worldwide the aluminum species in pacl is pre hydrolyzed and is produced in a way that gives it a high capacity for charge neutralization the fact that the interaction between pacl and substances to be removed can proceed effectively bratby 2016 leads to superior coagulation performance recently high basicity basicity 70 sulfated pacl has been developed and has rapidly become popular in japan because its use results in lower aluminum residuality in treated water higher removal efficiencies of natural organic matter nom and long term stability without the formation of precipitates during storage kimura et al 2013 furthermore compared with normal basicity 50 sulfated pacl high basicity pacl can attenuate transmembrane pressure rise more when it is applied in coagulation pretreatment before microfiltration kimura et al 2015 the market share of high basicity pacl indicates that it is becoming popular but for some raw water high basicity pacl may fail to outperform normal basicity pacl personal communication taki chemical co ltd 2019 in other countries and regions types of pacl similar to those used in japan are not always used the implication is that the pacl best suited for a local area depends on the characteristics of the raw water in that area however little attention has been focused on the relationship between pacl and raw water quality especially the concentrations of substances not targeted for removal on the other hand thorough studies of pacl coagulation performance have been conducted on the effects of the amount of pacl added hendricks 2016 letterman and yiacoumi 2010 and the mixing intensity after addition lin et al 2013 kan et al 2002 nakazawa et al 2018 there has also been a great deal of research on the properties of various types of pacls including their basicity and chemical composition in the case of non sulfated pacls the focus has been on aluminum polynuclear species kong et al 2021 lin et al 2008 liu et al 2021 matsui et al 1998 qu and liu 2004 tang et al 2015 wu et al 2007 yan et al 2007 these studies have led to the common understanding that pacls with high basicity contain al13 and or al30 species and are excellent coagulants because of the high charge neutralization capacities of these species however it is unclear whether this conclusion is true for all types of raw waters and the compatibility of pacls and raw water quality is not yet well understood with the exception of the compounds targeted in coagulation treatment because pacl and the conventional coagulant alum are hydrolyzing aluminum salts it is commonly understood that alkalinity is required for their hydrolysis and that hydrolysis produces the aluminum polynuclear species needed for coagulation high alkalinity of raw water therefore increases the efficiency of removal via coagulation with alum letterman et al 1979 yan et al 2008a in contrast saxena et al 2019 have reported that high alkalinity in water has little effect on particle removal via coagulation with high basicity pacl though they do not discuss the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon it has been reported that kegging type e al13 polycation which is said to be the active species in pacl needs to be hydrolyzed prior to interacting with colloidal particles to be removed by coagulation flocculation an et al 2021 among other anions commonly found in natural waters the effect of sulfate ions on alum coagulation was studied long ago miller 1925 it is known that the ph range of aluminum precipitation and the sweep coagulation of aluminum sulfate extends to more acidic side than those of aluminum chloride which attributed to the complexing of sulfate with aluminum hanna et al 1970 matijević and stryker 1966 letterman 2010 reports that sulfate ion of a certain concentration in water is required for coagulation at ph 6 while no sulfate ion is needed at ph 7 5 it is explained that sulfate ion destabilizes positively charged aluminum hydroxide possibly by surface ionization and site specific complex formation reactions edzwald 2011 the effect of sulfate ion on aluminum precipitation and is also reported elsewhere duan et al 2014 other researchers reports that sulfate ion in raw water increases the rate of floc formation snodgrass et al 1984 sricharoenchaikit and letterman 1987 xiao et al 2010 these studies have focused on conventional aluminum coagulants such as alum but there have been a limited number of studies related to the effect inorganic anions on pacl coagulation although it is known that sulfate ion content in pacl besides basicity influence the property and coagulation performance of pacl gao and yue 2005 nakazawa et al 2018 wang et al 2002 chu et al 2008 investigate the effect of sulfate ion on floc formation by pacl and report that floc formation is enhanced at low sulfate concentrations but is reduced at high sulfate concentrations however the conclusions was not clearly confirmed because of very limited experiments chen et al 2020 have examined the role of sulfate ions in removing superfine powdered activated carbon particles from water by coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration they have pointed out that the coagulation performance of high basicity pacl is highly dependent on the sulfate concentration in the raw water however the relevant mechanism and the effects of pacl types have not been fully studied the effect of ions other than sulfate in natural waters on pacl coagulation performance has not been fully investigated just as nitrate ions have little effect on coagulation by aluminum nitrate except at high concentrations hanna et al 1970 monovalent ions possibly have no effect on coagulation by pacl at normal concentrations in natural surface waters it is well known that phosphate forms precipitates with aluminum hanna et al 1970 and therefore the efficiency of removal via aluminum coagulation declines as the phosphate concentration increases cheng et al 2004 however the concentration of phosphate is rarely high enough in sources of drinking water to influence removal by an aluminum coagulant the effects of cations have rarely been investigated but long et al 2021 have pointed out that the binding affinity of ca2 and al3 facilitates formation of large flocs by pacl in summary although inorganic ions are the main dissolved species in natural waters their effects on the performances of pacls with different basicity and polymerization degree have not been systematically investigated because the concentrations of inorganic ions in surface waters are highly dependent on the type of soil and rock from which the minerals dissolved and entered a body of water nikanorov and brazhnikova 2009 they vary greatly worldwide and it is necessary to figure out compatibility between pacl and raw water the main objective of this study was to unravel the relationships between the concentrations of inorganic ions pacl precipitation by hydrolysis hydrolysis precipitation and coagulation performance specifically we investigated the effects of sulfate ions on the hydrolysis precipitation of two pacls with different basicities and the mechanism responsible for those effects measurements of hydrolysis precipitation rates were used to study the effects on pacl hydrolysis precipitation of common ions and nom as well as their combined effects natural waters were used to verify the relationship between ion concentrations in natural waters and coagulation performance 2 materials methods 2 1 coagulants we used sulfated pacl coagulants with high basicity hb 70 and normal basicity nb 50 taki chemical co ltd hyogo japan in this study we designated these as hb pacl and nb pacl respectively they were produced by the dissolution method described in sato and matsuda 2009 briefly nb pacl was produced by heating a mixture of alcl3 al2 so4 3 and al oh 3 hb pacl was producing from nb pacl by adding a sodium carbonate solution to raise the basicity to 70 at a temperature 85 c table s1 in the supplementary information si lists the basic properties of the pacl coagulants the characteristics of the pacl were analyzed by ferron assay colloid titration and 27al nmr analysis fig s1 si the details of these analytical methods are described

experiment coagulation experiments including flocculation and sedimentation processes were performed in a rectangular plastic beaker four liters of raw water were placed in the beaker and a predetermined volume of hcl or naoh 0 1 n was added to the water to bring the coagulation ph to 7 0 or 7 5 after 30 min of mixing pacl was added rapid mixing conducted at a g value of 600 s 1 for 40 s was followed by three stages of slow mixing at g values in chronological order of 50 s 1 for 170 s 20 s 1 for 170 s and 10 s 1 for 320 s during the rapid and slow mixing portions of water were withdrawn from the beaker and filtered through a 10 µm pore size membrane filter chen et al 2020 aluminum concentrations in the filtered water were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icpms 7700x agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa the time required to reduce the al concentration fourfold from the initial concentration calculation method explained in text s2 si and this one quarter concentration time was used as the index of the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation the one quarter concentration was chosen because it was considered important that most of the aluminum be hydrolyzed and precipitated after mixing the water was allowed to stand for 1 h for sedimentation the turbidities of the raw water and the supernatant after sedimentation were measured with a turbidity meter the zeta potentials of the water sampled after rapid mixing were measured with a zeta potential meter zetasizer nano zs malvern panalytical ltd almelo netherlands using a dip cell floc particle size was measured by using a particle size analyzer microtrac mt3300exii microtracbel corp osaka japan throughout the time of mixing water in the beaker was introduced into the analyzer by a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0 5 ml s a sufficiently slow speed to avoid floc breakage the outflow from the analyzer was discarded directly without circulation as an index of floc formation speed we used the time until the d50 median diameter of floc particles grew to 500 µm because the maximum d50 values were approximately 1 mm the size was set to 0 5 mm the time until the d50 grew to 500 µm and its 95 confidence interval were determined from the model fit chassagne 2021 by using minitab minitab llc pennsylvania usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrolysis precipitation rate as a performance index of coagulation and flocculation a previous study has revealed that the removability of superfine powdered activated carbon spac particles by coagulation and sedimentation varies greatly as a function of the basicity of pacl and the sulfate ion concentration of the raw water j 1 water and j 2 water fig s2 si chen et al 2020 for hb pacl the residual turbidity of the supernatant water was high in j 1 water low sulfate ion concentration but the residual turbidity was very low in j 2 water high sulfate ion concentration in contrast when nb pacl was applied the residual turbidity was low in both j 1 and j 2 water to confirm the universality of this phenomenon for the turbidity components not spac we conducted experiments using y m and t series waters because the j series water was consumed and we varied the amount of pacl added and the coagulation ph in addition to measuring the turbidity of the supernatant after sedimentation we measured floc particle size during rapid and slow mixing figs s3 and s4 because the sulfate ion concentrations in the y 1 and t 1 waters used in the experiment were low 0 06 mmol so4 2 l coagulation with hb pacl in these waters took more than 11 min to form floc particles with a d50 500 μm or did not form floc particles 500 μm fig 1 as a result the rate of removal of turbidity after sedimentation was also generally low fig 1 however because floc formation was faster in m 1 water with higher sulfate ion concentrations turbidity removal rates were higher when sufficient sulfate ions were added to the y 1 water which had the lowest concentration of ions to increase the concentration of sulfate ions to greater than 0 1 mmol l floc formation was faster and the rate of turbidity removal was higher in the case of nb pacl flocs with a d50 of 500 μm or greater were formed within 7 min in raw water with low as well as high sulfate ion concentrations and the turbidities of the supernatants were low on the weak alkaline side of ph 7 5 the coagulation ph at which pacls of high basicity excel kimura et al 2013 floc formation was faster than at ph 7 0 but floc formation still required a longer time if the sulfate ion concentration in the water was low 0 04 mmol l than with the nb pacl fig s5a si furthermore even when the dose was increased for hb pacl floc particles did not form in raw water with low sulfate ion concentrations and the rate of turbidity removal was low fig s6a b si therefore the reason why coagulation flocculation by hb pacl does not work well in raw water with low sulfate ion concentrations does not appear to be the insufficiency of its dose in contrast when the sulfate ion concentration in the raw water was high the rate of floc formation also increased with an increase of pacl dose fig s6c si as is normally observed because aluminum coagulants such as pacl consume alkalinity in the coagulation reaction bicarbonate ions may also have an effect on pacl coagulation and floc formation in nb pacl floc formation was faster in raw water with bicarbonate ion concentrations greater than 0 2 mmol l than in raw water with bicarbonate ion concentrations less than 0 2 mmol l and floc particles with d50s of 500 μm or more were formed in a shorter time fig 2 b the effect of bicarbonate ion concentration was not clearly apparent in hb pacl fig 2a overall the rate of floc formation depended on the raw water and in raw water with low concentrations of sulfate ions the rate of floc formation with hb pacl was inferior to that with nb pacl conventional indices of coagulant properties include the ferron distribution of al species the colloid charge and 27al nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the analytical results for the two pacls used in this study are shown in fig s1 si the ferron distribution panel a indicated that hb pacl had a higher content of alb alc which are generally regarded as the aluminum species with the highest charge neutralization capacity yan et al 2008b the colloid charge was actually higher for hb pacl than for nb pacl panel b the peak at 62 5 ppm in the 27al nmr spectrum panel c indicated that the concentration of kegging type e al13 polycations which have relatively high charge neutralization ability chen et al 2007 parker and bertsch 1992 sposito 1995 was higher in hb pacl than in nb pacl this superior charge neutralization ability of hb pacl suggests that it should be a better coagulant than nb pacl the zeta potential has commonly been used as an indicator of whether the neutralization of the particle charge necessary for coagulation is sufficient in our experiments we measured the zeta potential of the floc particles after rapid mixing for coagulation the zeta potentials of floc particles seemed closer to zero when they were formed by hb pacl than by nb pacl panel a of fig s7 si and the former particles were better destabilized because of the higher charge neutralization capacity of the hb pacl but hb pacl coagulation removed less turbidity than nb pacl coagulation even when hb pacl reduced the zeta potential of the flocs closer to zero than nb pacl floc formation took a longer time panel a the zeta potential could therefore not explain why the coagulation performance of hb pacl and nb pacl depended on the raw water and it was unclear why the charge neutralization mechanism was unrelated to the inferior coagulation performance of hb pacl compared with nb pacl when raw water with a low concentration of sulfate ions was treated in contrast moderate correlations were apparent between the zeta potential and turbidity removal for each hb pacl and nb pacl panel b of fig s7 si however the rates of turbidity removal by hb pacl and nb pacl were very different even when the zeta potentials were the same although charge neutralization as measured by the zeta potential is still a necessary requirement for coagulation by hb pacl and nb pacl comparison of the turbidity removal abilities of hb pacl and nb pacl is not possible based on zeta potential alone a previous study dealing with coagulation of superfine powdered activated carbon particles chen et al 2020 mentions an al hydrolysis precipitation reaction and proposes that the change of dissolved al concentration which is related to the polymerization of aluminum species is a key property besides charge neutralization capacity for proper coagulation including formation of large floc particles chu et al 2008 indicate that zeta potential is not the only indicator for the coagulant efficiency when aluminum precipitation significantly improves coagulation an et al 2021 also mention the importance of hydrolysis and have reported that al13 polycation hydrolyzes while retaining its structure in this study we used one quarter concentration time the time required to reduce the soluble precisely 10 μm or less in particle size al concentration fourfold from the initial concentration as described in section 2 3 as the index of the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation as shown in fig 3 when the rate of floc formation was slow a long time was required for the floc to grow to a size of 500 µm the one quarter concentration time was long the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation was slow the rates of floc formation which depended on the type of coagulant hb pacl or nb pacl and dose water quality sulfate and bicarbonate ion concentrations and ph were correlated to the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation r 2 0 614 the correlation became somewhat stronger r 2 0 672 when we omitted the datum associated with the lowest dose 1 5 mg l which resulted in low particle charge neutralization fig s8 si hydrolysis of aluminum was therefore found to be an important factor for floc formation the rate of turbidity removal was also measured and the results are shown in fig s9 si low turbidity removal 70 was observed when the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation were slow the one quarter concentration time exceeded 30 s or the zeta potential was lower than 5 mv fig s7b si in summary the dependence of coagulation performance on pacl type and water quality sulfate ion concentration was related to the hydrolysis precipitation of aluminum species in the pacl the rate of hydrolysis precipitation was identified as an indicator that could be used to evaluate the compatibility of the raw water with high basicity pacl furthermore the fact that there was no difference in the hydrolysis of pacl when looking at solubility insolubility around 1 μm which is usually used or at 0 1 μm in the colloidal region chen et al 2020 and that the hydrolysis precipitation index by concentration passing 10 μm was valid in this study suggests that the effect of aluminum hydrolysis precipitation on floc formation is different from that of charge neutralization by colloidal aluminum polymers the former is probably a main indicator of sweep flocculation while the latter is that of charge neutralization coagulation therefore even though the aluminum distribution by the ferron assay which is an indicator of the amount of highly charge neutralizing poly nuclear species contained in pacl are the same the difference in hydrolysis precipitation chen et al 2020 is due to the fact that the charge neutralization and the hydrolysis precipitation are looking at different properties of pacl 3 2 effects of inorganic ions and natural organic matter we investigated the effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation of inorganic ions commonly found in natural water including sulfate and bicarbonate ions by using artificial waters containing one major anion and one major cation each the time for the al concentration in the filtrate to decrease to one fourth of the original concentration one quarter concentration time was calculated from the experimental data and used as an index of the rate of hydrolysis precipitation as in section 3 1 if the rates of hydrolysis precipitation were very slow in the waters with monovalent ions and the one quarter concentration time was not obtainable the one quarter concentration time was calculated from the one half concentration time by using the linear relationship between the one half concentration time and one quarter concentration time text s2 and fig s10 si fig 4 shows the one quarter concentration times of pacl hydrolysis precipitation plotted against anion concentrations bicarbonate ions hydrolyzed both hb pacl and nb pacl at higher concentrations than sulfate ions much higher concentrations of chloride and nitrate ions were required to hydrolyze hb pacl and nb pacl the concentrations of sulfate bicarbonate chloride and nitrate ions required for a one quarter concentration time of 60 s for hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl were approximately 0 174 2 20 34 and 42 mmol l those of nb pacl were 0 168 1 00 14 and 12 mmol l respectively table 1 because such high chloride and nitrate ion concentrations are not normally found in natural river waters nitrate and chloride ions do not have a substantial effect on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl in river water the bicarbonate ion concentration of 1 0 mmol l corresponding to an alkalinity of 1 meq l required for hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl was similar to the concentrations sometimes observed in natural surface waters the bicarbonate concentration required for hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl 2 20 mmol l was relatively high therefore the bicarbonate ion concentration of 0 1 0 8 mmol l corresponding to an alkalinity of 0 1 0 8 meq l observed in the natural surface waters we used would contribute to the hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl but contribute to a much lesser extent to the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl this conclusion explains why the effect of bicarbonate was more clearly apparent in the formation of floc particles by nb pacl than hb pacl fig 2 in section 3 1 the concentrations of sulfate ions required for hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl and hb pacl also differed but the difference 0 174 vs 0 168 mmol l was not large compared with the difference of bicarbonate ion concentrations 2 20 vs 1 00 mmol l therefore the reason for the poor performance of hb pacl in water with low sulfate ion concentrations was partly the high concentration of sulfate ions required for the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl but mainly the small contribution of bicarbonate ions to the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl conversely because bicarbonate ions contribute to the hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl hydrolysis precipitation proceeds satisfactorily even in water with a low concentration of sulfate ions and nb pacl is a better coagulant than hb pacl in water with a low concentration of sulfate ions section 3 1 furthermore a review of previous data chen et al 2020 revealed that pacl produced by high temperature heating and base titration requires 3 times the concentration of sulfate ions for hydrolysis precipitation and floc formation than hb pacl produced by the widely and commercially applied dissolution method even at the same basicity this difference suggests that the effect of anions on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl i e which ion hydrolyzes each component in the pacl influences the suitability of pacl for raw water this study revealed that hb pacl which contains a larger amount of alb alc and thus have has a high charge neutralization capacity than nb pacl is not easily hydrolyzed by bicarbonate ions and requires a higher concentration of sulfate ions than nb pacl if various types of pacl are manufactured sold and used around the world jiang 2001 wang et al 2017 zouboulis and tzoupanos 2010 and if each of them is suitable for a region the diversity of pacls may be related to the anion concentrations in the raw water bicarbonate ions were about 11 times more effective than nitrate and chloride ions in promoting hydrolysis precipitation because the concentration of carbonate ions is 1 of the concentration of bicarbonate ions at the experimental ph of 7 0 its effect would be small compared to that of bicarbonate because the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl consumes alkalinity bicarbonate ions play a role as a source of alkalinity bratby 2016 dousma and de bruyn 1978 and their influence is thus likely to be greater than that of monovalent ions such as chloride ions the sulfate ion was 200 times more effective than chloride and nitrate ions in hydrolyzing pacl it was also 6 times more effective than the bicarbonate ion this difference was not eliminated by basing the calculations on ionic strengths rather than molar concentrations the effect of the sulfate ion on aluminum coagulant including pacl performance is explained by its capacity to neutralize the positive charge of hydrolyzing colloids of aluminum edzwald 2011 however there is roughly a 60 fold difference in the relative effectiveness of charge neutralization by divalent ions compared with monovalent ions according to the schulze hardy rule bratby 2016 but less than a 60 fold difference according to the modified schulze hardy rules by the dlvo theory of the electric double layer rakshit et al 2021 the relative effectiveness on the critical coagulation concentration has been reported to be around 60 or less nowicki and nowicka 1994 these values are still smaller than the observed relative effectiveness of pacl hydrolysis precipitation 200 the charge neutralization mechanism on the basis of these rules is therefore insufficient to explain the effect of sulfate chloride and nitrate ions on pacl hydrolysis precipitation the effects of cations were also investigated by using waters containing sulfate ion as the major counter anion as shown in fig s11 si the rate of hydrolysis precipitation was not influenced by whether the counter cation was na or ca2 k and mg2 slightly retarded the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl compared with na or ca2 whereas k mg2 na and ca2 did not have any effect on the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl because k and mg2 are not as abundant as na or ca2 in normal natural river water and the effects of cation type are much smaller than those of anion type the types of cations would not be expected to substantially affect pacl hydrolysis precipitation because it is commonly known that nom affects coagulation performance we investigated its role in pacl hydrolysis precipitation we conducted a test of hydrolysis precipitation rates by using artificial waters with the same nom srnom and different doc concentrations the results for hb pacl and nb pacl are shown in fig s12 si rates of hydrolysis precipitation were slower in waters with lower nom concentration and the presence of nom accelerated the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl these results may be related to the fact that nom is a target compound for coagulation treatment and reacts with pacl coagulants to form precipitates at the same doc concentration hb pacl was hydrolyzed at a slower rate longer one quarter concentration time than nb pacl a trend consistent with the results for anions including sulfate ions section 3 1 although the doc concentrations required for hydrolysis precipitation were not very high 1 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l for hb pacl and nb pacl respectively for a one quarter concentration time of 60 s surface waters with doc concentrations lower than 1 0 mg l are not uncommon in japan for such water the ionic composition required for pacl hydrolysis precipitation is key for floc formation when hb pacl is applied in contrast the influence of the nature of the nom must not be forgotten chromophoric nom with high specific ultraviolet absorbance values is removed by aluminum coagulation but non chromophoric nom is less amenable to removal archer and singer 2006 edwards 1997 edzwald 2011 ou et al 2014 therefore uv absorbance is considered more suitable than the concentration of doc as a metric of the concentration of nom that affects the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation this is discussed further in section 3 4 the mechanisms responsible for the effects of nom and anions on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl would be expected to differ the correlation between the one half and the one quarter concentration times regardless of anion species suggests that anions accelerate the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of pacl by the same mechanism al concentration vs time fig s10 si in contrast the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl by nom followed a different trend from hydrolysis precipitation by anions because the relationship between the half lives and one quarter concentration times in the case of hydrolysis precipitation by nom differed significantly from the relationship for hydrolysis precipitation by anions fig s13 si the fact that the initial rate of the hydrolysis precipitation reaction was very rapid in the presence of nom compared with the rate in the absence of nom text s2 was probably due to the direct reaction of nom with pacl barrett et al 2000 bratby 2016 edzwald 1993 yue et al 2021 this study did not examine in depth the detailed properties of nom and its stoichiometric relationship to hydrolysis precipitation because such an examination would have been beyond the scope of this study hussain et al 2013 li et al 2021 su et al 2017 but it should definitely be a subject of future research 3 3 effect of sulfate ions and its mechanism to further clarify the mechanism by which sulfate ions accelerate pacl hydrolysis precipitation and improve coagulation performance we selected three other oxo anions the selenate ion seo4 2 thiosulfate ion s2o3 2 and chromate ion cro4 2 that have the same valency and or similar structure to sulfate ion and we investigated their abilities to accelerate pacl hydrolysis precipitation fig 5 shows the relationship between the one quarter concentration times and the concentrations of anions in raw water for the rates of hydrolysis precipitation of both hb pacl and nb pacl water containing chromate ions or selenate ions was as effective as water containing sulfate ions panel b in fig 5 the effect of thiosulfate ions was somewhat smaller than that of sulfate ions but the difference was much smaller than the difference between sulfate ions and monovalent ions chloride nitrate and bicarbonate ions the main reason for the effect of sulfate ions on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl therefore seemed to be its divalency but the effect was not explained solely by the electric double layer theory that divalent ions are more effective as mentioned in section 3 2 the difference between the effects of sulfate ions and thiosulfate ions on the rate of hydrolysis precipitation indicates that the effect of sulfate ions is not due only to their divalency there is another property of sulfate ions that affects pacl hydrolysis precipitation a possible explanation is related to their pka2 which reflects the tendency of the ion to keep a proton h a lower pka2 value means that the ion tends to donate a proton among the four anions the thiosulfate ion which had the least effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation has the lowest pka2 however the chromate ion has the largest pka2 but had an effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation similar to that of the sulfate and selenate ions fig s14 si sulfate selenate and chromate ions have a similar structure consisting of a central atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement whereas the thiosulfate ion is a sulfate ion with one oxygen replaced by sulfur the effect on hydrolysis precipitation may therefore be related not only to the valence but also to the structure of the anion duan et al 2014 have mentioned that sulfate ions chemically bound to an al precipitate increase its negative surface charge and thereby prompt the aggregation of precipitates because of their structure sulfate ions would chemisorb onto colloidal aluminum species and thereby effectively neutralize their charge and promote further hydrolysis precipitation and the formation of coarse aluminum colloidal aggregates this supports the possibility that sulfate ions form complexes with aluminum hanna et al 1970 matijević and stryker 1966 this process could result in sulfate ions promoting hydrolysis precipitation of pacl more efficiently than the schulze hardy rule predicted by dlvo theory 3 4 effect of sulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom mixture the simultaneous effects of anions and nom in water need to be considered because natural waters contain a variety of ions not just cation anion pairs as described in section 3 2 because sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom had the largest effects on pacl hydrolysis precipitation we investigated their synergistic additive effects chloride and nitrate ions were omitted from this study because they affected pacl hydrolysis precipitation only at concentrations much higher than those found in surface waters the fact that increasing the concentration of either sulfate ions bicarbonate ions or nom shortened the one quarter concentration time of hydrolysis precipitation figs s15 and s16 si indicated that the rate of hydrolysis precipitation had increased increasing the concentrations of both sulfate and bicarbonate ions led to a much shorter one quarter concentration time than increasing the concentration of sulfate or bicarbonate ions separately we therefore analyzed the experimental data on the assumption that the effects of sulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom were additive table 1 summarizes the concentrations required for a one quarter concentration time of 60 s see section 3 2 if the effects of sulfate ion bicarbonate ion and nom are additive the total concentration of the components affecting the hydrolysis precipitation rate can be expressed in terms of the sulfate ion concentration by the following equation 1 c s e c s a c b c b c n o m here c s e is the sulfate ion equivalent concentration for the overall effect of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom mmol l c s c b c and c n o m are the concentrations of sulfate ions mmol l bicarbonate ions mmol l and nom cm 1 uv absorbance at 260 nm was used as a measure of the nom that reacts with pacl the parameter a is the ratio of the effects of bicarbonate ions to sulfate ions and b is the corresponding ratio of the effects of nom to sulfate ions table 1 shows the values of a and b we then obtained fig 6 by plotting the one quarter concentration times for pacl hydrolysis precipitation versus the c se values of the water despite the various concentrations of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom the data appear to reflect a single relationship the values for one quarter concentration times of less than 5 s were scattered and imprecise because the aluminum concentrations decreased rapidly the results shown in fig 6 indicate that the effects of sulfate ion bicarbonate ion and nom on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl vary greatly but the interactions between the effects are additive the graph shows that the rate of hydrolysis precipitation begins to decrease when the c se falls below 0 2 mmol l incidentally when the doc concentration was used instead of uv260 as the metric of the nom concentration the functional relationship shown in fig 6 was not obtained fig s17 si this confirms that uv260 is more appropriate as the concentration of nom that reacts with pacl and promotes hydrolysis precipitation using the a and b values we analyzed the contributions of sulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom to c s e and the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl and nb pacl in t 1 and t 2 waters fig 7 the reciprocal of the one quarter concentration times for hydrolysis precipitation when hb pacl was added to the t 1 water was 0 007 s 1 sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom were estimated to contribute 47 21 and 32 respectively to the hydrolysis precipitation in t 2 water in which the concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate ions were higher the reciprocal one quarter concentration time was 0 063 s 1 for hb pacl and the contributions of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom to hydrolysis precipitation were 58 24 and 18 respectively in contrast when nb pacl was added to the t 1 water the reciprocal one quarter concentration was 0 043 s 1 and the contributions of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom to the hydrolysis precipitation were estimated to be 35 34 and 31 respectively in t 2 water the reciprocal one quarter concentration time for nb pacl was 0 22 s 1 and the corresponding contributions to hydrolysis precipitation were 44 39 and 17 respectively the much larger reciprocal one quarter concentration times for nb pacl versus hb pacl indicated that the former was much more effective than the latter use of eq 1 enabled us to determine the contribution of each component to the hydrolysis precipitation and thus to coagulation as well as how the contributions varied with the components in the raw water the main substances in the water that affected pacl hydrolysis precipitation were sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom these substances interacted additively to enhance the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl this additive interaction may have led to better pacl coagulation performance but the enhancement depended on whether the pacl was a hb pacl or nb pacl we then used natural waters y series containing different concentrations of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom to verify that the effects on coagulation flocculation and sedimentation were in all cases additive the flocculation time the time for the d50 of floc particles to reach 500 μm was strongly correlated with the sulfate ion equivalent concentration for the overall effect of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom by uv260 as shown in fig 8 note as shown in fig 18s no correlations were obtained for c se doc which supports that some nom sensitive to uv is more effective for hydrolysis precipitation of pacl than the entire nom measured by doc the c s e was therefore a useful metric of the effectiveness of a pacl coagulant in this study it was shown that high basicity pacl in which the polymerization of aluminum is more advanced than that of normal basicity pacl is difficult to hydrolyze and therefore pacl hydrolysis is important for the coagulation flocculation by the pacl in addition to neutralizing the charge on the particles to be removed anions such as sulfate ion are important for the hydrolysis of pacl on the other hand it has been reported that mixing intensity during rapid mixing for coagulation process is important for high basicity pacl nakazawa et al 2018 so it is also important to study how physical condition such as mixing intensity and water temperature affect pacl hydrolysis precipitation we feel the high intensity mixing promote the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl 4 conclusion this study comprehensively investigated the ability of ions commonly found in natural surface waters to increase the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of pacls and thereby reduce turbidity by enhancing coagulation and the formation of floc particles the rates of floc formation by pacls with different basicities and polymerization hb pacl and nb pacl varied as a function of the characteristics of the raw water those variations were related to the hydrolyzability of the pacls floc formation rates were strongly correlated with the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation hydrolysis precipitation of pacls was enhanced by sulfate selenate chromate thiosulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom sulfate selenate and chromate ions had 200 times greater ability to hydrolyze and precipitate pacl than chloride ions and nitrate ions this greater ability was attributable to both the divalency and tetrahedral structure of the sulfate ion which supports the possible mechanism of the complexing of sulfate with aluminum cations in the water had little effect on the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation the ability of bicarbonate ions to hydrolyze pacls was more than tenfold that of chloride and nitrate ions but much less than that of sulfate ions hb pacl was hydrolyzed more slowly than nb pacl in particular hb pacl was very slowly hydrolyzed by bicarbonate ions the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl needed for sufficient flocculation performance therefore required a certain concentration of sulfate ions in natural surface water in contrast because nb pacl was hydrolyzed to some extent by bicarbonate ions the concentration of sulfate ions required for hydrolysis precipitation was low and in practice was rarely insufficient sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom affected the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of pacl in an additive manner the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation were therefore described rather well by sulfate ion equivalent concentrations which represent the additive effects of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom the rate of floc formation was low when the sulfate ion equivalent concentration in the raw water was low in this study it was found that hydrolysis precipitation of pacl beside charge neutralization is necessary for coagulation flocculation sulfate ion bicarbonate ion and nom accelerate the hydrolysis precipitation but their effects are different depending on the type of pacl the effectiveness of pacl which has a high charge neutralization capacity due to its high content of alb and alc has been demonstrated in a number of papers however such pacl is difficult to hydrolyze in raw water with low sulfate ion concentrations resulting in poor coagulation flocculation since pacl is composed of a variety of aluminum polymeric species clarifying which aluminum species is hydrolyzed by which anion or nom and at what rate will undoubtedly be an important research theme in the future declaration of competing interest

14917,application of poly aluminum chloride pacl coagulant is a popular mode of water treatment worldwide because of the high capacity of pacl to neutralize charge the manufacture and use of pacls with various basicities in different regions around the world suggest that the characteristics of the raw water are important determinants of the efficacy of pacl application however attention has not been fully paid to the effects of water quality other than the substances to be removed in this study two typical pacls with different basicities were used to investigate why the performance of pacls depends on the characteristics of the raw water we focused on the concentrations of inorganic ions in the raw water use of high basicity pacl hb pacl with a high content of polymeric colloidal species alb alc resulted in very slow floc formation and little turbidity removal in raw water with low concentrations of sulfate ions the performance of the hb pacl was inferior to that of normal basicity pacl nb pacl although the charge neutralization capacity of the hb pacl was higher rates of floc formation were strongly correlated with the rate of aluminum precipitation by hydrolysis reaction which was identified as an indicator for evaluating the compatibility of raw water with pacl treatment among the common ions in natural water the sulfate ion had the greatest ability to hydrolyze and precipitate pacl because of its divalency and tetrahedral structure this conclusion followed from experimental results showing similar effects for selenate and chromate ions as for sulfate ions and somewhat smaller effects for thiosulfate ions bicarbonate ions and natural organic matter affected pacl hydrolysis precipitation but chloride ions nitrate ions and cations had little effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation interestingly the abilities of sulfate ions to hydrolyze hb pacl and nb pacl were very similar but bicarbonate ions were less effective in hydrolyzing hb pacl than nb pacl and bicarbonate ions contributed little to the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl in raw water with normal alkalinity therefore sufficient coagulation with hb pacl therefore usually requires a certain concentration of sulfate ions in water to be treated the implication is that which anions are most influential to the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl and thus to pacl s coagulation ability depends on the constituents of the pacl graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrolysis basicity sulfate ion additive effect floc pacl data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coagulation flocculation is a fundamental process in water treatment and is applied worldwide as a pretreatment not only for traditional sedimentation rapid sand filtration but also for membrane filtration edzwald 2011 at the beginning of coagulation flocculation coagulant is dosed to destabilize particles during coagulation which plays an important role in the formation of floc particles and particle removal in subsequent processes such as sedimentation and filtration bratby 2016 among various types of inorganic coagulants polyaluminum chloride pacl which was first used as a coagulant in japan has been applied and is popular in water treatment worldwide the aluminum species in pacl is pre hydrolyzed and is produced in a way that gives it a high capacity for charge neutralization the fact that the interaction between pacl and substances to be removed can proceed effectively bratby 2016 leads to superior coagulation performance recently high basicity basicity 70 sulfated pacl has been developed and has rapidly become popular in japan because its use results in lower aluminum residuality in treated water higher removal efficiencies of natural organic matter nom and long term stability without the formation of precipitates during storage kimura et al 2013 furthermore compared with normal basicity 50 sulfated pacl high basicity pacl can attenuate transmembrane pressure rise more when it is applied in coagulation pretreatment before microfiltration kimura et al 2015 the market share of high basicity pacl indicates that it is becoming popular but for some raw water high basicity pacl may fail to outperform normal basicity pacl personal communication taki chemical co ltd 2019 in other countries and regions types of pacl similar to those used in japan are not always used the implication is that the pacl best suited for a local area depends on the characteristics of the raw water in that area however little attention has been focused on the relationship between pacl and raw water quality especially the concentrations of substances not targeted for removal on the other hand thorough studies of pacl coagulation performance have been conducted on the effects of the amount of pacl added hendricks 2016 letterman and yiacoumi 2010 and the mixing intensity after addition lin et al 2013 kan et al 2002 nakazawa et al 2018 there has also been a great deal of research on the properties of various types of pacls including their basicity and chemical composition in the case of non sulfated pacls the focus has been on aluminum polynuclear species kong et al 2021 lin et al 2008 liu et al 2021 matsui et al 1998 qu and liu 2004 tang et al 2015 wu et al 2007 yan et al 2007 these studies have led to the common understanding that pacls with high basicity contain al13 and or al30 species and are excellent coagulants because of the high charge neutralization capacities of these species however it is unclear whether this conclusion is true for all types of raw waters and the compatibility of pacls and raw water quality is not yet well understood with the exception of the compounds targeted in coagulation treatment because pacl and the conventional coagulant alum are hydrolyzing aluminum salts it is commonly understood that alkalinity is required for their hydrolysis and that hydrolysis produces the aluminum polynuclear species needed for coagulation high alkalinity of raw water therefore increases the efficiency of removal via coagulation with alum letterman et al 1979 yan et al 2008a in contrast saxena et al 2019 have reported that high alkalinity in water has little effect on particle removal via coagulation with high basicity pacl though they do not discuss the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon it has been reported that kegging type e al13 polycation which is said to be the active species in pacl needs to be hydrolyzed prior to interacting with colloidal particles to be removed by coagulation flocculation an et al 2021 among other anions commonly found in natural waters the effect of sulfate ions on alum coagulation was studied long ago miller 1925 it is known that the ph range of aluminum precipitation and the sweep coagulation of aluminum sulfate extends to more acidic side than those of aluminum chloride which attributed to the complexing of sulfate with aluminum hanna et al 1970 matijević and stryker 1966 letterman 2010 reports that sulfate ion of a certain concentration in water is required for coagulation at ph 6 while no sulfate ion is needed at ph 7 5 it is explained that sulfate ion destabilizes positively charged aluminum hydroxide possibly by surface ionization and site specific complex formation reactions edzwald 2011 the effect of sulfate ion on aluminum precipitation and is also reported elsewhere duan et al 2014 other researchers reports that sulfate ion in raw water increases the rate of floc formation snodgrass et al 1984 sricharoenchaikit and letterman 1987 xiao et al 2010 these studies have focused on conventional aluminum coagulants such as alum but there have been a limited number of studies related to the effect inorganic anions on pacl coagulation although it is known that sulfate ion content in pacl besides basicity influence the property and coagulation performance of pacl gao and yue 2005 nakazawa et al 2018 wang et al 2002 chu et al 2008 investigate the effect of sulfate ion on floc formation by pacl and report that floc formation is enhanced at low sulfate concentrations but is reduced at high sulfate concentrations however the conclusions was not clearly confirmed because of very limited experiments chen et al 2020 have examined the role of sulfate ions in removing superfine powdered activated carbon particles from water by coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration they have pointed out that the coagulation performance of high basicity pacl is highly dependent on the sulfate concentration in the raw water however the relevant mechanism and the effects of pacl types have not been fully studied the effect of ions other than sulfate in natural waters on pacl coagulation performance has not been fully investigated just as nitrate ions have little effect on coagulation by aluminum nitrate except at high concentrations hanna et al 1970 monovalent ions possibly have no effect on coagulation by pacl at normal concentrations in natural surface waters it is well known that phosphate forms precipitates with aluminum hanna et al 1970 and therefore the efficiency of removal via aluminum coagulation declines as the phosphate concentration increases cheng et al 2004 however the concentration of phosphate is rarely high enough in sources of drinking water to influence removal by an aluminum coagulant the effects of cations have rarely been investigated but long et al 2021 have pointed out that the binding affinity of ca2 and al3 facilitates formation of large flocs by pacl in summary although inorganic ions are the main dissolved species in natural waters their effects on the performances of pacls with different basicity and polymerization degree have not been systematically investigated because the concentrations of inorganic ions in surface waters are highly dependent on the type of soil and rock from which the minerals dissolved and entered a body of water nikanorov and brazhnikova 2009 they vary greatly worldwide and it is necessary to figure out compatibility between pacl and raw water the main objective of this study was to unravel the relationships between the concentrations of inorganic ions pacl precipitation by hydrolysis hydrolysis precipitation and coagulation performance specifically we investigated the effects of sulfate ions on the hydrolysis precipitation of two pacls with different basicities and the mechanism responsible for those effects measurements of hydrolysis precipitation rates were used to study the effects on pacl hydrolysis precipitation of common ions and nom as well as their combined effects natural waters were used to verify the relationship between ion concentrations in natural waters and coagulation performance 2 materials methods 2 1 coagulants we used sulfated pacl coagulants with high basicity hb 70 and normal basicity nb 50 taki chemical co ltd hyogo japan in this study we designated these as hb pacl and nb pacl respectively they were produced by the dissolution method described in sato and matsuda 2009 briefly nb pacl was produced by heating a mixture of alcl3 al2 so4 3 and al oh 3 hb pacl was producing from nb pacl by adding a sodium carbonate solution to raise the basicity to 70 at a temperature 85 c table s1 in the supplementary information si lists the basic properties of the pacl coagulants the characteristics of the pacl were analyzed by ferron assay colloid titration and 27al nmr analysis fig s1 si the details of these analytical methods are described

through a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane filter φ90 mm 0 45 µm pore size toyo roshi kaisha ltd tokyo japan these waters were stored at 4 c prior to experiments which were begun after the temperature of the waters had returned to room temperature 20 c concentrations of ions in the water were measured by ion chromatography integrion and ics 1100 thermo scientific bremen germany at the experimental ph of 7 0 almost all the alkalinity is associated with bicarbonate ions the alkalinity was measured by titration with sulfuric acid 0 01 m h2so4 fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation

experiment coagulation experiments including flocculation and sedimentation processes were performed in a rectangular plastic beaker four liters of raw water were placed in the beaker and a predetermined volume of hcl or naoh 0 1 n was added to the water to bring the coagulation ph to 7 0 or 7 5 after 30 min of mixing pacl was added rapid mixing conducted at a g value of 600 s 1 for 40 s was followed by three stages of slow mixing at g values in chronological order of 50 s 1 for 170 s 20 s 1 for 170 s and 10 s 1 for 320 s during the rapid and slow mixing portions of water were withdrawn from the beaker and filtered through a 10 µm pore size membrane filter chen et al 2020 aluminum concentrations in the filtered water were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icpms 7700x agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa the time required to reduce the al concentration fourfold from the initial concentration calculation method explained in text s2 si and this one quarter concentration time was used as the index of the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation the one quarter concentration was chosen because it was considered important that most of the aluminum be hydrolyzed and precipitated after mixing the water was allowed to stand for 1 h for sedimentation the turbidities of the raw water and the supernatant after sedimentation were measured with a turbidity meter the zeta potentials of the water sampled after rapid mixing were measured with a zeta potential meter zetasizer nano zs malvern panalytical ltd almelo netherlands using a dip cell floc particle size was measured by using a particle size analyzer microtrac mt3300exii microtracbel corp osaka japan throughout the time of mixing water in the beaker was introduced into the analyzer by a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0 5 ml s a sufficiently slow speed to avoid floc breakage the outflow from the analyzer was discarded directly without circulation as an index of floc formation speed we used the time until the d50 median diameter of floc particles grew to 500 µm because the maximum d50 values were approximately 1 mm the size was set to 0 5 mm the time until the d50 grew to 500 µm and its 95 confidence interval were determined from the model fit chassagne 2021 by using minitab minitab llc pennsylvania usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrolysis precipitation rate as a performance index of coagulation and flocculation a previous study has revealed that the removability of superfine powdered activated carbon spac particles by coagulation and sedimentation varies greatly as a function of the basicity of pacl and the sulfate ion concentration of the raw water j 1 water and j 2 water fig s2 si chen et al 2020 for hb pacl the residual turbidity of the supernatant water was high in j 1 water low sulfate ion concentration but the residual turbidity was very low in j 2 water high sulfate ion concentration in contrast when nb pacl was applied the residual turbidity was low in both j 1 and j 2 water to confirm the universality of this phenomenon for the turbidity components not spac we conducted experiments using y m and t series waters because the j series water was consumed and we varied the amount of pacl added and the coagulation ph in addition to measuring the turbidity of the supernatant after sedimentation we measured floc particle size during rapid and slow mixing figs s3 and s4 because the sulfate ion concentrations in the y 1 and t 1 waters used in the experiment were low 0 06 mmol so4 2 l coagulation with hb pacl in these waters took more than 11 min to form floc particles with a d50 500 μm or did not form floc particles 500 μm fig 1 as a result the rate of removal of turbidity after sedimentation was also generally low fig 1 however because floc formation was faster in m 1 water with higher sulfate ion concentrations turbidity removal rates were higher when sufficient sulfate ions were added to the y 1 water which had the lowest concentration of ions to increase the concentration of sulfate ions to greater than 0 1 mmol l floc formation was faster and the rate of turbidity removal was higher in the case of nb pacl flocs with a d50 of 500 μm or greater were formed within 7 min in raw water with low as well as high sulfate ion concentrations and the turbidities of the supernatants were low on the weak alkaline side of ph 7 5 the coagulation ph at which pacls of high basicity excel kimura et al 2013 floc formation was faster than at ph 7 0 but floc formation still required a longer time if the sulfate ion concentration in the water was low 0 04 mmol l than with the nb pacl fig s5a si furthermore even when the dose was increased for hb pacl floc particles did not form in raw water with low sulfate ion concentrations and the rate of turbidity removal was low fig s6a b si therefore the reason why coagulation flocculation by hb pacl does not work well in raw water with low sulfate ion concentrations does not appear to be the insufficiency of its dose in contrast when the sulfate ion concentration in the raw water was high the rate of floc formation also increased with an increase of pacl dose fig s6c si as is normally observed because aluminum coagulants such as pacl consume alkalinity in the coagulation reaction bicarbonate ions may also have an effect on pacl coagulation and floc formation in nb pacl floc formation was faster in raw water with bicarbonate ion concentrations greater than 0 2 mmol l than in raw water with bicarbonate ion concentrations less than 0 2 mmol l and floc particles with d50s of 500 μm or more were formed in a shorter time fig 2 b the effect of bicarbonate ion concentration was not clearly apparent in hb pacl fig 2a overall the rate of floc formation depended on the raw water and in raw water with low concentrations of sulfate ions the rate of floc formation with hb pacl was inferior to that with nb pacl conventional indices of coagulant properties include the ferron distribution of al species the colloid charge and 27al nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the analytical results for the two pacls used in this study are shown in fig s1 si the ferron distribution panel a indicated that hb pacl had a higher content of alb alc which are generally regarded as the aluminum species with the highest charge neutralization capacity yan et al 2008b the colloid charge was actually higher for hb pacl than for nb pacl panel b the peak at 62 5 ppm in the 27al nmr spectrum panel c indicated that the concentration of kegging type e al13 polycations which have relatively high charge neutralization ability chen et al 2007 parker and bertsch 1992 sposito 1995 was higher in hb pacl than in nb pacl this superior charge neutralization ability of hb pacl suggests that it should be a better coagulant than nb pacl the zeta potential has commonly been used as an indicator of whether the neutralization of the particle charge necessary for coagulation is sufficient in our experiments we measured the zeta potential of the floc particles after rapid mixing for coagulation the zeta potentials of floc particles seemed closer to zero when they were formed by hb pacl than by nb pacl panel a of fig s7 si and the former particles were better destabilized because of the higher charge neutralization capacity of the hb pacl but hb pacl coagulation removed less turbidity than nb pacl coagulation even when hb pacl reduced the zeta potential of the flocs closer to zero than nb pacl floc formation took a longer time panel a the zeta potential could therefore not explain why the coagulation performance of hb pacl and nb pacl depended on the raw water and it was unclear why the charge neutralization mechanism was unrelated to the inferior coagulation performance of hb pacl compared with nb pacl when raw water with a low concentration of sulfate ions was treated in contrast moderate correlations were apparent between the zeta potential and turbidity removal for each hb pacl and nb pacl panel b of fig s7 si however the rates of turbidity removal by hb pacl and nb pacl were very different even when the zeta potentials were the same although charge neutralization as measured by the zeta potential is still a necessary requirement for coagulation by hb pacl and nb pacl comparison of the turbidity removal abilities of hb pacl and nb pacl is not possible based on zeta potential alone a previous study dealing with coagulation of superfine powdered activated carbon particles chen et al 2020 mentions an al hydrolysis precipitation reaction and proposes that the change of dissolved al concentration which is related to the polymerization of aluminum species is a key property besides charge neutralization capacity for proper coagulation including formation of large floc particles chu et al 2008 indicate that zeta potential is not the only indicator for the coagulant efficiency when aluminum precipitation significantly improves coagulation an et al 2021 also mention the importance of hydrolysis and have reported that al13 polycation hydrolyzes while retaining its structure in this study we used one quarter concentration time the time required to reduce the soluble precisely 10 μm or less in particle size al concentration fourfold from the initial concentration as described in section 2 3 as the index of the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation as shown in fig 3 when the rate of floc formation was slow a long time was required for the floc to grow to a size of 500 µm the one quarter concentration time was long the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation was slow the rates of floc formation which depended on the type of coagulant hb pacl or nb pacl and dose water quality sulfate and bicarbonate ion concentrations and ph were correlated to the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation r 2 0 614 the correlation became somewhat stronger r 2 0 672 when we omitted the datum associated with the lowest dose 1 5 mg l which resulted in low particle charge neutralization fig s8 si hydrolysis of aluminum was therefore found to be an important factor for floc formation the rate of turbidity removal was also measured and the results are shown in fig s9 si low turbidity removal 70 was observed when the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation were slow the one quarter concentration time exceeded 30 s or the zeta potential was lower than 5 mv fig s7b si in summary the dependence of coagulation performance on pacl type and water quality sulfate ion concentration was related to the hydrolysis precipitation of aluminum species in the pacl the rate of hydrolysis precipitation was identified as an indicator that could be used to evaluate the compatibility of the raw water with high basicity pacl furthermore the fact that there was no difference in the hydrolysis of pacl when looking at solubility insolubility around 1 μm which is usually used or at 0 1 μm in the colloidal region chen et al 2020 and that the hydrolysis precipitation index by concentration passing 10 μm was valid in this study suggests that the effect of aluminum hydrolysis precipitation on floc formation is different from that of charge neutralization by colloidal aluminum polymers the former is probably a main indicator of sweep flocculation while the latter is that of charge neutralization coagulation therefore even though the aluminum distribution by the ferron assay which is an indicator of the amount of highly charge neutralizing poly nuclear species contained in pacl are the same the difference in hydrolysis precipitation chen et al 2020 is due to the fact that the charge neutralization and the hydrolysis precipitation are looking at different properties of pacl 3 2 effects of inorganic ions and natural organic matter we investigated the effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation of inorganic ions commonly found in natural water including sulfate and bicarbonate ions by using artificial waters containing one major anion and one major cation each the time for the al concentration in the filtrate to decrease to one fourth of the original concentration one quarter concentration time was calculated from the experimental data and used as an index of the rate of hydrolysis precipitation as in section 3 1 if the rates of hydrolysis precipitation were very slow in the waters with monovalent ions and the one quarter concentration time was not obtainable the one quarter concentration time was calculated from the one half concentration time by using the linear relationship between the one half concentration time and one quarter concentration time text s2 and fig s10 si fig 4 shows the one quarter concentration times of pacl hydrolysis precipitation plotted against anion concentrations bicarbonate ions hydrolyzed both hb pacl and nb pacl at higher concentrations than sulfate ions much higher concentrations of chloride and nitrate ions were required to hydrolyze hb pacl and nb pacl the concentrations of sulfate bicarbonate chloride and nitrate ions required for a one quarter concentration time of 60 s for hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl were approximately 0 174 2 20 34 and 42 mmol l those of nb pacl were 0 168 1 00 14 and 12 mmol l respectively table 1 because such high chloride and nitrate ion concentrations are not normally found in natural river waters nitrate and chloride ions do not have a substantial effect on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl in river water the bicarbonate ion concentration of 1 0 mmol l corresponding to an alkalinity of 1 meq l required for hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl was similar to the concentrations sometimes observed in natural surface waters the bicarbonate concentration required for hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl 2 20 mmol l was relatively high therefore the bicarbonate ion concentration of 0 1 0 8 mmol l corresponding to an alkalinity of 0 1 0 8 meq l observed in the natural surface waters we used would contribute to the hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl but contribute to a much lesser extent to the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl this conclusion explains why the effect of bicarbonate was more clearly apparent in the formation of floc particles by nb pacl than hb pacl fig 2 in section 3 1 the concentrations of sulfate ions required for hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl and hb pacl also differed but the difference 0 174 vs 0 168 mmol l was not large compared with the difference of bicarbonate ion concentrations 2 20 vs 1 00 mmol l therefore the reason for the poor performance of hb pacl in water with low sulfate ion concentrations was partly the high concentration of sulfate ions required for the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl but mainly the small contribution of bicarbonate ions to the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl conversely because bicarbonate ions contribute to the hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl hydrolysis precipitation proceeds satisfactorily even in water with a low concentration of sulfate ions and nb pacl is a better coagulant than hb pacl in water with a low concentration of sulfate ions section 3 1 furthermore a review of previous data chen et al 2020 revealed that pacl produced by high temperature heating and base titration requires 3 times the concentration of sulfate ions for hydrolysis precipitation and floc formation than hb pacl produced by the widely and commercially applied dissolution method even at the same basicity this difference suggests that the effect of anions on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl i e which ion hydrolyzes each component in the pacl influences the suitability of pacl for raw water this study revealed that hb pacl which contains a larger amount of alb alc and thus have has a high charge neutralization capacity than nb pacl is not easily hydrolyzed by bicarbonate ions and requires a higher concentration of sulfate ions than nb pacl if various types of pacl are manufactured sold and used around the world jiang 2001 wang et al 2017 zouboulis and tzoupanos 2010 and if each of them is suitable for a region the diversity of pacls may be related to the anion concentrations in the raw water bicarbonate ions were about 11 times more effective than nitrate and chloride ions in promoting hydrolysis precipitation because the concentration of carbonate ions is 1 of the concentration of bicarbonate ions at the experimental ph of 7 0 its effect would be small compared to that of bicarbonate because the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl consumes alkalinity bicarbonate ions play a role as a source of alkalinity bratby 2016 dousma and de bruyn 1978 and their influence is thus likely to be greater than that of monovalent ions such as chloride ions the sulfate ion was 200 times more effective than chloride and nitrate ions in hydrolyzing pacl it was also 6 times more effective than the bicarbonate ion this difference was not eliminated by basing the calculations on ionic strengths rather than molar concentrations the effect of the sulfate ion on aluminum coagulant including pacl performance is explained by its capacity to neutralize the positive charge of hydrolyzing colloids of aluminum edzwald 2011 however there is roughly a 60 fold difference in the relative effectiveness of charge neutralization by divalent ions compared with monovalent ions according to the schulze hardy rule bratby 2016 but less than a 60 fold difference according to the modified schulze hardy rules by the dlvo theory of the electric double layer rakshit et al 2021 the relative effectiveness on the critical coagulation concentration has been reported to be around 60 or less nowicki and nowicka 1994 these values are still smaller than the observed relative effectiveness of pacl hydrolysis precipitation 200 the charge neutralization mechanism on the basis of these rules is therefore insufficient to explain the effect of sulfate chloride and nitrate ions on pacl hydrolysis precipitation the effects of cations were also investigated by using waters containing sulfate ion as the major counter anion as shown in fig s11 si the rate of hydrolysis precipitation was not influenced by whether the counter cation was na or ca2 k and mg2 slightly retarded the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl compared with na or ca2 whereas k mg2 na and ca2 did not have any effect on the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of nb pacl because k and mg2 are not as abundant as na or ca2 in normal natural river water and the effects of cation type are much smaller than those of anion type the types of cations would not be expected to substantially affect pacl hydrolysis precipitation because it is commonly known that nom affects coagulation performance we investigated its role in pacl hydrolysis precipitation we conducted a test of hydrolysis precipitation rates by using artificial waters with the same nom srnom and different doc concentrations the results for hb pacl and nb pacl are shown in fig s12 si rates of hydrolysis precipitation were slower in waters with lower nom concentration and the presence of nom accelerated the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl these results may be related to the fact that nom is a target compound for coagulation treatment and reacts with pacl coagulants to form precipitates at the same doc concentration hb pacl was hydrolyzed at a slower rate longer one quarter concentration time than nb pacl a trend consistent with the results for anions including sulfate ions section 3 1 although the doc concentrations required for hydrolysis precipitation were not very high 1 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l for hb pacl and nb pacl respectively for a one quarter concentration time of 60 s surface waters with doc concentrations lower than 1 0 mg l are not uncommon in japan for such water the ionic composition required for pacl hydrolysis precipitation is key for floc formation when hb pacl is applied in contrast the influence of the nature of the nom must not be forgotten chromophoric nom with high specific ultraviolet absorbance values is removed by aluminum coagulation but non chromophoric nom is less amenable to removal archer and singer 2006 edwards 1997 edzwald 2011 ou et al 2014 therefore uv absorbance is considered more suitable than the concentration of doc as a metric of the concentration of nom that affects the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation this is discussed further in section 3 4 the mechanisms responsible for the effects of nom and anions on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl would be expected to differ the correlation between the one half and the one quarter concentration times regardless of anion species suggests that anions accelerate the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of pacl by the same mechanism al concentration vs time fig s10 si in contrast the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl by nom followed a different trend from hydrolysis precipitation by anions because the relationship between the half lives and one quarter concentration times in the case of hydrolysis precipitation by nom differed significantly from the relationship for hydrolysis precipitation by anions fig s13 si the fact that the initial rate of the hydrolysis precipitation reaction was very rapid in the presence of nom compared with the rate in the absence of nom text s2 was probably due to the direct reaction of nom with pacl barrett et al 2000 bratby 2016 edzwald 1993 yue et al 2021 this study did not examine in depth the detailed properties of nom and its stoichiometric relationship to hydrolysis precipitation because such an examination would have been beyond the scope of this study hussain et al 2013 li et al 2021 su et al 2017 but it should definitely be a subject of future research 3 3 effect of sulfate ions and its mechanism to further clarify the mechanism by which sulfate ions accelerate pacl hydrolysis precipitation and improve coagulation performance we selected three other oxo anions the selenate ion seo4 2 thiosulfate ion s2o3 2 and chromate ion cro4 2 that have the same valency and or similar structure to sulfate ion and we investigated their abilities to accelerate pacl hydrolysis precipitation fig 5 shows the relationship between the one quarter concentration times and the concentrations of anions in raw water for the rates of hydrolysis precipitation of both hb pacl and nb pacl water containing chromate ions or selenate ions was as effective as water containing sulfate ions panel b in fig 5 the effect of thiosulfate ions was somewhat smaller than that of sulfate ions but the difference was much smaller than the difference between sulfate ions and monovalent ions chloride nitrate and bicarbonate ions the main reason for the effect of sulfate ions on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl therefore seemed to be its divalency but the effect was not explained solely by the electric double layer theory that divalent ions are more effective as mentioned in section 3 2 the difference between the effects of sulfate ions and thiosulfate ions on the rate of hydrolysis precipitation indicates that the effect of sulfate ions is not due only to their divalency there is another property of sulfate ions that affects pacl hydrolysis precipitation a possible explanation is related to their pka2 which reflects the tendency of the ion to keep a proton h a lower pka2 value means that the ion tends to donate a proton among the four anions the thiosulfate ion which had the least effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation has the lowest pka2 however the chromate ion has the largest pka2 but had an effect on pacl hydrolysis precipitation similar to that of the sulfate and selenate ions fig s14 si sulfate selenate and chromate ions have a similar structure consisting of a central atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement whereas the thiosulfate ion is a sulfate ion with one oxygen replaced by sulfur the effect on hydrolysis precipitation may therefore be related not only to the valence but also to the structure of the anion duan et al 2014 have mentioned that sulfate ions chemically bound to an al precipitate increase its negative surface charge and thereby prompt the aggregation of precipitates because of their structure sulfate ions would chemisorb onto colloidal aluminum species and thereby effectively neutralize their charge and promote further hydrolysis precipitation and the formation of coarse aluminum colloidal aggregates this supports the possibility that sulfate ions form complexes with aluminum hanna et al 1970 matijević and stryker 1966 this process could result in sulfate ions promoting hydrolysis precipitation of pacl more efficiently than the schulze hardy rule predicted by dlvo theory 3 4 effect of sulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom mixture the simultaneous effects of anions and nom in water need to be considered because natural waters contain a variety of ions not just cation anion pairs as described in section 3 2 because sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom had the largest effects on pacl hydrolysis precipitation we investigated their synergistic additive effects chloride and nitrate ions were omitted from this study because they affected pacl hydrolysis precipitation only at concentrations much higher than those found in surface waters the fact that increasing the concentration of either sulfate ions bicarbonate ions or nom shortened the one quarter concentration time of hydrolysis precipitation figs s15 and s16 si indicated that the rate of hydrolysis precipitation had increased increasing the concentrations of both sulfate and bicarbonate ions led to a much shorter one quarter concentration time than increasing the concentration of sulfate or bicarbonate ions separately we therefore analyzed the experimental data on the assumption that the effects of sulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom were additive table 1 summarizes the concentrations required for a one quarter concentration time of 60 s see section 3 2 if the effects of sulfate ion bicarbonate ion and nom are additive the total concentration of the components affecting the hydrolysis precipitation rate can be expressed in terms of the sulfate ion concentration by the following equation 1 c s e c s a c b c b c n o m here c s e is the sulfate ion equivalent concentration for the overall effect of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom mmol l c s c b c and c n o m are the concentrations of sulfate ions mmol l bicarbonate ions mmol l and nom cm 1 uv absorbance at 260 nm was used as a measure of the nom that reacts with pacl the parameter a is the ratio of the effects of bicarbonate ions to sulfate ions and b is the corresponding ratio of the effects of nom to sulfate ions table 1 shows the values of a and b we then obtained fig 6 by plotting the one quarter concentration times for pacl hydrolysis precipitation versus the c se values of the water despite the various concentrations of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom the data appear to reflect a single relationship the values for one quarter concentration times of less than 5 s were scattered and imprecise because the aluminum concentrations decreased rapidly the results shown in fig 6 indicate that the effects of sulfate ion bicarbonate ion and nom on the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl vary greatly but the interactions between the effects are additive the graph shows that the rate of hydrolysis precipitation begins to decrease when the c se falls below 0 2 mmol l incidentally when the doc concentration was used instead of uv260 as the metric of the nom concentration the functional relationship shown in fig 6 was not obtained fig s17 si this confirms that uv260 is more appropriate as the concentration of nom that reacts with pacl and promotes hydrolysis precipitation using the a and b values we analyzed the contributions of sulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom to c s e and the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl and nb pacl in t 1 and t 2 waters fig 7 the reciprocal of the one quarter concentration times for hydrolysis precipitation when hb pacl was added to the t 1 water was 0 007 s 1 sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom were estimated to contribute 47 21 and 32 respectively to the hydrolysis precipitation in t 2 water in which the concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate ions were higher the reciprocal one quarter concentration time was 0 063 s 1 for hb pacl and the contributions of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom to hydrolysis precipitation were 58 24 and 18 respectively in contrast when nb pacl was added to the t 1 water the reciprocal one quarter concentration was 0 043 s 1 and the contributions of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom to the hydrolysis precipitation were estimated to be 35 34 and 31 respectively in t 2 water the reciprocal one quarter concentration time for nb pacl was 0 22 s 1 and the corresponding contributions to hydrolysis precipitation were 44 39 and 17 respectively the much larger reciprocal one quarter concentration times for nb pacl versus hb pacl indicated that the former was much more effective than the latter use of eq 1 enabled us to determine the contribution of each component to the hydrolysis precipitation and thus to coagulation as well as how the contributions varied with the components in the raw water the main substances in the water that affected pacl hydrolysis precipitation were sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom these substances interacted additively to enhance the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl this additive interaction may have led to better pacl coagulation performance but the enhancement depended on whether the pacl was a hb pacl or nb pacl we then used natural waters y series containing different concentrations of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom to verify that the effects on coagulation flocculation and sedimentation were in all cases additive the flocculation time the time for the d50 of floc particles to reach 500 μm was strongly correlated with the sulfate ion equivalent concentration for the overall effect of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom by uv260 as shown in fig 8 note as shown in fig 18s no correlations were obtained for c se doc which supports that some nom sensitive to uv is more effective for hydrolysis precipitation of pacl than the entire nom measured by doc the c s e was therefore a useful metric of the effectiveness of a pacl coagulant in this study it was shown that high basicity pacl in which the polymerization of aluminum is more advanced than that of normal basicity pacl is difficult to hydrolyze and therefore pacl hydrolysis is important for the coagulation flocculation by the pacl in addition to neutralizing the charge on the particles to be removed anions such as sulfate ion are important for the hydrolysis of pacl on the other hand it has been reported that mixing intensity during rapid mixing for coagulation process is important for high basicity pacl nakazawa et al 2018 so it is also important to study how physical condition such as mixing intensity and water temperature affect pacl hydrolysis precipitation we feel the high intensity mixing promote the hydrolysis precipitation of pacl 4 conclusion this study comprehensively investigated the ability of ions commonly found in natural surface waters to increase the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of pacls and thereby reduce turbidity by enhancing coagulation and the formation of floc particles the rates of floc formation by pacls with different basicities and polymerization hb pacl and nb pacl varied as a function of the characteristics of the raw water those variations were related to the hydrolyzability of the pacls floc formation rates were strongly correlated with the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation hydrolysis precipitation of pacls was enhanced by sulfate selenate chromate thiosulfate and bicarbonate ions and nom sulfate selenate and chromate ions had 200 times greater ability to hydrolyze and precipitate pacl than chloride ions and nitrate ions this greater ability was attributable to both the divalency and tetrahedral structure of the sulfate ion which supports the possible mechanism of the complexing of sulfate with aluminum cations in the water had little effect on the rate of pacl hydrolysis precipitation the ability of bicarbonate ions to hydrolyze pacls was more than tenfold that of chloride and nitrate ions but much less than that of sulfate ions hb pacl was hydrolyzed more slowly than nb pacl in particular hb pacl was very slowly hydrolyzed by bicarbonate ions the hydrolysis precipitation of hb pacl needed for sufficient flocculation performance therefore required a certain concentration of sulfate ions in natural surface water in contrast because nb pacl was hydrolyzed to some extent by bicarbonate ions the concentration of sulfate ions required for hydrolysis precipitation was low and in practice was rarely insufficient sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom affected the rate of hydrolysis precipitation of pacl in an additive manner the rates of pacl hydrolysis precipitation were therefore described rather well by sulfate ion equivalent concentrations which represent the additive effects of sulfate ions bicarbonate ions and nom the rate of floc formation was low when the sulfate ion equivalent concentration in the raw water was low in this study it was found that hydrolysis precipitation of pacl beside charge neutralization is necessary for coagulation flocculation sulfate ion bicarbonate ion and nom accelerate the hydrolysis precipitation but their effects are different depending on the type of pacl the effectiveness of pacl which has a high charge neutralization capacity due to its high content of alb and alc has been demonstrated in a number of papers however such pacl is difficult to hydrolyze in raw water with low sulfate ion concentrations resulting in poor coagulation flocculation since pacl is composed of a variety of aluminum polymeric species clarifying which aluminum species is hydrolyzed by which anion or nom and at what rate will undoubtedly be an important research theme in the future declaration of competing interest

14918,land water transition areas play a significant role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems however anthropogenic pressures are posing severe threats on land water transition areas which leads to degradation of the ecological integrity of many lakes worldwide enhancing habitat complexity and heterogeneity by restoring land water transition areas in lake systems is deemed a suitable method to restore lakes bottom up by stimulating lower trophic levels stimulating productivity of lower trophic levels phytoplankton zooplankton generates important food sources for declining higher trophic levels fish birds here we study ecosystem restoration project marker wadden in lake markermeer the netherlands this project involved the construction of a 700 ha archipelago of five islands in a degrading shallow lake aiming to create additional sheltered land water transition areas to stimulate food web development from its base by improving phytoplankton quantity and quality we found that phytoplankton quantity chlorophyll a concentration and quality inversed carbon nutrient ratio in the shallow waters inside the marker wadden archipelago were significantly improved likely due to higher nutrient availabilities while light availability remained sufficient compared to the surrounding lake higher phytoplankton quantity and quality was positively correlated with zooplankton biomass which was higher inside the archipelago than in the surrounding lake due to improved trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton we conclude that creating new land water transition areas can be used to increase light and nutrient availabilities and thereby enhancing primary productivity which in turn can stimulate higher trophic levels in degrading aquatic ecosystems

décamps 1997 seekell et al 2021 strayer and findlay 2010 in freshwater ecosystems land water transition areas only account for a small fraction of the total lake area but contribute disproportionately to the overall biodiversity and ecosystem processes in lakes hampton et al 2011 scheffer et al 1993 vadeboncoeur et al 2011 vander zanden and vadeboncoeur 2020 for instance more than 93 of species including fish crustaceans insects and mollusks inhabit the nearshore littoral zone and 72 are completely restricted to the littoral zone in 14 of the world s largest lakes vadeboncoeur et al 2011 these important ecosystem services provided by land water transition areas are maintained due to the input of nutrients from the land the ample light available for primary production in these shallow waters and the habitat heterogeneity porst et al 2019 strayer and findlay 2010 wall et al 2001 anthropogenic pressures on land water transitions are one of the most severe threats to lakes and their ecological integrity worldwide miler et al 2013 porst et al 2019 2015 schmieder 2004 these human induced pressures including human settlement associated industry and recreational activities cause loss of natural habitats and overall habitat degradation which in turn leads to decreased higher trophic production due to decreased food quantity and quality brauns et al 2007 chhor et al 2020 mcgoff et al 2013 porst et al 2019 therefore enhancing habitat complexity and heterogeneity by adding land water transition areas to lake systems seems a suitable method to restore lakes and stimulate the production of higher trophic levels meerhoff and de los ángeles gonzález sagrario 2021 light and nutrients provide the energy and matter that enable food web production sterner et al 1997 elser et al 2007 gruner et al 2008 the relative availabilities of light and nutrients can alter primary producer elemental composition and thereby their nutritional value for higher trophic levels sterner et al 1997 sterner and elser 2002 specifically increased light availability may lead to a higher carbon nutrient stoichiometry in primary producers that can form a stoichiometric bottleneck for herbivores thereby lowering the transfer efficiency burian et al 2020 which in turn lead to a decline in higher trophic level production dickman et al 2008 urabe and sterner 1996 creating new land water transition areas can affect light and nutrient availability which may stimulate the aquatic food web from its base by increasing phytoplankton quantity and quality and the transfer of energy to zooplankton trophic transfer we studied these processes in ecosystem restoration project marker wadden in lake markermeer the netherlands fig 1 a b covering an area of 680 km2 lake markermeer the netherlands is among the largest shallow lakes in western europe phytoplankton production in this lake is at present thought to be nutrient limited brinkmann et al 2019 van riel et al 2019 whereas the lake is also subject to strong wind driven sediment resuspension leading to low light availabilities eleveld 2012 kelderman et al 2012 the food web in lake markermeer has experienced strong declines in higher trophic levels such as the numbers of fish and benthivorous and piscivorous birds over the last decades noordhuis 2014 these declines have been associated with reduced phytoplankton production and a lack of natural land water transition areas van riel et al 2019 fig 1c to improve the ecological integrity of this lake and increase the numbers of fish and birds a large scale ecosystem restoration project called the marker wadden started in 2016 van leeuwen et al 2021 this project involved the construction of a 700 ha archipelago of five islands in lake markermeer aiming to create sheltered land water transition areas where sediment can settle and light availability in the water column can increase fig 1d e the shorelines of the marker wadden archipelago connect water and land which may lead to increased nutrient availability by run off from the land particularly within the archipelago such land water transition areas are rare along the shores of lake markermeer where land and water are almost entirely disconnected by basalt dikes as such the restoration project is expected to simultaneously increase light and nutrient availability in the water column hence increasing phytoplankton biomass production and its nutritional quality for higher trophic levels in this study we assessed the impact of the marker wadden ecosystem restoration project on nutrient and light availabilities in the archipelago in comparison with the surrounding lake we tested the consequences for phytoplankton biomass production and carbon nutrient stoichiometry as well as zooplankton biomass production we specifically hypothesized that a phytoplankton biomass expressed as the chlorophyll a concentration in the water is higher in the marker wadden archipelago than in the surrounding lake and b phytoplankton nutritional quality expressed as the inverse of their carbon nutrient ratios is higher in the marker wadden archipelago than in the surrounding lake due to the improved nutrient and light availabilities we further hypothesized that c these improved phytoplankton biomass and its quality in marker wadden could facilitate the biomass build up of the zooplankton due to the d improved trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton compared to the surrounding lake to test our hypotheses we performed a field study at the marker wadden from may to december 2018 we measured chlorophyll a concentrations seston carbon nutrient stoichiometry nutrient concentrations in the water column light availability zooplankton biomass and suspended solids concentrations at selected locations in and around the marker wadden archipelago 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake markermeer is a 3 5 m deep mean depth 3 6 m 680 km2 delta lake located in

construction of a dam the houtribdijk in 1975 the lake is a protected area under the european bird directive following natura2000 legislation and has experienced declines in numbers of benthivorous

analysis the mean light availability expressed as a fraction of surface light was calculated by the following formula riley 1957 sterner et al 1997 where zm is the mixed depth as the lake is shallow

d 0 l n e d z z in which e d 0 and e d z represent the light intensities at the surface and at depth z respectively in our study z was measured at a water depth of 50 cm except for the shallowest parts were z represented the water depth with a minimum of 8 cm to assess differences between the locations inside and outside of the marker wadden archipelago in all the measured parameters we first averaged values per sampling location over the sampling season n 6 inside n 6 outside then we tested for a potential influence of spatial autocorrelation in the data by creating a distance based weight matrix with the dnearneigh function of the spdep package bivand et al 2013 this determined the nearest neighbours for all 12 sampling locations we used this matrix to perform moran s i tests with the moran test and moran mc functions to derive p values based on 999 monte carlo simulation permutations for each dependent variable after bonferroni correction for multiple testing on the 12 dependent variables cp cn and np ratios showed significant spatial autocorrelation as their test statistics were significantly different from random table s1 to account for the possible influence of spatial autocorrelation on our analyses we tested differences between the locations inside and outside the archipelago by means of generalized least squares gls analyses with and without correcting for spatial structures for each dependent variable we constructed six models with the binomial explanatory variable inside or outside and different possible spatial autocorrelation structures that we

wadden while cyanobacteria were more frequently found outside marker wadden compared to inside marker wadden over time fig s1 seston c p ratios were low and stable inside the marker wadden archipelago for the entire duration of the sampling period whereas seston c p ratios showed a pronounced summer peak outside of the archipelago fig 3b consequently mean c p ratios inside the archipelago were 2 7

were less pronounced fig 3c g seston n p ratios approximated the redfield ratio across locations inside the marker wadden archipelago suggesting balanced availability i e matching that of phytoplankton n p demands while these ratios were 2 2 fold higher in the surrounding lake fig 3d h indicating p limitation a similar pattern was found for total zooplankton biomass inside and outside marker wadden which peaked at the end of spring and summer fig 4 a total zooplankton biomass was generally 3 9 fold higher at locations inside the marker wadden archipelago compared to those outside of the marker wadden archipelago fig 4c twenty three zooplankton taxa were recorded over the sampling time including eight cladocera bosmina daphnia ceriodaphnia diaphanasoma chydorus leptodera alona and macrothrix two copepoda orders cyclopoida and calanoida and thirteen rotifera genera polyarthra brachionus keratella synchaeta asplanchna trichocerca hexarthra lecane kellicottia lepadella squatinella notholca and notommata trophic transfer efficiency was higher during the spring and early summer inside marker wadden compared with outside marker wadden fig 4b on average trophic transfer efficiency was 1 1 fold higher inside marker wadden compared to outside marker wadden fig 4d without applying the standard log10 transformations to the calculation of trophic transfer to enable across study comparisons the increase of phyto 1 8 fold and zooplankton 3 9 fold results in a 2 2 fold higher trophic transfer 4 discussion our results demonstrate that the shallow waters inside the marker wadden archipelago contained higher nutrient concentrations than the surrounding lake while light availability remained sufficient this combination increased the quantity and quality of phytoplankton at the base of the aquatic food web resulting in higher zooplankton biomass and higher trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton inside the marker wadden archipelago compared to the surrounding lake this shows that the creation of land water transition areas can lead to higher availabilities of light and nutrients thereby increasing the quantity and quality of primary productivity which in turn can stimulate transfer to higher trophic levels creating new land water transition areas in degraded homogeneous aquatic ecosystems can be broadly applied in an ecosystem restoration context 4 1 effects of ecosystem restoration on resources availabilities and phytoplankton ecosystem restoration resulted in higher tp and tn concentrations inside the marker wadden archipelago as compared to the surrounding lake this higher nutrient availability was accompanied with higher phytoplankton biomass and lower seston c p and c n which implies that both phytoplankton biomass and quality for higher trophic levels was improved by the restoration measures confirming our hypotheses a and b besides the phytoplankton was most of the time dominated by green algae inside the marker wadden while cyanobacteria dominated the surrounding lake generally green algae are more edible for zooplankton than cyanobacteria ger et al 2016 which may have further contributed to the increased zooplankton biomass and trophic transfer inside marker wadden the increased tn and tp concentrations inside marker wadden may be attributed to the higher sediment resuspension rates as indicated by the higher tss and iss concentrations inside marker wadden and the fact that the nutrient levels are very high in the lake sediment used for construction leading to higher mobilization and nutrient run off from the shores temmink et al 2021 the higher sediment resuspension rates inside marker wadden may well be attributed to the relatively lower water depth and contribution of small particles i e over 50 of particles 63 µm fig s2 which is more prone to be affected by wind despite the relatively sheltered conditions compared to the sampling points outside marker wadden sediment resuspension may result in higher nutrient availability for phytoplankton growth as has been demonstrated in lake markermeer brinkmann et al 2019 furthermore bioturbation induced by water birds such as avocets and coots and benthivorous fish such as carp may also have contributed to higher sediment resuspension and thereby higher nutrient availability inside marker wadden vanni 2002 following the sediment resuspension process high tss causes deteriorated light conditions indicated by a high light attenuation coefficient fig s3a b which potentially limits the growth of phytoplankton due to low light availability however the light availability for the phytoplankton is also mediated by the water depth the water depth across locations inside the marker wadden archipelago 1 2 1 0 m water depth was generally lower compared to the locations outside marker wadden 4 3 0 2 m this potentially compensated for the high light attenuation caused by the sediment resuspension process resulting in a suitable light climate for phytoplankton biomass build up besides causing an increase in the absolute amount of the nutrients sediment resuspension could also determine the relative availability of light and nutrients that also plays a vital role in regulating the phytoplankton biomass production specifically a balanced input of resources may support higher species diversity and thereby enhance resource use efficiencies and community productivity of phytoplankton hillebrand et al 2014 in contrast an unbalanced availability of light and nutrients may decrease phytoplankton diversity through enhanced competition cardinale et al 2009 this in turn is expected to reduce overall resource use efficiencies of the phytoplankton community which would also contribute to decreased phytoplankton biomass the higher phytoplankton biomass production may be attributed to balanced resource availabilities inside marker wadden which is further confirmed by the n p ratio that was close to 16 suggesting co limitation of n and p and or limitation by another factor lenton and watson 2000 redfield 1958 interestingly we found that phytoplankton biomass showed an increasing trend inside marker wadden from late june to early august while it showed a decreasing trend outside of marker wadden fig 3a this corresponded with both a seasonal increase in light availability and temperature fig 2i and fig s3c this positive effect of temperature on the phytoplankton biomass production only occurred where the nutrients were abundant hence inside marker wadden while a shortage of nutrient supply might result in a lack of response as observed outside marker wadden or even detrimental temperature effects verbeek et al 2018 schulhof et al 2019 moreover because organisms tend to be more sensitive to external factors in nutrient poor environments finger et al 2013 the increased light availability during this period may also pose a threat to phytoplankton biomass build up outside marker wadden indeed during the same period the c p ratio at location outside marker wadden showed a sharp increasing trend while it was stable across locations inside the marker wadden which further confirms the nutrient shortage for phytoplankton growth especially p outside marker wadden this is also suggested by the seston n p ratios outside marker wadden which were generally much higher as compared to the redfield ratio i e n p of 16 suggesting that p may limit phytoplankton growth inside marker wadden high p and n concentrations were observed in the water which were at the redfield ratio suggesting that both high p and n availability contributed to phytoplankton biomass production given that enough light was available as a result the overall higher p and n concentrations explain a consistently low seston c p and c n ratio inside marker wadden irrespective of alterations in tp tn and light availabilities 4 2 effects of restoration on zooplankton and trophic transfer efficiency following the improved phytoplankton quantity and quality inside of marker wadden we observed that total zooplankton biomass was significantly higher inside of marker wadden compared with outside of marker wadden confirming hypothesis c we also observed that biomass of copepods cladocerans and rotifers biomasses was generally higher at locations inside the marker wadden archipelago compared to those outside of the marker wadden archipelago fig s4 wind induced turbulence may facilitate zooplankton biomass build up through improved phytoplankton quantity and quality by increasing nutrient availability while it may inhibit zooplankton growth due to the increased inorganic suspended solids concentration that could mechanically interfere with food collection or dilute gut contents thereby resulting in less food being assimilated koenings et al 1990 visser and stips 2002 apparently the positive effect of improved food quantity and quality overrides the negative effect of increased inorganic suspended solids concentrations following the sediment resuspension thereby resulting in higher zooplankton biomass inside marker wadden besides zooplankton at the locations inside the marker wadden archipelago may benefit from the reduced wind induced turbulence which in turn may enhance zooplankton food detection or capture or directly prevent body damage g tóth et al 2011 peters and marrasé 2000 moreover the high turbidity inside marker wadden may release zooplankton from the fish predation especially from those species that locate prey visually gardner 1981 lehtiniemi et al 2004 furthermore the newly created habitat inside the marker wadden may harbor less fish in its initial stage resulting in higher zooplankton biomass inside the marker wadden compared with those outside of marker wadden archipelago due to low fish predation pressures carpenter et al 2016 hessen et al 2006 whether fish numbers inside the marker wadden is indeed lower however still needs to be investigated we observed that trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton was higher inside marker wadden compared to outside marker wadden particularly during spring which is largely in line with hypothesis d this higher trophic transfer efficiency inside of marker wadden is mainly caused by the generally higher biomass of copepods cladocerans and rotifers during this period inside marker wadden fig s4 the higher zooplankton biomass likely resulted from the improved phytoplankton quantity and quality due to the improved light and nutrient availability following the sediment resuspension process furthermore zooplankton may have benefitted from the benthic food chain that developed within the islands jin et al 2022a 2022b van leeuwen et al 2021 4 3 implications for lake management our study shows that the newly created land water transition areas in the marker wadden restoration project can increase nutrient availability improve phytoplankton quantity and quality and enhance trophic transfer efficiency from phytoplankton to zooplankton when they are sheltered from wind effect this knowledge can be used to guide lake restoration for instance to combat eutrophication oligotrophication following nutrient mitigation measures is increasingly applied as a restoration approach in freshwater systems worldwide sabel et al 2020 this was also the case for lake markermeer where nutrient concentrations showed a notable decline over the last decades noordhuis 2014 van riel et al 2019 however in many systems an unintended decline of higher trophic production like zooplankton john anderson et al 2005 and fish finger et al 2007 was observed to coincide with these nutrient reductions nutrient reduction reduces phytoplankton biomass production which increases water transparency and together these changes increase phytoplankton carbon nutrient ratios as a result higher trophic levels in lake ecosystems may suffer from both food quantity and quality shortage therefore ideally lake restoration measures are required to achieve both improved water quality while maintaining higher trophic production to achieve this adding land water transition areas to lakes in order to enhance habitat complexity and heterogeneity could complement other measures such as nutrient reduction and biomanipulation to restore lakes and stimulate the production of higher trophic levels hansson et al 1998 meerhoff and de los ángeles gonzález sagrario 2021 spears et al 2021 however caution is needed as these newly created habitats only work properly when they are relatively sheltered from wind effects suggesting that wind induced hydrological dynamics need to be considered in the first place blukacz et al 2010 jin et al 2022a kong et al 2017 moreover increased nutrient concentrations may also lead to shifts in the phytoplankton community composition and when this will enhance cyanobacterial biomass it may both reduce water quality and trophic transfer due to their poor edibility huisman et al 2018 marker wadden was created to improve the ecological status of lake markermeer which is a typical example of an artificially created shallow lake in which eutrophication has been halted due to the oligotrophication efforts but the fish and bird populations have been declining our study shows a strengthened interaction between phytoplankton and zooplankton in the initial stage from which higher trophic levels may profit moreover those newly created land water transition areas could support additional habitats for the colonization of more diverse types of primary producers i e submerged macrophytes and emergent vegetation which have been observed on marker wadden after 2018 jin et al 2022a 2022b that will further enhance habitat heterogeneity and may improve food availability consequently the recovery of diverse types of higher trophic level organisms will also be enhanced and maintained van leeuwen et al 2021 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that the marker wadden archipelago significantly improved phytoplankton quantity and quality due to improved nutrient availability in the water column with still sufficient light this improved phytoplankton quantity and quality facilitated zooplankton biomass build up inside the marker wadden and resulted in a higher trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton we conclude that creating new land water transition areas can be used to increase light and nutrient availabilities and thereby enhancing primary productivity which in turn can stimulate higher trophic levels in degrading aquatic ecosystems authors contribution hj and esb designed the experiment hj and esb acquired the data hj esb cvl dbvdw and sajd performed the

14918,land water transition areas play a significant role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems however anthropogenic pressures are posing severe threats on land water transition areas which leads to degradation of the ecological integrity of many lakes worldwide enhancing habitat complexity and heterogeneity by restoring land water transition areas in lake systems is deemed a suitable method to restore lakes bottom up by stimulating lower trophic levels stimulating productivity of lower trophic levels phytoplankton zooplankton generates important food sources for declining higher trophic levels fish birds here we study ecosystem restoration project marker wadden in lake markermeer the netherlands this project involved the construction of a 700 ha archipelago of five islands in a degrading shallow lake aiming to create additional sheltered land water transition areas to stimulate food web development from its base by improving phytoplankton quantity and quality we found that phytoplankton quantity chlorophyll a concentration and quality inversed carbon nutrient ratio in the shallow waters inside the marker wadden archipelago were significantly improved likely due to higher nutrient availabilities while light availability remained sufficient compared to the surrounding lake higher phytoplankton quantity and quality was positively correlated with zooplankton biomass which was higher inside the archipelago than in the surrounding lake due to improved trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton we conclude that creating new land water transition areas can be used to increase light and nutrient availabilities and thereby enhancing primary productivity which in turn can stimulate higher trophic levels in degrading aquatic ecosystems

décamps 1997 seekell et al 2021 strayer and findlay 2010 in freshwater ecosystems land water transition areas only account for a small fraction of the total lake area but contribute disproportionately to the overall biodiversity and ecosystem processes in lakes hampton et al 2011 scheffer et al 1993 vadeboncoeur et al 2011 vander zanden and vadeboncoeur 2020 for instance more than 93 of species including fish crustaceans insects and mollusks inhabit the nearshore littoral zone and 72 are completely restricted to the littoral zone in 14 of the world s largest lakes vadeboncoeur et al 2011 these important ecosystem services provided by land water transition areas are maintained due to the input of nutrients from the land the ample light available for primary production in these shallow waters and the habitat heterogeneity porst et al 2019 strayer and findlay 2010 wall et al 2001 anthropogenic pressures on land water transitions are one of the most severe threats to lakes and their ecological integrity worldwide miler et al 2013 porst et al 2019 2015 schmieder 2004 these human induced pressures including human settlement associated industry and recreational activities cause loss of natural habitats and overall habitat degradation which in turn leads to decreased higher trophic production due to decreased food quantity and quality brauns et al 2007 chhor et al 2020 mcgoff et al 2013 porst et al 2019 therefore enhancing habitat complexity and heterogeneity by adding land water transition areas to lake systems seems a suitable method to restore lakes and stimulate the production of higher trophic levels meerhoff and de los ángeles gonzález sagrario 2021 light and nutrients provide the energy and matter that enable food web production sterner et al 1997 elser et al 2007 gruner et al 2008 the relative availabilities of light and nutrients can alter primary producer elemental composition and thereby their nutritional value for higher trophic levels sterner et al 1997 sterner and elser 2002 specifically increased light availability may lead to a higher carbon nutrient stoichiometry in primary producers that can form a stoichiometric bottleneck for herbivores thereby lowering the transfer efficiency burian et al 2020 which in turn lead to a decline in higher trophic level production dickman et al 2008 urabe and sterner 1996 creating new land water transition areas can affect light and nutrient availability which may stimulate the aquatic food web from its base by increasing phytoplankton quantity and quality and the transfer of energy to zooplankton trophic transfer we studied these processes in ecosystem restoration project marker wadden in lake markermeer the netherlands fig 1 a b covering an area of 680 km2 lake markermeer the netherlands is among the largest shallow lakes in western europe phytoplankton production in this lake is at present thought to be nutrient limited brinkmann et al 2019 van riel et al 2019 whereas the lake is also subject to strong wind driven sediment resuspension leading to low light availabilities eleveld 2012 kelderman et al 2012 the food web in lake markermeer has experienced strong declines in higher trophic levels such as the numbers of fish and benthivorous and piscivorous birds over the last decades noordhuis 2014 these declines have been associated with reduced phytoplankton production and a lack of natural land water transition areas van riel et al 2019 fig 1c to improve the ecological integrity of this lake and increase the numbers of fish and birds a large scale ecosystem restoration project called the marker wadden started in 2016 van leeuwen et al 2021 this project involved the construction of a 700 ha archipelago of five islands in lake markermeer aiming to create sheltered land water transition areas where sediment can settle and light availability in the water column can increase fig 1d e the shorelines of the marker wadden archipelago connect water and land which may lead to increased nutrient availability by run off from the land particularly within the archipelago such land water transition areas are rare along the shores of lake markermeer where land and water are almost entirely disconnected by basalt dikes as such the restoration project is expected to simultaneously increase light and nutrient availability in the water column hence increasing phytoplankton biomass production and its nutritional quality for higher trophic levels in this study we assessed the impact of the marker wadden ecosystem restoration project on nutrient and light availabilities in the archipelago in comparison with the surrounding lake we tested the consequences for phytoplankton biomass production and carbon nutrient stoichiometry as well as zooplankton biomass production we specifically hypothesized that a phytoplankton biomass expressed as the chlorophyll a concentration in the water is higher in the marker wadden archipelago than in the surrounding lake and b phytoplankton nutritional quality expressed as the inverse of their carbon nutrient ratios is higher in the marker wadden archipelago than in the surrounding lake due to the improved nutrient and light availabilities we further hypothesized that c these improved phytoplankton biomass and its quality in marker wadden could facilitate the biomass build up of the zooplankton due to the d improved trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton compared to the surrounding lake to test our hypotheses we performed a field study at the marker wadden from may to december 2018 we measured chlorophyll a concentrations seston carbon nutrient stoichiometry nutrient concentrations in the water column light availability zooplankton biomass and suspended solids concentrations at selected locations in and around the marker wadden archipelago 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake markermeer is a 3 5 m deep mean depth 3 6 m 680 km2 delta lake located in the center of the netherlands fig 1a b this freshwater lake is part of a former estuary that was disconnected from the sea in 1932 by damming and became a separate lake from lake ijsselmeer by the construction of a dam the houtribdijk in 1975 the lake is a protected area under the european bird directive following natura2000 legislation and has experienced declines in numbers of benthivorous and piscivorous birds over the last decades as well as in fish abundance noordhuis 2014 marker wadden is a newly constructed archipelago of islands spread across an area of about 700 ha in the northeastern part of lake markermeer 52 35 02 8 n 5 21 55 5 e and was built in 2016 2017 these islands have been constructed from local lake sediments and aim to improve the ecological status of lake markermeer the archipelago consists of five islands protruding several meters above the water level and an underwater landscape with varied water depths and littoral zones van leeuwen et al 2021 2 2 study design we selected six sampling locations that represent the habitat occurring within the marker wadden archipelago and six sampling locations in the open water surrounding the marker wadden fig 1f the distance between the marker wadden shoreline and these sampling locations in the surrounding lake outside of marker wadden was about 200 m during the study no submerged macrophytes were present at the sampling locations all the sampling locations on marker wadden are connected with the open water of the lake we made a comparison between the surface waters within the marker wadden archipelago and the surrounding lake 2 3 field sampling all 12 locations were sampled every two weeks from the 17th of may to the 6th of december 2018 the deeper sampling points were sampled from a ship whereas the shallow sampling points were sampled by carefully walking into the water from the shoreline preventing disturbance of the sediment the sampling protocol involved 1 measuring the water surface

cyclopoida copepod nauplii were counted but not distinguished taxonomically the cladoceran and copepod biomasses were estimated after measuring 30 individuals provided there were enough individuals to allow this of each genus and using published length weight relationships bottrell et al 1976 dumont et al 1975 the total rotifer biomass was estimated by extracting empirical individual dry weight

analysis the mean light availability expressed as a fraction of surface light was calculated by the following formula riley 1957 sterner et al 1997 where zm is the mixed depth as the lake is shallow and subject to frequent winds we assumed the zm is equal to the water depth k d is the vertical attenuation coefficient which is calculated by the following equation lampert and sommer 2007 k d l n e d 0 l n e d z z in which e d 0 and e d z represent the light intensities at the surface and at depth z respectively in our study z was measured at a water depth of 50 cm except for the shallowest parts were z represented the water depth with a minimum of 8 cm to assess differences between the locations inside and outside of the marker wadden archipelago in all the measured parameters we first averaged values per sampling location over the sampling season n 6 inside n 6 outside then we tested for a potential influence of spatial autocorrelation in the data by creating a distance based weight matrix with the dnearneigh function of the spdep package bivand et al 2013 this determined the nearest neighbours for all 12 sampling locations we used this matrix to perform moran s i tests with the moran test and moran mc functions to derive p values based on 999 monte carlo simulation permutations for each dependent variable after bonferroni correction for multiple testing on the 12 dependent variables cp cn and np ratios showed significant spatial autocorrelation as their test statistics were significantly different from random table s1 to account for the possible influence of spatial autocorrelation on our analyses we tested differences between the locations inside and outside the archipelago by means of generalized least squares gls analyses with and without correcting for spatial structures for each dependent variable we constructed six models with the binomial explanatory variable inside or outside and different possible spatial autocorrelation structures that we implemented in nlme pinheiro et al 2023 i e no exponential gaussian linear rational quadratic or spherical correlation structures for each dependent variable we present results for the model without

study comparisons the increase of phyto 1 8 fold and zooplankton 3 9 fold results in a 2 2 fold higher trophic transfer 4 discussion our results demonstrate that the shallow waters inside the marker wadden archipelago contained higher nutrient concentrations than the surrounding lake while light availability remained sufficient this combination increased the quantity and quality of phytoplankton at the base of the aquatic food web resulting in higher zooplankton biomass and higher trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton inside the marker wadden archipelago compared to the surrounding lake this shows that the creation of land water transition areas can lead to higher availabilities of light and nutrients thereby increasing the quantity and quality of primary productivity which in turn can stimulate transfer to higher trophic levels creating new land water transition areas in degraded homogeneous aquatic ecosystems can be broadly applied in an ecosystem restoration context 4 1 effects of ecosystem restoration on resources availabilities and phytoplankton ecosystem restoration resulted in higher tp and tn concentrations inside the marker wadden archipelago as compared to the surrounding lake this higher nutrient availability was accompanied with higher phytoplankton biomass and lower seston c p and c n which implies that both phytoplankton biomass and quality for higher trophic levels was improved by the restoration measures confirming our hypotheses a and b besides the phytoplankton was most of the time dominated by green algae inside the marker wadden while cyanobacteria dominated the surrounding lake generally green algae are more edible for zooplankton than cyanobacteria ger et al 2016 which may have further contributed to the increased zooplankton biomass and trophic transfer inside marker wadden the increased tn and tp concentrations inside marker wadden may be attributed to the higher sediment resuspension rates as indicated by the higher tss and iss concentrations inside marker wadden and the fact that the nutrient levels are very high in the lake sediment used for construction leading to higher mobilization and nutrient run off from the shores temmink et al 2021 the higher sediment resuspension rates inside marker wadden may well be attributed to the relatively lower water depth and contribution of small particles i e over 50 of particles 63 µm fig s2 which is more prone to be affected by wind despite the relatively sheltered conditions compared to the sampling points outside marker wadden sediment resuspension may result in higher nutrient availability for phytoplankton growth as has been demonstrated in lake markermeer brinkmann et al 2019 furthermore bioturbation induced by water birds such as avocets and coots and benthivorous fish such as carp may also have contributed to higher sediment resuspension and thereby higher nutrient availability inside marker wadden vanni 2002 following the sediment resuspension process high tss causes deteriorated light conditions indicated by a high light attenuation coefficient fig s3a b which potentially limits the growth of phytoplankton due to low light availability however the light availability for the phytoplankton is also mediated by the water depth the water depth across locations inside the marker wadden archipelago 1 2 1 0 m water depth was generally lower compared to the locations outside marker wadden 4 3 0 2 m this potentially compensated for the high light attenuation caused by the sediment resuspension process resulting in a suitable light climate for phytoplankton biomass build up besides causing an increase in the absolute amount of the nutrients sediment resuspension could also determine the relative availability of light and nutrients that also plays a vital role in regulating the phytoplankton biomass production specifically a balanced input of resources may support higher species diversity and thereby enhance resource use efficiencies and community productivity of phytoplankton hillebrand et al 2014 in contrast an unbalanced availability of light and nutrients may decrease phytoplankton diversity through enhanced competition cardinale et al 2009 this in turn is expected to reduce overall resource use efficiencies of the phytoplankton community which would also contribute to decreased phytoplankton biomass the higher phytoplankton biomass production may be attributed to balanced resource availabilities inside marker wadden which is further confirmed by the n p ratio that was close to 16 suggesting co limitation of n and p and or limitation by another factor lenton and watson 2000 redfield 1958 interestingly we found that phytoplankton biomass showed an increasing trend inside marker wadden from late june to early august while it showed a decreasing trend outside of marker wadden fig 3a this corresponded with both a seasonal increase in light availability and temperature fig 2i and fig s3c this positive effect of temperature on the phytoplankton biomass production only occurred where the nutrients were abundant hence inside marker wadden while a shortage of nutrient supply might result in a lack of response as observed outside marker wadden or even detrimental temperature effects verbeek et al 2018 schulhof et al 2019 moreover because organisms tend to be more sensitive to external factors in nutrient poor environments finger et al 2013 the increased light availability during this period may also pose a threat to phytoplankton biomass build up outside marker wadden indeed during the same period the c p ratio at location outside marker wadden showed a sharp increasing trend while it was stable across locations inside the marker wadden which further confirms the nutrient shortage for phytoplankton growth especially p outside marker wadden this is also suggested by the seston n p ratios outside marker wadden which were generally much higher as compared to the redfield ratio i e n p of 16 suggesting that p may limit phytoplankton growth inside marker wadden high p and n concentrations were observed in the water which were at the redfield ratio suggesting that both high p and n availability contributed to phytoplankton biomass production given that enough light was available as a result the overall higher p and n concentrations explain a consistently low seston c p and c n ratio inside marker wadden irrespective of alterations in tp tn and light availabilities 4 2 effects of restoration on zooplankton and trophic transfer efficiency following the improved phytoplankton quantity and quality inside of marker wadden we observed that total zooplankton biomass was significantly higher inside of marker wadden compared with outside of marker wadden confirming hypothesis c we also observed that biomass of copepods cladocerans and rotifers biomasses was generally higher at locations inside the marker wadden archipelago compared to those outside of the marker wadden archipelago fig s4 wind induced turbulence may facilitate zooplankton biomass build up through improved phytoplankton quantity and quality by increasing nutrient availability while it may inhibit zooplankton growth due to the increased inorganic suspended solids concentration that could mechanically interfere with food collection or dilute gut contents thereby resulting in less food being assimilated koenings et al 1990 visser and stips 2002 apparently the positive effect of improved food quantity and quality overrides the negative effect of increased inorganic suspended solids concentrations following the sediment resuspension thereby resulting in higher zooplankton biomass inside marker wadden besides zooplankton at the locations inside the marker wadden archipelago may benefit from the reduced wind induced turbulence which in turn may enhance zooplankton food detection or capture or directly prevent body damage g tóth et al 2011 peters and marrasé 2000 moreover the high turbidity inside marker wadden may release zooplankton from the fish predation especially from those species that locate prey visually gardner 1981 lehtiniemi et al 2004 furthermore the newly created habitat inside the marker wadden may harbor less fish in its initial stage resulting in higher zooplankton biomass inside the marker wadden compared with those outside of marker wadden archipelago due to low fish predation pressures carpenter et al 2016 hessen et al 2006 whether fish numbers inside the marker wadden is indeed lower however still needs to be investigated we observed that trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton was higher inside marker wadden compared to outside marker wadden particularly during spring which is largely in line with hypothesis d this higher trophic transfer efficiency inside of marker wadden is mainly caused by the generally higher biomass of copepods cladocerans and rotifers during this period inside marker wadden fig s4 the higher zooplankton biomass likely resulted from the improved phytoplankton quantity and quality due to the improved light and nutrient availability following the sediment resuspension process furthermore zooplankton may have benefitted from the benthic food chain that developed within the islands jin et al 2022a 2022b van leeuwen et al 2021 4 3 implications for lake management our study shows that the newly created land water transition areas in the marker wadden restoration project can increase nutrient availability improve phytoplankton quantity and quality and enhance trophic transfer efficiency from phytoplankton to zooplankton when they are sheltered from wind effect this knowledge can be used to guide lake restoration for instance to combat eutrophication oligotrophication following nutrient mitigation measures is increasingly applied as a restoration approach in freshwater systems worldwide sabel et al 2020 this was also the case for lake markermeer where nutrient concentrations showed a notable decline over the last decades noordhuis 2014 van riel et al 2019 however in many systems an unintended decline of higher trophic production like zooplankton john anderson et al 2005 and fish finger et al 2007 was observed to coincide with these nutrient reductions nutrient reduction reduces phytoplankton biomass production which increases water transparency and together these changes increase phytoplankton carbon nutrient ratios as a result higher trophic levels in lake ecosystems may suffer from both food quantity and quality shortage therefore ideally lake restoration measures are required to achieve both improved water quality while maintaining higher trophic production to achieve this adding land water transition areas to lakes in order to enhance habitat complexity and heterogeneity could complement other measures such as nutrient reduction and biomanipulation to restore lakes and stimulate the production of higher trophic levels hansson et al 1998 meerhoff and de los ángeles gonzález sagrario 2021 spears et al 2021 however caution is needed as these newly created habitats only work properly when they are relatively sheltered from wind effects suggesting that wind induced hydrological dynamics need to be considered in the first place blukacz et al 2010 jin et al 2022a kong et al 2017 moreover increased nutrient concentrations may also lead to shifts in the phytoplankton community composition and when this will enhance cyanobacterial biomass it may both reduce water quality and trophic transfer due to their poor edibility huisman et al 2018 marker wadden was created to improve the ecological status of lake markermeer which is a typical example of an artificially created shallow lake in which eutrophication has been halted due to the oligotrophication efforts but the fish and bird populations have been declining our study shows a strengthened interaction between phytoplankton and zooplankton in the initial stage from which higher trophic levels may profit moreover those newly created land water transition areas could support additional habitats for the colonization of more diverse types of primary producers i e submerged macrophytes and emergent vegetation which have been observed on marker wadden after 2018 jin et al 2022a 2022b that will further enhance habitat heterogeneity and may improve food availability consequently the recovery of diverse types of higher trophic level organisms will also be enhanced and maintained van leeuwen et al 2021 5 conclusions our results demonstrated that the marker wadden archipelago significantly improved phytoplankton quantity and quality due to improved nutrient availability in the water column with still sufficient light this improved phytoplankton quantity and quality facilitated zooplankton biomass build up inside the marker wadden and resulted in a higher trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton we conclude that creating new land water transition areas can be used to increase light and nutrient availabilities and thereby enhancing primary productivity which in turn can stimulate higher trophic levels in degrading aquatic ecosystems authors contribution hj and esb designed the experiment hj and esb acquired the data hj esb cvl dbvdw and sajd performed the

14919,steroids have attracted particular attention as environmental contaminants because of their severe endocrine disrupting effects previous studies have predominantly focused on parent steroids however the levels and proportions of the free and conjugated forms of their metabolites remain largely unclear especially in food webs here we first characterized the free and conjugated forms of parent steroids and their metabolites in 26 species in an estuarine food web the steroids were dominated by their metabolites in water samples whereas parent compounds were predominant in sediment samples the total mean steroid concentrations in the biota samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis decreased in the following order crabs 27 ng g fish 5 9 ng g snails 3 4 ng g shrimps and sea cucumbers 1 2 ng g and those in the biota samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis decreased in the following order crabs 57 ng g snails 9 2 ng g fish 7 9 ng g shrimps and sea cucumbers 3 5 ng g the proportion of metabolites in the enzymatic hydrolysis biota samples was higher 38 79 than that 2 9 65 in non enzymatic ones indicating that the free and conjugated forms of metabolites in aquatic organisms were not negligible most synthetic steroids were either bioaccumulative or highly bioaccumulative importantly in the invertebrate food web 17α methyltestosterone was biomagnified while 17β boldenone underwent trophic dilution although the estuarine water had a median ecological risk level the health risks via aquatic product consumption were very low this study provides novel insights into the composition and trophic transfer of steroids in an estuarine food web for the first time and highlights that free and conjugated metabolites should receive more attention particularly in

environmentally realistic concentrations azizi lalabadi and pirsaheb 2021 based on the sources steroids can be divided into natural and synthetic steroids which are recurrently identified in the aquatic environment due to the endogenous excretions of humans and vertebrate animals steroid drug production and application ojoghoro et al 2021 steroids in the environment at levels of ng l can disturb fecundity and immune function cause intersexuality and even cause the extinction of aquatic organisms azizi lalabadi and pirsaheb 2021 kidd et al 2007 for instance 2 ng l of mixed drospirenone and gestodene was found to significantly elevate the proportion of intersex fish šauer et al 2020 and long term exposure to 17α ethynylestradiol at 5 6 ng l eventually caused fish to almost disappear from a lake kidd et al 2007 alarmingly some steroids are potential carcinogens iarc 2020 our previous study revealed that some synthetic steroids are bioaccumulative in aquatic products liu et al 2017a given their critical endocrine disrupting effects azizi lalabadi and pirsaheb 2021 and potential carcinogenicity iarc 2020 it is of paramount importance to comprehensively evaluate the ecological risks of steroids in waterbodies and their risks to human health via aquatic product consumption previous studies have mainly focused on the occurrence distribution ecological risks and human health risks of steroids in rivers lakes and agriculture liu et al 2017a 2017b ismail et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 once exogenous parent steroids enter the body of fish up to 97 of the steroids in the muscle undergo phase i and ii metabolism to generate metabolites in free and conjugated forms glucuronide and sulfate liu et al 2019 scott et al 2014 nishshanka et al 2015 similar metabolic processes have also been observed in mussels schwarz et al 2017 2018 and crustaceans poelmans et al 2006 janer et al 2005 furthermore some conjugated steroids can be deconjugated into free forms by gut microbiota chen et al 2022a resulting in the re entry of free forms into tissues therefore previous studies that only monitored the levels of parent steroids in organisms may have greatly underestimated both the total burden of steroids and their ecological risks owing to the lack of chemical standards for glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of steroids there have been almost no studies on the conjugated metabolites of steroids in organisms enzymatic hydrolysis is a vital alternative method for quantitatively detecting the total levels of conjugated steroids liu et al 2015a müller et al 2021 thus the levels of free and conjugated forms of steroids in organisms can be differentiated using enzymatic hydrolysis estuaries contain abundant fishery resources pasquaud et al 2015 but their health is not optimistic as they are the primary sinks of terrestrial steroids omar et al 2018 2019 substantial amounts of steroids consistently enter estuarine environments through coastal domestic sewage and aquaculture wastewater field studies have shown that parent steroids are ubiquitous in estuarine water and sediments omar et al 2018 2019 korkmaz et al 2022 which may severely endanger estuarine fishery resources aquatic product security and human health although most steroids have low hydrophobicity log k ow 4 0 table s1 field survey has verified that some steroids have a strong bioaccumulation ability liu et al 2017b implying their potential for trophic transfer in the food web however few studies have been conducted on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of parent steroids and free and conjugated metabolites in organisms at different trophic levels particularly in estuarine food webs therefore studying the multimedia partitioning behaviors bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of different forms of steroids in estuarine food webs is highly valuable a typical subtropical estuary the pearl river estuary was selected as the study area of this work the aims of this study were to 1 characterize the multimedia partitioning behaviors of steroids in the estuarine food web 2 identify the composition of parent steroids and free and conjugated metabolites 3 evaluate their trophic transfer potential and 4 assess their ecological and human health risks this study is the first to provide systematic information on the compositions of different forms of steroids their bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in an estuarine food web which is of great importance for accurately assessing the ecological and human health risks of steroids

sample extraction and instrumental analysis the comprehensive sample extraction and analysis methods can be found in the si briefly water samples 5 l were enriched using solid phase extraction waters hlb 500 mg cartridges after filtration the freeze dried sediment samples 2 0 g were extracted by the ultrasonic method using ethyl acetate methanol 8 2 v v all biota samples were treated in accordance

they were more prone to generating conjugated steroids in biota therefore the free forms of parent steroids and metabolites were determined in 100 µl of the extracted biota sample while the total

bioaccumulation of exogenous steroids in the biota samples based on the free forms of synthetic steroids expressed in wet weight ww usepa 2003 arnot and gobas 2006 the baf was calculated using the following equation baf 1000 c biota c w where c biota is the level of the synthetic steroid in the tissue in its free form ng g ww and c w is the mean level of steroid detected in water the trophic

behavior of steroids in water and sediments fourteen steroids were identified in the pearl river estuary water samples with total levels of 1 9 5 7 ng l fig 1 and table s8 our results were comparable to those found in estuarine water in the usa meador et al 2016 and malaysia omar et al 2019 distinctly lower than those observed in river and lake water in china shen et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 and higher than those observed in surface water in india chakraborty et al 2021 and canada yarahmadi et al 2018 among the quantified steroids two natural steroids aed and p two metabolites crn and 20β dhp and one synthetic steroid 17α mt were detectable in all water samples table s8 for the surface water progestagens 29 77 were the most dominant steroids at most of the sampling sites whereas glucocorticoids 39 63 dominated the bottom water fig s2 metabolites were predominant in both water layers with proportions between 41 and 85 fig s2 the total levels of steroids in the bottom water were significantly higher than those in the surface water independent sample t test p 0 05 table s8 in the aquatic environment steroid levels are principally driven by biodegradation and photodegradation besides pollution sources and hydrodynamic conditions the species and abundance of microorganisms should be similar for different depths at the same sampling site steroid biodegradation has been reported to be mainly influenced by temperature tang et al 2019 and dissolved oxygen liu et al 2015b zhang et al 2020 the temperature and dissolved oxygen were similar between different sampling sites and water layers table s2 indicating that biodegradation may have comparable impacts in different water layers the surface layer may be exposed to higher light intensity than the bottom layer increasing the steroids susceptibility to photodegradation wammer et al 2016 most previous studies have focused exclusively on steroids in surface water ojoghoro et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 which may have led to the misestimation of the real contamination state especially for deep water bodies such as reservoirs estuaries and islands therefore water depth is a non negligible factor for steroid contamination in the environment eleven steroids were identified in the sediments with total concentrations of 1 9 3 6 ng g fig 1 and table s9 which were similar to those reported in the estuarine sediments in malaysia omar et al 2018 but below the levels of steroids detected in sediments from lake and fishing ports in china liu et al 2022 zhou et al 2016 river sediments in canada yarahmadi et al 2018 and estuary sediments in turkey korkmaz et al 2022 among the quantified steroids two natural steroids aed and p two metabolites 20α dhp and 20β dhp and two synthetic steroids 17α mt and 19 ntd were found in all sediment samples table s9 the field partitioning coefficients log k d and log k oc between the sediment and water were 2 0 4 6 and 3 8 7 1 l kg respectively tables s10 and s11 which were higher than those calculated for lake river and soil water systems sangster et al 2015 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 the sediment type sangster et al 2015 toc content steroid levels and degradation may have affected these values lai et al 2000 the proportion of progestagens 48 65 was the highest among different classes of steroids followed by androgens 29 39 and glucocorticoids 0 17 fig s2 this may be because progestagens and androgens with higher logk ow are more likely to adsorb into sediments whereas hydrophilic glucocorticoids are more soluble in water table s1 in contrast to the water samples the sediments were dominated by natural steroids 48 61 rather than metabolites 26 42 fig s2 these findings indicate that steroids and metabolites may exhibit different partitioning behaviors in different environmental media 3 2 levels and compositions of steroids in the biota samples 3 2 1 steroids with non enzymatic hydrolysis to improve the comparability of the data steroid levels were presented in wet weight ww and lipid weight lw tables s12 s15 for the snail shrimp sea cucumber crab and fish samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis namely free forms 11 14 5 16 and 13 steroids were identified respectively with the total mean concentrations of steroids in the different biota groups ranging from 1 2 to 27 ng g ww from 131 to 2821 ng g lw figs 1 and 2 fig s3 the wet weight concentrations were comparable to those observed in mariculture fish from malaysia ismail et al 2021 but were one to two orders of magnitude lower than those found in cultured fish in china liu et al 2017a 2017b the great differences between this study and cultured fish in china were attributed to the exogenous glucocorticoid crl the concentrations of which in cultured fish muscles were considerably higher than those in biota samples in the pearl river estuary species differences may have been the leading cause of this phenomenon liu et al 2017b moreover high density aquaculture and environmental pollutants can also elevate the cortisol levels in aquatic organisms bolasina et al 2006 rohonczy et al 2021 among the steroids detected only three natural steroids including t 97 crl 67 and p 81 exhibited high detection rates of 50 table s14 among the 26 species the snails shrimps sea cucumbers crabs and fish containing the highest total mean concentrations of steroids were nassarius siquijorensis banana prawn acaudina molpadioides clibanarius striolatus trypauchen vagina with levels of 5 5 2 2 1 2 27 and 17 ng g ww respectively fig s4 for the different groups the total mean concentrations decreased in the following order crabs fish snails shrimps and sea cucumbers fig 2a these results differ from those reported for cultured aquatic products for which the highest total steroid concentrations were found in fish followed by mollusks shrimps and crabs liu et al 2017a besides species and living conditions there were differences in the types of target steroids as existing studies have focused mainly on parent steroids while this study was the first to identify six metabolites doc 3α 5β thcrl 20α dhp 20β dhp 17α 20α dohp and 17α ohp in biota samples except for sea cucumber 2 9 metabolites in the other four biota groups accounted for up to 17 65 of the total steroid contributions thus metabolites in muscle tissues cannot be overlooked fig 2c there were distinct differences between the different classes of steroids in the different biota groups the percentages of glucocorticoids 46 67 were high in snails sea cucumbers and fish while progestagens were dominant in shrimps 56 and crabs 87 fig 2e eleven synthetic steroids were also determined in the biota samples with mean concentrations ranging from loq to 3 4 ng g ww mpa fig 1 indicating that the aquatic organisms in the pearl river estuary were contaminated by synthetic steroids albeit at relatively low levels 3 2 2 steroids with enzymatic hydrolysis for the snail shrimp sea cucumber crab and fish samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis 14 17 9 18 and 20 steroids were identified respectively with total mean concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 57 ng g ww 394 to 6012 ng g lw figs 1 and 2a fig s3 in addition to the natural steroids t 100 crl 98 and p 85 the detection rates of the metabolites 20α dhp 78 crn 52 and the synthetic steroid prel 51 also exceeded 50 table s15 interestingly prel was present in only one biota sample that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis after enzymatic hydrolysis the detection rate of prel increased to 51 these results reveal prel appeared more commonly in conjugated forms after entering the biota muscle tissues for different species the snail shrimp sea cucumber crab and fish with the highest total mean concentrations of steroids were nassarius siquijorensis banana prawn acaudina molpadioides clibanarius striolatus trypauchen vagina with concentrations of 18 4 8 3 5 57 and 17 ng g ww respectively fig s4 exhibiting the same tendency as the free forms for the different groups the total mean concentrations decreased in the following order crabs snails fish shrimps and sea cucumbers fig 2a compared with the samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis higher numbers and levels of steroids were detected in the samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis for the five groups of biota samples excluding crabs paired samples t test p 0 16 the total concentrations after enzymatic hydrolysis were significantly higher than those in the samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis paired samples t test or wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 fig 2a for all 26 species higher mean total concentrations ww of steroids were detected in the muscle samples after enzymatic hydrolysis than those after non enzymatic hydrolysis but they were only significantly higher in 14 species paired samples t test or wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 fig s4 the mean percentages of conjugated forms equal to the ratios of conjugated concentrations to the total ones free and conjugated concentrations in snails shrimps sea cucumbers crabs and fish were 61 63 65 53 and 27 respectively fig 2b furthermore the proportions of metabolites in the biota samples underwent enzymatic hydrolysis were higher 38 79 than that in the samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis 2 9 65 fig 2c d die was detected only in samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis these results demonstrate that conjugated metabolites are indispensable components of steroids in biota spearman correlation analysis was utilized to examine the relationships between different steroids in the estuarine environment and biota samples fig s5 significant positive relationships were observed between the levels of p and its metabolite 20α dhp and crl and its metabolite crn in both estuarine environments and biota samples p 0 05 except for crn undetectable in the sediment fig s6 and s7 this suggests that p and its metabolite 20α dhp and crl and its metabolite crn have similar partitioning behaviors in estuarine environments and organisms 3 3 bioaccumulation of synthetic steroids in the biota samples teleost fish can synthesize various steroids and their metabolites in different tissues tokarz et al 2015 scott et al 2014 some natural steroids and metabolites such as estriol 17β estradiol testosterone progesterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone could be endogenous in invertebrates crabs molluscs echinoderms shrimps snails cardoso et al 1997 lafont and mathieu 2007 rizk et al 2012 warrier et al 2001 consequently when natural steroids or metabolites are present in biota samples it is extremely challenging to distinguish whether they are endogenous or have been bioaccumulated from the environment therefore only synthetic steroids were considered to calculate bafs table 1 the mean log bafs values in snails shrimps crabs and fish were in the ranges of 1 8 4 3 2 4 4 1 2 3 6 4 and 2 1 4 3 respectively with crabs exhibiting the maximum bafs table 1 the log baf values in this study were comparable to those reported in the biota tissues from aquaculture farms or biota exposed to sewage effluents log bafs 1 0 5 0 chen et al 2022b fick et al 2010 liu et al 2017b but considerably higher than those calculated for fish exposed to synthetic steroids in laboratory experiments log baf 1 0 2 5 liu et al 2019 steele et al 2013 this may be attributed to the exposure concentrations and time generally the concentrations of exogenous contaminants in fish tissues are positively associated with the exposure concentrations but the bioaccumulation ability exhibits an inverse tendency particularly when the exposure concentrations exceeded 100 ng l huang et al 2015 lange et al 2001 wu et al 2016 experimental studies typically employ relatively high exposure concentrations which may result in the underestimation of the bioaccumulation capacity of exogenous contaminants in the real environment arnot and gobas 2006 in addition the bioaccumulation ability of exogenous contaminants in tissues can be accelerated with prolonged exposure when organisms are subjected to environmental levels in the range of ng l huang et al 2015 liu et al 2012 generally the baf values were comparable between snails shrimps and fish but two synthetic progestagens 16 dhp and ngt had higher bioaccumulation in crabs with mean baf values exceeding 5 0 table 1 these two synthetic compounds may be more stable and resistant to metabolism in crabs and future studies are needed to verify this furthermore chemicals are regarded as bioaccumulative and very bioaccumulative when the log baf values exceeded 3 3 and 3 7 respectively tsca 2012 except for 17α mt and 1 dhp most of the synthetic steroids examined in this study were bioaccumulative or very bioaccumulative in addition to the exposure concentrations and time several variables such as species growth stage sex lipid content water content body size and tl could regulate the distribution of exogenous contaminants arnot and gobas 2006 liu et al 2017b cca demonstrated that the baf values of synthetic steroids could be explained by water content 21 p 0 05 body weight 16 p 0 05 tl 15 p 0 05 and body length 13 p 0 05 fig s8 and table s16 indicating that these variables have limited influences on bioaccumulation neither the levels nor baf values of synthetic steroids were significantly linearly related to lipid content fig s9 which differs markedly from the moderately highly hydrophobic pollutants log k ow 4 0 reported in marine food webs bekele et al 2019 hou et al 2022 this may be because most synthetic steroids have low hydrophobicity log k ow 4 0 table s1 and are more likely to be distributed in water or proteins rather than in lipids meanwhile we discovered that there were negative relationships between the log baf and log k ow values for snails and fish with correlation coefficients of 0 84 and 0 58 p 0 01 respectively figs s10 and s11 which may have been influenced by their different metabolic capacities between different species schwarz et al 2018 nishshanka et al 2015 3 4 trophic transfer this study is the first to determine the trophic transfer of synthetic steroids in a typical estuary food web for biota samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis only one synthetic steroid 17α mt with a detection rate above 30 was selected to calculate the tmfs based on lipid weight there was no significant correlation between the log concentrations of 17α mt and the tls for all biota samples n 94 p 0 05 fig s12 and fish samples n 57 p 0 05 fig s13 interestingly for invertebrate samples snails shrimps sea cucumbers and crabs the log concentrations of 17α mt and 17β bol with detection rates of 49 and 38 respectively were significantly related to the tls n 37 p 0 05 fig 3 the tmf values of 17α mt and 17β bol calculated by the concentration tl slope were 3 2 and 0 050 respectively which were close to the estimates 4 3 and 0 070 respectively obtained by monte carlo simulations fig 3 implying that monte carlo simulations can effectively predict the tmf values the calculated tmf value of 17α mt being 1 suggested that 17α mt had significant trophic magnification potential in snails shrimps sea cucumbers and crabs in the pearl river estuary food web meanwhile 17β bol had a tmf of 1 indicating that it was bio diluted or metabolized as it was transferred along the invertebrate food web the differences in the tmfs between the two androgens may be attributed to their structures 17β bol readily forms biotransformation products on the hydroxyl group at the c 17β position via phase i and ii metabolism van eenoo and delbeke 2006 chiesa et al 2015 in contrast the methyl group at the c 17α position of 17α mt may weaken the biotransformation capability of the c 17β hydroxyl group through steric hindrance el desoky et al 2016 which may enhance the persistence of 17α mt in tissues after enzymatic hydrolysis 17β bol 17α mt prel and ngt with detection rates above 30 were picked to calculate the tmfs the tmf values of 17β bol 17α mt prel and ngt in their conjugated forms namely metabolites calculated from the concentration tl slop were 0 50 0 54 0 79 and 0 74 respectively which were close to the estimates 0 61 0 57 0 92 and 0 83 respectively determined using monte carlo simulations fig s14 this suggests that these synthetic steroid metabolites were bio diluted or metabolized when they were transferred along the food web more field investigations and experimental tests are required to elucidate the trophic transfer mechanisms of steroids and their metabolites in different aquatic organisms 3 5 ecological risks the hazard index results showed that both surface and bottom water samples in the pearl river estuary were at median risk primarily influenced by aed fig s16 p posed low risks in all water samples and the other steroids posed insignificant risks rq 0 01 in most water samples metabolites accounted for high percentages 41 84 of the total steroids in water particularly 20α dhp and 20β dhp fig s2 these metabolites can exert significant steroid activity besse and garric 2009 bińkowska and woroń 2015 however we only estimated the ecological risks for two metabolites crn and 17α ohp as toxicity data were insufficient table s17 as such the ecological risks posed by metabolites may be underestimated some laboratory experiments have revealed that steroids can act independently in mixtures willi et al 2020 while others have observed that mixed steroids at low concentrations ng l can cause significant detrimental effects on reproduction while individual ones do not exert any effect thrupp et al 2018 the hazard index method utilized in this study only considered the ecological risks of individual steroids making it challenging to accurately evaluate the true ecological risks in estuarine environments more studies are necessary to elucidate the ecological risks posed by steroids and their metabolites in estuarine ecosystems 3 6 potential human health risks for local customers the total edi values via shrimp crab and fish consumption ranged from 12 64 49 252 and 260 3117 ng d in free steroid forms and 23 123 82 419 and 313 3754 ng d for the total forms respectively fig 4 which were two and three orders of magnitude lower than those estimated for aquaculture fish liu et al 2017a 2017b this was principally attributed to the lower levels of crl observed in the pearl river estuary products high density aquaculture can elevate the cortisol levels in aquatic products bolasina et al 2006 in addition to crl progestagen metabolites 20α dhp 20β dhp 17α ohp were vital contributors to fish consumption fig 4 furthermore compared with the free form edi calculated for the free and conjugated forms were elevated for all aquatic products fig 4 implying that conjugated metabolites should not be omitted when estimating dietary risks china is the largest exporter of fishery products in the world fao 2022 and the pearl river estuary is an important production and breeding area for chinese fisheries therefore we estimated the human health risks from pearl river estuary aquatic products for both local and global consumers only t and p with acceptable daily intakes adis could be used to calculate the hqs tables s18 and s19 the hqs for the two steroids in their free and total forms ranged from 1 8 10 6 to 1 2 10 4 and 2 1 10 6 to 2 9 10 4 for local consumers and 1 9 10 6 to 6 8 10 4 and 2 1 10 6 to 1 3 10 3 for global consumers respectively fig 4 and tables s19 s20 indicating that the health risks caused by the two steroids via aquatic product consumption to local and global consumers are very low besides t and p maximum residue limits mrls in foods have been set for very few steroids marac 2019 some synthetic steroids consisting of 17β bol 17α mt 17β tbl 1 dhp 16 dhp 17α ohpa mgta 19 ntd and ngt were identified sporadically in the aquatic products at levels up to 9 8 ng g ww table s15 but no mrls exist for these steroids consequently it is challenging to accurately assess health risks associated with aquatic products future studies are required to consider not only different conjugated forms of steroids but also contamination by multiple steroid classes to improve human health risk assessment methods 3 7 environmental implications this study applied enzymatic hydrolysis method to investigate the compositions bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of different forms of steroids in an estuarine food web and highlighted that free and conjugated metabolites should receive sufficient attention this is a step forward of previous studies that were mainly focused on the parent steroids however the enzymatic hydrolysis method can only obtain the total concentrations of conjugated steroids future studies are warranted to incorporate non targeted screening strategies based on high resolution mass spectrometry to quantify glucuronide and sulfate metabolites respectively to better understand their bioaccumulation and trophic transfer characteristics 4 conclusions this study is the first to provide evidence of the composition of parent steroids and their metabolites in different forms in a typical estuarine food web the water was dominated by metabolites whereas the sediment was dominated by natural steroids water depth was a non negligible factor in aquatic steroid contamination compared with those that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis higher levels and numbers of steroids were recorded in biota samples after enzymatic hydrolysis the free and conjugated forms of metabolites were important components of steroids in estuarine biota samples most synthetic steroids were either bioaccumulative or very bioaccumulative water content body weight tl and body length significantly influenced bioaccumulation whereas lipid content and hydrophobicity did not monte carlo simulations effectively forecasted the trophic transfer behaviors of free and conjugated steroids in the invertebrate food web 17α methyltestosterone underwent trophic magnification whereas 17β boldenone underwent trophic dilution the conjugated metabolites of 17β boldenone 17α methyltestosterone prednisolone and norgestrel were bio diluted across the food web although estuarine water was at median ecological risk the health risks via aquatic product consumption were very low more studies on the metabolic mechanisms and trophic transfer of steroids metabolites and conjugates in the food web should be conducted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14919,steroids have attracted particular attention as environmental contaminants because of their severe endocrine disrupting effects previous studies have predominantly focused on parent steroids however the levels and proportions of the free and conjugated forms of their metabolites remain largely unclear especially in food webs here we first characterized the free and conjugated forms of parent steroids and their metabolites in 26 species in an estuarine food web the steroids were dominated by their metabolites in water samples whereas parent compounds were predominant in sediment samples the total mean steroid concentrations in the biota samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis decreased in the following order crabs 27 ng g fish 5 9 ng g snails 3 4 ng g shrimps and sea cucumbers 1 2 ng g and those in the biota samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis decreased in the following order crabs 57 ng g snails 9 2 ng g fish 7 9 ng g shrimps and sea cucumbers 3 5 ng g the proportion of metabolites in the enzymatic hydrolysis biota samples was higher 38 79 than that 2 9 65 in non enzymatic ones indicating that the free and conjugated forms of metabolites in aquatic organisms were not negligible most synthetic steroids were either bioaccumulative or highly bioaccumulative importantly in the invertebrate food web 17α methyltestosterone was biomagnified while 17β boldenone underwent trophic dilution although the estuarine water had a median ecological risk level the health risks via aquatic product consumption were very low this study provides novel insights into the composition and trophic transfer of steroids in an estuarine food web for the first time and highlights that free and conjugated metabolites should receive more attention particularly in

environmentally realistic concentrations azizi lalabadi and pirsaheb 2021 based on the sources steroids can be divided into natural and synthetic steroids which are recurrently identified in the aquatic environment due to the endogenous excretions of humans and vertebrate animals steroid drug production and application ojoghoro et al 2021 steroids in the environment at levels of ng l can disturb fecundity and immune function cause intersexuality and even cause the extinction of aquatic organisms azizi lalabadi and pirsaheb 2021 kidd et al 2007 for instance 2 ng l of mixed drospirenone and gestodene was found to significantly elevate the proportion of intersex fish šauer et al 2020 and long term exposure to 17α ethynylestradiol at 5 6 ng l eventually caused fish to almost disappear from a lake kidd et al 2007 alarmingly some steroids are potential carcinogens iarc 2020 our previous study revealed that some synthetic steroids are bioaccumulative in aquatic products liu et al 2017a given their critical endocrine disrupting effects azizi lalabadi and pirsaheb 2021 and potential carcinogenicity iarc 2020 it is of paramount importance to comprehensively evaluate the ecological risks of steroids in waterbodies and their risks to human health via aquatic product consumption previous studies have mainly focused on the occurrence distribution ecological risks and human health risks of steroids in rivers lakes and agriculture liu et al 2017a 2017b ismail et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 once exogenous parent steroids enter the body of fish up to 97 of the steroids in the muscle undergo phase i and ii metabolism to generate metabolites in free and conjugated forms glucuronide and sulfate liu et al 2019 scott et al 2014 nishshanka et al 2015 similar metabolic processes have also been observed in mussels schwarz et al 2017 2018 and crustaceans poelmans et al 2006 janer et al 2005 furthermore some conjugated steroids can be deconjugated into free forms by gut microbiota chen et al 2022a resulting in the re entry of free forms into tissues therefore previous studies that only monitored the levels of parent steroids in organisms may have greatly underestimated both the total burden of steroids and their ecological risks owing to the lack of chemical standards for glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of steroids there have been almost no studies on the conjugated metabolites of steroids in organisms enzymatic hydrolysis is a vital alternative method for quantitatively detecting the total levels of conjugated steroids liu et al 2015a müller et al 2021 thus the levels of free and conjugated forms of steroids in organisms can be differentiated using enzymatic hydrolysis estuaries contain abundant fishery resources pasquaud et al 2015 but their health is not optimistic as they are the primary sinks of terrestrial steroids omar et al 2018 2019 substantial amounts of steroids consistently enter estuarine environments through coastal domestic sewage and aquaculture wastewater field studies have shown that parent steroids are ubiquitous in estuarine water and sediments omar et al 2018 2019 korkmaz et al 2022 which may severely endanger estuarine fishery resources aquatic product security and human health although most steroids have low hydrophobicity log k ow 4 0 table s1 field survey has verified that some steroids have a strong bioaccumulation ability liu et al 2017b implying their potential for trophic transfer in the food web however few studies have been conducted on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of parent steroids and free and conjugated metabolites in organisms at different trophic levels particularly in estuarine food webs therefore studying the multimedia partitioning behaviors bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of different forms of steroids in estuarine food webs is highly valuable a typical subtropical estuary the pearl river estuary was selected as the study area of this work the aims of this study were to 1 characterize the multimedia partitioning behaviors of steroids in the estuarine food web 2 identify the composition of parent steroids and free and conjugated metabolites 3 evaluate their trophic transfer potential and 4 assess their ecological and human health risks this study is the first to provide systematic information on the compositions of different forms of steroids their bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in an estuarine food web which is of great importance for accurately assessing the ecological and human health risks of steroids

sample extraction and instrumental analysis the comprehensive sample extraction and analysis methods can be found in the si briefly water samples 5 l were enriched using solid phase extraction waters hlb 500 mg cartridges after filtration the freeze dried sediment samples 2 0 g were extracted by the ultrasonic method using ethyl acetate methanol 8 2 v v all biota samples were treated in accordance

they were more prone to generating conjugated steroids in biota therefore the free forms of parent steroids and metabolites were determined in 100 µl of the extracted biota sample while the total concentrations of free and conjugated steroids and metabolites after enzymatic hydrolysis treatment were determined in another 100 µl steroids and their metabolites were quantified using infinity ⅱ liquid chromatography agilent 1290 coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent 6470 the lipid contents and stable isotopic ratio of nitrogen δ15n in the corresponding tissue samples

bioaccumulation of exogenous steroids in the biota samples based on the free forms of synthetic steroids expressed in wet weight ww usepa 2003 arnot and gobas 2006 the baf was calculated using the following equation baf 1000 c biota c w where c biota is the level of the synthetic steroid in the tissue in its free form ng g ww and c w is the mean level of steroid detected in water the trophic levels tls of the biota samples were calculated based on the assumption that the tl and δ15n of zooplankton are 2 0 and 3 8 respectively thus tl 2 δ15 nbiota δ15nplankton 3 8 the trophic magnification factors tmfs of the synthetic steroids were calculated using the following two equations log c biota a b tl and tmf 10b where c biota is the level of a synthetic steroid in the tissue in its free or conjugated form ng g lipid weight the tmf were only calculated for the synthetic steroids when the detection frequencies exceeded 30 in the biota samples castro jiménez et al 2021 monte carlo simulations of 10000 orders were conducted to estimate the tmfs jia et al 2015 the mean and standard deviations of the tls and log steroid concentrations were inputted into the oracle crystal ball

kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk tests were used to test for normality an independent sample t test was applied to evaluate the differences in the total steroid levels at different water depths a

behavior of steroids in water and sediments fourteen steroids were identified in the pearl river estuary water samples with total levels of 1 9 5 7 ng l fig 1 and table s8 our results were comparable to those found in estuarine water in the usa meador et al 2016 and malaysia omar et al 2019 distinctly lower than those observed in river and lake water in china shen et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 and higher than those observed in surface water in india chakraborty et al 2021 and canada yarahmadi et al 2018 among the quantified steroids two natural steroids aed and p two metabolites crn and 20β dhp and one synthetic steroid 17α mt were detectable in all water samples table s8 for the surface water progestagens 29 77 were the most dominant steroids at most of the sampling sites whereas glucocorticoids 39 63 dominated the bottom water fig s2 metabolites were predominant in both water layers with proportions between 41 and 85 fig s2 the total levels of steroids in the bottom water were significantly higher than those in the surface water independent sample t test p 0 05 table s8 in the aquatic environment steroid levels are principally driven by biodegradation and photodegradation besides pollution sources and hydrodynamic conditions the species and abundance of microorganisms should be similar for different depths at the same sampling site steroid biodegradation has been reported to be mainly influenced by temperature tang et al 2019 and dissolved oxygen liu et al 2015b zhang et al 2020 the temperature and dissolved oxygen were similar between different sampling sites and water layers table s2 indicating that biodegradation may have comparable impacts in different water layers the surface layer may be exposed to higher light intensity than the bottom layer increasing the steroids susceptibility to photodegradation wammer et al 2016 most previous studies have focused exclusively on steroids in surface water ojoghoro et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 which may have led to the misestimation of the real contamination state especially for deep water bodies such as reservoirs estuaries and islands therefore water depth is a non negligible factor for steroid contamination in the environment eleven steroids were identified in the sediments with total concentrations of 1 9 3 6 ng g fig 1 and table s9 which were similar to those reported in the estuarine sediments in malaysia omar et al 2018 but below the levels of steroids detected in sediments from lake and fishing ports in china liu et al 2022 zhou et al 2016 river sediments in canada yarahmadi et al 2018 and estuary sediments in turkey korkmaz et al 2022 among the quantified steroids two natural steroids aed and p two metabolites 20α dhp and 20β dhp and two synthetic steroids 17α mt and 19 ntd were found in all sediment samples table s9 the field partitioning coefficients log k d and log k oc between the sediment and water were 2 0 4 6 and 3 8 7 1 l kg respectively tables s10 and s11 which were higher than those calculated for lake river and soil water systems sangster et al 2015 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 the sediment type sangster et al 2015 toc content steroid levels and degradation may have affected these values lai et al 2000 the proportion of progestagens 48 65 was the highest among different classes of steroids followed by androgens 29 39 and glucocorticoids 0 17 fig s2 this may be because progestagens and androgens with higher logk ow are more likely to adsorb into sediments whereas hydrophilic glucocorticoids are more soluble in water table s1 in contrast to the water samples the sediments were dominated by natural steroids 48 61 rather than metabolites 26 42 fig s2 these findings indicate that steroids and metabolites may exhibit different partitioning behaviors in different environmental media 3 2 levels and compositions of steroids in the biota samples 3 2 1 steroids with non enzymatic hydrolysis to improve the comparability of the data steroid levels were presented in wet weight ww and lipid weight lw tables s12 s15 for the snail shrimp sea cucumber crab and fish samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis namely free forms 11 14 5 16 and 13 steroids were identified respectively with the total mean concentrations of steroids in the different biota groups ranging from 1 2 to 27 ng g ww from 131 to 2821 ng g lw figs 1 and 2 fig s3 the wet weight concentrations were comparable to those observed in mariculture fish from malaysia ismail et al 2021 but were one to two orders of magnitude lower than those found in cultured fish in china liu et al 2017a 2017b the great differences between this study and cultured fish in china were attributed to the exogenous glucocorticoid crl the concentrations of which in cultured fish muscles were considerably higher than those in biota samples in the pearl river estuary species differences may have been the leading cause of this phenomenon liu et al 2017b moreover high density aquaculture and environmental pollutants can also elevate the cortisol levels in aquatic organisms bolasina et al 2006 rohonczy et al 2021 among the steroids detected only three natural steroids including t 97 crl 67 and p 81 exhibited high detection rates of 50 table s14 among the 26 species the snails shrimps sea cucumbers crabs and fish containing the highest total mean concentrations of steroids were nassarius siquijorensis banana prawn acaudina molpadioides clibanarius striolatus trypauchen vagina with levels of 5 5 2 2 1 2 27 and 17 ng g ww respectively fig s4 for the different groups the total mean concentrations decreased in the following order crabs fish snails shrimps and sea cucumbers fig 2a these results differ from those reported for cultured aquatic products for which the highest total steroid concentrations were found in fish followed by mollusks shrimps and crabs liu et al 2017a besides species and living conditions there were differences in the types of target steroids as existing studies have focused mainly on parent steroids while this study was the first to identify six metabolites doc 3α 5β thcrl 20α dhp 20β dhp 17α 20α dohp and 17α ohp in biota samples except for sea cucumber 2 9 metabolites in the other four biota groups accounted for up to 17 65 of the total steroid contributions thus metabolites in muscle tissues cannot be overlooked fig 2c there were distinct differences between the different classes of steroids in the different biota groups the percentages of glucocorticoids 46 67 were high in snails sea cucumbers and fish while progestagens were dominant in shrimps 56 and crabs 87 fig 2e eleven synthetic steroids were also determined in the biota samples with mean concentrations ranging from loq to 3 4 ng g ww mpa fig 1 indicating that the aquatic organisms in the pearl river estuary were contaminated by synthetic steroids albeit at relatively low levels 3 2 2 steroids with enzymatic hydrolysis for the snail shrimp sea cucumber crab and fish samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis 14 17 9 18 and 20 steroids were identified respectively with total mean concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 57 ng g ww 394 to 6012 ng g lw figs 1 and 2a fig s3 in addition to the natural steroids t 100 crl 98 and p 85 the detection rates of the metabolites 20α dhp 78 crn 52 and the synthetic steroid prel 51 also exceeded 50 table s15 interestingly prel was present in only one biota sample that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis after enzymatic hydrolysis the detection rate of prel increased to 51 these results reveal prel appeared more commonly in conjugated forms after entering the biota muscle tissues for different species the snail shrimp sea cucumber crab and fish with the highest total mean concentrations of steroids were nassarius siquijorensis banana prawn acaudina molpadioides clibanarius striolatus trypauchen vagina with concentrations of 18 4 8 3 5 57 and 17 ng g ww respectively fig s4 exhibiting the same tendency as the free forms for the different groups the total mean concentrations decreased in the following order crabs snails fish shrimps and sea cucumbers fig 2a compared with the samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis higher numbers and levels of steroids were detected in the samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis for the five groups of biota samples excluding crabs paired samples t test p 0 16 the total concentrations after enzymatic hydrolysis were significantly higher than those in the samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis paired samples t test or wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 fig 2a for all 26 species higher mean total concentrations ww of steroids were detected in the muscle samples after enzymatic hydrolysis than those after non enzymatic hydrolysis but they were only significantly higher in 14 species paired samples t test or wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 fig s4 the mean percentages of conjugated forms equal to the ratios of conjugated concentrations to the total ones free and conjugated concentrations in snails shrimps sea cucumbers crabs and fish were 61 63 65 53 and 27 respectively fig 2b furthermore the proportions of metabolites in the biota samples underwent enzymatic hydrolysis were higher 38 79 than that in the samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis 2 9 65 fig 2c d die was detected only in samples that underwent enzymatic hydrolysis these results demonstrate that conjugated metabolites are indispensable components of steroids in biota spearman correlation analysis was utilized to examine the relationships between different steroids in the estuarine environment and biota samples fig s5 significant positive relationships were observed between the levels of p and its metabolite 20α dhp and crl and its metabolite crn in both estuarine environments and biota samples p 0 05 except for crn undetectable in the sediment fig s6 and s7 this suggests that p and its metabolite 20α dhp and crl and its metabolite crn have similar partitioning behaviors in estuarine environments and organisms 3 3 bioaccumulation of synthetic steroids in the biota samples teleost fish can synthesize various steroids and their metabolites in different tissues tokarz et al 2015 scott et al 2014 some natural steroids and metabolites such as estriol 17β estradiol testosterone progesterone and 17α hydroxyprogesterone could be endogenous in invertebrates crabs molluscs echinoderms shrimps snails cardoso et al 1997 lafont and mathieu 2007 rizk et al 2012 warrier et al 2001 consequently when natural steroids or metabolites are present in biota samples it is extremely challenging to distinguish whether they are endogenous or have been bioaccumulated from the environment therefore only synthetic steroids were considered to calculate bafs table 1 the mean log bafs values in snails shrimps crabs and fish were in the ranges of 1 8 4 3 2 4 4 1 2 3 6 4 and 2 1 4 3 respectively with crabs exhibiting the maximum bafs table 1 the log baf values in this study were comparable to those reported in the biota tissues from aquaculture farms or biota exposed to sewage effluents log bafs 1 0 5 0 chen et al 2022b fick et al 2010 liu et al 2017b but considerably higher than those calculated for fish exposed to synthetic steroids in laboratory experiments log baf 1 0 2 5 liu et al 2019 steele et al 2013 this may be attributed to the exposure concentrations and time generally the concentrations of exogenous contaminants in fish tissues are positively associated with the exposure concentrations but the bioaccumulation ability exhibits an inverse tendency particularly when the exposure concentrations exceeded 100 ng l huang et al 2015 lange et al 2001 wu et al 2016 experimental studies typically employ relatively high exposure concentrations which may result in the underestimation of the bioaccumulation capacity of exogenous contaminants in the real environment arnot and gobas 2006 in addition the bioaccumulation ability of exogenous contaminants in tissues can be accelerated with prolonged exposure when organisms are subjected to environmental levels in the range of ng l huang et al 2015 liu et al 2012 generally the baf values were comparable between snails shrimps and fish but two synthetic progestagens 16 dhp and ngt had higher bioaccumulation in crabs with mean baf values exceeding 5 0 table 1 these two synthetic compounds may be more stable and resistant to metabolism in crabs and future studies are needed to verify this furthermore chemicals are regarded as bioaccumulative and very bioaccumulative when the log baf values exceeded 3 3 and 3 7 respectively tsca 2012 except for 17α mt and 1 dhp most of the synthetic steroids examined in this study were bioaccumulative or very bioaccumulative in addition to the exposure concentrations and time several variables such as species growth stage sex lipid content water content body size and tl could regulate the distribution of exogenous contaminants arnot and gobas 2006 liu et al 2017b cca demonstrated that the baf values of synthetic steroids could be explained by water content 21 p 0 05 body weight 16 p 0 05 tl 15 p 0 05 and body length 13 p 0 05 fig s8 and table s16 indicating that these variables have limited influences on bioaccumulation neither the levels nor baf values of synthetic steroids were significantly linearly related to lipid content fig s9 which differs markedly from the moderately highly hydrophobic pollutants log k ow 4 0 reported in marine food webs bekele et al 2019 hou et al 2022 this may be because most synthetic steroids have low hydrophobicity log k ow 4 0 table s1 and are more likely to be distributed in water or proteins rather than in lipids meanwhile we discovered that there were negative relationships between the log baf and log k ow values for snails and fish with correlation coefficients of 0 84 and 0 58 p 0 01 respectively figs s10 and s11 which may have been influenced by their different metabolic capacities between different species schwarz et al 2018 nishshanka et al 2015 3 4 trophic transfer this study is the first to determine the trophic transfer of synthetic steroids in a typical estuary food web for biota samples that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis only one synthetic steroid 17α mt with a detection rate above 30 was selected to calculate the tmfs based on lipid weight there was no significant correlation between the log concentrations of 17α mt and the tls for all biota samples n 94 p 0 05 fig s12 and fish samples n 57 p 0 05 fig s13 interestingly for invertebrate samples snails shrimps sea cucumbers and crabs the log concentrations of 17α mt and 17β bol with detection rates of 49 and 38 respectively were significantly related to the tls n 37 p 0 05 fig 3 the tmf values of 17α mt and 17β bol calculated by the concentration tl slope were 3 2 and 0 050 respectively which were close to the estimates 4 3 and 0 070 respectively obtained by monte carlo simulations fig 3 implying that monte carlo simulations can effectively predict the tmf values the calculated tmf value of 17α mt being 1 suggested that 17α mt had significant trophic magnification potential in snails shrimps sea cucumbers and crabs in the pearl river estuary food web meanwhile 17β bol had a tmf of 1 indicating that it was bio diluted or metabolized as it was transferred along the invertebrate food web the differences in the tmfs between the two androgens may be attributed to their structures 17β bol readily forms biotransformation products on the hydroxyl group at the c 17β position via phase i and ii metabolism van eenoo and delbeke 2006 chiesa et al 2015 in contrast the methyl group at the c 17α position of 17α mt may weaken the biotransformation capability of the c 17β hydroxyl group through steric hindrance el desoky et al 2016 which may enhance the persistence of 17α mt in tissues after enzymatic hydrolysis 17β bol 17α mt prel and ngt with detection rates above 30 were picked to calculate the tmfs the tmf values of 17β bol 17α mt prel and ngt in their conjugated forms namely metabolites calculated from the concentration tl slop were 0 50 0 54 0 79 and 0 74 respectively which were close to the estimates 0 61 0 57 0 92 and 0 83 respectively determined using monte carlo simulations fig s14 this suggests that these synthetic steroid metabolites were bio diluted or metabolized when they were transferred along the food web more field investigations and experimental tests are required to elucidate the trophic transfer mechanisms of steroids and their metabolites in different aquatic organisms 3 5 ecological risks the hazard index results showed that both surface and bottom water samples in the pearl river estuary were at median risk primarily influenced by aed fig s16 p posed low risks in all water samples and the other steroids posed insignificant risks rq 0 01 in most water samples metabolites accounted for high percentages 41 84 of the total steroids in water particularly 20α dhp and 20β dhp fig s2 these metabolites can exert significant steroid activity besse and garric 2009 bińkowska and woroń 2015 however we only estimated the ecological risks for two metabolites crn and 17α ohp as toxicity data were insufficient table s17 as such the ecological risks posed by metabolites may be underestimated some laboratory experiments have revealed that steroids can act independently in mixtures willi et al 2020 while others have observed that mixed steroids at low concentrations ng l can cause significant detrimental effects on reproduction while individual ones do not exert any effect thrupp et al 2018 the hazard index method utilized in this study only considered the ecological risks of individual steroids making it challenging to accurately evaluate the true ecological risks in estuarine environments more studies are necessary to elucidate the ecological risks posed by steroids and their metabolites in estuarine ecosystems 3 6 potential human health risks for local customers the total edi values via shrimp crab and fish consumption ranged from 12 64 49 252 and 260 3117 ng d in free steroid forms and 23 123 82 419 and 313 3754 ng d for the total forms respectively fig 4 which were two and three orders of magnitude lower than those estimated for aquaculture fish liu et al 2017a 2017b this was principally attributed to the lower levels of crl observed in the pearl river estuary products high density aquaculture can elevate the cortisol levels in aquatic products bolasina et al 2006 in addition to crl progestagen metabolites 20α dhp 20β dhp 17α ohp were vital contributors to fish consumption fig 4 furthermore compared with the free form edi calculated for the free and conjugated forms were elevated for all aquatic products fig 4 implying that conjugated metabolites should not be omitted when estimating dietary risks china is the largest exporter of fishery products in the world fao 2022 and the pearl river estuary is an important production and breeding area for chinese fisheries therefore we estimated the human health risks from pearl river estuary aquatic products for both local and global consumers only t and p with acceptable daily intakes adis could be used to calculate the hqs tables s18 and s19 the hqs for the two steroids in their free and total forms ranged from 1 8 10 6 to 1 2 10 4 and 2 1 10 6 to 2 9 10 4 for local consumers and 1 9 10 6 to 6 8 10 4 and 2 1 10 6 to 1 3 10 3 for global consumers respectively fig 4 and tables s19 s20 indicating that the health risks caused by the two steroids via aquatic product consumption to local and global consumers are very low besides t and p maximum residue limits mrls in foods have been set for very few steroids marac 2019 some synthetic steroids consisting of 17β bol 17α mt 17β tbl 1 dhp 16 dhp 17α ohpa mgta 19 ntd and ngt were identified sporadically in the aquatic products at levels up to 9 8 ng g ww table s15 but no mrls exist for these steroids consequently it is challenging to accurately assess health risks associated with aquatic products future studies are required to consider not only different conjugated forms of steroids but also contamination by multiple steroid classes to improve human health risk assessment methods 3 7 environmental implications this study applied enzymatic hydrolysis method to investigate the compositions bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of different forms of steroids in an estuarine food web and highlighted that free and conjugated metabolites should receive sufficient attention this is a step forward of previous studies that were mainly focused on the parent steroids however the enzymatic hydrolysis method can only obtain the total concentrations of conjugated steroids future studies are warranted to incorporate non targeted screening strategies based on high resolution mass spectrometry to quantify glucuronide and sulfate metabolites respectively to better understand their bioaccumulation and trophic transfer characteristics 4 conclusions this study is the first to provide evidence of the composition of parent steroids and their metabolites in different forms in a typical estuarine food web the water was dominated by metabolites whereas the sediment was dominated by natural steroids water depth was a non negligible factor in aquatic steroid contamination compared with those that underwent non enzymatic hydrolysis higher levels and numbers of steroids were recorded in biota samples after enzymatic hydrolysis the free and conjugated forms of metabolites were important components of steroids in estuarine biota samples most synthetic steroids were either bioaccumulative or very bioaccumulative water content body weight tl and body length significantly influenced bioaccumulation whereas lipid content and hydrophobicity did not monte carlo simulations effectively forecasted the trophic transfer behaviors of free and conjugated steroids in the invertebrate food web 17α methyltestosterone underwent trophic magnification whereas 17β boldenone underwent trophic dilution the conjugated metabolites of 17β boldenone 17α methyltestosterone prednisolone and norgestrel were bio diluted across the food web although estuarine water was at median ecological risk the health risks via aquatic product consumption were very low more studies on the metabolic mechanisms and trophic transfer of steroids metabolites and conjugates in the food web should be conducted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
