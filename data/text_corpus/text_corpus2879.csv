14395,the system performance biomass kinetics and microbial community structure in biofouling and suspended biomass of a hybrid mbbr mbr system operating at 6 h of hydraulic retention time subjected to four different scenarios of salinity wastewater constant 6 5 ms cm 1 and tidal like variable at 4 5 6 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 was studied the performance of the bioreactors in terms of organic matter removal was efficient nevertheless only the scenario of variable 4 5 ms cm 1 showed good nitrogen removal 59 59 the salinity conditions exerted an effect over the kinetics of the system with rates of substrate utilization dependent on substrate for variable salinity conditions and non dependent for constant salinity conditions also higher peak salinities lead to lower rates of substrate utilization massive parallel sequencing showed that xanthomonadaceae family 2 57 33 00 and mycobacterium genus 4 70 dominated biofouling under variable and constant salinity conditions respectively principal component analyses showed higher community similarity between biofouling and suspended biomass under variable salinity conditions than for constant salinity however differences in biofouling related otus were observed between attached and suspended communities by the means of effect size quantification the composition of oligotypes of otus important for biofouling showed no differences between biofouling and suspended biomass at all salinity scenarios the results suggested that biofouling process could be mainly determined by increases in relative abundance of biofouling related otus in the attached biomass with respect to suspended biomass 25 76 204 63 increase the results obtained will be of importance for future design and implementation of strategies for operation and biofouling control of salinity wastewater treatment systems keywords biofouling hybrid mbbr mbr microbial kinetics oligotyping salinity wastewater 1 introduction discharge of wastewater is one of the main environmental problems of our era for the last century the activated sludge system has been the most used technology for the treatment of urban wastewater 1 however other technologies have emerged such as the membrane bioreactor mbr technology that offers several important advantages over the activated sludge such as reduced footprint operation at higher solids concentrations or very high removal efficiency of pathogens 2 furthermore mbr systems can be benefited by the implementation of an upstream moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr in which floating media are added to the bioreactor for the formation of attached biofilms in addition to suspended biofilms 3 the combined technology has been named as moving bed biofilm reactor membrane bioreactor mbbr mbr and its superior capacity to the mbr for the treatment of urban wastewater has been reported 4 7 in spite of this mbbr mbr systems as well as other membrane based technologies have to deal with the serious operational problem caused by the biofilm related clogging of membrane surface named as biofouling in this sense the mbbr mbr technology has been reported as less susceptible to biofouling than the mbr technology 8 biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms which can grow in suspension or attached to surfaces and that play a very important role in wastewater treatment systems barr et al 2016 the effect of biofilms in wastewater treatment systems is mostly beneficial because they are involved in the elimination of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorous 9 nevertheless biofilms can impact the performance of membrane systems because the adhesion of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances eps can clog membrane pores thus reducing the transmembrane pressure and decreasing efficiency of waste water treatment of the membrane system 10 in this context the analysis of the agents that cause membrane biofouling is a requirement in order to implement new practices for its control 11 12 both urban and industrial wastewater could have high salinity concentrations for industrial applications many manufacturing industries can raise salinity in industrial effluents such as seafood processing milk processing petroleum refining or textile manufacturing 13 in the case of urban wastewater the increase in salinity concentration over regular values could be caused by snow melting activities seawater toilet flushing or intrusion of seawater in coastal wastewater treatment plants 14 these increases in salinity exert pressure over the microbial communities in wastewater treatment systems which become negatively affected due to increase in cell mortality rate and decrease in microbial metabolism among others 15 16 thus leading to inefficiencies in wastewater treatment processes 17 the capability of the hybrid mbbr mbr system for the treatment of salinity wastewater has been proven 2 9 nevertheless an in depth study on the effect of different salinity conditions over the performance microbial kinetics microbial community structure and biofouling of this technology has not been attempted to date in this research a hybrid mbbr mbr system was operated at 6 h hydraulic retention time and under four different salinity conditions constant at 6 5 ms cm 1 and tidal like variable with maximums at 4 5 6 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 under these operational conditions the performance of the system its kinetics under the different salinity scenarios and microbial community structures of the membrane biofouling and suspended biomass present in the bioreactor were studied in order to evaluate the influence of the salinity conditions on this novel technology the microbial community analyses were done based on massive parallel sequencing to explore the otu ecology and oligotypes within important otus in the bioreactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor configuration and operation the bioreactor used in this study was a hybrid mbbr mbr system a schematic of the bioreactor is shown in fig 1 the bioreactor showed a configuration of four chambers and a separated membrane tank the four chambers were equal and had an operational volume of 6 l each the membrane tank had an operational volume of 4 32 l the first third and fourth chambers contained k1 carriers density of 0 92 0 96 g cm 3 anox kaldnes as norway accounting for a volume of 35 of the total volume of the chamber and adding to a total specific biofilm surface area for the whole bioreactor of 111 7 m2 m 3 the aeration of the first third and fourth chambers was accomplished by the means of bottom displaced fine bubble diffusers afd 270 ecotec sa spain and air compressors aco 500 hailea china measured by rotameters 2100 model tecfluid sa spain and regulated using a valve the second chamber was under anoxic conditions since no aeration was provided and therefore its mixing was accomplished by continuous agitation by a mechanical stirrer multi mixer mm 1000 biosan laboratories inc usa the membrane tank was aerated by a coarse bubble diffuser cap 3 ecotec sa spain and by an air compressor aco 500 hailea china which flow was continuously measured by a rotameter 2100 model tecfluid sa spain and regulated using a valve an ultrafiltration membrane module was displaced inside the membrane tank in submerged configuration and was composed by 0 04 Î¼m pore diameter hollow fibers of polyvinylidene fluoride with a core reinforcement of polyester displaced vertically micronet porous fibers sl spain the fibers measured 2 45 mm for external diameter and 1 10 mm for internal diameter and the membrane accounted for a total membrane area of 0 2 m2 the influent flow was forced to enter through the first chamber by the means of a watson marlow peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps group usa and to pass all of them discharging from the fourth chamber into the membrane tank from there the effluent was withdrawn by membrane separation using a watson marlow peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps group usa with suction backwashing functioning in cycles of 9 min suction 1 min backwash the a recycling flow of 500 of the influent flow was imposed from the membrane tank to the first chamber using another watson marlow peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps group usa the bioreactor was fed with salinity amended urban wastewater from the start up to create this influent urban wastewater was collected from the los vados wwtp in granada spain and stored in a tank this wastewater was mixed with tap water amended with nacl to rise its electric conductivity of 50 ms cm 1 nacl has been traditionally used to increase salinity of wastewater for the purpose of saline urban wastewater treatment 14 however the use of other different salts in order to simulate urban wastewater mixed with seawater is a promising future prospect for saline wastewater treatment the mixing was controlled electronically by a topax lf1 conductivity module lutz jesco gmbh germany which was connected to two watson marlow peristaltic pumps one pumping from the regular urban wastewater tank and another from the 50 ms cm 1 salinity amended tap water tank a conductivity sensor measured the conductivity of the salinity amended influent wastewater and its temperature continuously in the mixing tank providing their values to the module automatically the conductivity control changed the electric conductivity of the influent wastewater depending on the desired scenario of operation the change in influent wastewater conductivity in the mixing tank was achieved by addition of 50 ms cm 1 electric conductivity salinity amended tap water to increase the conductivity addition of regular salinity urban wastewater to decrease the conductivity prior to the experimentation process the automatic conductivity control was tested and modified properly in order to provide accurate electric conductivities and in order to optimize the time needed to change water conductivity during cyclical conditions the four salinity scenarios were i constant salinity at 6 5 ms cm 1 3 6 g l 1 nacl mc ii tidal variable salinity with maximum electric conductivity of 6 5 ms cm 1 3 6 g l 1 nacl for 6 h and minimum of natural urban wastewater conductivity 0 5 g l 1 nacl for 6 h mv iii tidal variable salinity with maximum electric conductivity of 8 5 ms cm 1 4 8 g l 1 nacl for 6 h and minimum of natural urban wastewater conductivity 0 5 g l 1 nacl for 6 h hv iv tidal variable salinity with maximum electric conductivity of 4 5 ms cm 1 2 4 g l 1 nacl for 6 h and minimum of natural urban wastewater conductivity 0 5 g l 1 nacl for 6 h lv the hydraulic retention time was set to 6 h and the total suspended solids concentration in the systems was controlled around 2500 mg l 1 a summary of the conditions tested are shown in table s1 2 2 characterization of performance of the bioreactors the determination of influent and effluent biological oxygen demand at day 5 bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss were done following established protocols 18 the measurement of nitrogenous ions nh4 no2 and no3 was done by the means of ionic chromatography following gonzalez martinez et al 19 for this purpose the samples were collected and immediately filtered in a 0 45 Î¼m pore diameter filter then immediately assayed on the ion chromatograph the ion chromatograph used a metrosep c2 150 cation column and a metrosep a supp 4 250 anion column for measurements nitric acid dipicolinic acid was used as eluent for the cation column while carbonate bicarbonate was used as eluent for the anion columns calibration curves were developed for ammonium nitrite and nitrate in order to achieve accurate measures with the ion chromatograph the results were used to determine the amount of nitrogen entering and leaving the hybrid mbbr mbr systems 2 3 kinetic characterization of bioreactor biomass the kinetic characterization of the biomass in the bioreactors was done by the means of respirometric tests 2 20 for each test 1 l of sample was collected from the bioreactor the sample was aerated for 18 h at 20 c temperature in the dark after aeration period the sample was tested in a gas flux static liquid respirometer bm advance multipurpose the sample was subjected to determination of heterotrophic kinetics autotrophic kinetics and endogenous respiration the determination of heterotrophic and autotrophic kinetics was measured as oxygen consumption of substrate over time and used the addition in three different dilutions 50 80 and 100 of 500 mg l 1 nacooch3 and of 150 mg l 1 nh4cl for heterotrophic and autotrophic kinetics respectively the determination of endogenous respiration was done by measuring oxygen consumption in the non aerated sample all tests were run at ph 7 5 0 25 and 20 c examples of the respirometric tests for the heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass for the variable salinity conditions of 4 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 2 4 biomass sampling dna extraction and massive parallel sequencing procedure biomass samples were collected from the membrane biofouling and the mixed liquor in the bioreactor following gonzalez martinez et al 10 sampling time between samples was of two weeks the samples were taken when the systems were operating under steady state conditions biofouling samples were submerged in sterile saline solution 0 9 nacl previous to centrifugation samples from biofouling and mixed liquor were centrifuged at room temperature during 10 min at 821 73 g for biomass liquid separation the biomass was kept at 20 c for a period not exceeding 7 days before being subjected to dna extraction using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa and following the manufacturer s protocol the dna extracts were kept at 20 c and sent to research and testing laboratory lubbock tx usa for massive parallel sequencing amplification procedure this was done using the illumina miseq apparatus and the illumina miseq reagents kit v3 the amplification of dna extracts targeted the v1 v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene of bacteria domain through the utilization of primer pair 28f 519r and pcr conditions given in rodriguez sanchez et al 9 2 5 bioinformatics pipeline for target gene massive parallel amplification the processing of raw data from massive parallel sequencing procedure was done using mothur 21 first the paired end sequences were merged into contigs avoiding the generation of ambiguous bases in the overlap region due to differences in same position nucleotide phred scores 22 the contigs were then screened to remove sequences with 0 ambiguous bases and 8 homopolymers the remaining contigs were aligned against the midas s123 2 1 3 release 23 which was previously aligned against the silva nr v128 release both alignments used a kmer searching method with 8 bp kmer size and needleman alignment conditions the aligned sequences were forced to start and end at the primers positions removing all sequences that failed to align properly the remaining contigs were then checked for chimeras using vsearch 24 implemented in mothur and considering a self reference for chimera detection all non chimeric contigs were then taxonomically classified using the midas s123 2 1 3 release as template and using the k nearest neighbor method searching by kmers of 8 bp size all contigs that failed to classify as bacteria domain were eliminated from the analysis then contigs were clustered into otus in a 97 similarity threshold using vsearch implemented in mothur and through the abundance based greedy clustering method 25 26 after clustering all singleton otus were removed from the analysis and the remaining sequences within each otu were used to compute a consensus taxonomy for each otu 2 6 coverage analysis and diversity indices of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples the sequencing coverage of each sample was checked by redundancy abundance weighted coverage calculations using nonpareil software 27 the computations were done taking a 50 minimum overlap and a 95 minimum identity and 1000 sequences query set size as standard parameters offered by the software 48 the Î± diversity indices of shannon and simpson were calculated using mothur 2 7 exploration of massive parallel sequencing samples otu structure and composition of oligotypes of biofouling relevant otus the reads of all massive parallel sequencing generated through the bioinformatics pipeline were taken for the similarity analysis of the samples studied applying the statistical principles of compositional statistics 28 29 for an exploration of the data the out tables and composition of oligotypess were treated using zcomponents package implemented in r software subjected to a bayesian multiplicative replacement of zero values using the count zero multiplicative method the treated data was then transformed by the centered log ratio clr using codapack software the transformed data was subjected to a singular value decomposition svd utilizing r in order to obtain differences among samples derived from their otu variance the results from the svd were plotted in principal components analysis pca manner using r for quantitative analyses the zero replacement and clr were conducted by generating a distribution using the data and computed by 128 monte carlo replicates drawn from a dirichlet distribution using aldex2 package implemented in r the obtained data was then used for calculation of the expected effect size between biofouling and mixed liquor biomass for each salinity scenario 2 8 analysis of dissimilarity to determine otus important for biofouling the structure of otus was analyzed in order to observe which otus contributed more to dissimilarity among samples this was done by the means of simper analysis which was computed based on bray curtis distance using pastv3 software the samples were clustered in 8 different groups attending to influent maximum salinity 4 5 6 5 or 8 5 ms cm 1 salinity conditions constant or variable and biomass characteristics membrane biofouling or mixed liquor 2 9 oligotyping analysis of otus of interest for biofouling the otus of interest were defined as those with 5 in at least one sample of biofouling at any given operational conditions and with 1 dissimilarity contribution as per simper analysis for oligotyping an analysis based on shannon entropy was calculated for all aligned sequences within each otu separately 30 then unraveling of the composition of oligotypess for each of the otus was done based on shannon entropy results and by iterative computation by increasing the number of highest entropy components for oligotypes structure generation until all oligotypes with 100 sequences attained a total purity score 0 90 okazaki et al 2017 removal of noise during the oligotyping process was set as i each oligotype had to appear in at least one sample ii each oligotype had to account for at least 1 relative abundance in at least one sample iii each oligotype had a substantive abundance of 30 31 2 10 multivariate redundancy analysis the dominant otus in the global community were used to compute a multivariate redundancy analysis rda in order to capture their susceptibility to environmental parameters of influent bod5 cod tn and salinity loading and to the performance of the bioreactors for this purpose the clr escalated otu community structure was taken on the other hand the values of environmental parameters were escalated to log variable 1 when needed with both datasets a multivariate redundancy analysis was done by 499 unconstrained monte carlo simulations within a full permutation model using canoco 4 5 for windows 32 two rda linking influent characteristics with otus were calculated in order to observe trends among hv mv and lv scenarios and between mv and mc scenarios separately 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance parameters of the bioreactors under different salinity conditions the organic matter removal performance of the bioreactors under the four salinity conditions measured as bod5 and cod was efficient the constant salinity scenario attained a performance of 98 09 and 88 55 respectively the scenarios of tidal like variable salinity with peak salinity at 4 5 6 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 obtained respectively 99 37 and 80 44 99 51 and 88 64 and 90 44 and 76 05 for bod5 and cod the lower values obtained for the 8 5 ms cm 1 conditions and the similarities between the other scenarios could indicate that the hybrid mbbr mbr was affected by saline influents at peak salinities higher than 6 5 ms cm 1 on the other hand the removal of nitrogen was of poor efficiency the variable salinity scenarios removed 59 59 2 09 at 4 5 ms cm 1 peak 30 85 8 18 at 6 5 ms cm 1 and 25 15 2 01 for 8 5 ms cm 1 peak for the constant 6 5 ms cm 1 salinity scenario the nitrogen removal was of 29 34 7 00 this trend showed that ammonium oxidation efficiency dropped dramatically when the peak salinity increased past the 4 5 ms cm 1 therefore total nitrogen removal was affected when salinity higher than about 2 4 g l 1 was encountered in the bioreactor it has been claimed that sharp increase in salinity could cause an inhibition of nitrification in hybrid mbbr mbr systems 3 in general it has been shown that acclimatization of hybrid mbbr mbr systems to salinity after steady state operation under regular salinity wastewater allows for adaptation of biomass and thus yield efficient organic matter removal and nitrification 33 in such case cod removal and ammonium oxidation were of 81 20 and 63 20 respectively operating at 15 g l 1 on the other hand it has been proposed that start up of the mbbr mbr system under saline influent conditions results in lower cod elimination and nh4 oxidation 2 20 9 the performance data collected under saline influent operation in this experiment suggested that there is a very important implication of maximum salinity values in the treatment of saline wastewater future implementation of full scale saline wastewater treatment systems must take into account the maximum salinity variation in their influents in order to obtain good performances especially in nitrogen removal 3 2 kinetic characterization of the bioreactors the respirometric tests developed over the biomass in the systems showed differences between the salinity scenarios constant 6 5 variable 6 5 variable 4 5 and variable 8 5 ms cm 1 in terms of kinetic monod growth model parameters table s2 and rate of substrate utilization rsu fig 2 the rsu for both autrotrophic and heterotrophic biomass clearly differed between the constant salinity and variable salinity scenarios under the constant salinity scenario the rsu remained constant regardless of the substrate added while for the variable salinity conditions the biomass had faster kinetics with higher substrate concentrations these results showed that the kinetics of the hybrid mbbr mbr was affected by influent salinity conditions this behavior could be caused by the changing conditions of the variable salinity scenarios forcing the microbial biomass to adapt and therefore favoring those who had a marked r strategist growth pattern on the other hand constant salinity would favor microbial phylotypes adapted to salinity conditions which could develop under a k strategist growth pattern lower influent salinity concentrations were related to faster kinetics in both heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass for heterotrophs and autotrophs 4 5 ms cm 1 attained the fastest kinetics on the other hand 8 5 ms cm 1 attained the slowest kinetics in all cases for heterotrophs constant salinity conditions yielded faster kinetics at 6 5 ms cm 1 and only the variable 8 5 ms cm 1 scenario showed significantly lower kinetics than all others interestingly constant salinity conditions at 6 5 ms cm 1 yielded faster kinetics that variable conditions at 6 5 ms cm 1 scenario in this sense the heterotrophic kinetics showed that the biomass was more stressed under variable salinity than under constant salinity in the case of autotrophs the influent salinity concentration had a profound impact with kinetics for salinities under 4 5 ms cm 1 reaching values 20 fold to 30 fold higher compared with the other scenarios this was related to the higher tn removal performance of 4 5 ms cm 1 scenario with respect to the others the slower kinetics for the 8 5 ms cm 1 scenario were related to its lower removal performance in terms of bod5 cod and tn these results are linked to those obtained for performance with faster kinetics being related to higher removal efficiencies the cell decay rate was 4 fold higher for the constant salinity conditions than for the variable salinity conditions this result showed that influent salinity conditions pressure the microbial community in the hybrid mbbr mbr and cause a much higher cell death than the variable salinity conditions the kinetics results demonstrated that the microbial communities had a different behavior for constant and variable salinity conditions as well lower microbial activity was found for higher peak salinities which affected drastically the kinetics of autotrophic biomass slower kinetics for higher peak salinities suggested that operation of hybrid mbbr mbr systems under saline wastewater should take into account this fact in order to develop tools for efficient treatment such as increasing the hydraulic retention time at higher salinity peaks 3 3 metagenomic coverage of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples the metagenomic coverage showed that all samples successfully captured the bacterial diversity of the ecosystems analyzed this was highlighted by the high sequencing coverages minimum of 99 67 which suggested that contigs obtained by massive parallel sequencing offered a description of all bacterial species within the biological samples studied the high actual sequencing efforts that which was actually sequenced with minimum of 21 07 mbp and the low expected required efforts for nearly complete coverage how much sequencing was expected to be needed to reach the limit of 100 coverage which was greater than 0 only in lvfb1 sample also suggested that massive parallel sequencing could determine all bacterial species in the biological samples table s3 3 4 diversity indices of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples the Î± diversity indices of all samples showed that all of them had high evenness and diversity as determined by the values of shannon h and inverse simpson 1 d indices overall evenness was higher at constant salinity conditions followed by 6 5 ms cm 1 tidal like variable salinity the lowest value was related to 4 5 ms cm 1 tidal like variable salinity with respect to diversity as observed by shannon index the highest value corresponded to constant salinity conditions followed by 8 5 ms cm 1 tidal like variable scenario in general both biofouling and mixed liquor samples had similar evenness and diversities table s4 it has been reported that salinity build up in mbr systems trended to increase the shannon diversity index values which was reported to be related to the growth of halotolerant bacteria replacing those that could not adapt to increasing salinity conditions 34 on the other hand the higher evenness and diversity at constant salinity conditions suggested that tidal like variable influent salinity was detrimental for the bacterial community as a whole promoting fewer phylotypes that could adapt to the cycles of salinity no salinity conditions this result aimed that operation under variable salinity conditions create an environmental stress for bioreactor communities and thus leads to the necessity of a careful monitoring of such systems to achieve good performance 3 5 exploration of massive parallel sequencing samples otu structure the pca plot showing the results from the singular value decomposition of clr escalated otu table demonstrated that there was higher similarity among hv mv and lv samples than among mc samples with a clear grouping of samples with respect to influent salinity conditions fig 3 this suggested that bacterial otu diversity in the mixed liquor and biofouling at variable salinity scenarios was much similar than for constant salinity scenario the similarity observed between attached biofilm and suspended biomass in tidal like variable scenarios could be caused by difficult adaptation of the bacterial otus to variable salinity reducing the diversity in the environments the calculation of the effect size for the otu tables of the four scenarios yielded many otus with statistically significant differences between the mixed liquor and the biofouling among the four salinity scenarios 1 effect size fig 4 this result is supported by previous literature in which it was shown that biological samples in mbr systems subjected to different salinity build ups tend to cluster when salinity conditions were identical 34 in this sense these results suggested that influent salinity conditions play a very important role in the development of bacterial communities in membrane based technologies 3 6 bacterial community structure of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples 3 6 1 otus of importance for biofouling among the dominant otus in 16s rrna gene massive parallel sequencing samples only 5 were considered as representative for biofouling fig 5 bf otu000001 contributed to biofouling in all tidal like variable scenarios but was absent at constant salinity conditions in the same manner bf otu000002 and bf otu000015 were only important for hv while bf otu000003 and bf otu000004 were present only at mv and lv scenarios respectively on the other hand bf otu000009 was important only in the biofouling at mc all these otus accounted for more than 1 dissimilarity contribution following the results of simper analysis table s5 in this way regardless of the similarities found in evenness diversity and bacterial community structure as shown by Î± diversity and svd pca analyses otus causing biofouling were very dependent on the salinity conditions this may indicate that biofouling process is caused by the presence of certain adapted otus with biofilm formation capacity that are unique for each set of conditions tested therefore suggesting that biofouling is a more local driven process in microbiological terms it has been reported that influent wastewater salinity exerts an influence over the biofouling microbial communities showing that influent wastewater salinity conditions dramatically change the bacterial communities in the membrane fouling of lab scale mbr systems 35 this supports the results found in this study moreover the presence of core microorganisms causing membrane biofouling in contrast to the presence of randomly selected biofouling related phylotypes has also been reported elsewhere 36 this also supports the results obtained in this study in which different bacterial otus with different taxonomies were found to prevail in membrane biofouling under different salinity conditions bf otu000001 classified as a xanthomonadaceae family member showed to be important for biofouling at variable salinity conditions and dominated biofouling at lv 2 56 33 00 otu bf otu000002 was also classified as xanthomonadaceae family attaining high abundance at hv 16 93 21 70 the other biofouling related otu for hv conditions bf otu000015 1 32 5 33 was classified as thermomonas genus which also belongs to xanthomonadaceae family moreover at mv conditions the most important otu in terms of biofouling bf otu000003 11 28 21 10 was related to rhodanobacter genus at lv otu bf otu000004 4 90 6 89 affiliated to mizugakiibacter genus was also related to biofouling both rhodanobacter genus and mizugakiibacter genus are members of xanthomonadaceae family thus xanthomonadaceae family was found to cause biofouling at all tidal like variable conditions highlighting its negative role on fouling in membrane processes rhodanobacter genus has been found in mbbr mbr systems 6 9 and its nitrite oxidation capacity in autotrophic nitrogen removal systems has been reported 1 rhodanobacter genus as well as mizugakiibacter genus can develop chemoautotrophic denitrification using ferrous iron 37 nevertheless metabolic capability of mizugakiibacter also contained aerobic oxidation of multiple organic substrates 38 the metabolic flexibility of rhodanobacter and mizugakiibacter which can grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions give them an ecological advantage for growth in both aerobic and anaerobic zones of biofouling on the other hand thermomonas genus can oxidize ammonium fast and efficiently at high concentrations and utilize n acetylglucosamine as organic carbon source under aerobic conditions 20 39 40 on the contrary at mc conditions xanthomonadaceae family members did not appear as important biofouling otus instead showing the presence of genus mycobacterium related bacteria in bf otu000009 among all salinity scenarios expected effect size suggested that there were no significant differences for otus important in biofouling at lv and mc in this sense the results suggested that biofouling related otus at lv and mc were not promoted in membrane biofilm with respect to mixed liquor for the other scenarios bf otu000003 for mv and bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000015 for hv were found to have significant different abundance in biofouling compared to mixed liquor it is possible that certain biofouling related otus in these salinity scenarios could find a relevant ecological niche in membrane biofilm thus attachment to surfaces would promote their growth the results from the bacterial community structure of biofouling under the four salinity conditions tested demonstrated that salinity conditions greatly affected the dominant phylotypes in biofouling this was shown in the high relative abundance of xanthomonadaceae family at tidal like variable conditions and its absence at constant salinity conditions in addition the proliferation of specialized biofouling otus at all different conditions suggested that this process is driven by local unique phylotypes that are not consistent at all conditions tested this result suggested that control of biofouling by quorum sensing inhibitors 41 which has been proposed as a plausible strategy for mitigation of biofouling 42 is in practice more difficult to control in saline wastewater since biofouling important otus bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000003 bf otu000004 bf otu000009 bf otu000015 seemed to be very case specific in this way more tests should be derived in order to elucidate the practical application of quorum sensing biofouling in membrane based technologies 3 6 2 dominant mixed liquor otus some of the biofouling related otus were also dominant in the mixed liquor samples such as bf otu000001 for mv and mc bf otu000002 for hv lv mv and mc bf otu000003 for mv bf otu000004 for lv or bf otu000009 for mc nevertheless other otus were dominant members in the mixed liquor such as bf otu000006 and bf otu000016 for hv bf otu000012 for lv bf otu000005 and bf otu000013 for mv and bf otu000005 bf otu000007 and bf otu000014 for mc among these otus all had a dissimilarity contribution higher than 1 as per simper analysis except for bf otu000016 0 9928 and bf otu000014 0 7108 suggesting that they defined dissimilarity of biological samples table s5 all these otus were related to different phylogenies namely chitinophagaceae family sphingopyxis genus parvibaculum genus bradyrhizobiaceae family comamonas and ottowia genera ottowia genus was found of importance in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating salinity wastewater due to their capability for complete heterotrophic conversion of nh4 to n2 and biofilm formation 9 comamonas genus has also been proposed as heterotrophic nitrifier 19 many sphingopyxis and parvibaculum genera strains are heterotrophic and have been isolated from activated sludge or marine environments 43 45 none of these were taxonomically related with xanthomonadaceae family which showed a phylogenetic differentiation between mixed liquor communities and biofouling important otus bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000003 bf otu000004 bf otu000009 bf otu000015 in this way it is possible that growth of biofouling in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating saline wastewater is essentially driven by xanthomonadaceae family and thus controlling this taxonomic group could enhance the protection of this technology against biofouling when treating saline influents 3 6 3 autotrophic ammonium oxidizers and autotrophic nitrite oxidizers it has been demonstrated that the presence of autotrophic ammonium and nitrite oxidizers aob and nob respectively in mbr systems helps prevent its biofouling 11 the observed diversity of these phylotypes within the hybrid mbbr mbr systems was specifically analyzed showing 26 otus classified as nitrobacter genus 36 as unclassified nitrosomonadaceae family members 14 as nitrosomonas genus 18 as nitrosospira genus and 2 as uncultured nitrosomonadaceae family members their relative abundance was low in the hybrid mbbr mbr systems at all salinity scenarios with mean values between 0 01 and 0 70 fig s3 there was a higher representation of aob than nob at all salinity scenarios in both biofouling and mixed liquor also nitrite oxidizing nitrobacter seemed to be affected by variable salinity conditions since its relative abundance was more than three fold higher in the constant salinity scenario than in all others which suggested a high inhibition of autotrophic nitrite oxidation under variable salinity conditions the unclassified nitrosomonadaceae family members were the prevalent members of aob found and were more abundant at constant salinity conditions and at 8 5 ms cm 1 variable salinity conditions which were the scenarios with higher salinity loadings in this sense it is possible that this unclassified nitrosomonadaceae is a halophile aob compared to other mbbr mbr systems treating regular urban wastewater there was a significant difference in the total relative abundance of both aob up to 7 of total community under regular salinity and nob up to 1 under regular salinity conditions 6 moreover for regular conditions the dominant aob were nitrosospira and nitrosomonas genera while an unclassified nitrosomonadaceae family member outcompeted these genera at saline wastewater treatment in this sense the influent salinity conditions do have an effect over the diversity and relative abundance of aob and nob 3 7 oligotype structure of otus of interest in biofouling the important otus in the biofouling bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000003 bf otu000004 bf otu000009 bf otu000015 were subjected to an oligotyping analysis in order to check for certain oligotypes involved in the formation of biofouling fig 6 among these otus bf otu000009 and bf otu000015 did not have any oligotypes meeting the criteria imposed during the analysis 1 relative abundance in at least one sample substantive abundance 30 for bf otu000004 which was related to mizugakiibacter genus the composition of oligotypes showed only one oligotype accounting for 25 30 of total otu abundance for the remaining otus bf otu000001 bf otu000002 and bf otu000003 the oligotype structure showed a myriad of oligotypes with similar abundance contribution at all samples were the otu was found in this sense the dominant biofouling otus for the four salinity scenarios did not showed the predominance of a certain oligotype related with biofouling a pca analyses over the oligotype structure of the otu bf otu000001 showed that variable salinity scenarios had more similar oligotypes structure fig s2 also there was a differentiation between the fixed and suspended biomass with respect to composition of oligotypes for otus bf otu000002 bf otu000003 and bf otu000004 in this sense the data showed that different salinity conditions and different biomass configurations affected the composition of oligotypess of biofouling relevant otus in the experiment thus even though biofouling process could be related to certain otus that even shared phylogeny at family level in some cases there were not preferred oligotypes in terms of biofouling showing the capability of many different oligotypes to form biofilms over membranes furthermore no differences in oligotypes structure were found between biofouling and mixed liquor samples suggesting that biofouling related composition of oligotypes was shared with mixed liquor therefore otu was the most detailed phylogenetic trait that defined the potential for biofouling and relative abundance of all oligotypes within an otu was the only parameter discerning the importance of the otu in biofouling 3 8 multivariate redundancy analysis there was a clear linkage between several dominant otus in the bioreactors at different salinity scenarios and the removal efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen fig 7 a among these otus bf otu000013 bf otu000007 and bf otu000003 were strongly correlated with cod and bod5 removal these were dominant otus related to comamonas ottowia and rhodanobacter genera respectively these three genera have been reported from membrane based systems treating saline wastewater and their versatile metabolic capabilities for organic matter removal nitrification and or denitrification have been reported 2 20 9 on the other hand otus bf otu000001 bf otu000004 and bf otu000012 affiliated to xanthomonadaceae family and mizugakiibacter and parvibaculum genera were strongly correlated with tn removal in this sense these three phylotypes could be of importance in nitrification and or denitrification processes in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating saline wastewater accordingly these three groups have been described for denitrifying metabolisms such as autotrophic denitrification for xanthomonadaceae family in bench scale reactors treating synthetic wastewater 46 reduction of nitrate to nitrite in pure cultures of mizugakiibacter sediminis strains 38 and nitrite reduction in biological denitrifying processes related to parvibaculum genus 47 moreover mizugakiibacter has been reported as denitrifier in membrane based wastewater treatment technologies 9 as well as parvibaculum 12 the rda comparing mc and mv scenarios showed that the majority of dominant otus were promoted at lower influent bod5 cod tn and salinity loading fig 7b otus important for biofouling at these scenarios such as bf otu000001 bf otu000003 or bf otu000009 were negatively correlated with these variables on the other hand the otus important for biofouling for the tidal variable salinity scenarios appeared to be influenced differently by organic matter nitrogen and salinity in the influent fig 7c in this sense otus bf otu000001 and bf otu000004 were positively correlated with influent organic matter and negatively with influent total nitrogen and salinity the opposite occurred for otus bf otu000002 bf otu000006 and bf otu000015 thus the rda for tidal variable scenarios showed that important biofouling otus were indeed sensitive to influent conditions but changes in these would trigger the apparition of different biofouling otus thus not eliminating this operational problem these findings have also been reported by previous research conducted over the microbial communities in membrane biofilm of membrane bioreactors operating under salinity shocks 35 and over the membrane biofilm of different full scale membrane bioreactors 36 in light of this different operational conditions did not offer better scenarios for mitigation of biofouling but different ecological niches for biofouling forming otus for microbial kinetics otus bf otu00012 and bf otu00020 were strongly correlated with maximum growth rate for the heterotrophic fraction and bf otu00001 and bf otu00004 with maximum growth rate for the autotrophic fraction these data suggested that xanthomonadaceae family members were strongly correlated with ammonium oxidation activity while parvibaculum genus and an acetobacteraceae family member were correlated with organic matter degradation in the system showing an r strategist behavior other otus were strongly and negatively correlated with half saturation constant for autotrophs classified as rhodanobacter ottowia and comamonas genera and a microbacteriaceae family member this suggested that these phylotypes were correlated with ammonium oxidation in the system showing a k strategist behavior three phylotypes were strongly and negatively correlated with half saturation constant for the heterotrophic fraction namely thermomonas genus sphingopyxis genus and a xanthomonadaceae family member again xanthomonadacae family members were correlated with organic matter degradation showing a k strategist pattern in this way this result suggested that xanthomonadaceae family members have a beneficial effect over the hybrid mbbr mbr system in spite of their prevalence in biofouling thus control of xanthomonadaceae in order to reduce biofouling might impact the performance in ammonium oxidation and organic matter degradation of the bioreactor more research is needed in order to discern the beneficial or detrimental control of xanthomonadaceae family phylotypes in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating saline wastewater 4 conclusions the investigation of the bacterial communities in the bioreactors showed that both mixed liquor and biofouling communities were more similar under variable salinity conditions than under constant salinity conditions which could be attributed to low adaptability of wastewater bacteria to variable than to constant salinity regimes differences were observed in the relative abundance of dominant otus between biofouling and suspended biomass at all salinity scenarios suggesting that biofouling was related to changes in relative abundance of biofouling triggering otus variable salinity biofouling otus were related to several xanthomonadaceae family members such as thermomonas 4 54 relative abundance rhodanobacter 13 23 or mizugakiibacter 5 96 genera for the constant salinity conditions mycobacterium 4 60 was the main biofouling related otu oligotyping analysis showed that otus important for biofouling had the same composition of oligotypes in attached and suspended biomass and thus confirmed that biofouling differs from suspended biomass only in terms of relative abundance of certain biofouling triggering otus 25 76 204 63 increase for biofouling related otus the effect of influent wastewater characteristics over biofouling communities was observed for the dominant otus suggesting that variations in influent characteristics could promote different biofouling related otus but would not stop the process the results obtained aimed that operation of hybrid mbbr mbr under saline wastewater conditions yields a performance very related to influent salinity conditions maximum salinity and loading type and prevention of its biofouling could be accomplished by targeting activity of a handful of phylotypes and thus supporting the adequacy of quorum sensing antibiofouling treatments

14395,the system performance biomass kinetics and microbial community structure in biofouling and suspended biomass of a hybrid mbbr mbr system operating at 6 h of hydraulic retention time subjected to four different scenarios of salinity wastewater constant 6 5 ms cm 1 and tidal like variable at 4 5 6 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 was studied the performance of the bioreactors in terms of organic matter removal was efficient nevertheless only the scenario of variable 4 5 ms cm 1 showed good nitrogen removal 59 59 the salinity conditions exerted an effect over the kinetics of the system with rates of substrate utilization dependent on substrate for variable salinity conditions and non dependent for constant salinity conditions also higher peak salinities lead to lower rates of substrate utilization massive parallel sequencing showed that xanthomonadaceae family 2 57 33 00 and mycobacterium genus 4 70 dominated biofouling under variable and constant salinity conditions respectively principal component analyses showed higher community similarity between biofouling and suspended biomass under variable salinity conditions than for constant salinity however differences in biofouling related otus were observed between attached and suspended communities by the means of effect size quantification the composition of oligotypes of otus important for biofouling showed no differences between biofouling and suspended biomass at all salinity scenarios the results suggested that biofouling process could be mainly determined by increases in relative abundance of biofouling related otus in the attached biomass with respect to suspended biomass 25 76 204 63 increase the results obtained will be of importance for future design and implementation of strategies for operation and biofouling control of salinity wastewater treatment systems keywords biofouling hybrid mbbr mbr microbial kinetics oligotyping salinity wastewater 1 introduction discharge of wastewater is one of the main environmental problems of our era for the last century the activated sludge system has been the most used technology for the treatment of urban wastewater 1 however other technologies have emerged such as the membrane bioreactor mbr technology that offers several important advantages over the activated sludge such as reduced footprint operation at higher solids concentrations or very high removal efficiency of pathogens 2 furthermore mbr systems can be benefited by the implementation of an upstream moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr in which floating media are added to the bioreactor for the formation of attached biofilms in addition to suspended biofilms 3 the combined technology has been named as moving bed biofilm reactor membrane bioreactor mbbr mbr and its superior capacity to the mbr for the treatment of urban wastewater has been reported 4 7 in spite of this mbbr mbr systems as well as other membrane based technologies have to deal with the serious operational problem caused by the biofilm related clogging of membrane surface named as biofouling in this sense the mbbr mbr technology has been reported as less susceptible to biofouling than the mbr technology 8 biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms which can grow in suspension or attached to surfaces and that play a very important role in wastewater treatment systems barr et al 2016 the effect of biofilms in wastewater treatment systems is mostly beneficial because they are involved in the elimination of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorous 9 nevertheless biofilms can impact the performance of membrane systems because the adhesion of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances eps can clog membrane pores thus reducing the transmembrane pressure and decreasing efficiency of waste water treatment of the membrane system 10 in this context the analysis of the agents that cause membrane biofouling is a requirement in order to implement new practices for its control 11 12 both urban and industrial wastewater could have high salinity concentrations for industrial applications many manufacturing industries can raise salinity in industrial effluents such as seafood processing milk processing petroleum refining or textile manufacturing 13 in the case of urban wastewater the increase in salinity concentration over regular values could be caused by snow melting activities seawater toilet flushing or intrusion of seawater in coastal wastewater treatment plants 14 these increases in salinity exert pressure over the microbial communities in wastewater treatment systems which become negatively affected due to increase in cell mortality rate and decrease in microbial metabolism among others 15 16 thus leading to inefficiencies in wastewater treatment processes 17 the capability of the hybrid mbbr mbr system for the treatment of salinity wastewater has been proven 2 9 nevertheless an in depth study on the effect of different salinity conditions over the performance microbial kinetics microbial community structure and biofouling of this technology has not been attempted to date in this research a hybrid mbbr mbr system was operated at 6 h hydraulic retention time and under four different salinity conditions constant at 6 5 ms cm 1 and tidal like variable with maximums at 4 5 6 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 under these operational conditions the performance of the system its kinetics under the different salinity scenarios and microbial community structures of the membrane biofouling and suspended biomass present in the bioreactor were studied in order to evaluate the influence of the salinity conditions on this novel technology the microbial community analyses were done based on massive parallel sequencing to explore the otu ecology and oligotypes within important otus in the bioreactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor configuration and operation the bioreactor used in this study was a hybrid mbbr mbr system a schematic of the bioreactor is shown in fig 1 the bioreactor showed a configuration of four chambers and a separated membrane tank the four chambers were equal and had an operational volume of 6 l each the membrane tank had an operational volume of 4 32 l the first third and fourth chambers contained k1 carriers density of 0 92 0 96 g cm 3 anox kaldnes as norway accounting for a volume of 35 of the total volume of the chamber and adding to a total specific biofilm surface area for the whole bioreactor of 111 7 m2 m 3 the aeration of the first third and fourth chambers was accomplished by the means of bottom displaced fine bubble diffusers afd 270 ecotec sa spain and air compressors aco 500 hailea china measured by rotameters 2100 model tecfluid sa spain and regulated using a valve the second chamber was under anoxic conditions since no aeration was provided and therefore its mixing was accomplished by continuous agitation by a mechanical stirrer multi mixer mm 1000 biosan laboratories inc usa the membrane tank was aerated by a coarse bubble diffuser cap 3 ecotec sa spain and by an air compressor aco 500 hailea china which flow was continuously measured by a rotameter 2100 model tecfluid sa spain and regulated using a valve an ultrafiltration membrane module was displaced inside the membrane tank in submerged configuration and was composed by 0 04 Î¼m pore diameter hollow fibers of polyvinylidene fluoride with a core reinforcement of polyester displaced vertically micronet porous fibers sl spain the fibers measured 2 45 mm for external diameter and 1 10 mm for internal diameter and the membrane accounted for a total membrane area of 0 2 m2 the influent flow was forced to enter through the first chamber by the means of a watson marlow peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps group usa and to pass all of them discharging from the fourth chamber into the membrane tank from there the effluent was withdrawn by membrane separation using a watson marlow peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps group usa with suction backwashing functioning in cycles of 9 min suction 1 min backwash the a recycling flow of 500 of the influent flow was imposed from the membrane tank to the first chamber using another watson marlow peristaltic pump watson marlow pumps group usa the bioreactor was fed with salinity amended urban wastewater from the start up to create this influent urban wastewater was collected from the los vados wwtp in granada spain and stored in a tank this wastewater was mixed with tap water amended with nacl to rise its electric conductivity of 50 ms cm 1 nacl has been traditionally used to increase salinity of wastewater for the purpose of saline urban wastewater treatment 14 however the use of other different salts in order to simulate urban wastewater mixed with seawater is a promising future prospect for saline wastewater treatment the mixing was controlled electronically by a topax lf1 conductivity module lutz jesco gmbh germany which was connected to two watson marlow peristaltic pumps one pumping from the regular urban wastewater tank and another from the 50 ms cm 1 salinity amended tap water tank a conductivity sensor measured the conductivity of the salinity amended influent wastewater and its temperature continuously in the mixing tank providing their values to the module automatically the conductivity control changed the electric conductivity of the influent wastewater depending on the desired scenario of operation the change in influent wastewater conductivity in the mixing tank was achieved by addition of 50 ms cm 1 electric conductivity salinity amended tap water to increase the conductivity addition of regular salinity urban wastewater to decrease the conductivity prior to the experimentation process the automatic conductivity control was tested and modified properly in order to provide accurate electric conductivities and in order to optimize the time needed to change water conductivity during cyclical conditions the four salinity scenarios were i constant salinity at 6 5 ms cm 1 3 6 g l 1 nacl mc ii tidal variable salinity with maximum electric conductivity of 6 5 ms cm 1 3 6 g l 1 nacl for 6 h and minimum of natural urban wastewater conductivity 0 5 g l 1 nacl for 6 h mv iii tidal variable salinity with maximum electric conductivity of 8 5 ms cm 1 4 8 g l 1 nacl for 6 h and minimum of natural urban wastewater conductivity 0 5 g l 1 nacl for 6 h hv iv tidal variable salinity with maximum electric conductivity of 4 5 ms cm 1 2 4 g l 1 nacl for 6 h and minimum of natural urban wastewater conductivity 0 5 g l 1 nacl for 6 h lv the hydraulic retention time was set to 6 h and the total suspended solids concentration in the systems was controlled around 2500 mg l 1 a summary of the conditions tested are shown in table s1 2 2 characterization of performance of the bioreactors the determination of influent and effluent biological oxygen demand at day 5 bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod and total suspended solids tss were done following established protocols 18 the measurement of nitrogenous ions nh4 no2 and no3 was done by the means of ionic chromatography following gonzalez martinez et al 19 for this purpose the samples were collected and immediately filtered in a 0 45 Î¼m pore diameter filter then immediately assayed on the ion chromatograph the ion chromatograph used a metrosep c2 150 cation column and a metrosep a supp 4 250 anion column for measurements nitric acid dipicolinic acid was used as eluent for the cation column while carbonate bicarbonate was used as eluent for the anion columns calibration curves were developed for ammonium nitrite and nitrate in order to achieve accurate measures with the ion chromatograph the results were used to determine the amount of nitrogen entering and leaving the hybrid mbbr mbr systems 2 3 kinetic characterization of bioreactor biomass the kinetic characterization of the biomass in the bioreactors was done by the means of respirometric tests 2 20 for each test 1 l of sample was collected from the bioreactor the sample was aerated for 18 h at 20 c temperature in the dark after aeration period the sample was tested in a gas flux static liquid respirometer bm advance multipurpose the sample was subjected to determination of heterotrophic kinetics autotrophic kinetics and endogenous respiration the determination of heterotrophic and autotrophic kinetics was measured as oxygen consumption of substrate over time and used the addition in three different dilutions 50 80 and 100 of 500 mg l 1 nacooch3 and of 150 mg l 1 nh4cl for heterotrophic and autotrophic kinetics respectively the determination of endogenous respiration was done by measuring oxygen consumption in the non aerated sample all tests were run at ph 7 5 0 25 and 20 c examples of the respirometric tests for the heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass for the variable salinity conditions of 4 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 2 4 biomass sampling dna extraction and massive parallel sequencing procedure biomass samples were collected from the membrane biofouling and the mixed liquor in the bioreactor following gonzalez martinez et al 10 sampling time between samples was of two weeks the samples were taken when the systems were operating under steady state conditions biofouling samples were submerged in sterile saline solution 0 9 nacl previous to centrifugation samples from biofouling and mixed liquor were centrifuged at room temperature during 10 min at 821 73 g for biomass liquid separation the biomass was kept at 20 c for a period not exceeding 7 days before being subjected to dna extraction using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa and following the manufacturer s protocol the dna extracts were kept at 20 c and sent to research and testing laboratory lubbock tx usa for massive parallel sequencing amplification procedure this was done using the illumina miseq apparatus and the illumina miseq reagents kit v3 the amplification of dna extracts targeted the v1 v3 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene of bacteria domain through the utilization of primer pair 28f 519r and pcr conditions given in rodriguez sanchez et al 9 2 5 bioinformatics pipeline for target gene massive parallel amplification the processing of raw data from massive parallel sequencing procedure was done using mothur 21 first the paired end sequences were merged into contigs avoiding the generation of ambiguous bases in the overlap region due to differences in same position nucleotide phred scores 22 the contigs were then screened to remove sequences with 0 ambiguous bases and 8 homopolymers the remaining contigs were aligned against the midas s123 2 1 3 release 23 which was previously aligned against the silva nr v128 release both alignments used a kmer searching method with 8 bp kmer size and needleman alignment conditions the aligned sequences were forced to start and end at the primers positions removing all sequences that failed to align properly the remaining contigs were then checked for chimeras using vsearch 24 implemented in mothur and considering a self reference for chimera detection all non chimeric contigs were then taxonomically classified using the midas s123 2 1 3 release as template and using the k nearest neighbor method searching by kmers of 8 bp size all contigs that failed to classify as bacteria domain were eliminated from the analysis then contigs were clustered into otus in a 97 similarity threshold using vsearch implemented in mothur and through the abundance based greedy clustering method 25 26 after clustering all singleton otus were removed from the analysis and the remaining sequences within each otu were used to compute a consensus taxonomy for each otu 2 6 coverage analysis and diversity indices of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples the sequencing coverage of each sample was checked by redundancy abundance weighted coverage calculations using nonpareil software 27 the computations were done taking a 50 minimum overlap and a 95 minimum identity and 1000 sequences query set size as standard parameters offered by the software 48 the Î± diversity indices of shannon and simpson were calculated using mothur 2 7 exploration of massive parallel sequencing samples otu structure and composition of oligotypes of biofouling relevant otus the reads of all massive parallel sequencing generated through the bioinformatics pipeline were taken for the similarity analysis of the samples studied applying the statistical principles of compositional statistics 28 29 for an exploration of the data the out tables and composition of oligotypess were treated using zcomponents package implemented in r software subjected to a bayesian multiplicative replacement of zero values using the count zero multiplicative method the treated data was then transformed by the centered log ratio clr using codapack software the transformed data was subjected to a singular value decomposition svd utilizing r in order to obtain differences among samples derived from their otu variance the results from the svd were plotted in principal components analysis pca manner using r for quantitative analyses the zero replacement and clr were conducted by generating a distribution using the data and computed by 128 monte carlo replicates drawn from a dirichlet distribution using aldex2 package implemented in r the obtained data was then used for calculation of the expected effect size between biofouling and mixed liquor biomass for each salinity scenario 2 8 analysis of dissimilarity to determine otus important for biofouling the structure of otus was analyzed in order to observe which otus contributed more to dissimilarity among samples this was done by the means of simper analysis which was computed based on bray curtis distance using pastv3 software the samples were clustered in 8 different groups attending to influent maximum salinity 4 5 6 5 or 8 5 ms cm 1 salinity conditions constant or variable and biomass characteristics membrane biofouling or mixed liquor 2 9 oligotyping analysis of otus of interest for biofouling the otus of interest were defined as those with 5 in at least one sample of biofouling at any given operational conditions and with 1 dissimilarity contribution as per simper analysis for oligotyping an analysis based on shannon entropy was calculated for all aligned sequences within each otu separately 30 then unraveling of the composition of oligotypess for each of the otus was done based on shannon entropy results and by iterative computation by increasing the number of highest entropy components for oligotypes structure generation until all oligotypes with 100 sequences attained a total purity score 0 90 okazaki et al 2017 removal of noise during the oligotyping process was set as i each oligotype had to appear in at least one sample ii each oligotype had to account for at least 1 relative abundance in at least one sample iii each oligotype had a substantive abundance of 30 31 2 10 multivariate redundancy analysis the dominant otus in the global community were used to compute a multivariate redundancy analysis rda in order to capture their susceptibility to environmental parameters of influent bod5 cod tn and salinity loading and to the performance of the bioreactors for this purpose the clr escalated otu community structure was taken on the other hand the values of environmental parameters were escalated to log variable 1 when needed with both datasets a multivariate redundancy analysis was done by 499 unconstrained monte carlo simulations within a full permutation model using canoco 4 5 for windows 32 two rda linking influent characteristics with otus were calculated in order to observe trends among hv mv and lv scenarios and between mv and mc scenarios separately 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance parameters of the bioreactors under different salinity conditions the organic matter removal performance of the bioreactors under the four salinity conditions measured as bod5 and cod was efficient the constant salinity scenario attained a performance of 98 09 and 88 55 respectively the scenarios of tidal like variable salinity with peak salinity at 4 5 6 5 and 8 5 ms cm 1 obtained respectively 99 37 and 80 44 99 51 and 88 64 and 90 44 and 76 05 for bod5 and cod the lower values obtained for the 8 5 ms cm 1 conditions and the similarities between the other scenarios could indicate that the hybrid mbbr mbr was affected by saline influents at peak salinities higher than 6 5 ms cm 1 on the other hand the removal of nitrogen was of poor efficiency the variable salinity scenarios removed 59 59 2 09 at 4 5 ms cm 1 peak 30 85 8 18 at 6 5 ms cm 1 and 25 15 2 01 for 8 5 ms cm 1 peak for the constant 6 5 ms cm 1 salinity scenario the nitrogen removal was of 29 34 7 00 this trend showed that ammonium oxidation efficiency dropped dramatically when the peak salinity increased past the 4 5 ms cm 1 therefore total nitrogen removal was affected when salinity higher than about 2 4 g l 1 was encountered in the bioreactor it has been claimed that sharp increase in salinity could cause an inhibition of nitrification in hybrid mbbr mbr systems 3 in general it has been shown that acclimatization of hybrid mbbr mbr systems to salinity after steady state operation under regular salinity wastewater allows for adaptation of biomass and thus yield efficient organic matter removal and nitrification 33 in such case cod removal and ammonium oxidation were of 81 20 and 63 20 respectively operating at 15 g l 1 on the other hand it has been proposed that start up of the mbbr mbr system under saline influent conditions results in lower cod elimination and nh4 oxidation 2 20 9 the performance data collected under saline influent operation in this experiment suggested that there is a very important implication of maximum salinity values in the treatment of saline wastewater future implementation of full scale saline wastewater treatment systems must take into account the maximum salinity variation in their influents in order to obtain good performances especially in nitrogen removal 3 2 kinetic characterization of the bioreactors the respirometric tests developed over the biomass in the systems showed differences between the salinity scenarios constant 6 5 variable 6 5 variable 4 5 and variable 8 5 ms cm 1 in terms of kinetic monod growth model parameters table s2 and rate of substrate utilization rsu fig 2 the rsu for both autrotrophic and heterotrophic biomass clearly differed between the constant salinity and variable salinity scenarios under the constant salinity scenario the rsu remained constant regardless of the substrate added while for the variable salinity conditions the biomass had faster kinetics with higher substrate concentrations these results showed that the kinetics of the hybrid mbbr mbr was affected by influent salinity conditions this behavior could be caused by the changing conditions of the variable salinity scenarios forcing the microbial biomass to adapt and therefore favoring those who had a marked r strategist growth pattern on the other hand constant salinity would favor microbial phylotypes adapted to salinity conditions which could develop under a k strategist growth pattern lower influent salinity concentrations were related to faster kinetics in both heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass for heterotrophs and autotrophs 4 5 ms cm 1 attained the fastest kinetics on the other hand 8 5 ms cm 1 attained the slowest kinetics in all cases for heterotrophs constant salinity conditions yielded faster kinetics at 6 5 ms cm 1 and only the variable 8 5 ms cm 1 scenario showed significantly lower kinetics than all others interestingly constant salinity conditions at 6 5 ms cm 1 yielded faster kinetics that variable conditions at 6 5 ms cm 1 scenario in this sense the heterotrophic kinetics showed that the biomass was more stressed under variable salinity than under constant salinity in the case of autotrophs the influent salinity concentration had a profound impact with kinetics for salinities under 4 5 ms cm 1 reaching values 20 fold to 30 fold higher compared with the other scenarios this was related to the higher tn removal performance of 4 5 ms cm 1 scenario with respect to the others the slower kinetics for the 8 5 ms cm 1 scenario were related to its lower removal performance in terms of bod5 cod and tn these results are linked to those obtained for performance with faster kinetics being related to higher removal efficiencies the cell decay rate was 4 fold higher for the constant salinity conditions than for the variable salinity conditions this result showed that influent salinity conditions pressure the microbial community in the hybrid mbbr mbr and cause a much higher cell death than the variable salinity conditions the kinetics results demonstrated that the microbial communities had a different behavior for constant and variable salinity conditions as well lower microbial activity was found for higher peak salinities which affected drastically the kinetics of autotrophic biomass slower kinetics for higher peak salinities suggested that operation of hybrid mbbr mbr systems under saline wastewater should take into account this fact in order to develop tools for efficient treatment such as increasing the hydraulic retention time at higher salinity peaks 3 3 metagenomic coverage of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples the metagenomic coverage showed that all samples successfully captured the bacterial diversity of the ecosystems analyzed this was highlighted by the high sequencing coverages minimum of 99 67 which suggested that contigs obtained by massive parallel sequencing offered a description of all bacterial species within the biological samples studied the high actual sequencing efforts that which was actually sequenced with minimum of 21 07 mbp and the low expected required efforts for nearly complete coverage how much sequencing was expected to be needed to reach the limit of 100 coverage which was greater than 0 only in lvfb1 sample also suggested that massive parallel sequencing could determine all bacterial species in the biological samples table s3 3 4 diversity indices of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples the Î± diversity indices of all samples showed that all of them had high evenness and diversity as determined by the values of shannon h and inverse simpson 1 d indices overall evenness was higher at constant salinity conditions followed by 6 5 ms cm 1 tidal like variable salinity the lowest value was related to 4 5 ms cm 1 tidal like variable salinity with respect to diversity as observed by shannon index the highest value corresponded to constant salinity conditions followed by 8 5 ms cm 1 tidal like variable scenario in general both biofouling and mixed liquor samples had similar evenness and diversities table s4 it has been reported that salinity build up in mbr systems trended to increase the shannon diversity index values which was reported to be related to the growth of halotolerant bacteria replacing those that could not adapt to increasing salinity conditions 34 on the other hand the higher evenness and diversity at constant salinity conditions suggested that tidal like variable influent salinity was detrimental for the bacterial community as a whole promoting fewer phylotypes that could adapt to the cycles of salinity no salinity conditions this result aimed that operation under variable salinity conditions create an environmental stress for bioreactor communities and thus leads to the necessity of a careful monitoring of such systems to achieve good performance 3 5 exploration of massive parallel sequencing samples otu structure the pca plot showing the results from the singular value decomposition of clr escalated otu table demonstrated that there was higher similarity among hv mv and lv samples than among mc samples with a clear grouping of samples with respect to influent salinity conditions fig 3 this suggested that bacterial otu diversity in the mixed liquor and biofouling at variable salinity scenarios was much similar than for constant salinity scenario the similarity observed between attached biofilm and suspended biomass in tidal like variable scenarios could be caused by difficult adaptation of the bacterial otus to variable salinity reducing the diversity in the environments the calculation of the effect size for the otu tables of the four scenarios yielded many otus with statistically significant differences between the mixed liquor and the biofouling among the four salinity scenarios 1 effect size fig 4 this result is supported by previous literature in which it was shown that biological samples in mbr systems subjected to different salinity build ups tend to cluster when salinity conditions were identical 34 in this sense these results suggested that influent salinity conditions play a very important role in the development of bacterial communities in membrane based technologies 3 6 bacterial community structure of target gene massive parallel sequencing samples 3 6 1 otus of importance for biofouling among the dominant otus in 16s rrna gene massive parallel sequencing samples only 5 were considered as representative for biofouling fig 5 bf otu000001 contributed to biofouling in all tidal like variable scenarios but was absent at constant salinity conditions in the same manner bf otu000002 and bf otu000015 were only important for hv while bf otu000003 and bf otu000004 were present only at mv and lv scenarios respectively on the other hand bf otu000009 was important only in the biofouling at mc all these otus accounted for more than 1 dissimilarity contribution following the results of simper analysis table s5 in this way regardless of the similarities found in evenness diversity and bacterial community structure as shown by Î± diversity and svd pca analyses otus causing biofouling were very dependent on the salinity conditions this may indicate that biofouling process is caused by the presence of certain adapted otus with biofilm formation capacity that are unique for each set of conditions tested therefore suggesting that biofouling is a more local driven process in microbiological terms it has been reported that influent wastewater salinity exerts an influence over the biofouling microbial communities showing that influent wastewater salinity conditions dramatically change the bacterial communities in the membrane fouling of lab scale mbr systems 35 this supports the results found in this study moreover the presence of core microorganisms causing membrane biofouling in contrast to the presence of randomly selected biofouling related phylotypes has also been reported elsewhere 36 this also supports the results obtained in this study in which different bacterial otus with different taxonomies were found to prevail in membrane biofouling under different salinity conditions bf otu000001 classified as a xanthomonadaceae family member showed to be important for biofouling at variable salinity conditions and dominated biofouling at lv 2 56 33 00 otu bf otu000002 was also classified as xanthomonadaceae family attaining high abundance at hv 16 93 21 70 the other biofouling related otu for hv conditions bf otu000015 1 32 5 33 was classified as thermomonas genus which also belongs to xanthomonadaceae family moreover at mv conditions the most important otu in terms of biofouling bf otu000003 11 28 21 10 was related to rhodanobacter genus at lv otu bf otu000004 4 90 6 89 affiliated to mizugakiibacter genus was also related to biofouling both rhodanobacter genus and mizugakiibacter genus are members of xanthomonadaceae family thus xanthomonadaceae family was found to cause biofouling at all tidal like variable conditions highlighting its negative role on fouling in membrane processes rhodanobacter genus has been found in mbbr mbr systems 6 9 and its nitrite oxidation capacity in autotrophic nitrogen removal systems has been reported 1 rhodanobacter genus as well as mizugakiibacter genus can develop chemoautotrophic denitrification using ferrous iron 37 nevertheless metabolic capability of mizugakiibacter also contained aerobic oxidation of multiple organic substrates 38 the metabolic flexibility of rhodanobacter and mizugakiibacter which can grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions give them an ecological advantage for growth in both aerobic and anaerobic zones of biofouling on the other hand thermomonas genus can oxidize ammonium fast and efficiently at high concentrations and utilize n acetylglucosamine as organic carbon source under aerobic conditions 20 39 40 on the contrary at mc conditions xanthomonadaceae family members did not appear as important biofouling otus instead showing the presence of genus mycobacterium related bacteria in bf otu000009 among all salinity scenarios expected effect size suggested that there were no significant differences for otus important in biofouling at lv and mc in this sense the results suggested that biofouling related otus at lv and mc were not promoted in membrane biofilm with respect to mixed liquor for the other scenarios bf otu000003 for mv and bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000015 for hv were found to have significant different abundance in biofouling compared to mixed liquor it is possible that certain biofouling related otus in these salinity scenarios could find a relevant ecological niche in membrane biofilm thus attachment to surfaces would promote their growth the results from the bacterial community structure of biofouling under the four salinity conditions tested demonstrated that salinity conditions greatly affected the dominant phylotypes in biofouling this was shown in the high relative abundance of xanthomonadaceae family at tidal like variable conditions and its absence at constant salinity conditions in addition the proliferation of specialized biofouling otus at all different conditions suggested that this process is driven by local unique phylotypes that are not consistent at all conditions tested this result suggested that control of biofouling by quorum sensing inhibitors 41 which has been proposed as a plausible strategy for mitigation of biofouling 42 is in practice more difficult to control in saline wastewater since biofouling important otus bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000003 bf otu000004 bf otu000009 bf otu000015 seemed to be very case specific in this way more tests should be derived in order to elucidate the practical application of quorum sensing biofouling in membrane based technologies 3 6 2 dominant mixed liquor otus some of the biofouling related otus were also dominant in the mixed liquor samples such as bf otu000001 for mv and mc bf otu000002 for hv lv mv and mc bf otu000003 for mv bf otu000004 for lv or bf otu000009 for mc nevertheless other otus were dominant members in the mixed liquor such as bf otu000006 and bf otu000016 for hv bf otu000012 for lv bf otu000005 and bf otu000013 for mv and bf otu000005 bf otu000007 and bf otu000014 for mc among these otus all had a dissimilarity contribution higher than 1 as per simper analysis except for bf otu000016 0 9928 and bf otu000014 0 7108 suggesting that they defined dissimilarity of biological samples table s5 all these otus were related to different phylogenies namely chitinophagaceae family sphingopyxis genus parvibaculum genus bradyrhizobiaceae family comamonas and ottowia genera ottowia genus was found of importance in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating salinity wastewater due to their capability for complete heterotrophic conversion of nh4 to n2 and biofilm formation 9 comamonas genus has also been proposed as heterotrophic nitrifier 19 many sphingopyxis and parvibaculum genera strains are heterotrophic and have been isolated from activated sludge or marine environments 43 45 none of these were taxonomically related with xanthomonadaceae family which showed a phylogenetic differentiation between mixed liquor communities and biofouling important otus bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000003 bf otu000004 bf otu000009 bf otu000015 in this way it is possible that growth of biofouling in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating saline wastewater is essentially driven by xanthomonadaceae family and thus controlling this taxonomic group could enhance the protection of this technology against biofouling when treating saline influents 3 6 3 autotrophic ammonium oxidizers and autotrophic nitrite oxidizers it has been demonstrated that the presence of autotrophic ammonium and nitrite oxidizers aob and nob respectively in mbr systems helps prevent its biofouling 11 the observed diversity of these phylotypes within the hybrid mbbr mbr systems was specifically analyzed showing 26 otus classified as nitrobacter genus 36 as unclassified nitrosomonadaceae family members 14 as nitrosomonas genus 18 as nitrosospira genus and 2 as uncultured nitrosomonadaceae family members their relative abundance was low in the hybrid mbbr mbr systems at all salinity scenarios with mean values between 0 01 and 0 70 fig s3 there was a higher representation of aob than nob at all salinity scenarios in both biofouling and mixed liquor also nitrite oxidizing nitrobacter seemed to be affected by variable salinity conditions since its relative abundance was more than three fold higher in the constant salinity scenario than in all others which suggested a high inhibition of autotrophic nitrite oxidation under variable salinity conditions the unclassified nitrosomonadaceae family members were the prevalent members of aob found and were more abundant at constant salinity conditions and at 8 5 ms cm 1 variable salinity conditions which were the scenarios with higher salinity loadings in this sense it is possible that this unclassified nitrosomonadaceae is a halophile aob compared to other mbbr mbr systems treating regular urban wastewater there was a significant difference in the total relative abundance of both aob up to 7 of total community under regular salinity and nob up to 1 under regular salinity conditions 6 moreover for regular conditions the dominant aob were nitrosospira and nitrosomonas genera while an unclassified nitrosomonadaceae family member outcompeted these genera at saline wastewater treatment in this sense the influent salinity conditions do have an effect over the diversity and relative abundance of aob and nob 3 7 oligotype structure of otus of interest in biofouling the important otus in the biofouling bf otu000001 bf otu000002 bf otu000003 bf otu000004 bf otu000009 bf otu000015 were subjected to an oligotyping analysis in order to check for certain oligotypes involved in the formation of biofouling fig 6 among these otus bf otu000009 and bf otu000015 did not have any oligotypes meeting the criteria imposed during the analysis 1 relative abundance in at least one sample substantive abundance 30 for bf otu000004 which was related to mizugakiibacter genus the composition of oligotypes showed only one oligotype accounting for 25 30 of total otu abundance for the remaining otus bf otu000001 bf otu000002 and bf otu000003 the oligotype structure showed a myriad of oligotypes with similar abundance contribution at all samples were the otu was found in this sense the dominant biofouling otus for the four salinity scenarios did not showed the predominance of a certain oligotype related with biofouling a pca analyses over the oligotype structure of the otu bf otu000001 showed that variable salinity scenarios had more similar oligotypes structure fig s2 also there was a differentiation between the fixed and suspended biomass with respect to composition of oligotypes for otus bf otu000002 bf otu000003 and bf otu000004 in this sense the data showed that different salinity conditions and different biomass configurations affected the composition of oligotypess of biofouling relevant otus in the experiment thus even though biofouling process could be related to certain otus that even shared phylogeny at family level in some cases there were not preferred oligotypes in terms of biofouling showing the capability of many different oligotypes to form biofilms over membranes furthermore no differences in oligotypes structure were found between biofouling and mixed liquor samples suggesting that biofouling related composition of oligotypes was shared with mixed liquor therefore otu was the most detailed phylogenetic trait that defined the potential for biofouling and relative abundance of all oligotypes within an otu was the only parameter discerning the importance of the otu in biofouling 3 8 multivariate redundancy analysis there was a clear linkage between several dominant otus in the bioreactors at different salinity scenarios and the removal efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen fig 7 a among these otus bf otu000013 bf otu000007 and bf otu000003 were strongly correlated with cod and bod5 removal these were dominant otus related to comamonas ottowia and rhodanobacter genera respectively these three genera have been reported from membrane based systems treating saline wastewater and their versatile metabolic capabilities for organic matter removal nitrification and or denitrification have been reported 2 20 9 on the other hand otus bf otu000001 bf otu000004 and bf otu000012 affiliated to xanthomonadaceae family and mizugakiibacter and parvibaculum genera were strongly correlated with tn removal in this sense these three phylotypes could be of importance in nitrification and or denitrification processes in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating saline wastewater accordingly these three groups have been described for denitrifying metabolisms such as autotrophic denitrification for xanthomonadaceae family in bench scale reactors treating synthetic wastewater 46 reduction of nitrate to nitrite in pure cultures of mizugakiibacter sediminis strains 38 and nitrite reduction in biological denitrifying processes related to parvibaculum genus 47 moreover mizugakiibacter has been reported as denitrifier in membrane based wastewater treatment technologies 9 as well as parvibaculum 12 the rda comparing mc and mv scenarios showed that the majority of dominant otus were promoted at lower influent bod5 cod tn and salinity loading fig 7b otus important for biofouling at these scenarios such as bf otu000001 bf otu000003 or bf otu000009 were negatively correlated with these variables on the other hand the otus important for biofouling for the tidal variable salinity scenarios appeared to be influenced differently by organic matter nitrogen and salinity in the influent fig 7c in this sense otus bf otu000001 and bf otu000004 were positively correlated with influent organic matter and negatively with influent total nitrogen and salinity the opposite occurred for otus bf otu000002 bf otu000006 and bf otu000015 thus the rda for tidal variable scenarios showed that important biofouling otus were indeed sensitive to influent conditions but changes in these would trigger the apparition of different biofouling otus thus not eliminating this operational problem these findings have also been reported by previous research conducted over the microbial communities in membrane biofilm of membrane bioreactors operating under salinity shocks 35 and over the membrane biofilm of different full scale membrane bioreactors 36 in light of this different operational conditions did not offer better scenarios for mitigation of biofouling but different ecological niches for biofouling forming otus for microbial kinetics otus bf otu00012 and bf otu00020 were strongly correlated with maximum growth rate for the heterotrophic fraction and bf otu00001 and bf otu00004 with maximum growth rate for the autotrophic fraction these data suggested that xanthomonadaceae family members were strongly correlated with ammonium oxidation activity while parvibaculum genus and an acetobacteraceae family member were correlated with organic matter degradation in the system showing an r strategist behavior other otus were strongly and negatively correlated with half saturation constant for autotrophs classified as rhodanobacter ottowia and comamonas genera and a microbacteriaceae family member this suggested that these phylotypes were correlated with ammonium oxidation in the system showing a k strategist behavior three phylotypes were strongly and negatively correlated with half saturation constant for the heterotrophic fraction namely thermomonas genus sphingopyxis genus and a xanthomonadaceae family member again xanthomonadacae family members were correlated with organic matter degradation showing a k strategist pattern in this way this result suggested that xanthomonadaceae family members have a beneficial effect over the hybrid mbbr mbr system in spite of their prevalence in biofouling thus control of xanthomonadaceae in order to reduce biofouling might impact the performance in ammonium oxidation and organic matter degradation of the bioreactor more research is needed in order to discern the beneficial or detrimental control of xanthomonadaceae family phylotypes in hybrid mbbr mbr systems treating saline wastewater 4 conclusions the investigation of the bacterial communities in the bioreactors showed that both mixed liquor and biofouling communities were more similar under variable salinity conditions than under constant salinity conditions which could be attributed to low adaptability of wastewater bacteria to variable than to constant salinity regimes differences were observed in the relative abundance of dominant otus between biofouling and suspended biomass at all salinity scenarios suggesting that biofouling was related to changes in relative abundance of biofouling triggering otus variable salinity biofouling otus were related to several xanthomonadaceae family members such as thermomonas 4 54 relative abundance rhodanobacter 13 23 or mizugakiibacter 5 96 genera for the constant salinity conditions mycobacterium 4 60 was the main biofouling related otu oligotyping analysis showed that otus important for biofouling had the same composition of oligotypes in attached and suspended biomass and thus confirmed that biofouling differs from suspended biomass only in terms of relative abundance of certain biofouling triggering otus 25 76 204 63 increase for biofouling related otus the effect of influent wastewater characteristics over biofouling communities was observed for the dominant otus suggesting that variations in influent characteristics could promote different biofouling related otus but would not stop the process the results obtained aimed that operation of hybrid mbbr mbr under saline wastewater conditions yields a performance very related to influent salinity conditions maximum salinity and loading type and prevention of its biofouling could be accomplished by targeting activity of a handful of phylotypes and thus supporting the adequacy of quorum sensing antibiofouling treatments

14396,membrane filtration is used in many water reuse applications thanks to its high separation efficiency with regard to particles bacteria cysts and in the case of ultrafiltration even viruses however the separation performance of a membrane system can be affected and the permeate quality can be reduced or increased by phenomena such as membrane damage membrane fouling or microbiological regrowth on both permeate and retentate side of the membrane thus in order to guarantee a sufficiently high permeate quality the separation efficiency of a membrane system has to be assessed sensitively reliably and if possible continuously in the here presented study a variety of different analytical methods was tested to assess the separation efficiency of ultrafiltration membranes in a pilot scale wastewater reclamation system after intentionally damaging the membrane to different degrees its integrity was monitored by pressure decay testing and permeate turbidity measurements and by continuously monitoring the concentration of micro and nanoparticles in the permeate stream the microbiological permeate quality was not only assessed by plate counting but also by flow cytometric measurements the results showed that the membrane integrity is primarily affected by physical damaging as detectable by pressure decay testing while the permeate quality strongly depends on particle membrane interactions such as formation of a fouling layer or clogging of membrane defects nanoparticle counting was found to be a very sensitive method to continuously monitor the membrane s separation efficiency additionally flow cytometry revealed that bacterial regrowth on the permeate side can affect the microbiological permeate quality in particular keywords ultrafiltration water reuse membrane integrity particle counting 1 introduction 1 1 ultrafiltration in wastewater reclamation schemes due to global challenges such as climate change population growth and increasing water demand the use of alternative water resources is an important issue in many parts of the world for example reclamation and reuse of municipal wastewater is considered a feasible option for potable reuse or agricultural irrigation 1 4 however public health risks due to a potential microbial contamination of the reused water are a problem of primary concern 5 7 for this reason an effective and reliable microbial barrier is required in all wastewater reclamation schemes pressure driven membrane filtration is an increasingly used process in technical systems for wastewater treatment and drinking water production and membranes are core elements of many water reclamation schemes 8 reclamation processes with high water quality requirements e g indirect potable reuse typically consist of conventional wastewater treatment followed by ultrafiltration and or reverse osmosis and finally disinfection by uv light or chlorine 5 9 thanks to their small pore sizes in the range 1 100 nm ultrafiltration membranes allow for a removal of bacteria and cysts by about 6 log levels and have also been reported to remove viruses to a high extent 9 11 however the membrane s separation efficiency is only reached in the case of a fully intact filtration system in technical applications typical causes for integrity losses are reported to be chemical stress e g oxidation by cleaning agents faulty installation and maintenance e g damaging by sharp objects and strain during operation e g due to excessive backwashing pressure 12 13 any defect of the membrane material or other system component can lead to a drop in separation efficiency and consequently contamination of the permeate stream 12 already breaches in the submicron size range can allow viruses to pass the membrane 14 15 in this context the reliable assessment of membrane integrity is of utmost importance for maintaining a high microbiological permeate quality in water reclamation schemes 1 2 approaches to assess the integrity of ultrafiltration membranes for this purpose a variety of different integrity testing methods has been proposed in the past on one hand membrane integrity can be assessed by direct methods such as the widely used pressure decay test which consists of applying pressurized gas on the drained feed side of the membrane and monitoring the pressure decay over the wetted membrane pressure decay testing yields high sensitivities but as most direct integrity testing methods it is performed discontinuously and off line leading to plant downtimes which are often hydraulically or economically unfavorable 16 17 on the other hand indirect methods are available which rely on continuously measuring the system s permeate quality the permeate quality is typically assessed in terms of indicator parameters such as turbidity which has often been reported to be of insufficient sensitivity 14 16 as an alternative surrogate for viruses ms2 bacteriophages can be dosed into the feed stream and their concentration is then measured in the permeate but this method is considered rather complex and time consuming 9 18 with regard to waterborne microbiology plate counting of indicator organisms such as e coli or enterococci is the conventional approach 19 furthermore flow cytometry as a novel and highly sensitive measuring technology was found suitable to assess the membrane integrity of reverse osmosis systems although permeate counts were close to the detection limit in this specific study 5 20 to summarize a continuous reliable and easy to handle membrane integrity testing method is still needed 21 23 in this context the determination of suspended particles concentration in the permeate stream has been proposed as a promising method to indirectly assess the integrity of ultrafiltration membranes 10 1 3 particle counting as an indirect membrane integrity testing method by measuring the particle concentration in the feed and permeate of a membrane filtration system the specific particle retention can be calculated and on this basis the system integrity can be assessed this approach is based on size exclusion as the major retention mechanism in porous membrane filtration considerable research has been carried out on the performance of integrity assessment by particle counting and on the way it is affected by the applied module types operating modes and particle sizes 24 26 in many studies integrity tests were performed using surrogate particles with specific properties that allow for selective detection such as magnetic 27 or fluorescent 28 particles however in these applications the need to dose surrogate particles at discrete time intervals results in a lack of continuity as an alternative to surrogate particle measurement integrity testing can also focus on waterborne particles that are part of the biological wastewater matrix 29 in the past these rather unspecific particles were typically monitored using particle counters with laser based light scattering to which a comparably low sensitivity was attributed 22 26 today however a variety of alternative particle measurement technologies is being developed and highly accurate particle counters with low particle size thresholds have become commercially available that could allow for highly sensitive and continuous integrity testing of membrane systems recent studies using novel particle counting technologies were performed in a reverse osmosis system 5 in a membrane bioreactor 17 and in a small scale ultrafiltration set up 30 however quantitative comparison of the particle counting method s sensitivity to direct and indirect reference techniques is available only to a very limited extent 1 4 understanding the effects of membrane operation and integrity on its separation efficiency indirect integrity testing methods provide information on the permeate quality rather than on the physical integrity of the membrane itself which makes them particularly suitable tools for process monitoring 23 31 however in order to well interpret the measurement data and derive the right measures it is crucial to understand and consider that the permeate quality is not only influenced by the membrane integrity but by a range of overlapping particle membrane interactions it can for example be affected by biological fouling and particle clogging on the membrane surface and within membrane pores 32 furthermore it is a well known issue that microbiological regrowth on the permeate side of the filtration system may deteriorate the long term permeate quality 17 33 the here presented study focused on how the permeate quality of porous membrane filtration is affected by membrane damaging and clogging and on how different integrity testing methods respond to these effects a variety of different analytical methods was used and compared with regard to their ability to assess the separation efficiency of an ultrafiltration process used for wastewater reclamation measurements were performed and method responses were compared after build up of a membrane fouling layer during long term operation after chemical membrane cleaning and after intentionally compromising the membrane with differently sized damages respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 ultrafiltration set up ultrafiltration and integrity testing experiments were performed on a pilot scale filtration unit fed with secondary treated wastewater from wastewater treatment plant birs in birsfelden switzerland table 1 fig 1 the unit was equipped with a hollow fiber module zeeweed 10 ge water process technologies with a filtration area of 0 93 m2 submerged in a continuously aerated 35 l feed tank the module consisted of 300 polyvinylidene fluoride fibers with a nominal pore size of 40 nm and an external diameter of 2 mm each and it was operated in outside in filtration mode filtration experiments were conducted at a permeate recovery of 50 and constant flow rates in intervals of filtration 9 3 l m2 h permeate flow for a duration of 300 s and permeate backwash 19 5 l m2 h backwash flow for a duration of 30 s after 2 months of operation the filtration was chemically cleaned by flushing the membrane with a 1 g l and the permeate piping with a 10 g l solution of naocl reagent grade sigma aldrich for 60 min all components were immersed in naocl solution for 15 h and the system was thoroughly flushed with tap water before restarting the filtration process 2 2 integrity testing protocol four measurement series were performed each consisting of filtration membrane damaging and integrity testing in order to generate membrane damages of different sizes the membrane was intentionally damaged by puncturing with needles or cutting single fibers table 2 the relative damage size was estimated as follows equation 1 1 relative damage size cross sec t i o n a l damage area total membrane surface area after each damaging procedure the module was re installed into the filtration unit the filtration was re started and integrity tests were performed table 3 in this way the damages were applied in increasing order on three consecutive days and finally the damaged fiber was taken out of operation by knotting and sealing it with instant glue in one additional experiment 50 small damages were generated instead of one large damage yielding approximately the same total damage size 2 3 integrity testing methods after a run in time of 2 3 min after membrane damaging integrity testing was started by measuring the particle concentration in the permeate stream this was done on one hand using a nanoparticle counting prototype device pola 100x pml particle monitoring technologies ltd israel measuring range 80 nm 20 Î¼m and on the other hand using a commercially available microparticle counter ols50 p pamas gmbh germany measuring range 1 200 Î¼m the measurement technologies of both particle counters are based on a laser beam hitting particles in a flow through cell with the microparticle counting device detecting the light blockage and the nanoparticle counter measuring the phase shift of a structured laser beam dark laser beam technology the particle counter does only register those particles that pass exactly through the sensor focus for this reason the results do not give quantitative concentration values but will under comparable settings such as a constant water sampling flux represent the particle distribution and its changes in a measured water stream both particle counting devices were operated continuously and in parallel by sampling water from a bypass permeate line fig 1 prior to each measurement the particle counters and piping were disconnected from the sampling line coming from the pilot plant and flushed with pre filtered tap water for a duration of 5 min additionally water samples were taken from the permeate pipe and used for turbidity measurements turb 355 ir t xylem analytics gmbh germany and microbiological analyses these included cultivation and plate counting of e coli enterococci and total coliforms compact dry ec etc hyserve gmbh germany as well as flow cytometry measurements fcm partec gmbh germany with 488 nm excitation from a blue solid state laser at 50 mw after sybr green i staining of the samples using an analytical protocol similar to hammes et al 34 35 the fcm results are quantitatively expressed as total cell counts after electronic gating and additionally presented as density plots of green 520 nm fl1 and red 620 nm fl2 fluorescence all sample analyses were performed in triplicates finally pressure decay tests were carried out according to us epa 36 by applying pressurized air at an initial pressure of 0 18 bar on the permeate side of the filtration system and monitoring the pressure decay over time after closing all permeate side valves with the exception of pressure decay testing the measuring values of the integrity testing methods were expressed as log removal values lrv eq 2 2 l r v l o g 10 feed value permeate value 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of integrity testing methods 3 1 1 reference technologies monitoring of the feed and permeate turbidity is often considered a reference technique for assessing the integrity of porous membrane systems however turbidity measurements did not yield any valuable information on the permeate quality in the performed pilot scale experiments with a feed turbidity around 3 ntu and permeate turbidity values ranging between 0 01 and 0 4 ntu the measurements fluctuated strongly and could not be correlated with the degree of membrane integrity table 3 a limited sensitivity of turbidity measurements for small changes in permeate quality were also reported in literature 5 17 37 pressure decay testing is another well established reference technology for integrity testing of filtration modules the performed pilot scale experiments yielded an average relative pressure decay rate around 0 9 min with intact membranes as well as with small and medium damages fig 2 the slight pressure decay in the case of an intact membrane can be explained by air diffusion through the membrane pores or leaking pipe connections on the plant 38 thus although the results were of good reproducibility those damages could poorly be distinguished from an intact membrane the large damage however resulted in a significantly higher pressure decay rate indicating a detection limit of this method between relative damage sizes of 4 2 10 7 and 8 4 10 7 based on these results pressure decay testing is considered a robust and well reproducible method but it is time consuming and of comparably low sensitivity 3 1 2 monitoring of microbiological permeate quality in the case of an intact membrane no e coli or enterococci were detected in the permeate and total coliforms were separated by 99 9 on average small and medium damages lead only to a slight decrease in microbiological permeate quality the large damage however could clearly be identified leading to retention values of only 95 in the case of e coli and 98 in the case of enterococci in general it was difficult to evaluate the system integrity by plate counting due to its poor reproducibility and sensitivity table 3 the measuring results varied heavily between different measurement series and it seemed that not only membrane integrity but also microbiological re growth on the permeate side had an impact on microbiological permeate quality 39 total cell counts measured by flow cytometry were 107 ml in the feed and 8 5 104 ml in the permeate of an intact membrane which corresponds to a 99 removal small medium and large membrane damages lead to cell counts of 8 104 1 5 105 and 1 5 106 ml respectively which indicates a loss of separation efficiency with increasing damage size table 3 a qualitative evaluation of the flow cytometry cell plots revealed that the microbiological wastewater matrix consisted of two major clusters fig 3 one of them was present in the feed as well as in all permeate samples independent of the degree of membrane damage this cluster is formed by relatively large bacteria that are probably able to replicate on the permeate side of the system 40 the second cluster of smaller species however was found to be particularly characteristic for the feed matrix and could not be found in the permeate of intact small and medium damaged membranes when a large damage was generated the characteristic feed cluster became apparent also in the permeate sample indicating a leaking of cells through the membrane rather than only microbiological re growth this confirms previous findings that show that flow cytometry cell plots may contain viability and culturability information of different bacteria clusters 40 3 1 3 micro and nanoparticle counting nanoparticle counting by dark laser beam measurement was found to be a suitable method to evaluate changes in the quality of treated wastewater a total of 700 particles l were found in the secondary treated wastewater feed the feed particles were mainly sized between 100 nm and 2 Î¼m with a large majority of the detected particles being sized around 400 nm which is approximately the lower size range of waterborne bacteria the permeate of an intact ultrafiltration membrane exhibited qualitatively the same particle size distribution as the feed but at lower counts with a total average of 45 particles l fig 4 the removal efficiency was particularly low for small particles in the range 200 600 nm and higher for particles sized 600 nm while it seems reasonable that small particles pass through the membrane to a higher degree leakage of particles sized 40 nm is not in accordance with the nominal pore size of the membrane similar results were obtained in a particle counting study in membrane bioreactor permeates 17 it has also been shown in previous studies that the upper range of a membrane s pore size distribution can have a considerable effect on its nanoparticle retention efficiency 41 42 physical damaging of the membrane to different degrees lead to changes in the permeate quality that could be detected using the dark laser beam nanoparticle counter fig 5 the smaller the damage was the less particles were detected in the permeate with counts ranging between 225 particles l in the case of a large 143 l in the case of a medium and 34 l in the case of a small membrane damage thus even the smallest damage could be distinguished from the intact membrane and the method s detection limit was found to be below a relative damage size of 1 7 10 8 this value corresponds for example to a hole diameter of around 1 5 mm related to a 100 m2 surface area of one ultrafiltration unit as an alternative to the dark laser beam technology a commercially available microparticle counter was tested for comparative purposes this device detected particles sized 1 5 Î¼m in the wastewater matrix while only few larger particles were found a total particle concentration of 4 109 particles l was measured in the feed water while the permeate concentration varied between 5 5 108 and 7 5 109 particles l depending on the size of the membrane damage fig 6 the removal was nearly the same with an intact membrane as with small and medium damages so that no changes of separation efficiency could be identified however a large damage lead to a clear loss of integrity indicating a minimum detectable damage size between 4 2 10 7 and 8 4 10 7 thus microparticle counting is considered a promising alternative to pressure decay testing as it yields a comparable sensitivity and allows for continuous and on line operation 16 17 3 2 comparison of method sensitivities when comparing the integrity testing methods applied in this study certain differences in their method sensitivities can be determined table 3 the lrv of an intact membrane varied between 1 0 in the case of turbidity monitoring and 5 in the case of plate counting which indicates that this parameter is strongly influenced by the applied measurement technology and its selectivity all methods except turbidity monitoring were able to detect the large damage with a relative damage size of 8 4 10 7 by a clear loss of lrv or increase in pressure decay rate table 4 the low sensitivity of turbidity measurement as integrity monitoring method was already reported in a full scale survey study 43 only nanoparticle counting and microbiological plate counting were able to differentiate between smaller damages down to a relative size of 1 7 10 8 nanoparticle counting is thus considered a suitable means to sensitively monitor the integrity of membrane systems particularly if it is combined with microbiological analyses 3 3 influence of membrane clogging on its separation efficiency 3 3 1 fouling of an intact ultrafiltration membrane it was found in all pilot scale experiments that the membrane s separation efficiency was significantly influenced by blocking of membrane pores due to fouling while there were no changes in permeate quality observed after regular permeate backwashing intensive chemical membrane cleaning did indeed result in a loss of detectable membrane integrity it was for example observed that the pressure decay of an intact membrane increased by more than factor 2 after chemical cleaning indicating that the removal of a clogging layer increased the membrane s permeability similar effects could be observed by nanoparticle measurements immediately after chemical cleaning the nanoparticle concentration in the permeate increased over the whole range of detectable particle sizes leading to a lrv loss from 1 2 to 0 5 it is believed that this is due to the removal of a biological and particulate fouling layer on the membrane that is typically clogging the membrane pores to a certain extent it took several hours and days of continuous filtration to restore the particle separation efficiency of the system reaching an optimum lrv of nearly 1 8 after 72 h during this time a fouling layer seems to form on the membrane surface allowing for improved particle separation within the following 7 days of system operation a slight decrease in permeate quality was observed which is attributed to biological re growth on the permeate side of the system rather than to a loss of membrane integrity these findings were confirmed by plate counting which yielded an increased permeate concentration of total coliforms over 300 cfu 100 ml immediately after chemical cleaning and a restoring of membrane integrity within the following three days of filtration it was also reported in literature that particles and bacteria may be removed by cake layers on micro and ultrafiltration membranes 5 39 similarly to particle counting a decrease in permeate quality was observed by flow cytometry measurement after chemical membrane cleaning the total registered cell counts in the permeate were 2 5 105 ml right after cleaning and then decreased to 8 5 104 ml during 10 days of filtration with a feed concentration of around 107 ml this final value corresponds to a lrv of 2 here again it is possible to differentiate between clusters of bacteria leaking through the membrane right after the membrane cleaning and those presenting a constant population on the permeate side of the system fig 7 3 3 2 clogging of physical membrane damages the experiments also showed that the membrane s separation efficiency can be influenced by clogging of physical membrane damages while the permeate quality decreased immediately after damaging it was found to re improve during 24 h of filtration with the damaged membrane in the case of nanoparticle counting independent of the damage size a lrv above 1 1 was restored after 24 h of filtration which nearly corresponds to the separation efficiency of an intact membrane fig 5 these results indicate that continuous monitoring of the permeate quality is crucial in order to assess also temporary and reversible losses of effective membrane integrity in contrast to indirect integrity testing methods pressure decay tests did not show any effects of defect clogging fig 2 it is assumed that the blocking of physical damages is removed by the pressurized air in the course of pressure decay testing and that this method thus reflects the physical membrane integrity rather than the permeate quality of the membrane system microparticle counting revealed that the clogging of a large defect was sometimes incomplete yielding a final lrv of only 1 2 after 24 h fig 6 and that the clogging effect was particularly relevant for particles sized 100 Î¼m while smaller particles could still pass the membrane data not shown here a comparative experiment with 50 small damages instead of one large damage showed that the clogging behaviour is not only affected by the total damage size but by its peripheric structure in particular as defects are probably clogging from their edges inwards fig 8 restoring of permeate quality is thus expected to occur faster in the case of spread damages e g due to chemical stress than in the case of sharp physical damages 4 conclusions in the here presented study a variety of integrity testing methods was applied in pilot scale and compared with regard to their ability to assess the separation efficiency of ultrafiltration stages in water reuse applications it was found that the separation efficiency of the ultrafiltration system was considerably affected by both its physical integrity and particle membrane interactions such as clogging or fouling and that the monitoring technologies under study reflected those effects to different degrees the performed experiments showed that monitoring of permeate turbidity is not sensitive enough to detect any changes in membrane separation efficiency pressure decay testing was able to detect changes in the physical membrane integrity but the method s results could not directly be correlated to the actual permeate quality membrane integrity losses due to physical damaging could be detected to some extent by microparticle counting nanoparticle counting was found to be the most sensitive testing method being able to identify relative damage sizes around 1 7 10 8 furthermore particle counting was found a suitable tool to assess the influence of membrane fouling and defect clogging on the permeate quality while plate counting was found to be of limited accuracy flow cytometry measurements allowed for detecting membrane integrity changes to a certain extent furthermore this method provided evidence that microbiological regrowth on the permeate side of the membrane has the potential to considerably affect the permeate quality acknowledgements the work presented in this paper was financially supported by the european union in the seventh framework programme fp7 2007 2013 under grant agreement no

14396,membrane filtration is used in many water reuse applications thanks to its high separation efficiency with regard to particles bacteria cysts and in the case of ultrafiltration even viruses however the separation performance of a membrane system can be affected and the permeate quality can be reduced or increased by phenomena such as membrane damage membrane fouling or microbiological regrowth on both permeate and retentate side of the membrane thus in order to guarantee a sufficiently high permeate quality the separation efficiency of a membrane system has to be assessed sensitively reliably and if possible continuously in the here presented study a variety of different analytical methods was tested to assess the separation efficiency of ultrafiltration membranes in a pilot scale wastewater reclamation system after intentionally damaging the membrane to different degrees its integrity was monitored by pressure decay testing and permeate turbidity measurements and by continuously monitoring the concentration of micro and nanoparticles in the permeate stream the microbiological permeate quality was not only assessed by plate counting but also by flow cytometric measurements the results showed that the membrane integrity is primarily affected by physical damaging as detectable by pressure decay testing while the permeate quality strongly depends on particle membrane interactions such as formation of a fouling layer or clogging of membrane defects nanoparticle counting was found to be a very sensitive method to continuously monitor the membrane s separation efficiency additionally flow cytometry revealed that bacterial regrowth on the permeate side can affect the microbiological permeate quality in particular keywords ultrafiltration water reuse membrane integrity particle counting 1 introduction 1 1 ultrafiltration in wastewater reclamation schemes due to global challenges such as climate change population growth and increasing water demand the use of alternative water resources is an important issue in many parts of the world for example reclamation and reuse of municipal wastewater is considered a feasible option for potable reuse or agricultural irrigation 1 4 however public health risks due to a potential microbial contamination of the reused water are a problem of primary concern 5 7 for this reason an effective and reliable microbial barrier is required in all wastewater reclamation schemes pressure driven membrane filtration is an increasingly used process in technical systems for wastewater treatment and drinking water production and membranes are core elements of many water reclamation schemes 8 reclamation processes with high water quality requirements e g indirect potable reuse typically consist of conventional wastewater treatment followed by ultrafiltration and or reverse osmosis and finally disinfection by uv light or chlorine 5 9 thanks to their small pore sizes in the range 1 100 nm ultrafiltration membranes allow for a removal of bacteria and cysts by about 6 log levels and have also been reported to remove viruses to a high extent 9 11 however the membrane s separation efficiency is only reached in the case of a fully intact filtration system in technical applications typical causes for integrity losses are reported to be chemical stress e g oxidation by cleaning agents faulty installation and maintenance e g damaging by sharp objects and strain during operation e g due to excessive backwashing pressure 12 13 any defect of the membrane material or other system component can lead to a drop in separation efficiency and consequently contamination of the permeate stream 12 already breaches in the submicron size range can allow viruses to pass the membrane 14 15 in this context the reliable assessment of membrane integrity is of utmost importance for maintaining a high microbiological permeate quality in water reclamation schemes 1 2 approaches to assess the integrity of ultrafiltration membranes for this purpose a variety of different integrity testing methods has been proposed in the past on one hand membrane integrity can be assessed by direct methods such as the widely used pressure decay test which consists of applying pressurized gas on the drained feed side of the membrane and monitoring the pressure decay over the wetted membrane pressure decay testing yields high sensitivities but as most direct integrity testing methods it is performed discontinuously and off line leading to plant downtimes which are often hydraulically or economically unfavorable 16 17 on the other hand indirect methods are available which rely on continuously measuring the system s permeate quality the permeate quality is typically assessed in terms of indicator parameters such as turbidity which has often been reported to be of insufficient sensitivity 14 16 as an alternative surrogate for viruses ms2 bacteriophages can be dosed into the feed stream and their concentration is then measured in the permeate but this method is considered rather complex and time consuming 9 18 with regard to waterborne microbiology plate counting of indicator organisms such as e coli or enterococci is the conventional approach 19 furthermore flow cytometry as a novel and highly sensitive measuring technology was found suitable to assess the membrane integrity of reverse osmosis systems although permeate counts were close to the detection limit in this specific study 5 20 to summarize a continuous reliable and easy to handle membrane integrity testing method is still needed 21 23 in this context the determination of suspended particles concentration in the permeate stream has been proposed as a promising method to indirectly assess the integrity of ultrafiltration membranes 10 1 3 particle counting as an indirect membrane integrity testing method by measuring the particle concentration in the feed and permeate of a membrane filtration system the specific particle retention can be calculated and on this basis the system integrity can be assessed this approach is based on size exclusion as the major retention mechanism in porous membrane filtration considerable research has been carried out on the performance of integrity assessment by particle counting and on the way it is affected by the applied module types operating modes and particle sizes 24 26 in many studies integrity tests were performed using surrogate particles with specific properties that allow for selective detection such as magnetic 27 or fluorescent 28 particles however in these applications the need to dose surrogate particles at discrete time intervals results in a lack of continuity as an alternative to surrogate particle measurement integrity testing can also focus on waterborne particles that are part of the biological wastewater matrix 29 in the past these rather unspecific particles were typically monitored using particle counters with laser based light scattering to which a comparably low sensitivity was attributed 22 26 today however a variety of alternative particle measurement technologies is being developed and highly accurate particle counters with low particle size thresholds have become commercially available that could allow for highly sensitive and continuous integrity testing of membrane systems recent studies using novel particle counting technologies were performed in a reverse osmosis system 5 in a membrane bioreactor 17 and in a small scale ultrafiltration set up 30 however quantitative comparison of the particle counting method s sensitivity to direct and indirect reference techniques is available only to a very limited extent 1 4 understanding the effects of membrane operation and integrity on its separation efficiency indirect integrity testing methods provide information on the permeate quality rather than on the physical integrity of the membrane itself which makes them particularly suitable tools for process monitoring 23 31 however in order to well interpret the measurement data and derive the right measures it is crucial to understand and consider that the permeate quality is not only influenced by the membrane integrity but by a range of overlapping particle membrane interactions it can for example be affected by biological fouling and particle clogging on the membrane surface and within membrane pores 32 furthermore it is a well known issue that microbiological regrowth on the permeate side of the filtration system may deteriorate the long term permeate quality 17 33 the here presented study focused on how the permeate quality of porous membrane filtration is affected by membrane damaging and clogging and on how different integrity testing methods respond to these effects a variety of different analytical methods was used and compared with regard to their ability to assess the separation efficiency of an ultrafiltration process used for wastewater reclamation measurements were performed and method responses were compared after build up of a membrane fouling layer during long term operation after chemical membrane cleaning and after intentionally compromising the membrane with differently sized damages respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 ultrafiltration set up ultrafiltration and integrity testing experiments were performed on a pilot scale filtration unit fed with secondary treated wastewater from wastewater treatment plant birs in birsfelden switzerland table 1 fig 1 the unit was equipped with a hollow fiber module zeeweed 10 ge water process technologies with a filtration area of 0 93 m2 submerged in a continuously aerated 35 l feed tank the module consisted of 300 polyvinylidene fluoride fibers with a nominal pore size of 40 nm and an external diameter of 2 mm each and it was operated in outside in filtration mode filtration experiments were conducted at a permeate recovery of 50 and constant flow rates in intervals of filtration 9 3 l m2 h permeate flow for a duration of 300 s and permeate backwash 19 5 l m2 h backwash flow for a duration of 30 s after 2 months of operation the filtration was chemically cleaned by flushing the membrane with a 1 g l and the permeate piping with a 10 g l solution of naocl reagent grade sigma aldrich for 60 min all components were immersed in naocl solution for 15 h and the system was thoroughly flushed with tap water before restarting the filtration process 2 2 integrity testing protocol four measurement series were performed each consisting of filtration membrane damaging and integrity testing in order to generate membrane damages of different sizes the membrane was intentionally damaged by puncturing with needles or cutting single fibers table 2 the relative damage size was estimated as follows equation 1 1 relative damage size cross sec t i o n a l damage area total membrane surface area after each damaging procedure the module was re installed into the filtration unit the filtration was re started and integrity tests were performed table 3 in this way the damages were applied in increasing order on three consecutive days and finally the damaged fiber was taken out of operation by knotting and sealing it with instant glue in one additional experiment 50 small damages were generated instead of one large damage yielding approximately the same total damage size 2 3 integrity testing methods after a run in time of 2 3 min after membrane damaging integrity testing was started by measuring the particle concentration in the permeate stream this was done on one hand using a nanoparticle counting prototype device pola 100x pml particle monitoring technologies ltd israel measuring range 80 nm 20 Î¼m and on the other hand using a commercially available microparticle counter ols50 p pamas gmbh germany measuring range 1 200 Î¼m the measurement technologies of both particle counters are based on a laser beam hitting particles in a flow through cell with the microparticle counting device detecting the light blockage and the nanoparticle counter measuring the phase shift of a structured laser beam dark laser beam technology the particle counter does only register those particles that pass exactly through the sensor focus for this reason the results do not give quantitative concentration values but will under comparable settings such as a constant water sampling flux represent the particle distribution and its changes in a measured water stream both particle counting devices were operated continuously and in parallel by sampling water from a bypass permeate line fig 1 prior to each measurement the particle counters and piping were disconnected from the sampling line coming from the pilot plant and flushed with pre filtered tap water for a duration of 5 min additionally water samples were taken from the permeate pipe and used for turbidity measurements turb 355 ir t xylem analytics gmbh germany and microbiological analyses these included cultivation and plate counting of e coli enterococci and total coliforms compact dry ec etc hyserve gmbh germany as well as flow cytometry measurements fcm partec gmbh germany with 488 nm excitation from a blue solid state laser at 50 mw after sybr green i staining of the samples using an analytical protocol similar to hammes et al 34 35 the fcm results are quantitatively expressed as total cell counts after electronic gating and additionally presented as density plots of green 520 nm fl1 and red 620 nm fl2 fluorescence all sample analyses were performed in triplicates finally pressure decay tests were carried out according to us epa 36 by applying pressurized air at an initial pressure of 0 18 bar on the permeate side of the filtration system and monitoring the pressure decay over time after closing all permeate side valves with the exception of pressure decay testing the measuring values of the integrity testing methods were expressed as log removal values lrv eq 2 2 l r v l o g 10 feed value permeate value 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of integrity testing methods 3 1 1 reference technologies monitoring of the feed and permeate turbidity is often considered a reference technique for assessing the integrity of porous membrane systems however turbidity measurements did not yield any valuable information on the permeate quality in the performed pilot scale experiments with a feed turbidity around 3 ntu and permeate turbidity values ranging between 0 01 and 0 4 ntu the measurements fluctuated strongly and could not be correlated with the degree of membrane integrity table 3 a limited sensitivity of turbidity measurements for small changes in permeate quality were also reported in literature 5 17 37 pressure decay testing is another well established reference technology for integrity testing of filtration modules the performed pilot scale experiments yielded an average relative pressure decay rate around 0 9 min with intact membranes as well as with small and medium damages fig 2 the slight pressure decay in the case of an intact membrane can be explained by air diffusion through the membrane pores or leaking pipe connections on the plant 38 thus although the results were of good reproducibility those damages could poorly be distinguished from an intact membrane the large damage however resulted in a significantly higher pressure decay rate indicating a detection limit of this method between relative damage sizes of 4 2 10 7 and 8 4 10 7 based on these results pressure decay testing is considered a robust and well reproducible method but it is time consuming and of comparably low sensitivity 3 1 2 monitoring of microbiological permeate quality in the case of an intact membrane no e coli or enterococci were detected in the permeate and total coliforms were separated by 99 9 on average small and medium damages lead only to a slight decrease in microbiological permeate quality the large damage however could clearly be identified leading to retention values of only 95 in the case of e coli and 98 in the case of enterococci in general it was difficult to evaluate the system integrity by plate counting due to its poor reproducibility and sensitivity table 3 the measuring results varied heavily between different measurement series and it seemed that not only membrane integrity but also microbiological re growth on the permeate side had an impact on microbiological permeate quality 39 total cell counts measured by flow cytometry were 107 ml in the feed and 8 5 104 ml in the permeate of an intact membrane which corresponds to a 99 removal small medium and large membrane damages lead to cell counts of 8 104 1 5 105 and 1 5 106 ml respectively which indicates a loss of separation efficiency with increasing damage size table 3 a qualitative evaluation of the flow cytometry cell plots revealed that the microbiological wastewater matrix consisted of two major clusters fig 3 one of them was present in the feed as well as in all permeate samples independent of the degree of membrane damage this cluster is formed by relatively large bacteria that are probably able to replicate on the permeate side of the system 40 the second cluster of smaller species however was found to be particularly characteristic for the feed matrix and could not be found in the permeate of intact small and medium damaged membranes when a large damage was generated the characteristic feed cluster became apparent also in the permeate sample indicating a leaking of cells through the membrane rather than only microbiological re growth this confirms previous findings that show that flow cytometry cell plots may contain viability and culturability information of different bacteria clusters 40 3 1 3 micro and nanoparticle counting nanoparticle counting by dark laser beam measurement was found to be a suitable method to evaluate changes in the quality of treated wastewater a total of 700 particles l were found in the secondary treated wastewater feed the feed particles were mainly sized between 100 nm and 2 Î¼m with a large majority of the detected particles being sized around 400 nm which is approximately the lower size range of waterborne bacteria the permeate of an intact ultrafiltration membrane exhibited qualitatively the same particle size distribution as the feed but at lower counts with a total average of 45 particles l fig 4 the removal efficiency was particularly low for small particles in the range 200 600 nm and higher for particles sized 600 nm while it seems reasonable that small particles pass through the membrane to a higher degree leakage of particles sized 40 nm is not in accordance with the nominal pore size of the membrane similar results were obtained in a particle counting study in membrane bioreactor permeates 17 it has also been shown in previous studies that the upper range of a membrane s pore size distribution can have a considerable effect on its nanoparticle retention efficiency 41 42 physical damaging of the membrane to different degrees lead to changes in the permeate quality that could be detected using the dark laser beam nanoparticle counter fig 5 the smaller the damage was the less particles were detected in the permeate with counts ranging between 225 particles l in the case of a large 143 l in the case of a medium and 34 l in the case of a small membrane damage thus even the smallest damage could be distinguished from the intact membrane and the method s detection limit was found to be below a relative damage size of 1 7 10 8 this value corresponds for example to a hole diameter of around 1 5 mm related to a 100 m2 surface area of one ultrafiltration unit as an alternative to the dark laser beam technology a commercially available microparticle counter was tested for comparative purposes this device detected particles sized 1 5 Î¼m in the wastewater matrix while only few larger particles were found a total particle concentration of 4 109 particles l was measured in the feed water while the permeate concentration varied between 5 5 108 and 7 5 109 particles l depending on the size of the membrane damage fig 6 the removal was nearly the same with an intact membrane as with small and medium damages so that no changes of separation efficiency could be identified however a large damage lead to a clear loss of integrity indicating a minimum detectable damage size between 4 2 10 7 and 8 4 10 7 thus microparticle counting is considered a promising alternative to pressure decay testing as it yields a comparable sensitivity and allows for continuous and on line operation 16 17 3 2 comparison of method sensitivities when comparing the integrity testing methods applied in this study certain differences in their method sensitivities can be determined table 3 the lrv of an intact membrane varied between 1 0 in the case of turbidity monitoring and 5 in the case of plate counting which indicates that this parameter is strongly influenced by the applied measurement technology and its selectivity all methods except turbidity monitoring were able to detect the large damage with a relative damage size of 8 4 10 7 by a clear loss of lrv or increase in pressure decay rate table 4 the low sensitivity of turbidity measurement as integrity monitoring method was already reported in a full scale survey study 43 only nanoparticle counting and microbiological plate counting were able to differentiate between smaller damages

14397,this study evaluates stormwater management for use in non potable activities and pollution control by microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf stormwater was sampled in a parking lot the permeate flux and removal rates of both membranes were evaluated in continuous operation tests permeate quality was compared to american australian spanish and brazilian guidelines both mf and uf membranes allow the adjustment of stormwater quality for toilet flushing and fire protection and they have good performance in controlling pollution uf has a better operation and removal performance and might be complementary with best management practices to obtain an overall better efficiency keywords bmp heavy metals hydrocarbons membrane runoff pollution 1 introduction stormwater has become an issue of concern in urban centers large impermeable areas increase water flow to drainage systems causing flooding problems pipeline breakdowns and drainage system failures 1 3 the transport of pollutants by stormwater runoff generated by anthropogenic and biogenic activities from nearby impermeable surfaces parking lots roadways and so forth can carry a wide range of contaminants into the surface water sources that often exceed the federal maximum contaminant levels mcls this has a negative impact on the quality of groundwater surface water and soils affecting the public health and the environment 4 6 oils organic liquids fertilizers nutrients and heavy metals cd cu pb could be present in the stormwater 7 therefore the management of stormwater can be an important strategy in the effort towards sustainability the use of stormwater in non drinking applications could be an interesting way of addressing these large volumes of water rainwater has become an important resource not only in low volume storage areas but also in areas where the reduction of treated water consumption by local supply is desirable the average savings of drinking water in a residence could vary between 30 and 60 depending on consumer habits and the size of the collection area 2 or even between 34 and 92 depending on the existing demand 8 among the most frequent uses of this water are toilet flushing landscape irrigation laundering activities ornamental uses and fire protection 9 2 3 10 rainwater harvesting systems are usually composed of a catchment surface water delivery devices and a storage tank the worldwide leading system is composed of these three elements and also uses roofs as a collection surface 9 1 11 13 however systems that use that rooftops have limited productivity by their size while the ground offers large areas for catchment mostly in places characterized by low rainfall 13 the physico chemical and microbiological characterizations of stormwater collected in traffic areas roads courtyards and sidewalks 14 16 10 5 7 17 demonstrate the need for efficient treatment to achieve quality parameters of urban use or to reduce runoff pollution stormwater management has been carried out through best management practices bmp the main purpose of bmp is to reduce the runoff pollution reaching water bodies and soils common practices include the use of swales bioswales constructed wetlands vegetated filter strips and media filters 18 20 membrane separation processes msp are techniques widely known in water treatment microfiltration mf can remove impurities such as particulates and bacteria typical applications include the purification and sterile filtration of heat sensitive solutions pure water production and sewage treatment 21 22 on a large scale ultrafiltration uf is used to treat industrial wastewater and process water it is also used in ultrapure water production because it can remove suspended and colloidal solids macromolecules bacteria and viruses 14 23 22 both membrane processes have been used to treat rainwater catches on rooftops and surface water on a limited scale but with promising results 24 28 however we think there is a lack first in alternative catchment surfaces and second in their treatments so both are the innovations for this work aiming an effective stormwater management this paper focuses on the characterization of stormwater harvested on the ground and evaluates microfiltration and ultrafiltration as techniques for this purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling stormwater was collected in the parking lot of the faculty of law at the university of passo fundo rio grande do sul state brazil 28 13 34 97 s 52 23 16 53 w looking for large volumes of sampling stormwater and future filtration systems we decided to use a parking lot as catching area we also wanted the worst pollutant load scenario and parking lots bring together different types of organic and inorganic pollutants the surface is covered by asphalt and has an area of 1177 18 m2 with an average slope of 7 fig 1 around the parking lot are large green areas including some area for studies of corn soy oat plantation the sampling of stormwater was carried out taking advantage of the gravity flow to the storm sewer two collection plastic tanks 50 l were placed into a drain sewer one tank was used for rapid settling and the other was used for stormwater collection fig 2 sampling was conducted between august and september 2016 according to the available meteorological information the precipitation in the city of passo fundo is greater between august and september 29 considering that the filtration process would have to be carried out for long periods of time to obtain the flux curve and therefore with large amounts of feeding volume the sampling process had to be carried out when more stormwater was available six samplings were made to perform three filtration and characterization processes for each membrane precipitation characteristics for each rain event were obtained through automatic pluviograph lectures and they are shown in table 1 2 2 physico chemical and microbiological characterization all physico chemical and microbiological analysis were performed following the methods described by apha awwa wef 30 the physico chemical characterization included ph

nitrogen nh3 n chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod oil and grease heavy metals lead zinc nickel copper iron cadmium and chromium and hydrocarbons the microbiological characterization included total and fecal coliform the reference methods are shown in table 2 in addition we searched for traces of fuel gas or diesel after four successive extractions with 10 ml of hexane and 10 ml of the sample using an extraction funnel we analyzed hydrocarbons by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gcms tq8030 gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer series triple quadrupole type provided by shimadzu gcsolutions 4 11 version software rtx 5ms analytical column of size 30 m 0 25 Î¼m 0 25 mm injector temperature of 250 c injection volume of 1 0 Î¼l splitless

and uf treatment of stormwater hollow fiber membranes of mf and uf supplied by pam membranes rio de janeiro brazil were used for stormwater treatment the characteristics of the membranes are shown in table 3 three continuous operation experiments were performed for each membrane the operating conditions are shown in tables 4 and 5 preliminary sedimentation and sieving were performed to remove coarse solids such as stones leaves insects and branches to avoid premature clogging of the membranes the experimental diagram of the filtration rig is shown in fig 3 the runs were performed at room temperature 17 c 2 c the system was operated through the control panel 1 which regulates the filtration and backwashing the collected stormwater was manually fed to the polypropylene tank 2 where the membrane 3 was installed the feed volume was measured to obtain the recovered volume rate a vacuum pump 4 applied negative pressure in the system while the vacuum was adjusted to work steadily through the needle valve 5 the flow of the permeate was observed in the rotameter 6 air was provided by an external compressor 7 and the aeration rate was regulated by a second rotameter 8 the permeate was directed to the vacuum tank 9 and finally collected in the disposal tank 10 when the flow was reduced by 50 of the initial flow the backflushing process was started using a predetermined permeate volume the valve 11 was opened and the centrifugal pump 12 was driven by inverting the flow direction achieving the removal of suspended or colloidal material deposited on the surface of the membrane aeration was used to reduce fouling air injection can be useful for better fouling control 31 furthermore combined with backflushing processes air scouring can be an efficient cleaning technique achieving high recovery flow rates 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 stormwater characterization the characterization of stormwater is shown in table 6 the stormwater sampled has high turbidity color and a high concentration of settleable solids and suspended solids in fact a green area surrounds the parking lot near the asphalt there is grass and an experimental field of corn soy oatmeal plantation are found further away from the asphalt the stormwater runoff in this area carries out soil and organic matter from the surrounding area the bod may have the same origin as suggested by epa 33 and zhu et al 17 furthermore agriculture activities chemical and nitrogen fertilizers sediments bacteria and decomposition of organic matter are sources of nitrogen compounds such as total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrate 34 36 we found several species of metals in stormwater different sources like pavement erosion vehicles traffic exhaust gases abrasion of tires and brakes 14 33 37 36 and soil erosion 33 17 could contaminate stormwater with metals a wide range of concentrations of different metals is reported in previous studies of stormwater characterization 14 38 15 39 47 40 however cadmium chromium copper and iron concentration has higher values in this investigation compared to studies done in paved areas by other researchers 34 15 41 39 17 combustion and abrasion processes are issues that can increase concentrations of lead and sulfate 14 42 36 sulfates are also present in the soils of brazil 43 and we believe that these constituents were washed from the surrounding green area of the parking lot in automotive areas different traffic densities also have an effect on pollution load as shown in the minimum and maximum values 15 41 17 oil and grease concentrations are highly influenced by leakage of oil and lubricants in parking lots 14 15 17 the average concentration 72 28 mg l is similar to the maximum values reported by khan et al 44 and mcqueen et al 39 obtained from measurements conducted in areas with high traffic density such as highways and car parks however samples collected at the beginning of the rainfall event may overestimate the event mean concentration emc by 20 mg l samples collected at the end may underestimate the emc by 1 2 mg l as well 44 stormwater quality varies significantly and gradually with the intensity and duration of rainfall when there are high intensity and duration events concentrations can also be high 45 furthermore the quality of collected stormwater may be greatly influenced by antecedent dry events and the seasonal first flush 46 16 37 10 stormwater characterization is vital because pollutants can be transferred to surface water soils and groundwater 38 47 49 50 there is also concern about controlling large volumes of water from heavy rains which may affect the operation of drainage system and cause flooding 51 49 52 thus we must think in strategies of management of stormwater to prevent pollution and avoid the drainage system breakdown 3 2 stormwater treated by microfiltration and ultrafiltration the permeate flux of microfiltration and ultrafiltration of stormwater is shown in fig 4 we can observe that both membranes share some similarity in the initial flow rate which varies between 160 and 240 l h m2 followed by a strong decay we performed the backflushing in different times backflushing can be identified by the peaks in the curves and a better recovery of initial permeate flux was achieved after short periods of filtration besides aeration was an efficient technique to prevent irreversible fouling and keep high permeation through the membranes in the mf process the decline to 50 of the initial flow occurs more sharply and in a shorter period 40 75 85 to 135 min furthermore different backflushing procedures were tested for reversion to the initial rate which was achieved only in the last experiment we think that the larger pores of mf membranes allowed a stronger pore narrowing particulate and colloidal matter may lead to a process of faster fouling in mf membranes by affecting their long term performance 53 54 recovery rates in mf table 4 are widely different as show by the standard deviation while uf testing table 5 present a more uniform behavior in addition to membrane characteristics initial concentrations may influence the membrane operation 55 however parameters such as total solids and total suspended solids important causes of primary clogging have higher values in uf runs table 6 demonstrating an even better performance of the uf membrane uf membrane showed a more stable permeate flux after the backflushing procedures contrary to the mf the uf flux decline to 50 of the initial occurs in longer intervals varying between 105 and 160 min tables 4 and 5 show a total backflushing volume for microfiltration of 67 l while for ultrafiltration is only 42 l although filtration times are similar 20 25 h for mf and 19 5 h for uf backflushing volumes are even more conclusive because the difference is 37 3 less volume used with ultrafiltration fouling is one of the major constraints for efficient operation of membrane separation processes 54 31 56 57 techniques related to operational conditions such as running modes backflushing chemical cleaning and air scouring provide very good results 32 thus backflushing coupled with aeration was a good strategy to prevent fouling and keep a high permeation to treat stormwater by mf and uf mf and uf had a highly competitive hydraulic permeability with respect to best known management practices mf achieved values between 60 and 265 l h m2 1666 7360 cm s and uf achieved values between 80 and 220 l h m2 2222 6111 cm s other techniques used to treat stormwater using biochar filter media 48 mixed media filter 19 and bioretention systems 40 achieve hydraulic conductivities of 0 7 cm s 0 5 cm s and 0 00138 cm s respectively however the operation and quality criteria depend on the final destination of the treated stormwater whether for urban use or pollution control the characterization of mf and uf permeate and average removal rates are shown in table 7 removal percentages for settable solids total suspended solids fecal coliforms color turbidity and total coliforms are above 90 in both cases with a slightly better performance in the case of the uf as expected both membranes presented low removal efficiencies of ions hardness nitrate and sulfate nevertheless concentrations of these constituents are also low in stormwater table 6 and thus there is no compromise in the quality of treated water by mf and uf regarding nutrients rejections mf and uf also achieved low removal rates though low concentrations were detected in the permeates it is possible to achieve 100 removal efficiency for nitrogen with macro pervious pavement 58 a removal efficiency of 100 for nitrate and 90 for total phosphorus can be achieved with iron fillings in a filter system 59 mf and uf have a great removal performance of total suspended solids other mechanisms like bioswales 18 and macro pervious pavement 58 have a competitive efficiency with rates between 29 and 100 and 90 respectively both mf and uf have similar reductions in cod concentrations mf 49 88 41 57 uf and produced a permeated with low bod concentration bod 10 mg l constructed wetlands media filters and grassed swales exhibited similar cod removal rates 20 when msp are used rejection depends on membrane material and operating conditions as pressure and aeration rate 60 61 31 besides the initial polluting load could produce different concentration in the permeate mf and uf are a good microbiological barrier and reached similar removal of total and fecal coliforms despite having fairly high concentrations on influent stormwater 110 000 cfu 100 ml each one all permeate qualities using uf are below of 300 cfu 100 ml for fecal and total coliforms other techniques for treat stormwater as media filters with zeolite 62 and activated carbon 63 achieved e coli similar efficiencies 96 and 98 respectively the uf membrane reached higher removal rates for heavy metals such as fe 92 14 and ni 61 90 iron may be absorbed into the soil or organic matter that comes from green areas and nearby crops calcite zeolite and iron fillings in filter systems can achieve 90 100 removal efficiencies for cd cu pb ni cr and zn with much higher stormwater influent concentrations which vary between 2 5 mg l to 50 mg l 48 removal of oil and grease is less than 50 for both mf 22 83 mean and uf 37 11 mean it is possible that apolar constituents arose from oil emulsions whose size vary between 100 to 10 000 nm 64 and thus are not retained by either the pore diameter mf or the molecular weight cut off uf the urban stormwater runoff could carry out hydrocarbons to water bodies mainly because of oily materials 65 to identify what type of constituents the oily materials had we performed a chromatograph scanning for hydrocarbons present in fuel as gasoline and diesel the gas chromatographic profiles of standard fingerprints stormwater and permeate of uf running are shown in fig 5 we can see a little peak near 50 min on chromatographic profile of stormwater fig 5 b identifying a possible presence of the c29 however the chromatographic analysis leads us to conclude that all stormwater samples in this study did not show the profile of waters contaminated with hydrocarbons composed by c14 to c30 carbon chains suggesting that the oils and greases presented are not due to leaks or spills of fuels latimer et al 66 compared the chromatographic analysis of stormwater runoff in commercial residential and highway sites with five refined petroleum products profiles gasoline no 2 fuel oil no 6 fuel oil used crankcase oil and virgin crankcase oil the results showed that hydrocarbon concentrations come mainly from used engine oil for the three areas studied it is possible that stormwater collected in this study was contaminated with multiple types and concentrations of oils and greases table 6 both vegetal because the collection area is surrounded by green areas and mineral engine oil it becomes difficult to identify the type of hydrocarbons in addition there may be concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs common substances in stormwater runoff from parking lots and highways 14 15 5 17 which would be related to the concentrations of oily materials 3 3 treated stormwater applications prospects 3 3 1 stormwater for urban use quality assessment of mf and uf permeate for urban use was performed using guidelines issued by the united states environmental protection agency 33 the spanish department of environment and rural and marine environment ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino 67 and the department of environment and conservation of new south wales 34 from australia the epa 33 proposes values for treatment goal in reclaimed water its main applications are for recreational and landscape irrigation fire protection and toilet flushing the marm offers guidelines for three different scenarios where the wastewater can be used after treatment the parameters offered by the dec nsw 34 specific for stormwater use are for garden watering toilet flushing and car washing uses the mean quality concentrations of mf and uf permeates extracted from table 7 and the standards are presented in table 8 in general the stormwater treated by mf and uf showed good quality indicator for water reuse some comments a the epa 33 suggests low concentrations of cd and ni for reclaimed water for irrigation as cd can be toxic to plants for both mf and uf treatment cd must be dissolved in stormwater and neither mf nor uf was able to remove it for other uses ornamental use toilet flushing and fire protection mf and uf permeate can be used for if it also meets the microbiological quality in addition microbiological control can be easily performed by chlorination b turbidity and ph are within the limits established by the dec nsw 34 for residential uses the quantification of salts nutrients heavy metals and pesticides is required despite no specific limits for our treated stormwater the values of the other guidelines are a good quality indicator c for the marm 67 both permeates meet the turbidity total suspended solids and total phosphorus requirements for all proposed uses including washing streets vehicles irrigation flushing toilets recreation and fire protection however other parameters are also required such as legionella spp and intestinal nematodes if there is a risk of aerosolization however mf and uf are capable to remove nematodes and the chlorination can be used for control of legionella spp several authors 68 69 6 17 recommend the disposal of the first millimeters of rain as a very effective technique for improving the quality of water collected at rooftops and from the ground physico chemical characteristics such as color electrical conductivity turbidity ph and hardness can be reduced with bypass systems for that rain volume sedimentation and filtration systems contribute to the reduction of cod and tss concentrations because of the strong correlation between both parameters and the material dragged by first rain collected thus an arrangement of these methods could be performed for harvest stormwater in traffic surfaces to address both physico chemical parameters and microbiological quality 3 3 2 pollution control of stormwater by mf and uf different methods of stormwater treatment are known in the field of pollution control besides characterization of ph temperature dissolved oxygen and bacterial criteria there is a rather large list of other parameters that must be evaluated related to toxic radioactive and deleterious materials as well as aesthetic values brazil classifies its surface freshwater bodies in four classes according to their predominant use applications range from human supply protection of aquatic species food crops irrigation and navigation 70 brazil also has regulations for the management of the discharge of effluents to water bodies 71 characteristics of third and fourth class water bodies with the maximum values for effluents are summarized in table 9 it is possible to achieve effluents quality parameters with mf and uf except defined concentrations for oil and grease however effluent quality parameters can be used as long as receiving body characteristics are not altered mainly by the inflow rate in addition brazilian regulation includes the study of other organic compounds fourth class rivers are for navigation and landscape harmony the quality criteria for this class are easily achievable with mf and uf the permeate quality of both membranes allows stormwater to be classified as third class applications pertaining to third class rivers include human supply irrigation of non food crops fishing and secondary contact recreation however the concentrations of zn cu and fe agree with those limits our results also show that stormwater could be a strong source of metal contamination of surface water bodies and unfortunately mf and uf are not classical methods for metal removal from waters in fact for pb cd which was very close to the regulation value cr and ni complementary techniques might be implemented for use as has been highlighted the membranes separation processes will be competitive with other treatment mechanisms depending on the final use of stormwater however one of the biggest advantages of mf and uf systems are the multiple materials that can be used such as polymeric nanofibers 25 polysulfone 24 ceramics 28 or metals 31 which can meet multiple quality criteria and in turn provide the necessary economic viability nevertheless research for stormwater and surface water treatment by mf and uf is limited mf and uf processes have competitive hydraulic permeability rates as seen in item 3 2 this may be perhaps one of the main advantages over known techniques allowing treatment of large stormwater volumes in case of heavy rains and in addition longer durations of constant operation 3 3 3 stormwater treatment system we designed a treatment system for the stormwater in the selected parking lot the peak flow was estimated for each of the samples taken in this study and the results are shown in table 10 the rational method is one of the oldest and most widely used to scale hydraulic structures such as drainage collectors pipelines and aqueducts for storm water the peak flow q 72 is defined as q c i a where c is a dimensionless runoff coefficient based on the slope and the type of soil i is the average intensity of rain and a is the contributing drainage area a runoff coefficient c of 0 85 corresponding to the parking lot was used a treatment system with a uf membrane was proposed for the maximum estimated volume run 2 it was designed with a filtration time of 12 h and an average membrane flow of 100 l h m2 fig 4 thus membrane area required is 11 m2 so with a membrane module of 1 m in length a total of 32 modules would be needed a sketch of the system is shown in fig 6 for dry periods equalization basins can be designed to store great volumes of stormwater while the entire system can gradually filter it out after filtration membranes can be storage in standby into the same equalization basin with permeate the treatment system needs an area of only 1 6 m2 with an uf average recovery rate of 78 9 table 5 the treated water volume would be 10 823 l with such a value the possibility of use in urban environments or contribution to surface water bodies will be analyzed however a more detailed analysis would have to be done considering the variables of precipitation hydraulic variables collection energy consumption equalization basins complementary techniques storage and supply 4 conclusions stormwater harvested from paved surfaces and treated by mf and uf offers an excellent alternative for non potable uses both mf and uf are efficient techniques that meet quality standards for non drinking activities such as flushing toilets cleaning activities irrigation ornamental uses and fire protection nevertheless a deeper microbiological quality analysis is required to determine if any additional processes are necessary to achieve 100 of the quality requirements membrane techniques also can be suitable for pollutant load reduction that reaches water bodies for stormwater mf and uf membranes have high removal efficiency for total suspended solids total coliforms fecal coliforms and bod however a low removal of heavy metals lead cadmium chromium nickel was exhibited by both membranes the uf technique is more efficient than the mf technique achieving a better flux rate in constant operation and in backflush processes as well as greater removal rates thus uf and best management practices may be complementary to obtain an overall better performance a feasibility analysis should be performed according to quality criteria and operating conditions this can bring numerous benefits such as a reduction in the consumption of drinking water alternative water sources and flood control acknowledgement the corresponding author a d o s would like to acknowledge the funding by the postgraduate program in civil and environmental engineering of the university of passo fundo 
14397,this study evaluates stormwater management for use in non potable activities and pollution control by microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf stormwater was sampled in a parking lot the permeate flux and removal rates of both membranes were evaluated in continuous operation tests permeate quality was compared to american australian spanish and brazilian guidelines both mf and uf membranes allow the adjustment of stormwater quality for toilet flushing and fire protection and they have good performance in controlling pollution uf has a better operation and removal performance and might be complementary with best management practices to obtain an overall better efficiency keywords bmp heavy metals hydrocarbons membrane runoff pollution 1 introduction stormwater has become an issue of concern in urban centers large impermeable areas increase water flow to drainage systems causing flooding problems pipeline breakdowns and drainage system failures 1 3 the transport of pollutants by stormwater runoff generated by anthropogenic and biogenic activities from nearby impermeable surfaces parking lots roadways and so forth can carry a wide range of contaminants into the surface water sources that often exceed the federal maximum contaminant levels mcls this has a negative impact on the quality of groundwater surface water and soils affecting the public health and the environment 4 6 oils organic liquids fertilizers nutrients and heavy metals cd cu pb could be present in the stormwater 7 therefore the management of stormwater can be an important strategy in the effort towards sustainability the use of stormwater in non drinking applications could be an interesting way of addressing these large volumes of water rainwater has become an important resource not only in low volume storage areas but also in areas where the reduction of treated water consumption by local supply is desirable the average savings of drinking water in a residence could vary between 30 and 60 depending on consumer habits and the size of the collection area 2 or even between 34 and 92 depending on the existing demand 8 among the most frequent uses of this water are toilet flushing landscape irrigation laundering activities ornamental uses and fire protection 9 2 3 10 rainwater harvesting systems are usually composed of a catchment surface water delivery devices and a storage tank the worldwide leading system is composed of these three elements and also uses roofs as a collection surface 9 1 11 13 however systems that use that rooftops have limited productivity by their size while the ground offers large areas for catchment mostly in places characterized by low rainfall 13 the physico chemical and microbiological characterizations of stormwater collected in traffic areas roads courtyards and sidewalks 14 16 10 5 7 17 demonstrate the need for efficient treatment to achieve quality parameters of urban use or to reduce runoff pollution stormwater management has been carried out through best management practices bmp the main purpose of bmp is to reduce the runoff pollution reaching water bodies and soils common practices include the use of swales bioswales constructed wetlands vegetated filter strips and media filters 18 20 membrane separation processes msp are techniques widely known in water treatment microfiltration mf can remove impurities such as particulates and bacteria typical applications include the purification and sterile filtration of heat sensitive solutions pure water production and sewage treatment 21 22 on a large scale ultrafiltration uf is used to treat industrial wastewater and process water it is also used in ultrapure water production because it can remove suspended and colloidal solids macromolecules bacteria and viruses 14 23 22 both membrane processes have been used to treat rainwater catches on rooftops and surface water on a limited scale but with promising results 24 28 however we think there is a lack first in alternative catchment surfaces and second in their treatments so both are the innovations for this work aiming an effective stormwater management this paper focuses on the characterization of stormwater harvested on the ground and evaluates microfiltration and ultrafiltration as techniques for this purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling stormwater was collected in the parking lot of the faculty of law at the university of passo fundo rio grande do sul state brazil 28 13 34 97 s 52 23 16 53 w looking for large volumes of sampling stormwater and future filtration systems we decided to use a parking lot as catching area we also wanted the worst pollutant load scenario and parking lots bring together different types of organic and inorganic pollutants the surface is covered by asphalt and has an area of 1177 18 m2 with an average slope of 7 fig 1 around the parking lot are large green areas including some area for studies of corn soy oat plantation the sampling of stormwater was carried out taking advantage of the gravity flow to the storm sewer two collection plastic tanks 50 l were placed into a drain sewer one tank was used for rapid settling and the other was used for stormwater collection fig 2 sampling was conducted between august and september 2016 according to the available meteorological information the precipitation in the city of passo fundo is greater between august and september 29 considering that the filtration process would have to be carried out for long periods of time to obtain the flux curve and therefore with large amounts of feeding volume the sampling process had to be carried out when more stormwater was available six samplings were made to perform three filtration and characterization

as media filters with zeolite 62 and activated carbon 63 achieved e coli similar efficiencies 96 and 98 respectively the uf membrane reached higher removal rates for heavy metals such as fe 92 14 and ni 61 90 iron may be absorbed into the soil or organic matter that comes from green areas and nearby crops calcite zeolite and iron fillings in filter systems can achieve 90 100 removal efficiencies for cd cu pb ni cr and zn with much higher stormwater influent concentrations which vary between 2 5 mg l to 50 mg l 48 removal of oil and grease is less than 50 for both mf 22 83 mean and uf 37 11 mean it is possible that apolar constituents arose from oil emulsions whose size vary between 100 to 10 000 nm 64 and thus are not retained by either the pore diameter mf or the molecular weight cut off uf the urban stormwater runoff could carry out hydrocarbons to water bodies mainly because of oily materials 65 to identify what type of constituents the oily materials had we performed a chromatograph scanning for hydrocarbons present in fuel as gasoline and diesel the gas chromatographic profiles of standard fingerprints stormwater and permeate of uf running are shown in fig 5 we can see a little peak near 50 min on chromatographic profile of stormwater fig 5 b identifying a possible presence of the c29 however the chromatographic analysis leads us to conclude that all stormwater samples in this study did not show the profile of waters contaminated with hydrocarbons composed by c14 to c30 carbon chains suggesting that the oils and greases presented are not due to leaks or spills of fuels latimer et al 66 compared the chromatographic analysis of stormwater runoff in commercial residential and highway sites with five refined petroleum products profiles gasoline no 2 fuel oil no 6 fuel oil used crankcase oil and virgin crankcase oil the results showed that hydrocarbon concentrations come mainly from used engine oil for the three areas studied it is possible that stormwater collected in this study was contaminated with multiple types and concentrations of oils and greases table 6 both vegetal because the collection area is surrounded by green areas and mineral engine oil it becomes difficult to identify the type of hydrocarbons in addition there may be concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs common substances in stormwater runoff from parking lots and highways 14 15 5 17 which would be related to the concentrations of oily materials 3 3 treated stormwater applications prospects 3 3 1 stormwater for urban use quality assessment of mf and uf permeate for urban use was performed using guidelines issued by the united states environmental protection agency 33 the spanish department of environment and rural and marine environment ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino 67 and the department of environment and conservation of new south wales 34 from australia the epa 33 proposes values for treatment goal in reclaimed water its main applications are for recreational and landscape irrigation fire protection and toilet flushing the marm offers guidelines for three different scenarios where the wastewater can be used after treatment the parameters offered by the dec nsw 34 specific for stormwater use are for garden watering toilet flushing and car washing uses the mean quality concentrations of mf and uf permeates extracted from table 7 and the standards are presented in table 8 in general the stormwater treated by mf and uf showed good quality indicator for water reuse some comments a the epa 33 suggests low concentrations of cd and ni for reclaimed water for irrigation as cd can be toxic to plants for both mf and uf treatment cd must be dissolved in stormwater and neither mf nor uf was able to remove it for other uses ornamental use toilet flushing and fire protection mf and uf permeate can be used for if it also meets the microbiological quality in addition microbiological control can be easily performed by chlorination b turbidity and ph are within the limits established by the dec nsw 34 for residential uses the quantification of salts nutrients heavy metals and pesticides is required despite no specific limits for our treated stormwater the values of the other guidelines are a good quality indicator c for the marm 67 both permeates meet the turbidity total suspended solids and total phosphorus requirements for all proposed uses including washing streets vehicles irrigation flushing toilets recreation and fire protection however other parameters are also required such as legionella spp and intestinal nematodes if there is a risk of aerosolization however mf and uf are capable to remove nematodes and the chlorination can be used for control of legionella spp several authors 68 69 6 17 recommend the disposal of the first millimeters of rain as a very effective technique for improving the quality of water collected at rooftops and from the ground physico chemical characteristics such as color electrical conductivity turbidity ph and hardness can be reduced with bypass systems for that rain volume sedimentation and filtration systems contribute to the reduction of cod and tss concentrations because of the strong correlation between both parameters and the material dragged by first rain collected thus an arrangement of these methods could be performed for harvest stormwater in traffic surfaces to address both physico chemical parameters and microbiological quality 3 3 2 pollution control of stormwater by mf and uf different methods of stormwater treatment are known in the field of pollution control besides characterization of ph temperature dissolved oxygen and bacterial criteria there is a rather large list of other parameters that must be evaluated related to toxic radioactive and deleterious materials as well as aesthetic values brazil classifies its surface freshwater bodies in four classes according to their predominant use applications range from human supply protection of aquatic species food crops irrigation and navigation 70 brazil also has regulations for the management of the discharge of effluents to water bodies 71 characteristics of third and fourth class water bodies with the maximum values for effluents are summarized in table 9 it is possible to achieve effluents quality parameters with mf and uf except defined concentrations for oil and grease however effluent quality parameters can be used as long as receiving body characteristics are not altered mainly by the inflow rate in addition brazilian regulation includes the study of other organic compounds fourth class rivers are for navigation and landscape harmony the quality criteria for this class are easily achievable with mf and uf the permeate quality of both membranes allows stormwater to be classified as third class applications pertaining to third class rivers include human supply irrigation of non food crops fishing and secondary contact recreation however the concentrations of zn cu and fe agree with those limits our results also show that stormwater could be a strong source of metal contamination of surface water bodies and unfortunately mf and uf are not classical methods for metal removal from waters in fact for pb cd which was very close to the regulation value cr and ni complementary techniques might be implemented for use as has been highlighted the membranes separation processes will be competitive with other treatment mechanisms depending on the final use of stormwater however one of the biggest advantages of mf and uf systems are the multiple materials that can be used such as polymeric nanofibers 25 polysulfone 24 ceramics 28 or metals 31 which can meet multiple quality criteria and in turn provide the necessary economic viability nevertheless research for stormwater and surface water treatment by mf and uf is limited mf and uf processes have competitive hydraulic permeability rates as seen in item 3 2 this may be perhaps one of the main advantages over known techniques allowing treatment of large stormwater volumes in case of heavy rains and in addition longer durations of constant operation 3 3 3 stormwater treatment system we designed a treatment system for the stormwater in the selected parking lot the peak flow was estimated for each of the samples taken in this study and the results are shown in table 10 the rational method is one of the oldest and most widely used to scale hydraulic structures such as drainage collectors pipelines and aqueducts for storm water the peak flow q 72 is defined as q c i a where c is a dimensionless runoff coefficient based on the slope and the type of soil i is the average intensity of rain and a is the contributing drainage area a runoff coefficient c of 0 85 corresponding to the parking lot was used a treatment system with a uf membrane was proposed for the maximum estimated volume run 2 it was designed with a filtration time of 12 h and an average membrane flow of 100 l h m2 fig 4 thus membrane area required is 11 m2 so with a membrane module of 1 m in length a total of 32 modules would be needed a sketch of the system is shown in fig 6 for dry periods equalization basins can be designed to store great volumes of stormwater while the entire system can gradually filter it out after filtration membranes can be storage in standby into the same equalization basin with permeate the treatment system needs an area of only 1 6 m2 with an uf average recovery rate of 78 9 table 5 the treated water volume would be 10 823 l with such a value the possibility of use in urban environments or contribution to surface water bodies will be analyzed however a more detailed analysis would have to be done considering the variables of precipitation hydraulic variables collection energy consumption equalization basins complementary techniques storage and supply 4 conclusions stormwater harvested from paved surfaces and treated by mf and uf offers an excellent alternative for non potable uses both mf and uf are efficient techniques that meet quality standards for non drinking activities such as flushing toilets cleaning activities irrigation ornamental uses and fire protection nevertheless a deeper microbiological quality analysis is required to determine if any additional processes are necessary to achieve 100 of the quality requirements membrane techniques also can be suitable for pollutant load reduction that reaches water bodies for stormwater mf and uf membranes have high removal efficiency for total suspended solids total coliforms fecal coliforms and bod however a low removal of heavy metals lead cadmium chromium nickel was exhibited by both membranes the uf technique is more efficient than the mf technique achieving a better flux rate in constant operation and in backflush processes as well as greater removal rates thus uf and best management practices may be complementary to obtain an overall better performance a feasibility analysis should be performed according to quality criteria and operating conditions this can bring numerous benefits such as a reduction in the consumption of drinking water alternative water sources and flood control acknowledgement the corresponding author a d o s would like to acknowledge the funding by the postgraduate program in civil and environmental

14398,in the application of ultrafiltration uf membranes organics can result in severe hydraulically irreversible fouling which is not eliminated effectively by periodic backwashing using nacl solution as backwash water the effects of feed water properties and hydrodynamic conditions on irreversible fouling caused by humic acid and sodium alginate were systematically investigated results showed that nacl solution backwashing resulted in high hydraulic cleaning efficiencies hces which were hardly affected by feed concentrations ionic strengths solution temperatures filtration fluxes backwash fluxes and backwash intervals p 0 05 an alleviated hydraulically irreversible fouling was observed at a low feed concentration a low ionic strength a high temperature a small filtration flux a large backwash flux a long backwash duration and a short backwash interval using a constant backwash volume all the multiple backwash parameters of nacl solution backwashing led to high and comparable hces 97 and the hifis were equal statistically p 0 05 for a fixed backwash duration or interval membrane charge and surface tension analysis suggested that nacl solution backwashing outperformed uf permeate backwashing by restoring almost characteristics of uf membranes scanning electron microscopy observation further revealed the superiority of nacl solution backwashing to uf permeate backwashing for alleviating organic fouling of uf membranes keywords irreversible fouling uf membrane salt solution backwashing humic acid sodium alginate 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf is one of the most promising treatment technologies for addressing the microbiological safety of municipal water supplies by lowering filtered water turbidity and removing disinfectant tolerant microorganisms 1 the past three decades have seen phenomenal growth in the application of uf membranes for drinking water production 2 however membrane fouling which results in decreased membrane lifetimes and increased operational costs is a key challenge for the sustainable operation of uf membranes 3 membrane fouling can be classified as hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling based on hydraulic backwashing irreversible fouling is more problematic as it accumulates in the long term operation and impacts the sustainable operation of uf system 4 organic matters could result in severe irreversible fouling being a dominant operational problem 4 5 thus increasing concerns have be paid for the removal of organic foulant during periodic backwashing the existing studies involving the hydraulically irreversibility of uf membrane fouling caused by organics for potable water treatment primarily focused on factors influencing membrane fouling irreversibility such as membrane properties 6 7 feed water properties 8 9 and hydrodynamic conditions 10 11 as a key backwash parameter backwash water composite greatly influenced hydraulically irreversibility of membrane fouling 7 11 13 in most uf membrane systems uf permeates have been widely used for backwashing but this approach is limited by a low backwash efficiency 11 13 especially for organic fouling of uf membrane recently hydraulic cleaning efficiency hce of purer backwash water than uf permeate has been investigated the organic fouling layer could be easily removed by substituting the backwash water from uf permeate to deionized water 11 13 reverse osmosis ro permeate or nanofiltration nf permeate 13 14 as a substantial volume of pure water was consumed for cleaning the application of this backwash method should be weighted by balancing its effectiveness and water recovery of ro unit in a hybrid uf ro system up to now only a few groups have carried out the cleaning tests of uf membrane by means of saline solutions although inconsistent results on the performance of salt backwashing have been reported 13 15 25 it has been proven that organic foulants deposited in membranes are easily detached via forward cleaning e g soaking using nacl solutions 15 17 the effectiveness of nacl solution makes it possible to clean an uf membrane during backwashing li et al 13 18 19 indicated that na in backwash water had an adverse impact on hce and the authors attributed this to charge screening effect and calcium bridging effect with the former one as the dominant mechanism 19 in our previous studies 7 26 27 on the effect of backwash water composition on uf fouling caused by humic acid ha and sodium alginate sa ultrapure water was not the optimal backwash water because nacl solution backwashing resulted in higher hce due to breakup of calcium bridging effect ion exchange effect on the other hand high saline solutions e g ro concentrate or seawater have been utilized to backwash uf membranes for fouling alleviation and cost savings 20 25 the superiority of ro concentrate backwash for uf membrane fouling control has been demonstrated in pilot and filed studies 22 24 a pilot study reported by gilabert oriol et al 22 indicated that the same fouling tendency of the uf membrane was observed for backwashing with ro concentrate and uf permeate whereas the former method increased the efficiency of the uf process by 10 from 88 to 98 field studies with an integrated uf ro pilot system demonstrated that when backwash water of uf membranes was changed from ro permeate to ro concentrate the overall energy cost per volume of permeate product decreased by 43 23 coupled with a self adaptive in line coagulant dosing approach uf system with ro concentrate backwashing could maintain sustainable operation during periods of both mild and severe water quality degradation 24 an uf operation which combines continuous ro concentrate backwash with multiple consecutive backwash pulses was more effective than with a single pulse self adaptive triggering of uf backwash was highly effective in enabling uf operation over a wider range of water quality conditions and without the need for chemical cleaning 25 overall previous studies involving salt backwashing primarily focused on its effectiveness for uf fouling control and conflicting conclusions have been reported the scope of this study was to contribute to our understanding of backwash behaviors for organic fouled uf membranes using salt solutions this work was carried out to systematically investigate the effect of feed water properties and hydrodynamic conditions on hce and irreversible fouling in successive filtration backwash steps using nacl solution backwashing and uf permeate backwashing therefore the objectives of this study was a to evaluate the performance of nacl backwashing for uf membrane fouling caused by organics with different properties b to investigate the role of hydrodynamic conditions during filtration and backwash in the backwash behaviors of nacl solution and c to compare the cleaning behaviors between nacl solution backwashing and uf permeate backwashing 2 material and methods 2 1 feed water and backwash water unless otherwise specified all reagents and chemicals were analytical grade and solutions were prepared by diluting with ultrapure water nacl cacl2 2h2o hcl and naoh were purchased from tianjin benchmark chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china ultrapure water 18 2 mÏ cm was obtained from a water filtration system emd millipore corp billerica ma usa ha and sa were used as representatives of humic substances and polysaccharides in natural waters respectively 8 28 29 ha and sa were purchased from sigma aldrich co llc usa and stock solutions 2 g l were prepared as described in our previous papers 7 26 fresh solutions of ha and sa solutions were prepared by diluting both stock solutions a ca2 concentration of 0 5 mmol l was employed and ionic strengths were adjusted using nacl 7 26 the ph of each solution was adjusted to 7 5 using 1 mol l naoh or hcl solution the backwash water used in this work included nacl solution with a concentration of 10 mmol l and uf permeate the concentration of nacl solution was chosen due to its excellent cleaning performance for a large range of concentrations 26 water quality of uf permeate was dependent on feed water properties with the compositions in a typical uf test bold parameters in table 1 listed in table s1 supporting information 2 2 uf membrane and uf setup flat sheet polyethersulfone pes pall corp pt

monitor the trans membrane pressure tmp the transducer was connected to a computer and the pressure data were automatically logged every 30 s 2 3 experimental protocol and backwash performance evaluation in some bench scale tests the backwash procedure of a dead end uf disc was performed by placing the reverse side of membrane upwards under constant pressure or flux filtration mode manually 8 30 31 using a homemade filtration cell the robust structure of the uf disc with a small filtration area made it possible for the periodic filtration backwash as described in our previous work 26 the results obtained using bench scale flat sheet uf membranes provide helpful information for full scale operations 32 33 multi cycle uf tests with periodic filtration backwashing consisted of four steps

and backwash intervals for uf tests in a typical uf test feed concentration were 5 and 2 mg l for ha and sa solutions which has an ionic strength of 10 mmol l uf tests were carried out at 20 c at a filtration flux of 180 lmh a backwash with a flux of 180 lmh was carried out 120 s every 30 min filtration backwash performance of uf membranes was evaluated by hce and hydraulically irreversible

system model 682 gatan usa in addition membrane charge and hydrophilicity could be expressed as trans membrane streaming potential coefficient spc and surface tensions the detailed calculation were described in s3 supporting information to statistically evaluate the effects of feed water properties and hydrodynamic conditions on hce or hifi a two way analysis of variance anova was conducted using spss statistics software ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of feed water properties 3 1 1 effect of feed concentration fig 1 shows the values of hce and hifi when feeding with different concentrations of ha and sa solutions as presented in fig 1a there was no significant difference in hces when ha concentrations ranged from 2 to 10 mg l p 0 05 and the average values were 97 6 when sa solutions were filtrated comparable and high hces were observed for different concentrations p 0 05 with the average hce of 98 0 since most organic foulants have been removed by nacl solution backwashing due to the excellent backwash performance the small remaining foulant on membrane led to low irreversible fouling 7 26 as shown in fig 1b a low concentration ha solution resulted in smaller hifi decreasing from 0 50 to 0 21 m 1 similarly the hifi decreased from 0 53 to 0 22 m 1 when the feed sa concentrations decreased from 5 to 1 mg l p 0 05 the decreasing irreversible fouling with the decline in organic contents was consistent with previous literature 30 31 as also presented in fig 1b the hifis of sa solutions were much higher than that of ha solutions for a given feed concentration i e 2 or 5 mg l at the same concentration membrane fouling caused by ha solution was more severe than that by sa solution but the backwash performance of sa solutions was smaller similar results has been reported in previous literature when pure water was used as backwash water 34 35 in addition the prefixed concentrations of ha solution and sa solution were 5 and 2 mg l respectively these concentrations were employed to produce comparable fouling for backwash evaluation 3 1 2 effect of ionic strength fig 2 illustrates the effects of ionic strengths of ha and sa solutions on hce and hifi as presented in fig 2a when ha solutions were filtrated high hces were observed at all tested ionic strengths for nacl solution backwashing and they were the same statistically p 0 05 with an average hce of 97 4 meanwhile the excellent backwash performance was hardly influenced by the ionic strengths when sa fouled membranes were backwashed by nacl solution p 0 05 and high hces 97 6 were observed seen from fig 2b very low hifis were found for nacl solution backwashing and the hifis increased 0 33 0 55 m 1 when the ionic strengths of ha solutions varied from 2 to 100 mmol l p 0 05 when sa solutions were filtrated the hifis after nacl solution backwashing also increased from 0 40 to 0 62 m 1 as the ionic strengths increased from 2 to 100 mmol l at a high ionic strength the electrostatic repulsion between membrane and ha or sa decreased due to compaction of the electric double layers the fouling layer might be dense with small permeable to water resulting in a rapid increase in membrane fouling during the uf of ha or sa solution 36 because the ha or sa solutions under different ionic strengths showed comparable hces the irreversible fouling of uf membranes was similar to that of total fouling based on calculation equation of hce using permeability 7 this phenomenon was consistent with previous studies on the role of ionic strengths on uf fouling caused by organics 11 36 3 1 3 effect of temperature fig 3 shows the values of hce and hifi for nacl solution backwashing during filtration of ha solutions and sa solutions under different temperatures as presented in fig 3a the obtained p values were 0 121 and 0 312 p 0 05 for ha and sa solutions respectively suggesting that the effect of temperature on hce was not significant the average hces for both feed solutions were 96 8 and 97 3 respectively seen from fig 3b as for ha solutions the irreversible fouling was quite small and hifi values decreased from 0 45 to 0 29 m 1 when the temperatures increased from 5 to 35 c when sa solutions were filtrated the hifi value decreased from 0 72 m 1 at 5 c to 0 42 m 1 at 35 c firstly high temperatures led to a decrease in the surface tension which enhances the effectiveness of nacl as cleaning agent 16 secondly the rates of both reaction between nacl and the deposited foulants and the transport of foulants from the fouling layer to the bulk solution increased at high temperatures 37 38 in addition the structural stability of organic fouling layer might be weakened at higher temperatures 37 all the reasons above promoted the decrease in irreversible fouling caused by organics at a high temperature on the contrast a high hifi was observed at a low temperature as reported elsewhere 38 39 3 2 effect of hydrodynamic conditions 3 2 1 effects of filtration flux and backwash flux fig 4 shows the effects of filtration flux and backwash flux on hce and hifi when ha solutions and sa solutions were filtrated using nacl solution as backwash water as presented in fig 4a there was not a significant difference in the hces for ha solution p 0 05 with an average hce of 97 2 as for sa solutions the high hces of nacl backwashing were hardly influenced by permeate flux p 0 05 with the average value of 97 8 regarding hydraulically irreversible fouling fig 4b low irreversible fouling was observed and the hifi values increased from 0 31 to 0 47 m 1 for ha solutions with the increase in filtration flux when sa solutions were filtrated the hifis were 0 40 0 64 m 1 when the filtration fluxes increased from 120 to 240 l m2 h operation at a low flux has been proven to be an effective approach for membrane fouling control and a flux above a critical value led to severe membrane fouling 40 41 although a high backwash efficiency could be obtained using an appropriate backwash water similar phenomenon has been reported for surface water uf using pure water as backwash water 42 in addition the potential disadvantage of the accumulated irreversible fouling at a high filtration flux e g critical flux to process sustainability of an uf system for long term operation should not be ignored 43 a serial of backwash fluxes involving 90 180 270 and 360 lmh were investigated at a permeate flux of 180 lmh the low backwash strength jbw jfl 1 was selected because an effective backwash behavior might also be produced using this strength of backwashing 43 45 as presented in fig 4c there was an insignificant difference in hces under different backwash fluxes based on p values obtained p 0 947 and 0 845 0 05 with the average hces of 98 0 and 98 2 for ha solutions and sa solutions respectively ye et al 44 also stated that comparable hces 79 3 85 5 were obtained when backwash strengths jbw jfl increased from 0 5 to 2 for seawater pretreatment using uf membranes as for irreversible fouling of ha solutions the backwash flux of 90 lmh resulted in the largest hifi 0 42 m 1 while the hifis 0 34 0 33 m 1 were hardly affected by backwash strengths when backwash fluxes increased from 180 to 360 lmh when sa solutions were filtrated the hifis also decreased from 0 56 to 0 40 m 1 with the increase in backwash flux as shown in fig 4d in the long term operation of an uf membrane an increasing backwash fluxes might be an effective approach for membrane fouling control because the accumulated foulants required a larger backwash force to remove 43 3 2 2 effects of backwash duration and interval fig 5 presents the effects of backwash durations and intervals on hce and hifi for nacl solution backwashing when ha and sa solutions were filtrated as for ha solutions fig 5a there was no significant difference in hces for backwash duration between 45 and 120 s p 0 05 while low hces 66 0 and 83 9 were observed when backwash durations shortened to 30 and 10 s as for sa solutions high and comparable hces 93 3 98 0 were found when a backwash lasted for more than 30 s but a significant decrease in hce for the backwash duration of 10 s was observed the obvious increase in hydraulically irreversible fouling with the decreasing of backwash duration was reflected by the hifis in fig 5b specifically when backwash duration decreased from 120 to 10 s the hifis increased from 0 34 to 5 03 m 1 for ha solutions and the values varied from 0 47 to 10 20 m 1 for sa solutions these results indicated that an insufficient backwash duration might deteriorate the backwash performance because a short backwash duration only expanded the foulant layer which was subsequently recompressed back to the membrane surface when filtration resumed 46 according to the results reported by akhondi et al 47 the minimum backwash duration was the time when the pressure on the permeate side of the membrane at the end of a backwash cycle reached the atmospheric pressure maintained on the feed side in this study a backwash duration of no less than 45 s was necessary to achieve efficient backwashing for both organic solutions regarding the role of backwash interval as presented in fig 5c high hces were observed for ha and sa solutions when backwash intervals ranged from 15 to 60 min there was no significant difference in hces for these backwash intervals the average values were 97 8 and 97 7 for ha and sa solutions respectively considering the irreversible fouling fig 5d low hifis were found for backwash intervals of 30 and 60 min regardless of feeding with ha or sa solutions furthermore even a less hifi was obtained when the backwash interval shortened to 15 min although most fouling could be relieved by nacl solution backwashing the operation with a long backwash interval increased the instability of uf systems in the long term operation for example when sa solutions were filtrated the final tmp of the uf membrane with a backwash every 60 min reached approximately 70 kpa data not shown as a long backwash interval may compact the fouling layer and increase the difficulty of foulant removal during backwashing 44 48 this transition of the fouling layer from reversible to irreversible causes a decrease in backwash efficiency and the increase of energy demand on the other hand backwashing with an overly high frequency uses more permeate for cleaning than what is required 49 which decreases the net productivity and increases the energy consumption compared with fixed frequency backwash using ro concentrate self adaptive frequency backwash extended the projected uf operation from approximately 16 to 143 days 23 3 2 3 effects of multiple backwash parameters as the backwash performance of uf membranes is affected by more than a single parameter it is necessary to carry out uf tests at the same backwash water productivity with the results illustrated in fig 6 as presented in fig 6a there was no significant between hces at different backwash conditions investigated when nacl solution was used as backwash water p 0 05 and the average hces were 97 2 and 97 4 for ha solutions and sa solutions respectively with the increase in backwash interval the increased hifis were observed though they were quite small as presented in fig 6b published literature 50 also demonstrated that a longer backwash interval with a longer duration tfl tbw 15 0 5 30 1 60 2 120 4 240 8 resulted in a rapid fouling rate though membrane fouling for different backwash intervals were similar resosudarmo et al 11 indicated that though the variation in backwash condition led to minor differences in irreversible fouling hces decreased when backwash interval increased from 60 to 240 min tfl tbw 60 1 120 2 240 4 a constant volume of backwash water was maintained by varying backwash flux and duration when a fixed backwash interval was used tfl 30 min fig 6c and d or by varying backwash flux and interval for a fixed backwash duration tbw 2 min fig 6e and f as presented in fig 6c high hces were observed when backwash fluxes ranged from 90 to 360 lmh and there was no significant difference in hces for these backwash conditions p 0 05 with the average of 96 9 and 97 7 for ha and sa solutions respectively regarding the hydraulically irreversible fouling fig 6d low hifis were obtained and they were hardly influenced by backwash fluxes and durations with the average of 0 35 and 0 46 m 1 for ha and sa solutions respectively similar results could be found when a fixed backwash duration was used the average hces were 97 7 and 97 7 for ha and sa solutions respectively fig 6e the results indicated that the hces of organic fouled uf membranes were hardly influenced by multiple backwash parameters during nacl backwashing when the backwash volume was maintained to be constant previous literature also demonstrated that using the same backwash volume when backwash fluxes were 36 5 54 75 109 5 164 25 and 219 lmh backwash intervals were 90 60 30 20 and 15 s correspondingly the hces were 88 5 94 9 93 1 88 3 and 91 2 respectively 44 3 3 comparison of uf backwashing with nacl solution and uf permeate the hces and hifis for organic fouled uf membranes backwashed by uf permeate were summarized in tables s2 s3 supporting information different to the low hces for uf permeate backwashing higher hces were obtained for nacl solution backwashing with an increase of 35 68 42 48 and 41 47 50 82 for ha and sa solutions respectively table s2 regarding the hifis when ha solutions were filtrated the values using nacl solutions were just 4 14 of that using uf permeate backwashing and the values were approximate 4 25 for sa solutions table s3 during the uf of ha or sa solutions ca2 bind preferentially to the carboxylic functional groups resulting in cross linked structure 37 during backwashing with nacl solution besides the backward hydrodynamic force the ion exchange between na and bound ca2 in fouling layer broke down the cross linked ha ca or sa ca complex allowing the deposited foulants easily to be detached from membrane surface 7 26 for better comparisons between nacl solution backwashing and uf permeate backwashing membrane charges surface tensions Î³tot and sem images of membrane surfaces were investigated the normalized spcs and surface tensions of fouled membrane and cleaned membranes in a typical uf test i e bold parameters in table 1 were summarized in table s4 supporting information when ha solutions were filtrated the trans membrane spc decreased to 39 01 0 62 mv bar after filtration without backwashing from 51 19 mv bar of a new membrane indicating that the fouled membrane showed the characteristics of foulants uf permeate backwashing just partly restored membrane charge with spc spc0 of 82 6 while the membrane charge was almost recovered by nacl solution backwashing 93 9 the reduction in the net negative charge of the uf membrane after being fouled by nom has been also reported 13 26 similarly nacl backwashing restored the charge of sa fouled uf membrane by 32 7 from 56 9 to 89 6 compared with a small recovery using uf permeate backwashing by 9 5 table s4 supporting information in addition the highest Î³tot was observed for organic fouled membranes without backwash compared with the new membrane of 41 22 0 80 mj m2 while uf permeate backwashing just slightly decreased the surface tensions an obvious decrease in Î³tot was observed for nacl solution backwashing the low Î³tot corresponded to a small hifi because there was a positive relation between hifis and Î³tot 27 fig 7 shows the sem images of fouled membrane surfaces before and after backwashing using nacl solution and uf permeate as presented in fig 7a and b a thick cake layer or gel layer was formed on the membrane surface during filtration of ha or sa respectively these observations were agree to the results reported by katsoufidou et al 28 29 when the ha solution was filtrated the surfaces of uf membranes cleaned by nacl solution was rather clean in comparison a large amount of cake foulants was still deposited on the membranes after backwashing with uf permeate fig 7e similar to the fouled membrane without backwashing as for sa solutions nacl solution backwashing resulted in a clean membrane surface bur uf permeate backwashing led to a surface with a large amount of gel foulants as presented in previous literature 26 in addition the contents of elemental ca in fouling layer of fouled membranes identified using eds and those cleaned by nacl solution and uf permeate are also illustrated in fig 7 the relative contents of ca after backwashing with nacl solution and uf permeate suggested the existence of ion exchange between na and bound ca2 during nacl cleaning the breakup of calcium bridging effect attributed to the superiority of nacl solution backwashing 7 26 4 conclusions the effects

14398,in the application of ultrafiltration uf membranes organics can result in severe hydraulically irreversible fouling which is not eliminated effectively by periodic backwashing using nacl solution as backwash water the effects of feed water properties and hydrodynamic conditions on irreversible fouling caused by humic acid and sodium alginate were systematically investigated results

backwash fluxes and backwash intervals p 0 05 an alleviated hydraulically irreversible fouling was observed at a low feed concentration a low ionic strength a high temperature a small filtration flux a large backwash flux a long backwash duration and a short backwash interval using a constant backwash volume all the multiple backwash parameters of nacl solution backwashing led to high and comparable hces 97 and the hifis were equal statistically p 0 05 for a fixed backwash duration or interval membrane charge and surface tension analysis suggested that nacl solution backwashing outperformed uf permeate backwashing by restoring almost characteristics of uf membranes scanning electron microscopy observation further revealed the superiority of nacl solution backwashing to uf permeate backwashing for alleviating organic fouling of uf membranes keywords irreversible fouling uf membrane salt solution backwashing humic acid sodium alginate 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf is one of the most promising treatment technologies for addressing the microbiological safety of municipal water supplies by lowering filtered water turbidity and removing disinfectant tolerant microorganisms 1 the past three decades have seen phenomenal growth in the application of uf membranes for drinking water production 2 however membrane fouling which results in decreased membrane lifetimes and increased operational costs is a key challenge for the sustainable operation of uf membranes 3 membrane fouling can be classified as hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling based on hydraulic backwashing irreversible fouling is more problematic as it accumulates in the long term operation and impacts the sustainable operation of uf system 4 organic matters could result in severe irreversible fouling being a dominant operational problem 4 5 thus increasing concerns have be paid for the removal of organic foulant during periodic backwashing the existing studies involving the hydraulically irreversibility of uf membrane fouling caused by organics for potable water treatment primarily focused on factors influencing membrane fouling irreversibility such as membrane properties 6 7 feed water properties 8 9 and hydrodynamic conditions 10 11 as a key backwash parameter backwash water composite greatly influenced hydraulically irreversibility of membrane fouling 7 11 13 in most uf membrane systems uf permeates have been widely used for backwashing but this approach is limited by a low backwash efficiency 11 13 especially for organic fouling of uf membrane recently hydraulic cleaning efficiency hce of purer backwash water than uf permeate has been investigated the organic fouling layer could be easily removed by substituting the backwash water from uf permeate to deionized water 11 13 reverse osmosis ro permeate or nanofiltration nf permeate 13 14 as a substantial volume of pure water was consumed for cleaning the application of this backwash method should be weighted by balancing its effectiveness and water recovery of ro unit in a hybrid uf ro system up to now only a few groups have carried out the cleaning tests of uf membrane by means of saline solutions although inconsistent results on the performance of salt backwashing have been reported 13 15 25 it has been proven that organic foulants deposited in membranes are easily detached via forward cleaning e g soaking using nacl solutions 15 17 the effectiveness of nacl solution makes it possible to clean an uf membrane during backwashing li et al 13 18 19 indicated that na in backwash water had an adverse impact on hce and the authors attributed this to charge screening effect and calcium bridging effect with the former one as the dominant mechanism 19 in our previous studies 7 26 27 on the effect of backwash water composition on uf fouling caused by humic acid ha and sodium alginate sa ultrapure water was not the optimal backwash water because nacl solution backwashing resulted in higher hce due to breakup of calcium bridging effect ion exchange effect on the other hand high saline solutions e g ro concentrate or seawater have been utilized to backwash uf membranes for fouling alleviation and cost savings 20 25 the superiority of ro concentrate backwash for uf membrane fouling control has been demonstrated in pilot and filed studies 22 24 a pilot study reported by gilabert oriol et al 22 indicated that the same fouling tendency of the uf membrane was observed for backwashing with ro concentrate and uf permeate whereas the former method increased the efficiency of the uf process by 10 from 88 to 98 field studies with an integrated uf ro pilot system demonstrated that when backwash water of uf membranes was changed from ro permeate to ro concentrate the overall energy cost per volume of permeate product decreased by 43 23 coupled with a self adaptive in line coagulant dosing approach uf system with ro concentrate backwashing could maintain sustainable operation during periods of both mild and severe water quality degradation 24 an uf operation which combines continuous ro concentrate backwash with multiple consecutive backwash pulses was more effective than with a single pulse self adaptive triggering of uf backwash was highly effective in enabling uf operation over a wider range of water quality conditions and without the need for chemical cleaning 25 overall previous studies involving salt backwashing primarily focused on its effectiveness for uf fouling control and conflicting conclusions have been reported the scope of this study was to contribute to our understanding of backwash behaviors for organic fouled uf membranes using salt solutions this work was carried out to systematically investigate the effect of feed water properties and hydrodynamic conditions on hce and irreversible fouling in successive filtration backwash steps using nacl solution backwashing and uf permeate backwashing therefore the objectives of this study was a to evaluate the performance of nacl backwashing for uf membrane fouling caused by organics with different properties b to investigate the role of hydrodynamic conditions during filtration and backwash in the backwash behaviors of nacl solution and c to compare the cleaning behaviors between nacl solution backwashing and uf permeate backwashing 2 material and methods 2 1 feed water and backwash water unless otherwise specified all reagents and chemicals were analytical grade and solutions were prepared by diluting with ultrapure water nacl cacl2 2h2o hcl and naoh were purchased from tianjin benchmark chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china ultrapure water 18 2 mÏ cm was obtained from a water filtration system emd millipore corp billerica ma usa ha and sa were used as representatives of humic substances and polysaccharides in natural waters respectively 8 28 29 ha and sa were purchased from sigma aldrich co llc usa and stock solutions 2 g l were prepared as described in our previous papers 7 26 fresh solutions of ha and sa solutions were prepared by diluting both stock solutions a ca2 concentration of 0 5 mmol l was employed and ionic strengths were adjusted using nacl 7 26 the ph of each solution was adjusted to 7 5 using 1 mol l naoh or hcl solution the backwash water used in this work included nacl solution with a concentration of 10 mmol l and uf permeate the concentration of nacl solution was chosen due to its excellent cleaning performance for a large range of concentrations 26 water quality of uf permeate was dependent on feed water properties with the compositions in a typical uf test bold parameters in table 1 listed in table s1 supporting information 2 2 uf membrane and uf setup flat sheet polyethersulfone pes pall corp pt washington ny usa uf membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kda were used a new membrane disc with an effective surface area of 4 15 cm2 was used for each filtration run the membranes were negatively charged with zeta potentials of membrane surfaces of 21 69 1 11 mv 7 the new membranes were soaked in ultrapure water for 24 h and the water was replaced at least three times ultrapure water was then filtered with the membranes until the total organic carbon toc content of the filtrate was zero bench scale setup fig s1 supporting information consisted of a self made uf cell a high

monitor the trans membrane pressure tmp the transducer was connected to a computer and the pressure data were automatically logged every 30 s 2 3 experimental protocol and backwash performance evaluation in some bench scale tests the backwash procedure of a dead end uf disc was performed by placing the reverse side of membrane upwards under constant pressure or flux filtration mode manually 8 30 31 using a homemade filtration cell the robust structure of the uf disc with a small filtration area made it possible for the periodic filtration backwash as described in our previous work 26 the results obtained using bench scale flat sheet uf membranes provide helpful information for full scale operations 32 33 multi cycle uf tests with periodic filtration backwashing consisted of four steps

exceeded 80 kpa table 1 summarizes the feed water properties organic concentrations ionic strengths and temperatures and hydrodynamic conditions filtration fluxes backwash fluxes backwash durations and backwash intervals for uf tests in a typical uf test feed concentration were 5 and 2 mg l for ha and sa solutions which has an ionic strength of 10 mmol l uf tests were carried out at 20 c at a filtration flux of 180 lmh a backwash with a flux of 180 lmh was carried out 120 s every 30 min filtration backwash performance of uf membranes was evaluated by hce and hydraulically irreversible fouling index hifi which could be calculated via eqs 1 2 as described in previous study 26 1 h c e n 1 k h c e n k t m p f n t m p i n i n 1 t m p f n t m p i n i n 2 1 js 1 hifi v s where tm p ini n

system model 682 gatan usa in addition membrane charge and hydrophilicity could be expressed as trans membrane streaming potential coefficient spc and surface tensions the detailed calculation were described in s3 supporting information to statistically evaluate the effects of feed water properties and hydrodynamic conditions on hce or hifi a two way analysis of variance anova was conducted using spss statistics software ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of feed water properties 3 1 1 effect of feed concentration fig 1 shows the values of hce and hifi when feeding with different concentrations of ha and sa solutions as presented in fig 1a there was no significant difference in hces when ha concentrations ranged from 2 to 10 mg l p 0 05 and the average values were 97 6 when sa solutions were filtrated comparable and high hces were observed for different concentrations p 0 05 with the average hce of 98 0 since most organic foulants have been removed by nacl solution backwashing due to the excellent backwash performance the small remaining foulant on membrane led to low irreversible fouling 7 26 as shown in fig 1b a low concentration ha solution resulted in smaller hifi decreasing from 0 50 to 0 21 m 1 similarly the hifi decreased from 0 53 to 0 22 m 1 when the feed sa concentrations decreased from 5 to 1 mg l p 0 05 the decreasing irreversible fouling with the decline in organic contents was consistent with previous literature 30 31 as also presented in fig 1b the hifis of sa solutions were much higher than that of ha solutions for a given feed concentration i e 2 or 5 mg l at the same concentration membrane fouling caused by ha solution was more severe than that by sa solution but the backwash performance of sa solutions was smaller similar results has been reported in previous literature when pure water was used as backwash water 34 35 in addition the prefixed concentrations of ha solution and sa solution were 5 and 2 mg l respectively these concentrations were employed to produce comparable fouling for backwash evaluation 3 1 2 effect of ionic strength fig 2 illustrates the effects of ionic strengths of ha and sa solutions on hce and hifi as presented in fig 2a when ha solutions were filtrated high hces were observed at all tested ionic strengths for nacl solution backwashing and they were the same statistically p 0 05 with an average hce of 97 4 meanwhile the excellent backwash performance was hardly influenced by the ionic strengths when sa fouled membranes were backwashed by nacl solution p 0 05 and high hces 97 6 were observed seen from fig 2b very low hifis were found for nacl solution backwashing and the hifis increased 0 33 0 55 m 1 when the ionic strengths of ha solutions varied from 2 to 100 mmol l p 0 05 when sa solutions were filtrated the hifis after nacl solution backwashing also increased from 0 40 to 0 62 m 1 as the ionic strengths increased from 2 to 100 mmol l at a high ionic strength the electrostatic repulsion between membrane and ha or sa decreased due to compaction of the electric double layers the fouling layer might be dense with small permeable to water resulting in a rapid increase in membrane fouling during the uf of ha or sa solution 36 because the ha or sa solutions under different ionic strengths showed comparable hces the irreversible fouling of uf membranes was similar to that of total fouling based on calculation equation of hce using permeability 7 this phenomenon was consistent with previous studies on the role of ionic strengths on uf fouling caused by organics 11 36 3 1 3 effect of temperature fig 3 shows the values of hce and hifi for nacl solution backwashing during filtration of ha solutions and sa solutions under different temperatures as presented in fig 3a the obtained p values were 0 121 and 0 312 p 0 05 for ha and sa solutions respectively suggesting that the effect of temperature on hce was not significant the average hces for both feed solutions were 96 8 and 97 3 respectively seen from fig 3b as for ha solutions the irreversible fouling was quite small and hifi values decreased from 0 45 to 0 29 m 1 when the temperatures increased from 5 to 35 c when sa solutions were filtrated the hifi value decreased from 0 72 m 1 at 5 c to 0 42 m 1 at 35 c firstly high temperatures led to a decrease in the surface tension which enhances the effectiveness of nacl as cleaning agent 16 secondly the rates of both reaction between nacl and the deposited foulants and the transport of foulants from the fouling layer to the bulk solution increased at high temperatures 37 38 in addition the structural stability of organic fouling layer might be weakened at higher temperatures 37 all the reasons above promoted the decrease in irreversible fouling caused by organics at a high temperature on the contrast a high hifi was observed at a low temperature as reported elsewhere 38 39 3 2 effect of hydrodynamic conditions 3 2 1 effects of filtration flux and backwash flux fig 4 shows the effects of filtration flux and backwash flux on hce and hifi when ha solutions and sa solutions were filtrated using nacl solution as backwash water as presented in fig 4a there was not a significant difference in the hces for ha solution p 0 05 with an average hce of 97 2 as for sa solutions the high hces of nacl backwashing were hardly influenced by permeate flux p 0 05 with the average value of 97 8 regarding hydraulically irreversible fouling fig 4b low irreversible fouling was observed and the hifi values increased from 0 31 to 0 47 m 1 for ha solutions with the increase in filtration flux when sa solutions were filtrated the hifis were 0 40 0 64 m 1 when the filtration fluxes increased from 120 to 240 l m2 h operation at a low flux has been proven to be an effective approach for membrane fouling control and a flux above a critical value led to severe membrane fouling 40 41 although a high backwash efficiency could be obtained using an appropriate backwash water similar phenomenon has been reported for surface water uf using pure water as backwash water 42 in addition the potential disadvantage of the accumulated irreversible fouling at a high filtration flux e g critical flux to process sustainability of an uf system for long term operation should not be ignored 43 a serial of backwash fluxes involving 90 180 270 and 360 lmh were investigated at a permeate flux of 180 lmh the low backwash strength jbw jfl 1 was selected because an effective backwash behavior might also be produced using this strength of backwashing 43 45 as presented in fig 4c there was an insignificant difference in hces under different backwash fluxes based on p values obtained p 0 947 and 0 845 0 05 with the average hces of 98 0 and 98 2 for ha solutions and sa solutions respectively ye et al 44 also stated that comparable hces 79 3 85 5 were obtained when backwash strengths jbw jfl increased from 0 5 to 2 for seawater pretreatment using uf membranes as for irreversible fouling of ha solutions the backwash flux of 90 lmh resulted in the largest hifi 0 42 m 1 while the hifis 0 34 0 33 m 1 were hardly affected by backwash strengths when backwash fluxes increased from 180 to 360 lmh when sa solutions were filtrated the hifis also decreased from 0 56 to 0 40 m 1 with the increase in backwash flux as shown in fig 4d in the long term operation of an uf membrane an increasing backwash fluxes might be an effective approach for membrane fouling control because the accumulated foulants required a larger backwash force to remove 43 3 2 2 effects of backwash duration and interval fig 5 presents the effects of backwash durations and intervals on hce and hifi for nacl solution backwashing when ha and sa solutions were filtrated as for ha solutions fig 5a there was no significant difference in hces for backwash duration between 45 and 120 s p 0 05 while low hces 66 0 and 83 9 were observed when backwash durations shortened to 30 and 10 s as for sa solutions high and comparable hces 93 3 98 0 were found when a backwash lasted for more than 30 s but a significant decrease in hce for the backwash duration of 10 s was observed the obvious increase in hydraulically irreversible fouling with the decreasing of backwash duration was reflected by the hifis in fig 5b specifically when backwash duration decreased from 120 to 10 s the hifis increased from 0 34 to 5 03 m 1 for ha solutions and the values varied from 0 47 to 10 20 m 1 for sa solutions these results indicated that an insufficient backwash duration might deteriorate the backwash performance because a short backwash duration only expanded the foulant layer which was subsequently recompressed back to the membrane surface when filtration resumed 46 according to the results reported by akhondi et al 47 the minimum backwash duration was the time when the pressure on the permeate side of the membrane at the end of a backwash cycle reached the atmospheric pressure maintained on the feed side in this study a backwash duration of no less than 45 s was necessary to achieve efficient backwashing for both organic solutions regarding the role of backwash interval as presented in fig 5c high hces were observed for ha and sa solutions when backwash intervals ranged from 15 to 60 min there was no significant difference in hces for these backwash intervals the average values were 97 8 and 97 7 for ha and sa solutions respectively considering the irreversible fouling fig 5d low hifis were found for backwash intervals of 30 and 60 min regardless of feeding with ha or sa solutions furthermore even a less hifi was obtained when the backwash interval shortened to 15 min although most fouling could be relieved by nacl solution backwashing the operation with a long backwash interval increased the instability of uf systems in the long term operation for example when sa solutions were filtrated the final tmp of the uf membrane with a backwash every 60 min reached approximately 70 kpa data not shown as a long backwash interval may compact the fouling layer and increase the difficulty of foulant removal during backwashing 44 48 this transition of the fouling layer from reversible to irreversible causes a decrease in backwash efficiency and the increase of energy demand on the other hand backwashing with an overly high frequency uses more permeate for cleaning than what is required 49 which decreases the net productivity and increases the energy consumption compared with fixed frequency backwash using ro concentrate self adaptive frequency backwash extended the projected uf operation from approximately 16 to 143 days 23 3 2 3 effects of multiple backwash parameters as the backwash performance of uf membranes is affected by more than a single parameter it is necessary to carry out uf tests at the same backwash water productivity with the results illustrated in fig 6 as presented in fig 6a there was no significant between hces at different backwash conditions investigated when nacl solution was used as backwash water p 0 05 and the average hces were 97 2 and 97 4 for ha solutions and sa solutions respectively with the increase in backwash interval the increased hifis were observed though they were quite small as presented in fig 6b published literature 50 also demonstrated that a longer backwash interval with a longer duration tfl tbw 15 0 5 30 1 60 2 120 4 240 8 resulted in a rapid fouling rate though membrane fouling for different backwash intervals were similar resosudarmo et al 11 indicated that though the variation in backwash condition led to minor differences in irreversible fouling hces decreased when backwash interval increased from 60 to 240 min tfl tbw 60 1 120 2 240 4 a constant volume of backwash water was maintained by varying backwash flux and duration when a fixed backwash interval was used tfl 30 min fig 6c and d or by varying backwash flux and interval for a fixed backwash duration tbw 2 min fig 6e and f as presented in fig 6c high hces were observed when backwash fluxes ranged from 90 to 360 lmh and there was no significant difference in hces for these backwash conditions p 0 05 with the average of 96 9 and 97 7 for ha and sa solutions respectively regarding the hydraulically irreversible fouling fig 6d low hifis were obtained and they were hardly influenced by backwash fluxes and durations with the average of 0 35 and 0 46 m 1 for ha and sa solutions respectively similar results could be found when a fixed backwash duration was used the average hces were 97 7 and 97 7 for ha and sa solutions respectively fig 6e the results indicated that the hces of organic fouled uf membranes were hardly influenced by multiple backwash parameters during nacl backwashing when the backwash volume was maintained to be constant previous literature also demonstrated that using the same backwash volume when backwash fluxes were 36 5 54 75 109 5 164 25 and 219 lmh backwash intervals were 90 60 30 20 and 15 s correspondingly the hces were 88 5 94 9 93 1 88 3 and 91 2 respectively 44 3 3 comparison of uf backwashing with nacl solution and uf permeate the hces and hifis for organic fouled uf membranes backwashed by uf permeate were summarized in tables s2 s3 supporting information different to the low hces for uf permeate backwashing higher hces were obtained for nacl solution backwashing with an increase of 35 68 42 48 and 41 47 50 82 for ha and sa solutions respectively table s2 regarding the hifis when ha solutions were filtrated the values using nacl solutions were just 4 14 of that using uf permeate backwashing and the values were approximate 4 25 for sa solutions table s3 during the uf of ha or sa solutions ca2 bind preferentially to the carboxylic functional groups resulting in cross linked structure 37 during backwashing with nacl solution besides the backward hydrodynamic force the ion exchange between na and bound ca2 in fouling layer broke down the cross linked ha ca or sa ca complex allowing the deposited foulants easily to be detached from membrane surface 7 26 for better comparisons between nacl solution backwashing and uf permeate backwashing membrane charges surface tensions Î³tot and sem images of membrane surfaces were investigated the normalized spcs and surface tensions of fouled membrane and cleaned membranes in a typical uf test i e bold parameters in table 1 were summarized in table s4 supporting information when ha solutions were filtrated the trans membrane spc decreased to 39 01 0 62 mv bar after filtration without backwashing from 51 19 mv bar of a new membrane indicating that the fouled membrane showed the characteristics of foulants uf permeate backwashing just partly restored membrane charge with spc spc0 of 82 6 while the membrane charge was almost recovered by nacl solution backwashing 93 9 the reduction in the net negative charge of the uf membrane after being fouled by nom has been also reported 13 26 similarly nacl backwashing restored the charge of sa fouled uf membrane by 32 7 from 56 9 to 89 6 compared with a small recovery using uf permeate backwashing by 9 5 table s4 supporting information in addition the highest Î³tot was observed for organic fouled membranes without backwash compared with the new membrane of 41 22 0 80 mj m2 while uf permeate backwashing just slightly decreased the surface tensions an obvious decrease in Î³tot was observed for nacl solution backwashing the low Î³tot corresponded to a small hifi because there was a positive relation between hifis and Î³tot 27 fig 7 shows the sem images of fouled membrane surfaces before and after backwashing using nacl solution and uf permeate as presented in fig 7a and b a thick cake layer or gel layer was formed on the membrane surface during filtration of ha or sa respectively these observations were agree to the results reported by katsoufidou et al 28 29 when the ha solution was filtrated the surfaces of uf membranes cleaned by nacl solution was rather clean in comparison a large amount of cake foulants was still deposited on the membranes after backwashing with uf permeate fig 7e similar to the fouled membrane without backwashing as for sa solutions nacl solution backwashing resulted in a clean membrane surface bur uf

in another study ghadiri et al 21 carried out a numerical simulation for co2 stripping from a solution using nano porous membrane contactors although application of nanofiber membranes for the wastewater and air treatment have attracted many attentions in the experimental and numerical works of some researchers separation of chloroform as a dangerous and carcinogen contaminant from wastewater by these kinds of membrane contactors has not yet been numerically investigated this paper provides a numerical investigation for chloroform removal from wastewater by membrane gas stripping method using electro spun poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf nanofiber membrane 2 model development in this work a mathematical model for gas stripping membrane process was developed and applied to a membrane contactor to analyze the performance of a nanofiber membrane modelling of the chloroform transport through the membrane contactor was done in a way that the contactor was divided into three sections i e liquid side membrane and gas side a schematic figure of the membrane cell is illustrated in fig 1 as can be seen in this figure chloroform solution and nitrogen gas were fed into the liquid and gas side of the membrane cell respectively voc contaminants flow in radial direction from the liquid side of the membrane contactor to pass the nanofiber membrane and reach the gas chamber where fast flow of nitrogen gas stripped out chloroforms from the stream the model consists of a set of differential equations for estimating state variables in an infinite small fluid particles and also some algebraic equations for determination of gas liquid and gas gas mass transfer coefficients governing differential equations were converted to a large set of linear algebraic equations and were solved by the finite element method as the numerical technique using unstructured tetrahedral grids in comsol multiphysics software transport equations were solved in two segregated steps unsteady state gas and liquid flow equations with the iterative method of generalized minimal residual attached by the geometric multi grid pre conditioner and unsteady component transport equations by multi frontal massively parallel sparse direct solver the maximum time step was 1 10 2 second and the convergence criterion for maximum residuals between two iterations was also set to 1 10 4 density and viscosity of liquid and gas phases at process conditions are illustrated in table 1 the solubility data henry s constant and other unknown parameters of species were obtained from the information available in the literature 25 the following assumptions were also considered to simplify development of the mathematical model 1 isothermally operation of the whole system 2 non wetted

diffusivity coefficients 6 newtonian fluids 2 1 equations of change the 3d unsteady state forms of mass balance equations for all three sections of the nanofiber membrane contactor along with the momentum balance equations for the liquid and gas sides of the contactor were solved 2 1 1 equations of liquid side the mass conservation equation of chloroform in the liquid side of the membrane contactor can be expressed as the following 26 1 c i t c i v j i where c j v t and i are concentration diffusive flux velocity time and chloroform component respectively in the above equation diffusive fluxes were calculated by the fick s law of diffusion the velocity field v was obtained by solving the navier stokes equations expressed as follows 2 t v v v Î¼ Î´ v 1 Ï p 0 where Î¼ refers to the dynamic viscosity v is the velocity vector Ï is the density of the fluid and p is the pressure the following boundary conditions were assumed for this zone at the walls there is no flux at the inlet section the liquid concentration is equal to the tank concentration at the outlet section there is no diffusion transport it should be noted that the reservoir tank containing chloroform solution was modeled as a continuous stirred tank on the other hand the average chloroform concentration for outlet stream of the liquid chamber was considered as the inlet liquid feed concentration 2 1 2 equations of membrane transport of chloroforms through membrane pores were assumed to have only diffusion mechanism and the term of convection was considered to be neglected therefore continuity equation for the membrane side is as follows 26 3 c i t d i m e m b 2 c i where d i memb denotes diffusive coefficient of component i through the membrane and is calculated from the following equation 26 4 d i m e m b d i g a s Îµ Ï where d i gas is the diffusion of chloroform in the gas side and is constant Îµ is porosity of the nanofiber membrane and is equal to 0 76 according to the information mentioned in the experimental work of feng et al 13 tortuosity Ï was also assumed to be equal to the inverse of nanofiber membrane porosity based on the work done by matyka et al 27 at the lower surface of the nanofiber membrane section chloroform concentration was assumed to be equal to the solubility of chloroform in water at the specified temperature and pressure at the upper surface of the membrane side concentration of chloroform in water was also equal to that of the gas phase 2 1 3 equations of gas side the 3d unsteady state equation of mass transfer in the gas phase was the same as that of the liquid phase and was coupled with momentum equations as described in the liquid side section assumed boundary conditions for equations of the gas side at the walls there are no flux no slip condition at the inlet section chloroform concentration is zero at the outlet section there is no diffusivity 3 results and discussion 3 1 model verification and validation to verify consistency with the proposed mathematical model numerical errors and solving the right model we checked to insert the right boundary and initial conditions and satisfy the physical principles of conservation laws additionally linearization and discretization errors were checked to be in acceptant ranges for validation of the proposed model simulation results of chloroform concentration in the feed tank at the temperature of 60 c gas inlet and liquid inlet velocities are 25 and 1 2 m s respectively versus time were depicted and compared with experimental data reported by feng et al in the literature 13 the experimental data were related to the removal of chloroform from wastewater by membrane gas stripping using electro spun poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf nanofiber membrane compared results of the model and experiments are shown in fig 2 as can be seen in this figure a good agreement between the simulation and experimental data was observed with an average deviation of about 11 percent it should be noted that the model tends to slightly underestimate the chloroform concentration of experimental work after about 1 h since system works in recirculating mode concentration of chloroform in the tank was steadily declined by passing the time after 5 h this concentration value reached to one third of its initial one based on the aforementioned arguments it could be concluded that the mathematical model and simulation approach used in this work was precise enough to model the chloroform removal from wastewater using the nanofiber membrane contactor according to the simulation results chloroform was removed from wastewater by passing the time and after 5 h about 67 of the initial chloroform concentration was removed at the temperature of 60 c and liquid inlet velocity of 1 2 m s in the following sections concentration and velocity profiles of the studied nanofiber membrane cell are mentioned and described gas inlet velocity 25 m s liquid inlet velocity 1 2 m s inlet temperature 60 c and operating time 5 h 3 2 concentration distribution as the chloroform solution was fed to the membrane cell chloroform contaminants flows from the liquid side of the cell toward the membrane because of the high concentration gradients near the membrane chloroforms will be then removed from wastewater by the fast flow of stripping gas in the gas section outlet flow of the liquid side will be returned to the reservoir tank to recycle the chloroform solution and feed again to the liquid side to continue the process of wastewater purification in our system in the numerical analysis we modelled this system to operate at specified conditions for 5 h after solving our model equations concentration distribution of chloroform in each part of the membrane cell was determined fig 3 shows that the rich chloroform solution flows from the inlet part of the liquid chamber z 0 where the chloroform concentration is at its the highest rate c 6 mol m3 to reach the outlet section of the liquid chamber z l a uniform distribution of chloroform concentration throughout the liquid chamber can be observed in this figure c 5 5 to 6 mol m3 however at the upper part of the liquid side and adjacent to the membrane a large concentration gradient of chloroform contaminants can be detected where the chloroform contaminants are going to permeate through the nanofiber membrane chloroform concentration reaches around 2 mol m3 in this region the concentration field of chloroforms at the nanofiber membrane section of the contactor is illustrated in fig 4 chloroform concentration values at the bottom of the membrane section is around 0 02 mol m3 because of the constant feed of chloroform particles at the lower section of the membrane and these values are reduced in the radial direction of the membrane to reach its lowest values around 0 016 mol m3 at the top section of the membrane fig 5 depicts chloroform concentration at the gas section of the nanofiber membrane contactor as it can be seen in this figure all the chloroform contaminats are accumulated at the lower part of the gas chamber below the inlet and outlet nozzles where c 0 012 to 0 018 mol m3 chloroform concentration at the upper part of the gas chamber around 0 005 0 01 mol m3 is much less than that of its lower part because the high flow rate of nitrogen gas will not allow most of chloroform contaminants to reach the upper side of the gas section 3 3 velocity field velocity field at the liquid side of the membrane cell is shown in fig 6 this velocity field was obtained after 5 h of circulating the chloroform solution in the whole system and at the temperature of 60 c velocity magnitude varies from 1 2 m s at the inlet section of the liquid chamber to 0 m s near the wall and at the upper section the cell the figure reveals that the velocity magnitude at the lower part of the liquid phase is more than two times greater than that of the upper part it seems that a short path line of chloroform contaminant flows from the inlet to the outlet zone of the liquid side at the middle zone of the liquid side of the chamber velocity magnitude is very low almost the same as corners of the chamber at the upper zone of the liquid side chamber velocity gradient is negligible attributing to the chloroform diffusion through the nanofiber membrane velocity field of nitrogen gas flowing in the gas side of the membrane cell after 5 h is also illustrated in fig 7 as can be seen in this figure velocity profile is fully developed and underdeveloped at the inlet and outlet nozzle of the gas side respectively maximum velocity magnitude for the nitrogen gas was 27 m s for the inlet section of the gas chamber while the minimum nitrogen velocity magnitude was around zero near the walls and each corners of the gas chamber average velocity magnitude of nitrogen gas at the outlet nozzle of the gas chamber was found to be around 17 m s 3 4 effective parameters high gas pressure drop on the gas side of the contactor is one of the primary impediments of the process of membrane gas stripping for wastewater treatment however change in the gas velocity do not have effect on the rate of treatment because factors other than the gas flow rate are determinative in this regards some of these factors like liquid feed flow liquid temperature kind and porosity of the nanofiber membrane are important and are needed to be further investigated in this kind of water treatment system effects of inlet feed flow and temperature on the rate of chloroform removal from wastewater with membrane gas stripping method were taken into consideration and were discussed here fig 8 shows that decrease of liquid inlet temperature from 60 c to 40 and 25 c will significantly reduce the treatment efficiency since removal rate of chloroform from the wastewater for the case of liquid inlet temperature equal to 25 c is half than that for the inlet temperature of 60 c on the other hand the more the temperature of liquid inlet section of membrane gas stripping system the more efficiency of our system for the wastewater treatment liquid velocity inlet is also a parameter which was taken into consideration to investigate its effect on the removal rate of chloroform from wastewater through the studied membrane contactor temperature of 60 c was constant and inlet velocity magnitude was also considered to be varied from 0 5 to 2 m s as it is obvious in fig 9 raising of the inlet liquid velocity leaded to the improvement in efficiency of the system slope of the diagram for about the first four hours of the operating time for the case in which inlet velocity was 0 5 m s was slightly lower than that for the one with inlet velocity of 2 m s in addition concentration diagrams for the three different inlet velocity magnitudes reached each other after 5 h on the other hand liquid inlet velocity had no or little effect on efficiency of the membrane contactor by passing the time after 5 h in other words this parameter can be neglected for the situation in which the whole system is operated in steady condition 4 conclusion a comprehensive 3d transport model at unsteady condition for chloroform removal from wastewater by a nanofiber membrane contactor was obtained numerically to simulate the system governing conservation equations were solved for chloroform specie in all sections of the nanofiber membrane contactor by finite element method verification and validation of the membrane contactor were done by comparing simulation results with experimental data available in the literature and a good agreement was observed with the average deviations around 11 chloroform concentration at feed section of the tank declined by passing the time since 67 of the chloroform contaminants were removed from wastewater after 5 h furthermore simulation outputs i e concentration and velocity profiles for each section of the membrane contactor were reported and analyzed parameters of inlet liquid velocity magnitude and temperature were selected to investigate their effects on the process of wastewater treatment using the nanofiber membrane reduction in the liquid inlet temperature leaded to the efficiency decrease of studied membrane contactor however the effect of inlet liquid temperature found to have not considerable impact on efficiency of the membrane contactor since after 5 h its affection was negligible funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

treatment efficiency since removal rate of chloroform from the wastewater for the case of liquid inlet temperature equal to 25 c is half than that for the inlet temperature of 60 c on the other hand the more the temperature of liquid inlet section of membrane gas stripping system the more efficiency of our system for the wastewater treatment liquid velocity inlet is also a parameter which was taken into consideration to investigate its effect on the removal rate of chloroform from wastewater through the studied membrane contactor temperature of 60 c was constant and inlet velocity magnitude was also considered to be varied from 0 5 to 2 m s as it is obvious in fig 9 raising of the inlet liquid velocity leaded to the improvement in efficiency of the system slope of the diagram for about the first four hours of the operating time for the case in which inlet velocity was 0 5 m s was slightly lower than that for the one with inlet velocity of 2 m s in addition concentration diagrams for the three different inlet velocity magnitudes reached each other after 5 h on the other hand liquid inlet velocity had no or little effect on efficiency of the membrane contactor by passing the time after 5 h in other words this parameter can be neglected for the situation in which the whole system is operated in steady condition 4 conclusion a comprehensive 3d transport model at unsteady condition for chloroform removal from wastewater by a nanofiber membrane contactor was obtained numerically to simulate the system governing conservation equations were solved for chloroform specie in all sections of the nanofiber membrane contactor by finite element method verification and validation of the membrane contactor were done by comparing simulation results with experimental data available in the literature and a good agreement was observed with the average deviations around 11 chloroform concentration at feed section of the tank declined by passing the time since 67 of the chloroform contaminants were removed from wastewater after 5 h furthermore simulation outputs i e concentration and velocity profiles for each section of the membrane contactor were reported and analyzed parameters of inlet liquid velocity magnitude and temperature were selected to investigate their effects on the process of wastewater treatment using the nanofiber membrane reduction in the liquid inlet temperature leaded to the efficiency decrease of studied membrane contactor however the effect of inlet liquid temperature found to have not considerable impact on efficiency of the membrane contactor since after 5 h its affection was negligible funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors
