and production technologies have led companies to explore new reservoirs in ever deeper waters this extreme scenario presents major challenges in terms of operations security and economic factors following the recent worldwide discoveries of offshore reservoirs at water depths exceeding 2000 m such as those in brazil the gulf of mexico north sea and west africa a need for new technologies has emerged the development of more efficient risers which are the primary components responsible for the transportation of oil from the reservoir to the floating unit poses one of the greatest challenges faced by industry one of the main problems that affects the structural behavior of these components is the presence of large amplitude compressive waves acting on them which are generated by the floating unit movement the propagation of these compressive waves combined with harsh environmental conditions can cause among other problems fatigue and buckling particularly in the region where the riser touches the seabed also known as the touchdown point or tdp and unwanted vibrations i e vortex induced vibrations vivs which can reduce the riser lifespan and increase significantly the operational cost the simplest and most used riser configuration is the free hanging catenary in which the riser is connected to the floating unit and freely laid to the seabed in a catenary shape in ultra deep oil fields the length of the suspended catenary becomes too large increasing its weight and consequently inducing large vessel payloads which makes the configuration unfeasible in many cases previous studies jacob et al 1999 have shown that configurations presenting buoyancy elements such as lazy wave steep wave lazy s and steep s elicit better structural behaviors than the free hanging catenary examples of risers configurations are illustrated in fig 1 however real life applications of these new configurations are very challenging as these often demand an extended installation time and a higher economical cost in addition to complex logistics the concept of using hydrodynamic dampers hd aguiar et al 2010 was introduced in order to solve both economic and technical requirements as these are capable of reducing operational time the catenary riser with hydrodynamic dampers crhd essentially adopts the same configuration as the free hanging catenary riser the hd consists of a low density coating material applied to different segments of the riser the main function of the hd is to reduce the propagation of compressive waves along the risers and to avoid buckling in the critical region close to the tdp inducing its occurrence in a more suitable region and in a controlled manner brito et al 2017 furthermore the reduction of compressive waves mitigates the effects caused by vivs generated by ocean currents thus the lifespan of the risers in terms of fatigue can be increased the final configuration of the crhd i e the number of dampers their lengths and spacing between them depends on several factors intensity of the environmental conditions waves winds and currents water depth in the considered region properties of the riser material and costs associated with the pipes dampers and installation process fig 2 illustrates a catenary riser with several hds essentially the two governing principles in engineering projects are technical feasibility and economic viability i e the design of structural systems should safely comply with operational criteria and simultaneously meet the economic requirements traditionally the design process is based on human intuition and trial and error following this methodology the required time and the quality of the chosen configuration are highly dependent on the designer s knowledge and experience alternatively structural optimization techniques have been used in a large variety of fields to spawn new and improved designs in a fraction of the time previous studies have investigated the application of optimization techniques to riser design problems efforts that began with the length minimization of a steep wave riser proposed by riggs and leraand 1991 most of these studies adopted evolutionary algorithms ea especially genetic algorithms ga as the optimization method for this task mainly because these algorithms are easy to use and have been successfully implemented in commercial software some examples are the application of ga to the minimization of the cost of risers in different configurations such as a lazy s based hybrid rodrigues 2004 lazy wave vieira et al 2003 tanaka and martins 2006 andrade et al 2010 and the free hanging catenary configuration cunliffe et al 2004 other types of ea have been adopted such as artificial immune systems ais vieira et al 2008 particle swarm optimization pso pina et al 2011 and simulated annealing sa tanaka and martins 2011 although popular ea usually have high computational cost since they require many analyses which is an undesirable feature in engineering design framework recently some authors have proposed the use of surrogate models that approximate the dynamic response of the risers instead of performing a complete dynamic finite element analysis chen et al 2016 these surrogate models are less time consuming than the finite element analysis providing a significant speed up of the optimization procedure yang and zheng 2011 performed the optimization of a catenary riser using the kriging metamodel chen et al 2016 used kriging and radial basis function rbf to optimize a steep wave riser and monteiro et al 2018 applies artificial neural networks ann and multivariate adaptive regression splines mars to estimate the dynamic responses of a lazy wave riser striving for a more efficient approach we adopt a local global algorithm based on the traditional nelder mead method nelder and mead 1965 although never applied to offshore engineering problems before the globalized bounded nelder mead method gbnm luersen and le riche 2004 has already been efficiently used to the structural optimization of a composite bracket ghiasi et al 2008 design of road noise barriers baulac et al 2007 design of a rotor bearing system ritto et al 2011 and tuning of controller parameters butt et al 2017 the present study discusses the applications difficulties and solutions of optimization techniques in the design of catenary risers with hds the effects from compressive waves and the costs involved to achieve practical and cost efficient designs in a considerably shorter computational time are also considered the study of this type of configuration is fairly recent the configuration has not been installed and used in the field yet however recent studies indicate its structural and economic viability aguiar et al 2010 therefore the main objective of this work is to use optimization techniques to attain optimal configurations of the crhd that satisfy technical and economic criteria 2 optimization the optimization of engineering projects usually demands complex simulations with high computational costs and the solutions must comply with the technical and operational requirements in order to make it feasible it is thus desirable that the optimization method does not require a high number of objective function evaluations and also satisfies all the imposed constraints simultaneously in this work the globalized bounded nelder mead method a generalization of the nelder mead method is used for the optimization 2 1 nelder mead method the nelder mead method nelder and mead 1965 is a zero order method this means that it does not require gradient information in order to find the solution to the optimization problem making it capable of handling nonsmooth problems the method is based on a simplex a geometrical object with n 1 vertices where n is the dimension of the design space x 1 x 2 x n 1 r n and the respective objective function values which are ordered with respect to the function values from the lowest f 1 to the highest f n 1 the goal is to substitute the worst vertex x n 1 for another with a better value by using four simple geometric operations namely reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage the reflection operation fig 3a generates a new point x r along the line formed by x n 1 and the centroid of the remaining vertices x 1 x 1 n i 1 n x i 2 x r x α x x n 1 by the end of the operation if the value of the function at the new point f r f x r satisfies the condition f 1 f r f n x n 1 is replaced by x r if f r f 1 the function value may still decrease on the same direction so the expansion operation fig 3b is applied 3 x e x β x r x if f e f r x n 1 is replaced by x e otherwise x r is accepted the reflection operation may also lead to a point where the function value is lower than x n 1 but higher than x n in that case a contraction operation fig 3c shall be performed 4 x c x γ x n 1 x if none of those operations are able to identify a better point a shrinkage operation fig 3d is performed towards the best vertex x 1 5 x i x 1 δ x i x 1 for i 2 n 1 the procedure is repeated until the solution converges thus resulting in the optimized solution the flowchart depicted in fig 4 presents the main steps of the nelder mead method the coefficients α β γ and δ are respectively the reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage coefficients this method is extremely efficient for problems involving objective and or constraint functions with high computational cost as it only computes one or two test points per iteration however as a classical local search method the nelder mead algorithm converges to the first local minimum found 2 2 globalized bounded nelder mead the globalized bounded nelder mead method gbnm proposed by luersen and le riche 2004 is a modification of the original method in which a good estimation of the global minimum is obtained instead of obtaining only the first local minimum found a local search is performed using the original method whereby after the identification of the local minimum the global algorithm restarts the search procedure choosing the next starting point based on an adaptive probability density storing in memory past local searches hence unnecessary evaluations on already explored regions are avoided the probability p x of having sampled a point x is described by a gaussian parzen windows approach duda et al 2012 luersen and le riche 2004 6 p x 1 n i 1 n p i x where n is the number of points already sampled and p i is the multi dimensional probability density function defined by 7 p i x 1 2 π n 2 det σ 1 2 exp 1 2 x x i t σ 1 x x i where n is the problem dimension and σ the covariance matrix the variances σ j 2 are estimated by the relation 8 σ j 2 α x j max x j min 2 where x j max and x j min are the bounds in the j th direction and α is a positive parameter that controls the length of the gaussians the starting point of a new search is the one that minimizes eq 6 after having sampled n r randomly generated sample points the gbnm also proposes an improvement that implements a strategy for bounding variables by projections and a set of convergence tests with restart options these tests improve the convergence of the algorithm by reinitializing degenerated simplexes and checking optimality 2 3 considering arbitrary constraints penalization techniques are an effective way of handling general constraints while maintaining much of the framework developed for unconstrained optimization the basic idea is to introduce the constraints in the objective function in some form of penalization eq 10 displays the penalized form of the constrained problem 9 the objective function of problem 10 ϕ x is the sum of the original objective function f x plus the penalized constraint function p h x theoretically p h x would be equal to infinity whenever the constraint h x is violated in this way the solution of the penalized problem would be the same as the solution of the constrained problem however this makes the problem ill conditioned several proposed penalization functions exist in the literature and each has its own strengths and weaknesses in this study the augmented lagrangian method is used because of its strong mathematical background and its well established efficiency this approach proved to be effective for the set of problems addressed in this research 9 min x f x s t h j x 0 for j 1 n h 10 min x ϕ x f x j 1 n h p h x the augmented lagrangian method is a numerically efficient algorithm to handle constraints and has successfully been used in the field of structural optimization for the solution of stress constrained problems senhora 2017 consider again the general optimization problem with equality constraints 9 the augmented lagrangian method approximates the original problem by a sequence of k problems described by eq 11 11 min x λ μ l k x λ μ f x j 1 n h λ j k h j x μ k 2 j 1 n h h j 2 x where λ j k are the estimates of the lagrange multipliers and μ k is a penalty parameter for the k th problem each problem is then solved using an unconstrained optimization technique the kkt optimality conditions for problem 11 state that 12 l x λ μ 0 f x k j 1 n h λ j k μ k h j x k h j x k 0 for problem 10 if x is a solution of the problem the optimality condition is 13 l x λ 0 f x j 1 n h λ j h j x 0 comparing the kkt conditions for problems 10 and 11 it can be deduced that 14 λ j λ j k μ k h j x k from eq 14 the lagrange multipliers can be updated using the following expression after the step k 15 λ j k 1 λ j k μ k h j x k for j 1 n h the penalty parameter μ is updated as follows bertsekas 1999 16 μ k 1 β μ k where β 1 is a numerically adjusted parameter the sequence of solutions for the k problems described in 11 converges to a solution to the original problem 9 for the optimization problem with inequality constraints 17 min x f x s t g j x 0 for j 1 n g the augmented lagrangian method formulation has to be modified by the introduction of slack variables and the inequality constraints are rewritten as 18 h j x g j x s j s j 0 for j 1 n g substituting the above into eq 11 and fixing x the minimization of l with respect to s can be performed based on the following solution 19 s j max 0 λ j k μ k g j x hence the augmented lagrangian for the optimization problem with inequality constraints is 20 l x λ μ f x j 1 n g λ j k max g j x λ j k μ k μ k 2 max g j x λ j k μ k 2 for a more detailed explanation on the augmented lagrangian method please refer to wright and nocedal 1999 and bertsekas 1999 3 problem formulation the riser model used in this work consists of 11 segments with its bottom end connected to the wellhead and the top end connected to the floating unit as illustrated in fig 2 the equilibrium configuration of the riser is defined by the length of each riser segment and by the parameters related to the installation area properties such as the water depth environmental conditions and subsea layout the height h and the horizontal projection p of the catenary are considered fixed as they respectively represent the water depth and the projected distance from the floating unit to the wellhead the top angle α measured from the riser axis at the top and the vertical can be determined by the catenary equation fixing the horizontal projection and the total length of the riser each set of lengths of the 11 segments determines a different configuration thus the length of each segment is a design variable in the optimization process the pipe material and inner and outer diameters are considered fixed and already determined during the preliminary design stages therefore they are not considered as variables the field environmental conditions are taken into consideration as waves and currents the waves are particularly important when running dynamic analyses as they are the main cause of motion of the floating unit which is transferred to the top end of the riser 3 1 objective function the primary goal of this study is to determine whether it is feasible to install crhds in ultra deep water at depths exceeding 1500 m or not a feasible riser configuration must comply with all the required technical criteria and standards and also present a reasonable cost evaluating the cost of a riser configuration is not simple as many factors impact the final cost such as the pipe material type and installation methods however the amount of material needed for each configuration is able to provide a good cost estimate hence the goal is to seek configurations that minimize the length of each segment the objective function can be defined by 21 f o b j l t i 1 11 l i where l i represents each riser segment of the model as shown in fig 2 and l t is the total riser length minimizing this objective function clearly leads to configurations that tend to violate the technical criteria because decreasing the segments lengths especially the ones with dampers generally increases the stresses in the design therefore constraints must be carefully implemented in order to comply with the conflicting goals 3 2 operational constraints in the present study the constraints are based on operational and structural criteria to comply with operational constraints the minimum vertical clearance c m i n is defined from the seabed to the deepest damper section fig 2 this constraint is important to prevent any riser section equipped with dampers from touching the seabed furthermore in this sense the total length of the riser should not exceed the sum of the water depth and the horizontal projection to avoid slack pipeline at the tdp the top angle should not have a large value to avoid increased suspended lengths which could limit the presence of other supporting vessels and induce larger stresses as a structural constraint the offshore standard dnv os f201 2001 defines the combined loading criterion clc for pipe members subjected to bending moments and to effective tensions as follows 22 γ s c γ m m d m k 1 p i p o p b 2 t e t k 2 p i p o p b 2 1 if p i p o γ s c γ m 2 m d m k t e t k 2 2 p o p m

pressure p o external pressure p b burst pressure for p i p o p c collapse pressure for p i p o p m i n minimum internal pressure 3 3 implementation details two software programs were used in the development of the present study one for the dynamic structural analysis of the riser which determines the displacements forces and stresses as a function of time and another for the optimization process for the dynamic analysis the orcaflex software orcina ltd 2019 was used which is the industry standard software package for nonlinear static and dynamic analyses of offshore marine systems in the time and frequency domains for the optimization process a script with the gbnm algorithm was developed in matlab which is compatible to the orcaflex application programming interface api and allows us to send commands from matlab to orcaflex programmatically 4 practical case study 4 1 description of the model in this work a rigid steel catenary riser installed at a water depth of 2150 m and connected to a floating fpso type unit was considered the horizontal projection i e the horizontal distance from the fpso and the wellhead is 2861 m while the physical and geometric properties of the pipes used in the riser are summarized in table 1 regarding the boundary conditions the base of the riser anchor is considered fixed to the seabed and the top is connected to the fpso i e the movements of the floating unit are transferred to the top of the riser the load case used in this study is the one that produces the worst results regarding the distribution of stresses along the riser under all the combinations of environmental conditions waves and currents and it is analyzed in an extreme load assessment the simulation time is equivalent to two wave periods with a ramp of a single wave that spanned three wave periods 37 23 s table 2 presents the fpso motion imposed to the riser top end the riser is divided in 11 steel pipe segments five of them have low density coatings appropriate for the hds previous studies regarding the ideal number of segments for hds suggested that five was the optimal number brito et al 2017 the input variables of the optimization problem of the crhd configuration are the lengths of the five sections with dampers l2 l4 l6 l8 and l10 the lengths of the section spacings between the dampers l3 l5 l7 and l9 and the lengths of the top and bottom sections of the riser l1 and l11 the operational constraint values are presented in table 3 and the variation ranges of each of the previously described variables are listed in table 4 4 2 optimization procedure the optimization analysis focuses on the single objective problem that minimizes the total length of the riser and satisfies all the imposed constraints the gbnm is implemented using the standard values of the simplex operational parameters 23 α 1 β 0 5 γ 2 δ 0 5 the convergence and restart tests proposed in luersen and le riche 2004 are also adopted in this study for a small simplex the length of its side is set to 5 of the smallest dimensional range while this value is set to 15 in the case of a large simplex the computational cost is set 25 restarts and a maximum of 120 iterations per restart 5 numerical results 5 1 case studies in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the crhd we propose three different case studies case 1 consists of a steel catenary riser scr subjected to the minimization of its total length case 2 is the proposed optimization scheme crhd where the goal is to minimize the total length of the riser using the hydrodynamic dampers and case 3 is the previous optimal configuration without the hydrodynamic dampers the first case is the industry standard configuration for riser and it serves as a basis for comparison with the last two the second case demonstrates the effectiveness of our results and the third case highlights the efficiency of the hydrodynamic dampers we noticed that the structural constraint is the most difficult to be satisfied as most of the tested configurations presented violations clc 1 the ultra deep water field and the increased amplitude of the heave motion for the riser top end lead to the increased stresses developed in the structure owing to this extreme scenario no feasible solutions were found for case 1 as no solutions presented a maximum clc value that was lower than 2 72 fig 5 a stress peak appears at the tdp region based on the analysis of the equivalent stress of the structure von mises the maximum value of 778 mpa indicated that the material tensile strength is exceeded and that the pipe would thus collapse fig 6 for case 2 the solution is a riser with a length of 4125 6 m presented in table 5 configuration 1 fig 7 illustrates the static equilibrium configuration of the optimized riser and the hds positioning while fig 8 presents the clc values for the entire riser it can be observed that there are six peaks that correspond to the regions of the five dampers and the tdp if the dampers are removed thus turning the riser into a regular catenary riser the resulting structural behavior would be completely different see figs 9 and 10 thus leading to increased stresses at the tdp region that would exceed the material tensile strength as an advantage of the gbnm method it is possible to compare the other local minima and check if there is a more suitable solution the five best solutions regarding the efficiency criterion are compared table 5 and fig 11 the structural behavior is quite similar with six stress peaks and no constraint violations once again the removal of the dampers leads to unfeasible regular catenary risers owing to the extreme stresses developed in the tdp region the design variables are treated as continuous throughout the optimization process in this way it is not possible to obtain configurations that could automatically comply with the industry requirements as pipes are traditionally manufactured with lengths equal to 12 m hence the procedure recommended by haftka and gürdal 2012 of adjusting the values of the design variables to the nearest discrete counterpart is adopted as it is not expected to change the response of the structure substantially table 5 presents the adjusted design variables respective response and comparison with the original configurations the obtained total length is similar for all the configurations however the structural behavior despite the similarities present relevant differences as configuration 3 becomes unfeasible due to the excessive stresses developed the results suggest that the configurations 1 and 2 are the best ones as the adjusted design variables lead to shorter risers with an acceptable structural behavior a fatigue analysis which would be the upcoming task in a complete riser design procedure can provide relevant complementary information to the designers thus leading to the most suitable solution 5 2 algorithm comparison in order to obtain a better understanding of the efficiency of the gbnm optimization method it is important to compare it to other methods we compared our algorithm with the commercial algorithm called midaco mixed integer distributed ant colony optimization a numerical high performance solver for single and multi objective optimization midaco is based on the ant colony optimization and has multiple engineering applications such as structural optimization of continuous footing keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016 and optimal frame design for civil aircrafts picchi scardaoni and frediani 2019 more information on the algorithm can be found in schlueter et al 2013 the criteria chosen to compare both methods is the number of objective function evaluations as most of the computational cost of the optimization process is due to the simulations that are involved in the objective function evaluation table 6 shows the number of objective function evaluations and computational time taken by each method to verify the effectiveness of both algorithms we also compared the optimal solutions obtained with each method the final results are shown in table 7 the adjusted lengths are obtained considering that each pipe is 12 meters long tables 6 and 7 show that the results obtained with both algorithms were very close in practice the numerical difference represents only 2 pipes which is a small amount when compared to the total riser length although the gbnm algorithm required more function evaluations than the midaco the cpu times for both algorithms were similar this suggests that gbnm explored regions that lead to many unfeasible configurations which are fast evaluated also the number of gbnm restarts can be reduced eliminating unnecessary evaluations in addition gbnm has an advantage when compared to midaco regarding the number of results that can be obtained while midaco reports only the current best solution gbnm presents multiple local minimums allowing the designer to select the best solution to be used in practice 6 conclusions this study presented a methodology that can successfully obtain optimized riser configurations in a considerably short time and provides well suited solutions for problems with few feasible designs the ability to identify several different local solutions is considered an advantage as the designer could choose from a range of suitably optimized designs provided by the algorithm although capable of providing effective solutions the gbnm still has room for improvement specifically with respect to unnecessary function evaluations we noticed that the restart process based on the adaptive probability density scheme generates many unfeasible configurations as starting point leading to a high number of function evaluations a new probability density scheme for the restart process of the gbnm algorithm is currently under investigation by the authors the proposed riser configuration proved to be a good alternative for ultra deep water and harsh environments with a better structural behavior than the traditional free hanging catenary configuration as the hds reduced the maximum stresses in the catenary riser by at most 64 for future studies a comparison between the crhd and lazy wave configurations would be useful as the latter is typically the preferred alternative when the regular catenary configuration is unfeasible it would also be interesting to consider fatigue constraints as a more realistic failure criteria however it should be taken into account that fatigue analyses are very computationally expensive and the fatigue constraint implementation would require prohibitively high computational costs acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by tecgraf institute of

on the same direction so the expansion operation fig 3b is applied 3 x e x β x r x if f e f r x n 1 is replaced by x e otherwise x r is accepted the reflection operation may also lead to a point where the function value is lower than x n 1 but higher than x n in that case a contraction operation fig 3c shall be performed 4 x c x γ x n 1 x if none of those operations are able to identify a better point a shrinkage operation fig 3d is performed towards the best vertex x 1 5 x i x 1 δ x i x 1 for i 2 n 1 the procedure is repeated until the solution converges thus resulting in the optimized solution the flowchart depicted in fig 4 presents the main steps of the nelder mead method the coefficients α β γ and δ are respectively the reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage coefficients this method is extremely efficient for problems involving objective and or constraint functions with high computational cost as it only computes one or two test points per iteration however as a classical local search method the nelder mead algorithm converges to the first local minimum found 2 2 globalized bounded nelder mead the globalized bounded nelder mead method gbnm proposed by luersen and le riche 2004 is a modification of the original method in which a good estimation of the global minimum is obtained instead of obtaining only the first local minimum found a local search is performed using the original method whereby after the identification of the local minimum the global algorithm restarts the search procedure choosing the next starting point based on an adaptive probability density storing in memory past local searches hence unnecessary evaluations on already explored regions are avoided the probability p x of having sampled a point x is described by a gaussian parzen windows approach duda et al 2012 luersen and le riche 2004 6 p x 1 n i 1 n p i x where n is the number of points already sampled and p i is the multi dimensional probability density function defined by 7 p i x 1 2 π n 2 det σ 1 2 exp 1 2 x x i t σ 1 x x i where n is the problem dimension and σ the covariance matrix the variances σ j 2 are estimated by the relation 8 σ j 2 α x j max x j min 2 where x j max and x j min are the bounds in the j th direction and α is a positive parameter that controls the length of the gaussians the starting point of a new search is the one that minimizes eq 6 after having sampled n r randomly generated sample points the gbnm also proposes an improvement that implements a strategy for bounding variables by projections and a set of convergence tests with restart options these tests improve the convergence of the algorithm by reinitializing degenerated simplexes and checking optimality 2 3 considering arbitrary constraints penalization techniques are an effective way of handling general constraints while maintaining much of the framework developed for unconstrained optimization the basic idea is to introduce the constraints in the objective function in some form of penalization eq 10 displays the penalized form of the constrained problem 9 the objective function of problem 10 ϕ x is the sum of the original objective function f x plus the penalized constraint function p h x theoretically p h x would be equal to infinity whenever the constraint h x is violated in this way the solution of the penalized problem would be the same as the solution of the constrained problem however this makes the problem ill conditioned several proposed penalization functions exist in the literature and each has its own strengths and weaknesses in this study the augmented lagrangian method is used because of its strong mathematical background and its well established efficiency this approach proved to be effective for the set of problems addressed in this research 9 min x f x s t h j x 0 for j 1 n h 10 min x ϕ x f x j 1 n h p h x the augmented lagrangian method is a numerically efficient algorithm to handle constraints and has successfully been used in the field of structural optimization for the solution of stress constrained problems senhora 2017 consider again the general optimization problem with equality constraints 9 the augmented lagrangian method approximates the original problem by a sequence of k problems described by eq 11 11 min x λ μ l k x λ μ f x j 1 n h λ j k h j x μ k 2 j 1 n h h j 2 x where λ j k are the estimates of the lagrange multipliers and μ k is a penalty parameter for the k th problem each problem is then solved using an unconstrained optimization technique the kkt optimality conditions for problem 11 state that 12 l x λ μ 0 f x k j 1 n h λ j k μ k h j x k h j x k 0 for problem 10 if x is a solution of the problem the optimality condition is 13 l x λ 0 f x j 1 n h λ j h j x 0 comparing the kkt conditions for problems 10 and 11 it can be deduced that 14 λ j λ j k μ k h j x k from eq 14 the lagrange multipliers can be updated using the following expression after the step k 15 λ j k 1 λ j k μ k h j x k for j 1 n h the penalty parameter μ is updated as follows bertsekas 1999 16 μ k 1 β μ k where β 1 is a numerically adjusted parameter the sequence of solutions for the k problems described in 11 converges to a solution to the original problem 9 for the optimization problem with inequality constraints 17 min x f x s t g j x 0 for j 1 n g the augmented lagrangian method formulation has to be modified by the introduction of slack variables and the inequality constraints are rewritten as 18 h j x g j x s j s j 0 for j 1 n g substituting the above into eq 11 and fixing x the minimization of l with respect to s can be performed based on the following solution 19 s j max 0 λ j k μ k g j x hence the augmented lagrangian for the optimization problem with inequality constraints is 20 l x λ μ f x j 1 n g λ j k max g j x λ j k μ k μ k 2 max g j x λ j k μ k 2 for a more detailed explanation on the augmented lagrangian method please refer to wright and nocedal 1999 and bertsekas 1999 3 problem formulation the riser model used in this work consists of 11 segments with its bottom end connected to the wellhead and the top end connected to the floating unit as illustrated in fig 2 the equilibrium configuration of the riser is defined by the length of each riser segment and by the parameters related to the installation area properties such as the water depth environmental conditions and subsea layout the height h and the horizontal projection p of the catenary are considered fixed as they respectively represent the water depth and the projected distance from the floating unit to the wellhead the top angle α measured from the riser axis at the top and the vertical can be determined by the catenary equation fixing the horizontal projection and the total length of the riser each set of lengths of the 11 segments determines a different configuration thus the length of each segment is a design variable in the optimization process the pipe material and inner and outer diameters are considered fixed and already determined during the preliminary design stages therefore they are not considered as variables the field environmental conditions are taken into consideration as waves and currents the waves are particularly important when running dynamic analyses as they are the main cause of motion of the floating unit which is transferred to the top end of the riser 3 1 objective function the primary goal of this study is to determine whether it is feasible to install crhds in ultra deep water at depths exceeding 1500 m or not a feasible riser configuration must comply with all the required technical criteria and standards and also present a reasonable cost evaluating the cost of a riser configuration is not simple as many factors impact the final cost such as the pipe material type and installation methods however the amount of material needed for each configuration is able to provide a good cost estimate hence the goal is to seek configurations that minimize the length of each segment the objective function can be defined by 21 f o b j l t i 1 11 l i where l i represents each riser segment of the model as shown in fig 2 and l t is the total riser length minimizing this objective function clearly leads to configurations that tend to violate the technical criteria because decreasing the segments lengths especially the ones with dampers generally increases the stresses in the design therefore constraints must be carefully implemented in order to comply with the conflicting goals 3 2 operational constraints in the present study the constraints are based on operational and structural criteria to comply with operational constraints the minimum vertical clearance c m i n is defined from the seabed to the deepest damper section fig 2 this constraint is important to prevent any riser section equipped with dampers from touching the seabed furthermore in this sense the total length of the riser should not exceed the sum of the water depth and the horizontal projection to avoid slack pipeline at the tdp the top angle should not have a large value to avoid increased suspended lengths which could limit the presence of other supporting vessels and induce larger stresses as a structural constraint the offshore standard dnv os f201 2001 defines the combined loading criterion clc for pipe members subjected to bending moments and to effective tensions as follows 22 γ s c γ m m d m k 1 p i p o p b 2 t e t k 2 p i p o p b 2 1 if p i p o γ s c γ m 2 m d m k t e t k 2 2 p o p m

development of the present study one for the dynamic structural analysis of the riser which determines the displacements forces and stresses as a function of time and another for the optimization process for the dynamic analysis the orcaflex software orcina ltd 2019 was used which is the industry standard software package for nonlinear static and dynamic analyses of offshore marine systems in the time and frequency domains for the optimization process a script with the gbnm algorithm was developed in matlab which is compatible to the orcaflex application programming interface api and allows us to send commands from matlab to orcaflex programmatically 4 practical case study 4 1 description of the model in this work a rigid steel catenary riser installed at a water depth of 2150 m and connected to a floating fpso type unit was considered the horizontal projection i e the horizontal distance from the fpso and the wellhead is 2861 m while the physical and geometric properties of the pipes used in the riser are summarized in table 1 regarding the boundary conditions the base of the riser anchor is considered fixed to the seabed and the top is connected to the fpso i e the movements of the floating unit are transferred to the top of the riser the load case used in this study is the one that produces the worst results regarding the distribution of stresses along the riser under all the combinations of environmental conditions waves and currents and it is analyzed in an extreme load assessment the simulation time is equivalent to two wave periods with a ramp of a single wave that spanned three wave periods 37 23 s table 2 presents the fpso motion imposed to the riser top end the riser is divided in 11 steel pipe segments five of them have low density coatings appropriate for the hds previous studies regarding the ideal number of segments for hds suggested that five was the optimal number brito et al 2017 the input variables of the optimization problem of the crhd configuration are the lengths of the five sections with dampers l2 l4 l6 l8 and l10 the lengths of the section spacings between the dampers l3 l5 l7 and l9 and the lengths of the top and bottom sections of the riser l1 and l11 the operational constraint values are presented in table 3 and the variation ranges of each of the previously described variables are listed in table 4 4 2 optimization procedure the optimization analysis focuses on the single objective problem that minimizes the total length of the riser and satisfies all the imposed constraints the gbnm is implemented using the standard values of the simplex operational parameters 23 α 1 β 0 5 γ 2 δ 0 5 the convergence and restart tests proposed in luersen and le riche 2004 are also adopted in this study for a small simplex the length of its side is set to 5 of the smallest dimensional range while this value is set to 15 in the case of a large simplex the computational cost is set 25 restarts and a maximum of 120 iterations per restart 5 numerical results 5 1 case studies in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the crhd we propose three different case studies case 1 consists of a steel catenary riser scr subjected to the minimization of its total length case 2 is the proposed optimization scheme crhd where the goal is to minimize the total length of the riser using the hydrodynamic dampers and case 3 is the previous optimal configuration without the hydrodynamic dampers the first case is the industry standard configuration for riser and it serves as a basis for comparison with the last two the second case demonstrates the effectiveness of our results and the third case highlights the efficiency of the hydrodynamic dampers we noticed that the structural constraint is the most difficult to be satisfied as most of the tested configurations presented violations clc 1 the ultra deep water field and the increased amplitude of the heave motion for the riser top end lead to the increased stresses developed in the structure owing to this extreme scenario no feasible solutions were found for case 1 as no solutions presented a maximum clc value that was lower than 2 72 fig 5 a stress peak appears at the tdp region based on the analysis of the equivalent stress of the structure von mises the maximum value of 778 mpa indicated that the material tensile strength is exceeded and that the pipe would thus collapse fig 6 for case 2 the solution is a riser with a length of 4125 6 m presented in table 5 configuration 1 fig 7 illustrates the static equilibrium configuration of the optimized riser and the hds positioning while fig 8 presents the clc values for the entire riser it can be observed that there are six peaks that correspond to the regions of the five dampers and the tdp if the dampers are removed thus turning the riser into a regular catenary riser the resulting structural behavior would be completely different see figs 9 and 10 thus leading to increased stresses at the tdp region that would exceed the material tensile strength as an advantage of the gbnm method it is possible to compare the other local minima and check if there is a more suitable solution the five best solutions regarding the efficiency criterion are compared table 5 and fig 11 the structural behavior is quite similar with six stress peaks and no constraint violations once again the removal of the dampers leads to unfeasible regular catenary risers owing to the extreme stresses developed in the tdp region the design variables are treated as continuous throughout the optimization process in this way it is not possible to obtain configurations that could automatically comply with the industry requirements as pipes are traditionally manufactured with lengths equal to 12 m hence the procedure recommended by haftka and gürdal 2012 of adjusting the values of the design variables to the nearest discrete counterpart is adopted as it is not expected to change the response of the structure substantially table 5 presents the adjusted design variables respective response and comparison with the original configurations the obtained total length is similar for all the configurations however the structural behavior despite the similarities present relevant differences as configuration 3 becomes unfeasible due to the excessive stresses developed the results suggest that the configurations 1 and 2 are the best ones as the adjusted design variables lead to shorter risers with an acceptable structural behavior a fatigue analysis which would be the upcoming task in a complete riser design procedure can provide relevant complementary information to the designers thus leading to the most suitable solution 5 2 algorithm comparison in order to obtain a better understanding of the efficiency of the gbnm optimization method it is important to compare it to other methods we compared our algorithm with the commercial algorithm called midaco mixed integer distributed ant colony optimization a numerical high performance solver for single and multi objective optimization midaco is based on the ant colony optimization and has multiple engineering applications such as structural optimization of continuous footing keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016 and optimal frame design for civil aircrafts picchi scardaoni and frediani 2019 more information on the algorithm can be found in schlueter et al 2013 the criteria chosen to compare both methods is the number of objective function evaluations as most of the computational cost of the optimization process is due to the simulations that are involved in the objective function evaluation table 6 shows the number of objective function evaluations and computational time taken by each method to verify the effectiveness of both algorithms we also compared the optimal solutions obtained with each method the final results are shown in table 7 the adjusted lengths are obtained considering that each pipe is 12 meters long tables 6 and 7 show that the results obtained with both algorithms were very close in practice the numerical difference represents only 2 pipes which is a small amount when compared to the total riser length although the gbnm algorithm required more function evaluations than the midaco the cpu times for both algorithms were similar this suggests that gbnm explored regions that lead to many unfeasible configurations which are fast evaluated also the number of gbnm restarts can be reduced eliminating unnecessary evaluations in addition gbnm has an advantage when compared to midaco regarding the number of results that can be obtained while midaco reports only the current best solution gbnm presents multiple local minimums allowing the designer to select the best solution to be used in practice 6 conclusions this study presented a methodology that can successfully obtain optimized riser configurations in a considerably short time and provides well suited solutions for problems with few feasible designs the ability to identify several different local solutions is considered an advantage as the designer could choose from a range of suitably optimized designs provided by the algorithm although capable of providing effective solutions the gbnm still has room for improvement specifically with respect to unnecessary function evaluations we noticed that the restart process based on the adaptive probability density scheme generates many unfeasible configurations as starting point leading to a high number of function evaluations a new probability density scheme for the restart process of the gbnm algorithm is currently under investigation by the authors the proposed riser configuration proved to be a good alternative for ultra deep water and harsh environments with a better structural behavior than the traditional free hanging catenary configuration as the hds reduced the maximum stresses in the catenary riser by at most 64 for future studies a comparison between the crhd and lazy wave configurations would be useful as the latter is typically the preferred alternative when the regular catenary configuration is unfeasible it would also be interesting to consider fatigue constraints as a more realistic failure criteria however it should be taken into account that fatigue analyses are very computationally expensive and the fatigue constraint implementation would require prohibitively high computational costs acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by tecgraf institute of

22736,this paper presents research results on the causes and effects of human errors in relation to typical ship design factors such as noise vibrations and ship motions following a review of the relevant literature aimed to the identification and quantification of pertinent parameters and effects a detailed questionnaire has been developed and answered by seafarers the questionnaire results are presented in the form of quantitative risk models using bayesian networks with applications on two safety critical ships namely containerships and tankers finally we present the generic collision and grounding causation probabilities for both ship types the results are found to be in good agreement with current literature knowledge of the ship design factor effects on the human performance in quantitative form would be useful in the ship design and the development of new safety rules and regulations keywords human factors collision and grounding risk based ship design bayesian networks 1 introduction over the last decades the maritime industry has focused its efforts on improving the reliability and performance of ship systems in order to reduce or eliminate the number of maritime accidents occurring in this way the hull and its stability propulsion systems and navigation equipment among others have considerably improved through sophisticated hardware systems however regardless of these advances in technology the number of maritime accidents still remains high today it is often stated that around 80 of all maritime accidents collisions or groundings are attributable to human error he as the initiating cause schoröder hinrichs et al 2013 celik and cebi 2008 guedes et al 2000 antao and guedes 2008 baker and mccafferty 2005 card et al 2005 the fact is that any maritime system is a people based system ships depend completely on the professionalism and competence of seafarers it is fair to say that the seafarers are the last responsible to ensure the operational safety of the ship the safety and security of the life at sea and protection of the marine environment the human element is the key to achieve safe shipping the people onboard interact with technologies environmental conditions and organizational factors and in turn these factors influence to a greater or lesser extent on the performance of the tasks carried out by the humans therefore we must focus on the human operator designing technologies work environments and organizational issues support and encourage the operator to improve the performance of their duties under the philosophy of design for safety risk based ship design rbd is a methodology focusing on the integration of risk assessment within the conventional ship design process treating safety as a design objective konovessis et al 2013 vassalos 2008 from its implementation rbd has ascertained its usefulness in several research projects for example safedor 2005 2016 where the aim of the project was to improve the safety of maritime transportation and to increase maritime industries competitiveness through the integration of safety as design objective into ship design and risk assessment into the approval frameworks other studies such as klanac and varsta 2011 and ståhlberg et al 2013 were focused to stablish methodologies for design marine structures with increased safety for environment both proposals address the risk based ship for ship ship collision scenarios boulogouris and papanikolaou 2013 presented a risk based design concept to naval ship design by introducing assessment methods for ship s behavior after flooding more recently kujala et al 2019 reviews the knowledge necessary for the application of the risk based ship design for artic conditions nevertheless human factors have been not incorporated in these studies ship design for human factor has mainly addressed design ergonomics at the local level pusia and bliault 2013 the most typical example being the optimization of the ergonomics for efficient and cost effective bridge layout there has been very little research effort expended towards the consideration within ship design of the causes and effects on human errors in relation to pertinent ship design factors sdfs such as noise and vibration or ship motions for example there are simulator based experimental studies anderson et al 2014 hove and roza 2010 houben and bos 2010 kurt et al 2010 which investigate the effects of sdfs on seafarer s performance it is highlighted however that data in the literature clearly demonstrate that there is certain evidence for sdfs having some effect on human performance hansen and holmen 2011 smith et al 2001 dobie t 2000 in this context the european research project faros 2012 2015 developed a theoretical framework to link sdfs to human reliability this framework is based on specific maximum allowable limits on noise vibration and motion levels on board from the design rules and international standards on this background the aim of this paper is to present human reliability based risk models for maritime casualties through the use of bayesian belief networks bbns with applications on two safety critical ship types namely containerships and tankers collision and grounding accidents have been modelled supported by published background knowledge det norke veritas 2003 2006 hänninen and kujala 2012 these risk models are enhanced with the incorporation of variables relationships with sdfs to quantify the negative effects of the sdfs beyond the analysis and synthesis of the existing knowledge a study through questionnaires to crew members on board of vessel has been carried out 2 literature review of sdf effects on human performance in the following typical negative effects that ship design factors exert on the human performance are discussed 2 1 effect of noise noise can be defined as undesirable sound and it is present in most compartments of a ship including engines generators pumps etc the noise impacts on crew members are numerous basically the negative effects can be classified in two ways physiological and psychological the physiological impact most well known as a consequence of the noise is the hearing loss temporary or permanent however a long term exposure to high noise levels may cause other alterations on the human organism as such cardiovascular system disturbances hypertension hypotension and cardiac disease digestive disorders ulcers or colitis or endocrine and biochemical disorders although these physiological effects are less perceptible they have a considerable impact on human performance and this makes them the most dangerous cause of noise induced fatigue lamb 2006 on the other hand exposure to noise also impairs people psychologically seafarers working in a noisy environment tend to be irritable and moody becker et al 1995 lamb 2006 pusia and bliault 2013 kurt et al 2016 and consequently reduce the cognitive resources anxiety may be another effect caused by noise studies edsell 1976 standing and stace 1980 showed that there is a greater anxiety under noise conditions compared to low noise anxiety may affect to the central nervous system and this in turn decreasing vigilance task performance button et al 2004 obviously noise also affects sleep patterns the crew may have difficulty sleeping waking up often and suffering insomnia it decreases the restorative quality of rest which greatly contributes to fatigue lamb 2006 and creating an aggressive climate on board in the study oldenburg et al 2009 carried on to identify stressor in seafarers the noise physical stressor is ranked in the position 10 of the 23 stressors studied in the shipping industry the updated imo code on noise levels on board ships imo 2014 is the current noise standard nevertheless several classification societies have defined their own noise limits for each ship space which are stricter than the limits set by the imo code overall the noise exposure of crew members should not exceed 80 db a however these limits are designed to protect seafarers from hazardous levels of noise affecting their hearing and therefore limiting the associated psychological effects of noise on performance and wellbeing of the crew members are not considered in this sense the silenv project 2008 2012 focused on the reduction of the noise and vibration on board ships proposed a holistic approach to investigate all of these noise related annoyances and suggested ways to limit the noise in addition silenv green label noise standards were also introduced in comparison with the current normative framework kurt et al 2016 2 2 effects of the whole body vibration wbv wbv may affect subjective comfort and working efficiency of the crew members the vibrations may exert physical effects on the persons it can be transmitted to the whole body surface or to individual parts of the body surface e g hand arm according to the directive 2002 44 ec over physical agents the wbv is defined as the mechanical vibration that when transmitted to the whole body entails risks to the health and safety of workers in particular lower back morbidity and trauma of the spine in addition vibrations can affect human performance indirectly by affecting stable visual field causing fuzzy vision and difficulty of interpretation dobie 2000 pusia and biault 2013 the conway et al 2007 study shows that wbv has a negative influence on performance where the perceptual and fine motor tasks were the largest negative effects also moderate negative effects on cognitive performance were found dobie 2000 and lamb 2006 also suggest that vibrations may cause fatigue performance deficits and interrupt demanding operations finally the slamming induced vibrations can be a source of discomfort on board dallinga and bos 2010 this fact is more prominent during the shock impulses experienced by the watercrafts grech et al 2010 this study indicated that prolonged exposure to shock impulses and wbvs in these type of vessels can negative affect wellbeing and health and performance degradation of personnel salyga and juozuynas 2016 carried out a study to determinate the relation between environment and psycho emotional stress experienced by seafarers this study shows that vibrations and secondly noise as the principal factors which are detrimental to health on board 2 3 effects of ship motions effects of ship motion effects are typically measured by motion induced sickness mis and motion induced interruptions mii mis is recognized as a major contributor to performance impairment in both mental and physical state general discomfort malaise nausea and vomiting characterise motion sickness dobie 2000 however the adaptation to seafarers to ship motion is high especially in cases of experienced sailors pusia and biault 2013 in relation to mis ue compass project 2002 2005 investigated and presented a more suitable and realistic approach to deal with motion sickness and passenger comfort in sea transportation but ship motion may affect crew performance interfering with gross and fine motor skills by affecting motivation fatigue or time of lost in maintaining his balance applebe et al 1980 wertheim 1998 valk et al 2010 including the reduction in their activities attributed to the induced motion matsangas et al 2010 in addition ship motion may directly interfere on performance by interrupting the task mii addresses a situation which occurs when a person loses balance or slips as consequence of local motions hence interrupting whatever task is being carried out dobie 2000 on this background there is clear evidence that noise vibrations and ship motions can exert negative effects on human performance however crew performance degradation levels are ambiguous and are strongly related to the seafarer in accordance with the dynamic adaptability hanckok 1989 and the compensatory control models robert and hockey 1997 under these theories the humans are capable of adapting to environments when there are motivated to do so in addition they can find additional cognitive resources to facilitate completion of a task at the expense of performance in other areas 3 methodology 3 1 approach adopted estimating the probability of collision or grounding is fundamental in maritime quantitative risk assessments currently the method more extensively used to calculate probability of occurrence for ship collision or grounding has its roots in the studies of fujii et al 1974 and mcduff 1974 the accident probability is calculated as a product of a number of candidates to suffer an accident n a and a causation probability p c p c aims to measure the relationship between cause and effect of an undesirable event as an illustration it represents the probability of failing an evasive manoeuvre to avoid an accident therefore p c is the quantification of the proportion of actual accident cases over the whole population of potential accident cases if no evasive manoeuvre takes place montewka et al 2010 hence p c depends on the type of evasive manoeuvre being performed which in turn depends on a number of contributing factors typically human errors technical failures or environment factors the causation probability may be estimated using accident statistics or by using risk analysis tools such as fault trees or bayesian networks hänninen and kujala 2010 in addition others studies introduce the pc concept through analysis of near collisions based on the maritime traffic analysis and a number of modelled collision candidates montewka et al 2012 or through bayesian paired comparison approach szwed et al 2006 a bayesian network bn is a graphical representation that connects probability theory and graph theory friss hansen 2005 a bn is a probabilistic model that relates a set of random variables and their conditional dependences using intuitive visual representation direct acyclic graph the random variables are represented by a set of nodes in the network and their dependent relationships are represented by direct links using arrows the bn technique is recognized as an effective and robust tool for risk modelling and decision support means in the maritime industry in this regard formal safety assessment fsa studies for large passenger ships or for electronic chart display and information system ecdis dnv 2003 2006 or the risk model developed for the maritime traffic safety in the gulf of finland hänninen and kujala 2010 are examples of applications of bns for maritime research in this paper the causation probability for collision and grounding of container and tanker ships are modelled with bns supported by background knowledge for modelling the bns this paper made use of the software genie modeller academic genie 2015 in order to capture the effect of human factors performance the risk models are enhanced with the incorporation of variables relationships with ship design factors sdfs such as noise vibrations and ship motions 3 2 quantification of sdfs in the bayesian networks in order to quantify how ship design factors noise whole body vibrations and ship motion alter stress level of the crew on board a questionnaire was developed this questionnaire is attached in appendix 1 the questionnaire was distributed to several european seafarers associations a total of 130 questionnaires were received of them 119 were selected as suitable for the analysis of the 11 responses not taken into account in the analysis 2 were disregarded due to lack of answers to the majority of the questions asked the remaining 9 were questionnaires completed by deck and engine cadets 6 deck cadets and 3 engineer cadets and were excluded from the analysis due the responders limited experience onboard ships as there are 63 responses to the questionnaire by qualified captains and deck officers the elimination of 6 responses from deck cadets is not considered as having any significant effect on the analysis of the responses the questionnaire is developed in accordance with typical effects that sdfs exert on human performance as addressed in the literature the questionnaire comprises 14 questions focused on the following a questions related to personal data position on board age sex and experience on board b general questions about the sdfs levels on board and stress level self feeling self evaluation by the participants in general some degree of satisfaction perception intensity should be indicated in these questions in terms of amount for this a verbal scale of 5 levels was used i e very high high normal low and very low c specific questions related to typical physical and mental stressors caused by sdfs effects where the frequency should be indicated in these questions for that a verbal scale of 4 levels was used i e always often sometimes and never or rarely the mental stressors considered are the following six irritability anxiety distraction on task decrease on cognitive abilities sea sickness and sleeping problems further divided in difficulty falling asleep disruption problems and insomnia the physical stressor considered is the decrease on physical task performance fig 1 shows the sdfs and the stressors identified in accordance with the literature reviewed the specific questions were evaluated on a scale of 1 4 where 1 never or rarely 2 sometimes 3 often and 4 always the answers to these specific questions were used to quantify the sdf variables in the bayesian network this set of variables are adopted from montewka et al 2017 2015 and described in section 4 2 description and quantification of the nodes related with sdfs for the bn the results obtained from the quantification process are then translated to the corresponding bayesian network nodes two stages are defined for each variable where 1 affect and 0 not affect it means to calculate the probability percentage of each variable using the scale before mentioned the value 1 0 2 33 3 67 and 4 100 of probabilities for example to 2 19 the probability used in the stages of the variable will be 40 for stage affect and 60 for the stage no affect i e 0 40 between 0 and 1 where 0 is no affect and 1 is affect 4 results 4 1 questionnaire results the questionnaires were filled by 119 seafarers where 84 were men and 16 women the age of 46 of the mariners is between 30 and 40 years whereas 19 are between 40 and 50 years other 19 over 50 years and the remaining 16 are under 30 years in total 94 officers 79 and 25 non officers 21 participated in the study the seafarers were furthermore allotted according to their position on board master 27 deck officers 36 chief engineer 12 engine officer 19 and others positions 25 more than half 52 of seafarers had over 10 years of experience at sea 24 between 1 and 5 years and other 24 between 5 and 10 years those with less than one year experience e g cadets were excluded from the study see table 1 the seafarers were asked to self assess about the mental stress level caused by noise and vibrations these questions were evaluated on a scale from 1 very low to 5 very high table 2 shows the results obtained where mean m and standard deviation sd were calculated for the number of participants n stress levels are found between normal and high the stress level caused by noise is 3 52 whereas the stress level caused by the vibrations is 3 30 out of a maximum 5 when comparing results as allotted for different professional functions similar patterns are observed when comparing results between deck and engine departments however we observe stress levels at the engine department higher than deck department 3 8 vs 3 46 for noise and 3 51 vs 3 30 for vibrations this finding is consistent with the restricted environment at the engine spaces which is expected to result in more severe effects on human performance from noise and vibrations in addition the seafarers were asked to self assess their ability to adapt to effects by the sdfs the results obtained are shown in fig 2 the answers were allotted according to the crew total as well as experience onboard ships in general the adaptability level in the crew total is located between normal and high levels m 3 40 and sd 0 70 nonetheless if compared between times of experience on board we observe that adaptability level is increased to more experience on board except for ship motion parameter where the adaptability level remains almost constant for all the groups this output could be conditioned to the type of vessel and environmental conditions where the respondents performed their duties table 3 shows the data obtained to evaluate the sdfs effects through physical and mental stressors this results were extracted of the specific questions about the sdfs broadly in accordance with the results obtained we could say that sleeping problems has been the main trouble related with the sdf effects on crew performance difficulty falling asleep and sleep disruption are marked by participants with the higher values it affects quality of rest which greatly contributes to fatigue irritability etc in relation to ship motion and its typical effects such as seasickness and mii the study distinguished between four types of vessels containerships tankers bulk carrier and ropax ships this is explained by the fact that for example the motions a ropax experiences in a certain seaway is fundamentally different compared to a tanker ship as motions and behavior in a seaway depend highly on the hull form thus ship motion is strongly related with the deadweight hull forms length draught freeboard etc while noise and vibrations on board depend on propulsion engine sound isolation size of the vessel accommodation location vessel age and condition etc in this context our results shown that mis and mii on containerships is greater than the rest of the ships 4 2 description and quantification of the nodes related with sdfs for the bn in the following the new nodes incorporated to the grounding and collision models are briefly described this particular set of nodes is adopted from montewka et al 2017 2015 2014 and the literature review of sdf effects on human performance on this basis the ship motions noise and whole body vibrations having effects on human performance by two paths the sdfs effects could be presented on one hand as stressors acting on personal conditions and people s attention management system e g noise can reduce the cognitive resources affecting to the attention and on the other hand as physical effects acting directly on performance e g motion induced interruptions can degrade the physical ability by interrupting the task the new nodes incorporated to the bn models performed by det norske veritas 2003 2006 are as follow noise the node describes the officer on watch oow will be affected by mental stress caused by noise effects diffuse motion the node describes the oow will be affected by mental stress caused by ship motion diffuse vibration the node describes the oow will be affected by mental stress caused by wbv acute motion the node describes the oow will be affected by ship motion induced interruptions physical stress acute vibration the node describes the oow will be affected by physical stress caused by wbv sdf stressor mental stressor the node joins the nodes noise diffuse vibration and diffuse motion and describes whether the oow has influenced by these factors this node is included in order to gather the nodes noise diffuse vibration and diffuse motion in one node the node has only logical probability input i e probabilities are either 1 or 0 sdf physical effect physical effect the node joins the nodes acute vibration and acute motion and describes whether the oow has influenced by these factors this node is made in order to gather the nodes acute vibration and acute motion in one node the node has only logical probability input i e probabilities are either 1 or 0 once obtained the values for each new node the distribution of the probabilities was calculated and introduced in the bn two stages are defined for each node where 1 affect and 0 not affect for example the value of the noise node obtained of the quantification process of the questionnaire was 2 19 corresponding to the average of all effects in this way 1 0 2 33 3 67 and 4 100 of probabilities it means that conditional probability to noise node will be 40 for affect stage affect and 60 for the no affect stage i e 0 40 between 0 and 1 where 0 is no affect and 1 is affect table 4 and fig 3 show the conditional probabilities used for each node in the bn in order to validate our results table 5 shows a comparative between our results and the results of the faros project faros 2016 montewka et al 2017 to both sdf stressor and sdf physical effect nodes the results are very similar with the exception of the sdf physical effect for tankers it is important to emphasize that we distinguish between two ships type while faros obtain its result to a generic ship our results are in accordance with the assumption that the movement in a tanker ship will be less than a container ship therefore the physical effect caused by motion is expected to be lesser 4 3 aggregation of the sdf variables into bn models in montewka 2017 a bn model was developed linking typical sdfs effects hence the sdf acting as stressors were linked with nodes related with human capabilities e g attention management capability node while sdf acting with physical effects were linked with nodes related with human behaviour e g maintenance task performance node on the other hand the bn models developed by dnv are not based on human reliability theory and therefore our set of nodes is a priori incompatible with the nodes presented by dnv to overcome this we considered that sdfs have effects on human performance via two paths 1 as stressors acting on personal conditions and attention 2 as physical effects acting directly on performance as an explanation the personal conditions node is described by dnv as the physical and mental condition of the oww i e if the officer is fit to perform his tasks as navigator it clearly appears that sdfs acting as mental stressor have a direct relation with this node for example noise may impair the capability of the officer due to insomnia similar considerations are made for diffuse motion and vibrations the attention node describes the level of the attention when the oww is performing their tasks at the bridge it is important noting that the attention node is son to the personal conditions node at the dnv model which includes the sdf stressor node however we decided to link the sdf stressor directly with attention node also as an example a motion induced seasickness may exert negative effects when the oow is keeping their guard on the bridge which should be modelled as that the sdf stressor affect directly both the officer s personal conditions and also the attention level necessary at the moment on which the officer takes a decision the performance node finally indicates the manner in which the oww carry out their tasks it appears clearly that sdfs acting as physical effects have a direct relation with this node since the ship motion as well as vibrations may decrease the physical task performance on a certain moment by for example shock impulses it is worth noting again that the personal conditions node is parent to the performance node 4 4 influence of the sdf variables in the risk models development the structure of the bn models are to a large extent based on models presented by det norske veritas 2003 2006 adapted to the casualties and ship types under consideration the structure models for groundings and collisions can be seen in appendix 2 figures a1 and a2 respectively the set of variables presented in each model has been classified with very few exceptions on the basis of the nature thereof in six major groups as follows 1 detection of the hazard factors 2 human factors 3 management factors 4 external assistant factors 5 consequences and 6 others e g give way variable in the bn leading collisions table a 1in appendix 2 includes all the variables as classified above for each variable a number of states is assigned in addition each node is assigned a conditional probability table cpt which has been set manually the majority of nodes states and probability values are derived from dnv 2003 dnv 2006 hänninen and kujala 2012 however a limited number of certain variables are based on or adjusted on the basis of expert judgment as detailed in table a1 in relation to the human factor nodes and more specifically the nodes related to sdfs we consider that the sdf stressor node has a relationship with the personal conditions and attention nodes whereas the sdf physical node has to be linked to the performance node of our bn the cpts of these variables have been tailored through experts judgment and logical adaptation from the previous studies dnv 2003 2006 the main assumptions made are the following personal conditions this node describes the physical and mental conditions of the oww i e if the officer is fit to perform his tasks as navigator the node stages are fit unfit and not able to perform also the node is dependent on the nodes stress level tired incapacitated and sdf stressors it assumes that the oow is 100 fit if he is capable i e not incapacitated has standard stress level is not tired and the sdf stressor is not present however when the sdf stressor node is present i e active the fitness stage will be reduced by 20 in addition if he is tired or has high stress level the fitness is reduced by 10 see table a2 attention this node describes level of the attention when the oww is performing his tasks the node stages are high attention low attention and not able to pay attention also the node is dependent on the nodes distraction level personal condition bridge design brm and sdf stressors it assumes that when the sdf stressor is present and the oow is fit the low attention stage will be increase by 5 if the oow is unfit the low attention will be increased by 10 see table a3 performance the node indicates the manner in which the oww carry out their tasks the node stages are excellent standard and poor also the node is dependent on the nodes competence personal condition bridge design and sdf physical effect it assumes that when the oow has fit stage and the sdf physical effects are present the performance will be 50 poor if he is unfit the performance will be 100 poor see table a4 on this basis the main results obtained for the grounding and collision bn models are the followings table 6 tanker ship the probability of grounding i e the oow loss of control and like consequence the grounding occurs is 1 05e 04 an absolute value in addition the probability of fatalities occur is 2 30e 08 if the sdf nodes are not active the probabilities will decrease respectively to 7 57e 05 and 1 65e 08 the collision probability is 1 15e 05 the probability of fatalities occur is 9 35e 09 if the sdf nodes are not active the probability will decrease respectively to 1 01e 05 and 8 25e 09 container ship the probability of grounding is 1 26e 04 the probability of fatalities occur is 7 25e 08 if the sdf nodes are not active the probabilities will decrease respectively to 9 09e 05 and 5 20e 08 the probability of collision is 1 16e 05 the probability of fatalities occur is 9 59e 09 if the sdf nodes are not active the probabilities will decrease respectively to 1 01e 05 and 8 31e 09 our results are in good agreement with the literature the most popular and used causation probabilities are based on fujii et al 1984 where the collision causation probability for crossing and meeting ships are 1 3e 04 and 4 9e 05 respectively to grounding the causation probabilities are established between 8 0e 05 and 5 0e 04 finally even though the presence of the variables related with the sdfs exert scarce influence on the final results of grounding and collision probabilities our study reveals the negative effects that noise vibrations and ship motion have on the two accident categories examined collision and grounding 5 discussion and validation of the results this section discusses the results of a validation exercise applied to the models namely data questionnaire and bn models and assesses the strength of evidence found 5 1 data questionaries once all the items of the questionnaire were analyzed it is observed that the only item that presents problems of normality is noise present in the engine room it can be said that this item presents an almost unique and consistent response around the maximum that is all participants agree that the noise in the engine room is excessive so that the item is described and excluded from the parametric analysis with the rest of the items we can proceed to the parametric type analysis the total scales for noise effects of noise vibration effects of vibrations movement effects of movement and the total scale of adaptability to these factors are defined due to the differences in the number of items we will use the standardized scores of the same the direct scores on the scales appear in table 7 the unifactorial anova does not find statistically significant differences in the scales depending on the position performed on board nor are significant differences found based on age or depending on the time of experience the total reliability of the scale has an excellent internal consistency value cronbach s alpha of α 0 958 all the items presenting correlations with the scale 0 40 except for the item that assesses the noise in the engine room whose correlation with the scale is r 0 020 this is because this item presents a consistent response around the maximum in all individuals so it must be excluded from the analysis once the item is eliminated the alpha is α 0 959 5 2 bayesian network models the developed models are an extension based on models presented by det norske veritas adapted to the casualties and ship types under consideration for this reason the results are in good agreement with the previous literature although the study shows that the presence of the variables related with the sdfs exert scarce influence on the final results of grounding and collision probabilities however reveals the negative effects that noise vibrations and ship motion exert on the human factor reinforcing in this way what has already been studied by the faros project while in the faros project the states for the input variables of ship motion noise and vibration were derived from the literature around thresholds of effect in the presents study the inputs were quantified through a questionnaire developed to extract the experience of the seafarers in relation with these variables nonetheless the results of both studies show good agreement in addition an influence test and sensitive analysis carried out to assessment the parameters of the models providing a valuable tool for screening the models for important variables 5 2 1 influence test to evaluate the influence that the new variables introduced into risk models exert on human performance an influence test was carried out table 8 shows the conditional probabilities of the nodes directly influenced by the sdf variables the different stages to each node as well as its values are presented in the best and worst scenarios i e when sdf variables are inactive or totally active the test results indicate that the major difference is located to the performance node where the oow performance will be substantially reduced with the sdfs are active this node indicates the manner which the oww carry out their tasks and it is dependent on the personal condition and sdf physical effect nodes among others during the expert s judgment our study assumed that when the oow has a fit stage and the sdf physical effects are active the performance would be 50 poor based on it we can understand why these differences are so high and therefore the strength of evidence in this data would be moderate 5 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is technique that can help validate the probability parameters of a bayesian network this is done by investigating the effect of small changes in numerical parameters i e probabilities on the output parameters genie modeller used to model the bn implements an algorithm proposed by kjærulff and van der gaag 2000 that performs simple sensitive analysis based on the findings from the analysis into our models the following can be concluded to collision parameter the model is low sensitive to steering failure and very low sensitive to give way variables to grounding parameter the model is highly sensitive to steering failure in addition model is moderate sensitive to action assessment and incapacity variables the remaining variables in both models have very low sensitive values to end result it means fatalities variable for both collision and grounding models the analysis shows a value 0 as maximum sensitivity concluding that the models present a very low sensitive so it is shown that the typical variables related to the sdfs that is personal conditions attention and performance present very little sensitivity for the end result i e grounding or collision therefore the assumptions proposed to give conditional probabilities could be valid in addition for this set of variables the parameter which presents the maximum sensitive value is incapacity node nevertheless to performance node the acute motion and acute vibration i e sdf physical presents moderate values of sensitive it is in agreement with the earlier mentioned during the influence test therefore the strength of evidence in this data would be moderate 6 conclusions in this paper we presented research findings on the influence and quantification of the relationship of typical collision and grounding risk factors with ship design parameters as affected by the human element we developed a detailed questionnaire to capture the experience of crew members and presented the analysis of the results the findings of the questionnaire were statistically tested and validated by t test unifactorial anova and cronbach s alpha presenting excellent correlation and statistical inference these results were then incorporated into human reliability based risk models the study reveals the negative effects that noise vibrations and ship motion exert on the human factor reinforcing earlier research findings one major finding is that sleeping problems is ranked high among the crew members in relation to ship design factors sdfs affecting quality of rest which in turn greatly contributes to fatigue irritability and the other factors considered which then contribute to increased probabilities of collision and grounding to calculate the probabilities of collision and grounding is necessary to know the so called causation probability value which estimates the probability of failing an evasive manoeuvre to avoid an accident in this paper we presented the framework for modelling the causation probability for collision and grounding using bayesian network technique the bayesian networks have been enhanced with the incorporation of the variables related with sdfs and its relations with the human performance the results are found in good agreement with existing literature further contributing in quantifying the effect of ship design factors on human performance depending on service and

22736,this paper presents research results on the causes and effects of human errors in relation to typical ship design factors such as noise vibrations and ship motions following a review of the relevant literature aimed to the identification and quantification of pertinent parameters and effects a detailed questionnaire has been developed and answered by seafarers the questionnaire results are presented in the form of quantitative risk models using bayesian networks with applications on two safety critical ships namely containerships and tankers finally we present the generic collision and grounding causation probabilities for both ship types the results are found to be in good agreement with current literature knowledge of the ship design factor effects on the human performance in quantitative form would be useful in the ship design and the development of new safety rules and regulations keywords human factors collision and grounding risk based ship design bayesian networks 1 introduction over the last decades the maritime industry has focused its efforts on improving the reliability and performance of ship systems in order to reduce or eliminate the number of maritime accidents occurring in this way the hull and its stability propulsion systems and navigation equipment among others have considerably improved through sophisticated hardware systems however regardless of these advances in technology the number of maritime accidents still remains high today it is often stated that around 80 of all maritime accidents collisions or groundings are attributable to human error he as the initiating cause schoröder hinrichs et al 2013 celik and cebi 2008 guedes et al 2000 antao and guedes 2008 baker and mccafferty 2005 card et al 2005 the fact is that any maritime system is a people based system ships depend completely on the professionalism and competence of seafarers it is fair to say that the seafarers are the last responsible to ensure the operational safety of the ship the safety and security of the life at sea and protection of the marine environment the human element is the key to achieve safe shipping the people onboard interact with technologies environmental conditions and organizational factors and in turn these factors influence to a greater or lesser extent on the performance of the tasks carried out by the humans therefore we must focus on the human operator designing technologies work environments and organizational issues support and encourage the operator to improve the performance of their duties under the philosophy of design for safety risk based ship design rbd is a methodology focusing on the integration of risk assessment within the conventional ship design process treating safety as a design objective konovessis et al 2013 vassalos 2008 from its implementation rbd has ascertained its usefulness in several research projects for example safedor 2005 2016 where the aim of the project was to improve the safety of maritime transportation and to increase maritime industries competitiveness through the integration of safety as design objective into ship design and risk assessment into the approval frameworks other studies such as klanac and varsta 2011 and ståhlberg et al 2013 were focused to stablish methodologies for design marine structures with increased safety for environment both proposals address the risk based ship for ship ship collision scenarios boulogouris and papanikolaou 2013 presented a risk based design concept to naval ship design by introducing assessment methods for ship s behavior after flooding more recently kujala et al 2019 reviews the knowledge necessary for the application of the risk based ship design for artic conditions nevertheless human factors have been not incorporated in these studies ship design for human factor has mainly addressed design ergonomics at the local level pusia and bliault 2013 the most typical example being the optimization of the ergonomics for efficient and cost effective bridge layout there has been very little research effort expended towards the consideration within ship design of the causes and effects on human errors in relation to pertinent ship design factors sdfs such as noise and vibration or ship motions for example there are simulator based experimental studies anderson et al 2014 hove and roza 2010 houben and bos 2010 kurt et al 2010 which investigate the effects of sdfs on seafarer s performance it is highlighted however that data in the literature clearly demonstrate that there is certain evidence for sdfs having some effect on human performance hansen and holmen 2011 smith et al 2001 dobie t 2000 in this context the european research project faros 2012 2015 developed a theoretical framework to link sdfs to human reliability this framework is based on specific maximum allowable limits on noise vibration and motion levels on board from the design rules and international standards on this background the aim of this paper is to present human reliability based risk models for maritime casualties through the use of bayesian belief networks bbns with applications on two safety critical ship types namely containerships and tankers collision and grounding accidents have been modelled supported by published background knowledge det norke veritas 2003 2006 hänninen and kujala 2012 these risk models are enhanced with the incorporation of variables relationships with sdfs to quantify the negative effects of the sdfs beyond the analysis and synthesis of the existing knowledge a study through questionnaires to crew members on board of vessel has been carried out 2 literature review of sdf effects on human performance in the following typical negative effects that ship design factors exert on the human performance are discussed 2 1 effect of noise noise can be defined as undesirable sound and it is present in most compartments of a ship including engines generators pumps etc the noise impacts on crew members are numerous basically the negative effects can be classified in two ways physiological and psychological the physiological impact most well known as a consequence of the noise is the hearing loss temporary or permanent however a long term exposure to high noise levels may cause other alterations on the human organism as such cardiovascular system disturbances hypertension hypotension and cardiac disease digestive disorders ulcers or colitis or endocrine and biochemical disorders although these physiological effects are less perceptible they have a considerable impact on human performance and this makes them the most dangerous cause of noise induced fatigue lamb 2006 on the other hand exposure to noise also impairs people psychologically seafarers working in a noisy environment tend to be irritable and moody becker et al 1995 lamb 2006 pusia and bliault 2013 kurt et al 2016 and consequently reduce the cognitive resources anxiety may be another effect caused by noise studies edsell 1976 standing and stace 1980 showed that there is a greater anxiety under noise conditions compared to low noise anxiety may affect to the central nervous system and this in turn decreasing vigilance task performance button et al 2004 obviously noise also affects sleep patterns the crew may have difficulty sleeping waking up often and suffering insomnia it decreases the restorative quality of rest which greatly contributes to fatigue lamb 2006 and creating an aggressive climate on board in the study oldenburg et al 2009 carried on to identify stressor in seafarers the noise physical stressor is ranked in the position 10 of the 23 stressors studied in the shipping industry the updated imo code on noise levels on board ships imo 2014 is the current noise standard nevertheless several classification societies have defined their own noise limits for each ship space which are stricter than the limits set by the imo code overall the noise exposure of crew members should not exceed 80 db a however these limits are designed to protect seafarers from hazardous levels of noise affecting their hearing and therefore limiting the associated psychological effects of noise on performance and wellbeing of the crew members are not considered in this sense the silenv project 2008 2012 focused on the reduction of the noise and vibration on board ships proposed a holistic approach to investigate all of these noise related annoyances and suggested ways to limit the noise in addition silenv green label noise standards were also introduced in comparison with the current normative framework kurt et al 2016 2 2 effects of the whole body vibration wbv wbv may affect subjective comfort and working efficiency of the crew members the vibrations may exert physical effects on the persons it can be transmitted to the whole body surface or to individual parts of the body surface e g hand arm according to the directive 2002 44 ec over physical agents the wbv is defined as the mechanical vibration that when transmitted to the whole body entails risks to the health and safety of workers in particular lower back morbidity and trauma of the spine in addition vibrations can affect human performance indirectly by affecting stable visual field causing fuzzy vision and difficulty of interpretation dobie 2000 pusia and biault 2013 the conway et al 2007 study shows that wbv has a negative influence on performance where the perceptual and fine motor tasks were the largest negative effects also moderate negative effects on cognitive performance were found dobie 2000 and lamb 2006 also suggest that vibrations may cause fatigue performance deficits and interrupt demanding operations finally the slamming induced vibrations can be a source of discomfort on board dallinga and bos 2010 this fact is more prominent during the shock impulses experienced by the watercrafts grech et al 2010 this study indicated that prolonged exposure to shock impulses and wbvs in these type of vessels can negative affect wellbeing and health and performance degradation of personnel salyga and juozuynas 2016 carried out a study to determinate the relation between environment and psycho emotional stress experienced by seafarers this study shows that vibrations and secondly noise as the principal factors which are detrimental to health on board 2 3 effects of ship motions effects of ship motion effects are typically measured by motion induced sickness mis and motion induced interruptions mii mis is recognized as a major contributor to performance impairment in both mental and physical state general discomfort malaise nausea and vomiting characterise motion sickness dobie 2000 however the adaptation to seafarers to ship motion is high especially in cases of experienced sailors pusia and biault 2013 in relation to mis ue compass project 2002 2005 investigated and presented a more suitable and realistic approach to deal with motion sickness and passenger comfort in sea transportation but ship motion may affect crew performance interfering with gross and fine motor skills by affecting motivation fatigue or time of lost in maintaining his balance applebe et al 1980 wertheim 1998 valk et al 2010 including the reduction in their activities attributed to the induced motion matsangas et al 2010 in addition ship motion may directly interfere on performance by interrupting the task mii addresses a situation which occurs when a person loses balance or slips as consequence of local motions hence interrupting whatever task is being carried out dobie 2000 on this background there is clear evidence that noise vibrations and ship motions can exert negative effects on human performance however crew performance degradation levels are ambiguous and are strongly related to the seafarer in accordance with the dynamic adaptability hanckok 1989 and the compensatory control models robert and hockey 1997 under these theories the humans are capable of adapting to environments when there are motivated to do so in addition they can find additional cognitive resources to facilitate completion of a task at the expense of performance in other areas 3 methodology 3 1 approach adopted estimating the probability of collision or grounding is fundamental in maritime quantitative risk assessments currently the method more extensively used to calculate probability of occurrence for ship collision or grounding has its roots in the studies of fujii et al 1974 and mcduff 1974 the accident probability is calculated as a product of a number of candidates to suffer an accident n a and a causation probability p c p c aims to measure the relationship between cause and effect of an undesirable event as an illustration it represents the probability of failing an evasive manoeuvre to avoid an accident therefore p c is the quantification of the proportion of actual accident cases over the whole population of potential accident cases if no evasive manoeuvre takes place montewka et al 2010 hence p c depends on the type of evasive manoeuvre being performed which in turn depends on a number of contributing factors typically human errors technical failures or environment factors the causation probability may be estimated using accident statistics or by using risk analysis tools such as fault trees or bayesian networks hänninen and kujala 2010 in addition others studies introduce the pc concept through analysis of near collisions based on the maritime traffic analysis and a number of modelled collision candidates montewka et al 2012 or through bayesian paired comparison approach szwed et al 2006 a bayesian network bn is a graphical representation that connects probability theory and graph theory friss hansen 2005 a bn is a probabilistic model that relates a set of random variables and their conditional dependences using intuitive visual representation direct acyclic graph the random variables are represented by a set of nodes in the network and their dependent relationships are represented by direct links using arrows the bn technique is recognized as an effective and robust tool for risk modelling and decision support means in the maritime industry in this regard formal safety assessment fsa studies for large passenger ships or for electronic chart display and information system ecdis dnv 2003 2006 or the risk model developed for the maritime traffic safety in the gulf of finland hänninen and kujala 2010 are examples of applications of bns for maritime research in this paper the causation probability for collision and grounding of container and tanker ships are modelled with bns supported by background knowledge for modelling the bns this paper made use of the software genie modeller academic genie 2015 in order to capture the effect of human factors performance the risk models are enhanced with the incorporation of variables relationships with ship design factors sdfs such as noise vibrations and ship motions 3 2 quantification of sdfs in the bayesian networks in order to quantify how ship design factors noise whole body vibrations and ship motion alter stress level of the crew on board a questionnaire was developed this questionnaire is attached in appendix 1 the questionnaire was distributed to several european seafarers associations a total of 130 questionnaires were received of them 119 were selected as suitable for the analysis of the 11 responses not taken into account in the analysis 2 were disregarded due to lack of answers to the majority of the questions asked the remaining 9 were questionnaires completed by deck and engine cadets 6 deck cadets and 3 engineer cadets and were excluded from the analysis due the responders limited experience onboard ships as there are 63 responses to the questionnaire by qualified captains and deck officers the elimination of 6 responses from deck cadets is not considered as having any significant effect on the analysis of the responses the questionnaire is developed in accordance with typical effects that sdfs exert on human performance as addressed in the literature the questionnaire comprises 14 questions focused on the following a questions related to personal data position on board age sex and experience on board b general questions about the sdfs levels on board and stress level self feeling self evaluation by the participants in general some degree of satisfaction perception intensity should be indicated in these questions in terms of amount for this a verbal scale of 5 levels was used i e very high high normal low and very low c specific questions related to typical physical and mental stressors caused by sdfs effects where the frequency should be indicated in these questions for that a verbal scale of 4 levels was used i e always often sometimes and never or rarely the mental stressors considered are the following six irritability anxiety distraction on task decrease on cognitive abilities sea sickness and sleeping problems further divided in difficulty falling asleep disruption problems and insomnia the physical stressor considered is the decrease on physical task performance fig 1 shows the sdfs and the stressors identified in accordance with the literature reviewed the specific questions were evaluated on a scale of 1 4 where 1 never or rarely 2 sometimes 3 often and 4 always the answers to these specific questions were used to quantify the sdf variables in the bayesian network this set of variables are adopted from montewka et al 2017 2015 and described in section 4 2 description and quantification of the nodes related with sdfs for the bn the results obtained from the quantification process are then translated to the corresponding bayesian network nodes two stages are defined for each variable where 1 affect and 0 not affect it means to calculate the probability percentage of each variable using the scale before mentioned the value 1 0 2 33 3 67 and 4 100 of probabilities for example to 2 19 the probability used in the stages of the variable will be 40 for stage affect and 60 for the stage no affect i e 0 40 between 0 and 1 where 0 is no affect and 1 is affect 4 results 4 1 questionnaire results the questionnaires were filled by 119 seafarers where 84 were men and 16 women the age of 46 of the mariners is between 30 and 40 years whereas 19 are between 40 and 50 years other 19 over 50 years and the remaining 16 are under 30 years in total 94 officers 79 and 25 non officers 21 participated in the study the seafarers were furthermore allotted according to their position on board master 27 deck officers 36 chief engineer 12 engine officer 19 and others positions 25 more than half 52 of seafarers had over 10 years of experience at sea 24 between 1 and 5 years and other 24 between 5 and 10 years those with less than one year experience e g cadets were excluded from the study see table 1 the seafarers were asked to self assess about the mental stress level caused by noise and vibrations these questions were evaluated on a scale from 1 very low to 5 very high table 2 shows the results obtained where mean m and standard deviation sd were calculated for the number of participants n stress levels are found between normal and high the stress level caused by noise is 3 52 whereas the stress level caused by the vibrations is 3 30 out of a maximum 5 when comparing results as allotted for different professional functions similar patterns are observed when comparing results between deck and engine departments however we observe stress levels at the engine department higher than deck department 3 8 vs 3 46 for noise and 3 51 vs 3 30 for vibrations this finding is consistent with the restricted environment at the engine spaces which is expected to result in more severe effects on human performance from noise and vibrations in addition the seafarers were asked to self assess their ability to adapt to effects by the sdfs the results obtained are shown in fig 2 the answers were allotted according to the crew total as well as experience onboard ships in general the adaptability level in the crew total is located between normal and high levels m 3 40 and sd 0 70 nonetheless if compared between times of experience on board we observe that adaptability level is increased to more experience on board except for ship motion parameter where the adaptability level remains almost constant for all the groups this output could be conditioned to the type of vessel and environmental conditions where the respondents performed their duties table 3 shows the data obtained to evaluate the sdfs effects through physical and mental stressors this results were extracted of the specific questions about the sdfs broadly in accordance with the results obtained we could say that sleeping problems has been the main trouble related with the sdf effects on crew performance difficulty falling asleep and sleep disruption are marked by participants with the higher values it affects quality of rest which greatly contributes to fatigue irritability etc in relation to ship motion and its typical effects such as seasickness and mii the study distinguished between four types of vessels containerships tankers bulk carrier and ropax ships this is explained by the fact that for example the motions a ropax experiences in a certain seaway is fundamentally different compared to a tanker ship as motions and behavior in a seaway depend highly on the hull form thus ship motion is strongly related with the deadweight hull forms length draught freeboard etc while noise and vibrations on board depend on propulsion engine sound isolation size of the vessel accommodation location vessel age and condition etc in this context our results shown that mis and mii on containerships is greater than the rest of the ships 4 2 description and quantification of the nodes related with sdfs for the bn in the following the new nodes incorporated to the grounding and collision models are briefly described this particular set of nodes is adopted from montewka et al 2017 2015 2014 and the literature review of sdf effects on human performance on this basis the ship motions noise and whole body vibrations having effects on human performance by two paths the sdfs effects could be presented on one hand as stressors acting on personal conditions and people s attention management system e g noise can reduce the cognitive resources affecting to the attention and on the other hand as physical effects acting directly on performance e g motion induced interruptions can degrade the physical ability by interrupting the task the new nodes incorporated to the bn models performed by det norske veritas 2003 2006 are as follow noise the node describes the officer on watch oow will be affected by mental stress caused by noise effects diffuse motion the node describes the oow will be affected by mental stress caused by ship motion diffuse vibration the node describes the oow will be affected by mental stress caused by wbv acute motion the node describes the oow will be affected by ship motion induced interruptions physical stress acute vibration the node describes the oow will be affected by physical stress caused by wbv sdf stressor mental stressor the node joins the nodes noise diffuse vibration and diffuse motion and describes whether the oow has influenced by these factors this node is included in order to gather the nodes noise diffuse vibration and diffuse motion in one node the node has only logical probability input i e probabilities are either 1 or 0 sdf physical effect physical effect the node joins the nodes acute vibration and acute motion and describes whether the oow has influenced by these factors this node is made in order to gather the nodes acute vibration and acute motion in one node the node has only logical probability input i e probabilities are either 1 or 0 once obtained the values for each new node the distribution of the probabilities was calculated and introduced in the bn two stages are defined for each node where 1 affect and 0 not affect for example the value of the noise node obtained of the quantification process of the questionnaire was 2 19 corresponding to the average of all effects in this way 1 0 2 33 3 67 and 4 100 of probabilities it means that conditional probability to noise node will be 40 for affect stage affect and 60 for the no affect stage i e 0 40 between 0 and 1 where 0 is no affect and 1 is affect table 4 and fig 3 show the conditional probabilities used for each node in the bn in order to validate our results table 5 shows a comparative between our results and the results of the faros project faros 2016 montewka et al 2017 to both sdf stressor and sdf physical effect nodes the results are very similar with the exception of the sdf physical effect for tankers it is important to emphasize that we distinguish between two ships type while faros obtain its result to a generic ship our results are in accordance with the assumption that the movement in a tanker ship will be less than a container ship therefore the physical effect caused by motion is expected to be lesser 4 3 aggregation of the sdf variables into bn models in montewka 2017 a bn model was developed linking typical sdfs effects hence the sdf acting as stressors were linked with nodes related with human capabilities e g attention management capability node while sdf acting with physical effects were linked with nodes related with human behaviour e g maintenance task performance node on the other hand the bn models developed by dnv are not based on human reliability theory and therefore our set of nodes is a priori incompatible with the nodes presented by dnv to overcome this we considered that sdfs have effects on human performance via two paths 1 as stressors acting on personal conditions and attention 2 as physical effects acting directly on performance as an explanation the personal conditions node is described by dnv as the physical and mental condition of the oww i e if the officer is fit to perform his tasks as navigator it clearly appears that sdfs acting as mental stressor have a direct relation with this node for example noise may impair the capability of the officer due to insomnia similar considerations are made for diffuse motion and vibrations the attention node describes the level of the attention when the oww is performing their tasks at the bridge it is important noting that the attention node is son to the personal conditions node at the dnv model which includes the sdf stressor node however we decided to link the sdf stressor directly with attention node also as an example a motion induced seasickness may exert negative effects when the oow is keeping their guard on the bridge which should be modelled as that the sdf stressor affect directly both the officer s personal conditions and also the attention level necessary at the moment on which the officer takes a decision the performance node finally indicates the manner in which the oww carry out their tasks it appears clearly that sdfs acting as physical effects have a direct relation with this node since the ship motion as well as vibrations may decrease the physical task performance on a certain moment by for example shock impulses it is worth noting again that the personal conditions node is parent to the performance node 4 4 influence of the sdf variables in the risk models development the structure of the bn models are to a large extent based on models presented by det norske veritas 2003 2006 adapted to the casualties and ship types under consideration the structure models for groundings and collisions can be seen in appendix 2 figures a1 and a2 respectively the set of variables presented in each model has been classified with very few exceptions on the basis of the nature thereof in six major groups as follows 1 detection of the hazard factors 2 human factors 3 management factors 4 external assistant factors 5 consequences and 6 others e g give way variable in the bn leading collisions table a 1in appendix 2 includes all the variables as classified above for each variable a number of states is assigned in addition each node is assigned a conditional probability table cpt which has been set manually the majority of nodes states and probability values are derived from dnv 2003 dnv 2006 hänninen and kujala 2012 however a limited number of certain variables are based on or adjusted on the basis of expert judgment as detailed in table a1 in relation to the human factor nodes and more specifically the nodes related to sdfs we consider that the sdf stressor node has a relationship with the personal conditions and attention nodes whereas the sdf physical node has to be linked to the performance node of our bn the cpts of these variables have been tailored through experts judgment and logical adaptation from the previous studies dnv 2003 2006 the main assumptions made are the following personal conditions this node describes the physical and mental conditions of the oww i e if the officer is fit to perform his tasks as navigator the node stages are fit unfit and not able to perform also the node is dependent on the nodes stress level tired incapacitated and sdf stressors it assumes that the oow is 100 fit if he is capable i e not incapacitated has standard stress level is not tired and the sdf stressor is not present however when the sdf stressor node is present i e active the fitness stage will be reduced by 20 in addition if he is tired or has high stress level the fitness is reduced by 10 see table a2 attention this node describes level of the attention when the oww is performing his tasks the node stages are high attention low attention and not able to pay attention also the node is dependent on the nodes distraction level personal condition bridge design brm and sdf stressors it assumes that when the sdf stressor is present and the oow is fit the low attention stage will be increase by 5 if the oow is unfit the low attention will be increased by 10 see table a3 performance the node indicates the manner in which the oww carry out their tasks the node stages are excellent standard and poor also the node is dependent on the nodes competence personal condition bridge design and sdf physical effect it assumes that when the oow has fit stage and the sdf physical effects are present the performance will be 50 poor if he is unfit the performance will be 100 poor see table a4 on this basis the main results obtained for the grounding and collision bn models are the followings table 6 tanker ship the probability of grounding i e the oow loss of control and like consequence the grounding occurs is 1 05e 04 an absolute value in addition the probability of fatalities occur is 2 30e 08 if the sdf nodes are not active the probabilities will decrease respectively to 7 57e 05 and 1 65e 08 the collision probability is 1 15e 05 the probability of fatalities occur is 9 35e 09 if the sdf nodes are not active the probability will decrease respectively to 1 01e 05 and 8 25e 09 container ship the probability of grounding is 1 26e 04 the probability of fatalities occur is 7 25e 08 if the sdf nodes are not active the probabilities will decrease respectively to 9 09e 05 and 5 20e 08 the probability of collision is 1 16e 05 the probability of fatalities occur is 9 59e 09 if the sdf nodes are not active the probabilities will decrease respectively to 1 01e 05 and 8 31e 09 our results are in good agreement with the literature the most popular and used causation probabilities are based on fujii et al 1984 where the collision causation probability for crossing and meeting ships are 1 3e 04 and 4 9e 05 respectively to grounding the causation probabilities are established between 8 0e 05 and 5 0e 04 finally even though the presence of the variables related with the sdfs exert scarce influence on the final results of grounding and collision probabilities our study reveals the negative effects that noise vibrations and ship motion have on the two accident categories examined collision and grounding 5 discussion and validation of the results this section discusses the results of a validation exercise applied to the models namely data questionnaire and bn models and assesses the strength of evidence found 5 1 data questionaries once all the items of the questionnaire were analyzed it is observed that the only item that presents problems of normality is noise present in the engine room it can be said that this item presents an almost unique and consistent response around the maximum that is all participants agree that the noise in the engine room is excessive so that the item is described and excluded from the parametric analysis with the rest of the items we can proceed to the parametric type analysis the total scales for noise effects of noise vibration effects of vibrations movement effects of movement and the total scale of adaptability to these factors are defined due to the differences in the number of items we will use the standardized scores of the same the direct scores on the scales appear in table 7 the unifactorial anova does not find statistically significant differences in the scales depending on the position performed on board nor are significant differences found based on age or depending on the time of experience the total reliability of the scale has an excellent internal consistency value cronbach s alpha of α 0 958 all the items presenting correlations with the scale 0 40 except for the item that assesses the noise in the engine room whose correlation with the scale is r 0 020 this is because this item presents a consistent response around the maximum in all individuals so it must be excluded from the analysis once the item is eliminated the alpha is α 0 959 5 2 bayesian network models the developed models are an extension based on models presented by det norske veritas adapted to the casualties and ship types under consideration for this reason the results are in good agreement with the previous literature although the study shows that the presence of the variables related with the sdfs exert scarce influence on the final results of grounding and collision probabilities however reveals the negative effects that noise vibrations and ship motion exert on the human factor reinforcing in this way what has already been studied by the faros project while in the faros project the states for the input variables of ship motion noise and vibration were derived from the literature around thresholds of effect in the presents study the inputs were quantified through a questionnaire developed to extract the experience of the seafarers in relation with these variables nonetheless the results of both studies show good agreement in addition an influence test and sensitive analysis carried out to assessment the parameters of the models providing a valuable tool for screening the models for important variables 5 2 1 influence test to evaluate the influence that the new variables introduced into risk models exert on human performance an influence test was carried out table 8 shows the conditional probabilities of the nodes directly influenced by the sdf variables the different stages to each node as well as its values are presented in the best and worst scenarios i e when sdf variables are inactive or totally active the test results indicate that the major difference is located to the performance node where the oow performance will be substantially reduced with the sdfs are active this node indicates the manner which the oww carry out their tasks and it is dependent on the personal condition and sdf physical effect nodes among others during the expert s judgment our study assumed that when the oow has a fit stage and the sdf physical effects are active the performance would be 50 poor based on it we can understand why these differences are so high and therefore the strength of evidence in this data would be moderate 5 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is technique that can help validate the probability parameters of a bayesian network this is done by investigating the effect of small changes in numerical parameters i e probabilities on the output parameters genie modeller used to model the bn implements an algorithm proposed by kjærulff and van der gaag 2000 that performs simple sensitive analysis based on the findings from the analysis into our models the following can be concluded to collision parameter the model is low sensitive to steering failure and very low sensitive to give way variables to grounding parameter the model is highly sensitive to steering failure in addition model is moderate sensitive to action assessment and incapacity variables the remaining variables in both models have very low sensitive values to end result it means fatalities variable for both collision and grounding models the analysis shows a value 0 as maximum sensitivity concluding that the models present a very low sensitive so it is shown that the typical variables related to the sdfs that is personal conditions attention and performance present very little sensitivity for the end result i e grounding or collision therefore the assumptions proposed to give conditional probabilities could be valid in addition for this set of variables the parameter which presents the maximum sensitive value is incapacity node nevertheless to performance node the acute motion and acute vibration i e sdf physical presents moderate values of sensitive it is in agreement with the earlier mentioned during the influence test therefore the strength of evidence in this data would be moderate 6 conclusions in this paper we presented research findings on the influence and quantification of the relationship of typical collision and grounding risk factors with ship design parameters as affected by the human element we developed a detailed questionnaire to capture the experience of crew members and presented the analysis of the results the findings of the questionnaire were statistically tested and validated by t test unifactorial anova and cronbach s alpha presenting excellent correlation and statistical inference these results were then incorporated into human reliability based risk models the study reveals the negative effects that noise vibrations and ship motion exert on the human factor reinforcing earlier research findings one major finding is that sleeping problems is ranked high among the crew members in relation to ship design factors sdfs affecting quality of rest which in turn greatly contributes to fatigue irritability and the other factors considered which then contribute to increased probabilities of collision and grounding to calculate the probabilities of collision and grounding is necessary to know the so called causation probability value which estimates the probability of failing an evasive manoeuvre to avoid an accident in this paper we presented the framework for modelling the causation probability for collision and grounding using bayesian network technique the bayesian networks have been enhanced with the incorporation of the variables related with sdfs and its relations with the human performance the results are found in good agreement with existing literature further contributing in quantifying the effect of ship design factors on human performance depending on service and

22737,the hybrid foundation of combining a friction wheel with a monopile is an innovative solution for offshore structures subjected to large lateral moment loading in this paper the lateral moment response of the monopile friction wheel foundation in saturated sand are investigated via centrifuge tests and three dimensional finite element method fem a series of tests on the monopile hybrid foundations with wheels of different diameters and thicknesses and single wheel foundation were conducted the results show that the lateral bearing capacity and stiffness improve significantly by adding a wheel to monopile and the improvement follows the diameter or thickness of the wheel an extensive experimental research regarding to the influential factors such as the embedment of the wheel and the vertical load is also presented by means of fem the load transfer mechanism interaction between the foundation and soil and the bending moment in the pile are illustrated to study how the wheel contributes to the performance of the foundation system moreover the effects of load eccentricity and vertical load are investigated by fe analyses keywords offshore wind turbine monopile friction wheel foundation centrifuge modelling fem lateral bearing capacity 1 introduction wind energy is one of the most promising types of renewable energy resources due to its advantages of wide distribution low environment impact efficiency and less water consumption etc wang et al 2018b among the wind energy resources offshore wind power s contribution in terms of electricity potential is higher since the wind is much stronger and steadier off the coasts li and yu 2015 the growing significance of wind energy stimulated the studies of foundations for offshore wind turbines owts monopiles have historically been the dominant substructure due to the economical manufacture and mature installation technique with 9840 mw installed as of december 31 2016 or an 80 market share musial et al 2017 to date the trend is to build owts in deeper water depths since there is less obstructions impeding the wind speed in the sea farther off the land meanwhile larger wind turbines with higher output per structure are preferred to use globally the average nameplate capacity of turbines installed in 2016 was 4 7 mw a 14 increase from 2015 musial et al 2017 the severe environmental conditions in deeper water and growing capacity of turbines lead to more challenges in the design of substructures for owts simply increasing the length or diameter of the monopile may not be economical or practical for the new generation of owts thus a new hybrid foundation which combines a friction wheel to a monopile has been put forward fig 1 and the preliminary examinations demonstrate a promising improvement in both bearing capacity and stiffness under lateral loading wang et al 2018a the monopile in conjunction with a friction wheel is analogous to a retaining wall with a stabilizing base in which the base provides a resisting lateral load and moment from the bearing pressure generated under the base carder et al 1999 powrie and chandler 1998 powrie and chandler 1998 indicated that the optimal length of the stabilizing base must be at least approximately 50 of the walls embedment depth the monopile friction wheel foundation is also similar to a pile with pile caps and the effects of pile caps have been widely investigated kim et al 1979 mokwa and duncan 2001 rollins and cole 2006 mokwa and duncan 2001 concluded that the pile caps provided significant resistance approximately 50 of the overall lateral capacity in field tests rollins and cole 2006 conducted several full scale cyclic lateral load tests to explore the influence of the pile cap on the performance of group piles the results proved the benefit of pile cap due to the considerable contribution of passive resistance on the pile cap and pointed out the passive resistances degraded significantly under cyclic loading for deflections greater than 0 5 of the pile cap height the concept of incorporating a bearing plate at the mudline of pile foundations to resist lateral loads have been discussed by some researchers and valuable conclusions have been drawn arshi and stone arshi and stone 2012 arshi et al 2015 stone et al 2007 performed several 1 g tests centrifuge tests and 3 d numerical modellings on piled footings to examine the performance the hybrid system the effects of system geometry the connection type between the pile and circular footing and the load eccentricity are explored via tests the vertical capacity of the hybrid system was found to be equal or slightly greater than the sum of the individual component pile and footing in freestanding condition the lateral loading capacity and stiffness were enhanced substantially and significantly influenced by the initial contact stress between the footing and the soil lehane et al reported several centrifuge tests and supporting fe analyses of piled footing subjected to lateral loadings in kaolin clay and sand lehane et al 2010 2014 the pile in the centrifuge tests corresponded to a long pipe pile with a l d l is the embedment length and d is the diameter of pile ratio about 10 the performance of the piled footing in clay did not indicate much improvement since the clay was soft and the surcharge from the gravity of footing would not enhance lateral bearing capacity of the pile moreover the footing was relatively small compared to the pile d d 3 5 d is the diameter of wheel and the lateral resistance of footing in clay was insignificant the research of piled footing d d 5 3 extended to sand demonstrated considerable enhancements in stiffness and bearing capacity compared with individual pile in sand in the tests the capacities of the piled foundations were controlled by the bending capacities of the structures the footing produced a significant reduction in bending moment along the pile thus increase the lateral loading capacity el marassi 2011 focused on the behavior of the monopile footing foundation under combined loading by means of finite element method the failure envelopes of the hybrid foundation in vertical lateral and resultant moment were depicted according to the numerical results the ratio of pile length to footing width affected the performance significantly wang et al studied the responses of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation under static loading and cyclic loading by centrifuge tests wang et al 2018a 2018c two types of friction wheels including the solid wheel and gravel wheel were tested both the static and cyclic bearing capacities increased for the hybrid system compared with the monopile and the solid wheel exhibited a better response analytical methods were used to estimate the lateral bearing capacity under static loading and degradation parameters were recommended based on the tests results to predict the accumulated lateral displacement in service conditions the effectiveness of the monopile friction wheel foundation in increasing the lateral stiffness and capacity has been proven by previous studies however only a small amount of literature was published the benefits of adding a friction wheel to a short rigid pile and the parametric studies on foundation geometry and influential factors by centrifuge modelling are merely reported the interaction between the foundation and surrounding soil and the mechanism of the load transfer have not been fully clarified in this paper a group of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the response of innovative hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations subjected to lateral moment loading in saturated sand a set of tests regarding to the diameter and thickness of the wheel was conducted several tests considering the influential factors such as the embedment of the wheel and the vertical load were presented additionally the load transfer mechanism interaction between the foundation and soil and the bending moment in the pile are illustrated by fe analyses which have been compared with the results of centrifuge tests for validation for a clearer understanding of the contribution of the wheel to the hybrid system 2 centrifuge testing program centrifuge modelling is a valuable tool for studying the complex problems related to soils such as soil structure interaction earthquake induced liquefaction etc due to the one to one scaling of stress and strain the centrifuge tests in this paper were performed on the 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge at case western reserve university figueroa et al 1998 the centrifuge is spun to 50 g before applying loads which represents a scaling factor equal to 50 for data interpretations the photo of the testing package and the schematic cross sectional view of the centrifuge model are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 2 1 test set up tests are conducted in a rigid container with internal dimensions of 53 3 cm length 24 1 cm width 17 7 cm height which is 26 65 m length 12 05 m width 8 85 m height in prototype scale all data in the following sections are reported in prototype scale unless otherwise specified three types of foundations monopile monopile friction wheel foundation and single wheel foundation are tested as shown in fig 4 all the foundation models are made of aluminum with a unit weight of 26 5 kn m3 the pile is modelled by a solid circular bar with a diameter of 1 11 m length of 8 5 m and embedment length of 5 25 m in the tests the wheel is a central perforated disc and the center hole is fabricated as the same size of the diameter of the pile to avoid obvious gap between the pile and wheel when the pile is threaded through the wheel as shown in fig 4 sliding is allowed between the pile and wheel various dimensions of wheels are made to explore the effects of the diameter and thickness of the wheel on the performance of the hybrid foundation for the single wheel foundation a bushing is used to fix the wheel on the transient part which is a short circular bar with a diameter 1 1 m and length 3 3 m as shown in fig 4 the details of the foundation models and their designations are listed in table 1 the uppercase letters d an l are the diameter and thickness of the wheel the lowercase letters d and l denote the diameter and embedment length of the pile in the tests all the foundations are configured with the same upper structure shown in fig 4 the wind tower is modelled by a steel rod with a weight of 139 kn and a diameter of 0 5 m and length of 13 m the wind turbine is simplified as a lumped mass with a weight of 98 kn to provide vertical load to the foundation soil samples were constructed by toyoura sand the toyoura sand is a typical clean sand with a mean particle size of 0 17 mm specific gravity of 2 65 g cm3 and void ratio ranges from 0 6 to 0 98 air pluviation method is employed in the preparation dry sand is firstly poured into the test container in a certain height then de aired water flows in from the bottom of the container with a vacuum for at least 24 h for saturation wang et al 2018a the height of the soil deposit is controlled as 7 85 m in each test to maintain the consistency of soil conditions the saturated density is obtained from the measured soil mass and volume the relative density of the soil is calculated as 30 from the density of the soil and parameters of toyoura sand mentioned above the soil sample can be classified as loose sand direct shear tests were carried out to determine the internal friction angle of the sample yang et al 2017 all the properties of the soil sample are listed in table 2 lateral loads are applied at 4 7 m above the ground surface by an actuator seen in figs 2 and 3 the actuator is set to be controlled by the input load data a clip is used to provide roller support at the load point which means lateral load without moment can be exerted on the load point deflections are measured and recorded using a lvdt linear variable differential transformer attached to the clip and the loads can be recorded by the load cell during the loading process 2 2 test procedures the pile was pushed by hand into the soil to its desired penetration depth of 5 25 m under 1 g gravitational level the wheel was then slid along the pile down to the soil surface and contacted with the soil surface firmly after the centrifuge was spun to 50 g lateral load was applied linearly in 125s prototype scale for most of the tests all the tests and their descriptions are listed in table 3 the loading rate in test 3 8 and 9 were adjusted by changing the scan rate of the input load data to examine the effect of the vertical load on performance of the hybrid foundation extra steel disks were placed at the mid height of the tower to offer a higher vertical load as described in test 10 and 11 test 12 examined the benefit of the pre embedment of the wheel in test 12 after threading the wheel to the pile the wheel was slowly rotated by hand and pressed into the soil to a depth 0 48 m of half the wheel thickness test 13 studied the influence of friction coefficient between the pile and wheel the interface of the pile and wheel was greased by motor oil in this test 3 centrifuge tests results the lateral load displacement curves of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m under different loading rates are displayed in fig 5 the loads and displacements are related to the load position which is 4 7 m above the ground level the curves are similar especially in the beginning part which means the loading rate has little effect on the bearing capacity of hybrid foundation in the sand deposit of the tests the results are reasonable since the soil permeability in prototype is 50 times that of the toyoura sand in tests the excess pore water pressure during the loading may dissipate quickly at these loading rates the conclusion is consistent with that in the research of wang et al 2017 where the soil conditions are similar and it was stated that no obvious increases of pore water pressure were recorded by the pore water pressure transducers consequently the loading time of 125s is selected for the tests in the subsequent paragraphs fig 6 depicts the load displacement curves of monopile friction wheel foundations with different wheel diameters as well as the monopile foundation considerable enhancement of lateral loading resistance can be observed for the hybrid foundations when compared with the monopile the larger the diameter of the wheel the higher the lateral loading resistance to assess the bearing capacity quantitatively two methods are adopted here to determine the bearing capacity of each foundation in method one the significant changing point of the load displacement curve is defined as the ultimate bearing state as shown in fig 6 if the turning point is difficult to identify the curve is fitted as three lines and the first turnoff point is corresponding to the critical lateral capacity and the second turnoff point is the ultimate lateral capacity graham et al 1982 in method two failure load was taken as the load in a displacement of 10 of the pile diameter peng et al 2010 which is 0 111 m in the present study the bearing capacities of the foundations and their improvements the bearing capacity of monopile is selected as the benchmark are listed in table 4 the stiffness of the hybrid foundations and monopoles are similar at the initial point fig 6 it may be because the clip used in the loading system is not firmly attached to the tower in order to reduce the friction in vertical direction so that all vertical loads from the upper structure are transmitted to the foundation this configuration may interfere the initial stiffness revealed in the load displacement curves since there may be some tiny gaps between the clip and tower however the slope of the load displacement curves quickly differentiates after the initial point and it is apparent that the stiffness improves when the pile is in conjunction with a wheel the secant stiffness displacement relationships are plotted in fig 7 the stiffness increases with the increase of wheel diameter the enhancement in stiffness is very beneficial for offshore wind turbines as the height of the turbines are relatively high compared with other offshore structures and the allowable deflection of the wind tower is much stricter the post test photographs of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m are displayed in fig 8 after the lateral loading the wheel rotates into the soil along with translation resulting in a soil heave in front of the wheel and separation of the rear part of the wheel from the soil underneath as identified in the previous studies pedram 2015 the embedment of the front wheel will help to withstand the lateral resistance some trivial cracks can be observed in the soil heave in fig 8 due to the squeeze of the wheel because of the uplift of the rear part of the wheel the shear stress occurs under only part of the wheel to resist the later load fig 9 and fig 10 show a set of load displacement curves and stiffness displacement curves for the hybrid foundations with different wheel thicknesses it can be seen that the initial stiffness is larger when a thicker wheel is combined to the pile one interesting thing is that for the hybrid foundation with a thinner wheel l 0 48 m the lateral load resistance is smaller at a small deflection however the load resistance increases continuously with the deflection and reaches the level of the foundation with a thicker wheel l 0 95 m one possible explanation is that the front part of the thinner wheel may embeds into the soil totally during the rotation which leads to a better resistance to lateral loading due to the involvement of the upper face of the front wheel the bearing capacity is defined as the load at a displacement of 0 1d since it is more conservative marked in fig 9 the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations with wheel thickness of 0 48 m 0 95 m and 1 6 m are 248 kn 338 kn and 480 kn the improvements compared with the monopile 136 kn are 82 144 and 253 respectively the lateral loading capacity of the hybrid foundation is generally not a simple algebraic sum of the separate capacity of the wheel and pile in freestanding state akinmusuru 1980 wang et al 2018a the lateral loading test of a single wheel foundation was also conducted and the comparison of the hybrid foundation single wheel monopile foundation and the sum capacity of the two individual foundations are plotted in fig 11 in the present tests the lateral loading resistance of the hybrid system is lower than the sum of the capacity of monopile and single wheel foundation the post test photo of the single wheel foundation is shown in fig 12 it seems the dominant motion pattern of the single wheel is sliding which is different from that in the hybrid system the soil heave is almost invisible in front of the wheel no obvious separation between the wheel and soil can be observed thus the shear stress can generate in the whole underside of the wheel to resist the lateral loads fig 13 presents the effects of vertical loads on the lateral response of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m the lateral resistance grows when the weight of upper structure rises to 404 kn nevertheless the lateral resistance at large deflection declines when the upper weight increases to 572 kn one possible cause is that the additional vertical load will result in an overturning moment with the deflection of the tower since the extra load is added on the middle point of the tower the lateral resistance at small deflection increases with the increase of vertical load and the lateral bearing capacity at 0 1d rises slightly with the addition of the vertical load as shown in fig 13 the increase is not that significant because the wheel is not fixed on the pile thus the extra weight will not increase the initial pressure under the wheel significantly the response of hybrid foundation with a pre embedment of the wheel is presented in fig 14 as discussed previously if the wheel is embedded to some extent lateral loads may also be resisted by the soil in front of the wheel in fig 14 the lateral resistance with a pre embedment indeed improves at large deflection whereas it is lower at small deflection one possibility is that as the wheel was rotated by hand to press in the soil during the installation this disturbed and loosen the shallow surrounding soil and decreased the lateral resistance at the beginning of loading the post test photo is shown in fig 15 a larger area of soil bulges and obvious cracks occurs in the soil heave which means the soil in front of the wheel plays a greater role to withstand the lateral load fig 16 plots the results of the hybrid foundation with a greased interface of the wheel and pile the smoothen of the pile wheel interface leads to a marginal effect slight improvement at large deflections compared with the original configuration the phenomena is consistent with the conclusion in previous studies in which the hybrid foundation system tends to be more effective if vertical movements are allowed at the pile footing connection arshi et al 2013 the lateral resistance at small deflections decreases with the grease since the lubrication will reduce the portion of the vertical load undertaken by the wheel resulting in a lower bearing pressure underneath the wheel 4 finite element analyses 4 1 finite element models it is assumed that the installation process has a negligible effect on the bearing behavior of the foundations the pile is modelled wished in place and small strain finite element ssfe analyses are utilized zhang et al 2011 fe models including the pile foundation and monopile friction wheel foundations with wheel diameter of 3 175 m 5 m 7 m and thickness 0 95 m are built in the prototype scale of the centrifuge tests using commercial software abaqus hibbit 2007 the geometry of the soil is equivalent to the soil in tests to duplicate the boundary conditions typical fe model and meshes are shown in fig 17 relatively fine meshes are adopted around the foundation while coarser mesh sizes are employed in the soil away from the foundation to reduce the computer resources needed three dimensional 8 node 6 degrees of freedom per node linear brick elements c3d8r with reduced integration are used in the models according to the boundary conditions in the tests movements in all degrees of freedom are restricted on the base of the soil block and only vertical motion is permitted on the side of the soil block the interactions in the pile wheel wheel soil and pile soil interfaces are simulated using normal hard contact model with coulomb s tangent friction separation is allowed during the loading to mimic the realistic contact behavior the friction coefficient of the aluminum and soil was measured to be 0 4 using a modified direct shear apparatus yang et al 2017 and the friction coefficient between the pile and wheel is set as 1 davis 1997 the pile wheel and upper structures are modelled as elastic perfectly plastic materials based on their material properties listed in table 5 the soil is simulated in an elastic plastic model governed by the mohr coulomb criteria as mentioned in the test section the internal friction angle φ was measured as 33 7 for sand the angle of internal friction from direct shear test is usually higher than that obtained from the simple shear test and triaxial test wu 2006 an internal friction angle of 31 is selected referring to the discussion of chakraborty et al chakraborty and salgado 2010 the dilation angle is 5 for loose sand vermeer and de borst 1984 the young s modulus e is equal to the unloading reloading modulus of soils e ur the accepted variation of soil modulus with depth that given by schanz and vermeer 1998 and vermeer 2001 is considered e 50 p r e f 150 σ x p r e f a n d e u r 4 e 50 where e 50 symbolizes the secant stiffness at 50 stress level at the associated confining pressure p ref is a reference pressure equal to 100 kpa σ x is the horizontal pressure at a certain depth here σ x k 0 γ z k 0 is the coefficient of earth pressure at rest and k 0 1 sin φ is used the soil properties are summarized in table 6 in each fe calculation loads are applied in three steps initially gravity is applied to the soil as a body force to establish geostatic stresses and the lateral earth pressure at rest is calculated by the recommended formula k 0 1 sin φ stress balance is undertaken to avoid deformation of soil under gravity next gravities are applied on structures and foundations finally horizontal load and resultant moment are applied by displacement control method a lateral displacement is applied linearly on the load point which is 4 7 m above ground level the corresponding load is recorded from the reaction force at the load point 4 2 validation of the fem the load displacement curves of different foundations from fe analysis are compared with those of the centrifuge tests as seen in fig 18 the responses fit well and the general trends are similar the stiffness and lateral loading resistance both enhances with the addition of the wheels one dissimilarity is that for the hybrid foundation with a larger wheel diameter especially for d 7 m the lateral load resistance develops quickly and reaches the maximum in small deflection and then declines slightly while in the fem no decrease exhibits it is probably due to that the embedment of the wheel induced by the rotation may play a greater role in the lateral resistance especially for wheels with larger diameter and this enhancement undermines when the soil heave is squeezed and ruptured at a larger defection whereas the embedment behavior cannot be simulated actually since the soil elements under the wheel cannot spilt for offshore wind turbine the serviceability constraints of the turbine lead to a strict limited rotation angle of the wind tower which in recommended as 0 5 kuo et al 2009 therefore the lateral operating capacities at a rotation angle of 0 5 are extracted from fe results and compared with the corresponding loads from the centrifuge tests as listed in table 7 the lateral bearing capacity with a deflection of 0 1d are also listed in table 7 4 3 boundary effects the dimension of soil sample 26 6 m 12 0 m 8 85 m in the test is restricted by the size of the strongbox which may result in boundary effects therefore two supplementary boundary conditions are imposed on the hybrid model d 5 m l 0 95 m in boundary condition 1 the soil block is created as a cylinder with a diameter 40 m 8d and depth equal to the test 7 85 m in boundary condition 2 the soil is modelled as a cylinder with a diameter 40 m 8d and depth 21 m 4l to minimize the boundary effect the comparisons are plotted in fig 19 it is clear that the constraint of the strongbox has little effect on the initial stiffness the ultimate capacity rises approximately 10 in the boundary condition with the strongbox and the increase is mainly due to the constriction in the depth 4 4 load transfer mechanism the fem offers a possibility to explore how the different components in the hybrid system interact with each other and contributes to the total capacity of the hybrid system the load resistance and sharing factor of the pile and wheel in the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m are shown in figs 20 and 21 the load resistance of the wheel grows rapidly and plateaus at a maximum value in a small deflection it can be concluded that the initial behavior of the hybrid system is controlled by the wheel component on the contrary the lateral load resistance provided by the pile increases slightly initially then the curve accelerates and continues rising with the development of deflection the sharing factor of the pile and wheel component are about 60 and 40 at the ultimate stage 4 5 stress distribution in the fe results the stresses in the structures do not exceed the yielding point indicating that the bearing capacity of the system is governed by the shear strength of the soil the contact earth pressure as well as the lateral deflection along the pile in both the hybrid system and the monopile foundation at the ultimate state 0 1d are depicted in fig 22 the main difference of the stress distribution appears in the part adjacent to the soil surface where the lateral earth pressure increases apparently while wheel is added due to the bearing pressure under the friction wheel in addition the deflection of the pile in the hybrid system is smaller than that in the monopile owing to the restraint of the wheel 4 6 bending moment the wheel provides a restraint moment at the pile head which will result in a pronounced reduction in the bending moment fig 23 presents the section bending moments of the tower and pile obtained from the fem in ultimate state 0 1d the ground level is set as coordinate 0 for the hybrid system the wheel decreases the bending moment at the pile head from 1264 knm to 761 knm when the ultimate state of the hybrid foundation 338 kn is approached which accounts for a reduction of 40 of the bending moment induced by the lateral load the bending moments in the hybrid system at a vertical load of 136 kn is significant lower than that of the monopile owing to the moment and shear force provided by the wheel in the ultimate state of both the monopile 136 kn and hybrid foundation 338 kn the bending moments in the piles are similar demonstrating that the addition of the wheel can considerably increase the lateral loading capacity without raising the section bending moment in the pile this effect is advantageous as the structural capacity of the pile or tower dictates the maximum moment that can be resisted by the foundation in many offshore engineering practices 4 7 load eccentricity the effects of load eccentricity are investigated by fem the load eccentricity is defined as the distance from the load application point to the ground level fig 24 and fig 25 plot the moment rotation relationships of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m and monopile in various load eccentricities the moments are calculated with respect to the ground level the initial rotation stiffness of the hybrid foundation decreases with the increase of load eccentricity on the contrary the initial rotation stiffness generally increases with the increase of load eccentricity in the moment rotation curves of monopile the moment in serviceability limit state tower rotation angle 0 5 of the hybrid foundation and monopile with different lateral load eccentricities are listed in table 8 the relative improvements by the addition of the wheel declines when the load point elevates it can be concluded that the efficiency of the enhancement diminishes with the increase of the load eccentricity 4 8 vertical load the initial bearing pressure under the wheel from the gravity of the upper structures plays a significant role in the lateral performance of the hybrid system arshi 2016 to advantageously utilize the vertical load the wheel is fixed on the pile in the fe models called the coupled hybrid foundation to study the effect of vertical load on the lateral performance of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m the soil is modelled as large cylindrical block with a diameter 40 m 8d and height 21 m 4l to minimize the boundary effect in the computation the vertical load is applied to specified vertical elevation 4 7 m from ground level then a horizontal load is applied at the same point with the vertical load remains constant fig 26 presents lateral load displacement curves of the coupled hybrid foundation under different vertical loads the value of vertical load excludes the weight of the pile and wheel the lateral load resistance at large defection increases with the increase of vertical load when the vertical load does not exceed 4000 kn while the initial stiffness declines with the increase of vertical load the vertical load v at a settlement of 0 111 m 0 1d is 5092 kn which is selected as the reference value v r the relationship of the normalized lateral loading capacity and vertical load is plotted in fig 27 the lateral loading capacity h is determined by the load resistance at a deflection of 0 1d it is found that the maximum lateral loading capacity occurs when the vertical load is approximately half the vertical bearing capacity 0 1d and the maximum value is about 0 09 times the vertical bearing capacity of the hybrid system 5 conclusions the conclusions relate to the structural configuration where a solid friction wheel is combined with a short rigid pile and the shear strength of the soil governs the lateral bearing performance of the hybrid system 1 the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation shows a significant improvement in both lateral bearing capacity and stiffness over the monopile as shown in the results of centrifuge tests and supporting fe analyses in the tests the bearing capacity increases with the increase of the wheel diameter or thickness the vertical load from the gravity of upper structures helps to improve the lateral performance of the hybrid foundation however the improvement is limited in the present configuration where sliding is allowed between the pile and wheel due to the overturning moment induced by the vertical load when the tower is tilt in the lateral loading 2 in the tests of hybrid foundations the wheel in the hybrid system rotates into the ground with a soil heave in front of the wheel and a separation of the rear part of the wheel from the soil in the single wheel tests the dominant motion mode is sliding and no obvious soil heave is observed 3 the fem is proved to be capable of simulating the response of the hybrid foundation under lateral moment loading with the validation by centrifuge tests the fe analysis indicates that the lateral load is initially undertaken by the wheel component and the pile is involved more to resist the lateral load with the development of pile deflection the lateral earth pressure in front of the pile increases due to the bearing pressure generated underneath the front part of wheel results in a positive effect on the lateral resistance of pile the wheel also imparts an additional moment on the pile head which will considerably reduce the bending moment in the pile 4 according to the results of fe analyses the efficiency of adding a wheel to a pile diminishes with the increase of lateral load eccentricity the wheel is fixed to the pile in the fe models to advantageously utilize the vertical load it is shown that the maximum lateral bearing capacity occurs when the vertical load is about half of the vertical bearing capacity 
22737,the hybrid foundation of combining a friction wheel with a monopile is an innovative solution for offshore structures subjected to large lateral moment loading in this paper the lateral moment response of the monopile friction wheel foundation in saturated sand are investigated via centrifuge tests and three dimensional finite element method fem a series of tests on the monopile hybrid foundations with wheels of different diameters and thicknesses and single wheel foundation were conducted the results show that the lateral bearing capacity and stiffness improve significantly by adding a wheel to monopile and the improvement follows the diameter or thickness of the wheel an extensive experimental research regarding to the influential factors such as the embedment of the wheel and the vertical load is also presented by means of fem the load transfer mechanism interaction between the foundation and soil and the bending moment in the pile are illustrated to study how the wheel contributes to the performance of the foundation system moreover the effects of load eccentricity and vertical load are investigated by fe analyses keywords offshore wind turbine monopile friction wheel foundation centrifuge modelling fem lateral bearing capacity 1 introduction wind energy is one of the most promising types of renewable energy resources due to its advantages of wide distribution low environment impact efficiency and less water consumption etc wang et al 2018b among the wind energy resources offshore wind power s contribution in terms of electricity potential is higher since the wind is much stronger and steadier off the coasts li and yu 2015 the growing significance of wind energy stimulated the studies of foundations for offshore wind turbines owts monopiles have historically been the dominant substructure due to the economical manufacture and mature installation technique with 9840 mw installed as of december 31 2016 or an 80 market share musial et al 2017 to date the trend is to build owts in deeper water depths since there is less obstructions impeding the wind speed in the sea farther off the land meanwhile larger wind turbines with higher output per structure are preferred to use globally the average nameplate capacity of turbines installed in 2016 was 4 7 mw a 14 increase from 2015 musial et al 2017 the severe environmental conditions in deeper water and growing capacity of turbines lead to more challenges in the design of substructures for owts simply increasing the length or diameter of the monopile may not be economical or practical for the new generation of owts thus a new hybrid foundation which combines a friction wheel to a monopile has been put forward fig 1 and the preliminary examinations demonstrate a promising improvement in both bearing capacity and stiffness under lateral loading wang et al 2018a the monopile in conjunction with a friction wheel is analogous to a retaining wall with a stabilizing base in which the base provides a resisting lateral load and moment from the bearing pressure generated under the base carder et al 1999 powrie and chandler 1998 powrie and chandler 1998 indicated that the optimal length of the stabilizing base must be at least approximately 50 of the walls embedment depth the monopile friction wheel foundation is also similar to a pile with pile caps and the effects of pile caps have been widely investigated kim et al 1979 mokwa and duncan 2001 rollins and cole 2006 mokwa and duncan 2001 concluded that the pile caps provided significant resistance approximately 50 of the overall lateral capacity in field tests rollins and cole 2006 conducted several full scale cyclic lateral load tests to explore the influence of the pile cap on the performance of group piles the results proved the benefit of pile cap due to the considerable contribution of passive resistance on the pile cap and pointed out the passive resistances degraded significantly under cyclic loading for deflections greater than 0 5 of the pile cap height the concept of incorporating a bearing plate at the mudline of pile foundations to resist lateral loads have been discussed by some researchers and valuable conclusions have been drawn arshi and stone arshi and stone 2012 arshi et al 2015 stone et al 2007 performed several 1 g tests centrifuge tests and 3 d numerical modellings on piled footings to examine the performance the hybrid system the effects of system geometry the connection type between the pile and circular footing and the load eccentricity are explored via tests the vertical capacity of the hybrid system was found to be equal or slightly greater than the sum of the individual component pile and footing in freestanding condition the lateral loading capacity and stiffness were enhanced substantially and significantly influenced by the initial contact stress between the footing and the soil lehane et al reported several centrifuge tests and supporting fe analyses of piled footing subjected to lateral loadings in kaolin clay and sand lehane et al 2010 2014 the pile in the centrifuge tests corresponded to a long pipe pile with a l d l is the embedment length and d is the diameter of pile ratio about 10 the performance of the piled footing in clay did not indicate much improvement since the clay was soft and the surcharge from the gravity of footing would not enhance lateral bearing capacity of the pile moreover the footing was relatively small compared to the pile d d 3 5 d is the diameter of wheel and the lateral resistance of footing in clay was insignificant the research of piled footing d d 5 3 extended to sand demonstrated considerable enhancements in stiffness and bearing capacity compared with individual pile in sand in the tests the capacities of the piled foundations were controlled by the bending capacities of the structures the footing produced a significant reduction in bending moment along the pile thus increase the lateral loading capacity el marassi 2011 focused on the behavior of the monopile footing foundation under combined loading by means of finite element method the failure envelopes of the hybrid foundation in vertical lateral and resultant moment were depicted according to the numerical results the ratio of pile length to footing width affected the performance significantly wang et al studied the responses of the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation under static loading and cyclic loading by centrifuge tests wang et al 2018a 2018c two types of friction wheels including the solid wheel and gravel wheel were tested both the static and cyclic bearing capacities increased for the hybrid system compared with the monopile and the solid wheel exhibited a better response analytical methods were used to estimate the lateral bearing capacity under static loading and degradation parameters were recommended based on the tests results to predict the accumulated lateral displacement in service conditions the effectiveness of the monopile friction wheel foundation in increasing the lateral stiffness and capacity has been proven by previous studies however only a small amount of literature was published the benefits of adding a friction wheel to a short rigid pile and the parametric studies on foundation geometry and influential factors by centrifuge modelling are merely reported the interaction between the foundation and surrounding soil and the mechanism of the load transfer have not been fully clarified in this paper a group of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the response of innovative hybrid monopile friction wheel foundations subjected to lateral moment loading in saturated sand a set of tests regarding to the diameter and thickness of the wheel was conducted several tests considering the influential factors such as the embedment of the wheel and the vertical load were presented additionally the load transfer mechanism interaction between the foundation and soil and the bending moment in the pile are illustrated by fe analyses which have been compared with the results of centrifuge tests for validation for a clearer understanding of the contribution of the wheel to the hybrid system 2 centrifuge testing program centrifuge modelling is a valuable tool for studying the complex problems related to soils such as soil structure interaction earthquake induced liquefaction etc due to the one to one scaling of stress and strain the centrifuge tests in this paper were performed on the 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge at case western reserve university figueroa et al 1998 the centrifuge is spun to 50 g before applying loads which represents a scaling factor equal to 50 for data interpretations the photo of the testing package and the schematic cross sectional view of the centrifuge model are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 2 1 test set up tests are conducted in a rigid container with internal dimensions of 53 3 cm length 24 1 cm width 17 7 cm height which is 26 65 m length 12 05 m width 8 85 m height in prototype scale all data in the following sections are reported in prototype scale unless otherwise specified three types of foundations monopile monopile friction wheel foundation and single wheel foundation are tested as shown in fig 4 all the foundation models are made of aluminum with a unit weight of 26 5 kn m3 the pile is modelled by a solid circular bar with a diameter of 1 11 m length of 8 5 m and embedment length of 5 25 m in the tests the wheel is a central perforated disc and the center hole is fabricated as the same size of the diameter of the pile to avoid obvious gap between the pile and wheel when the pile is threaded through the wheel as shown in fig 4 sliding is allowed between the pile and wheel various dimensions of wheels are made to explore the effects of the diameter and thickness of the wheel on the performance of the hybrid foundation for the single wheel foundation a bushing is used to fix the wheel on the transient part which is a short circular bar with a diameter 1 1 m and length 3 3 m as shown in fig 4 the details of the foundation models and their designations are listed in table 1 the uppercase letters d an l are the diameter and thickness of the wheel the lowercase letters d and l denote the diameter and embedment length of the pile in the tests all the foundations are configured with the same upper structure shown in fig 4 the wind tower is modelled by a steel rod with a weight of 139 kn and a diameter of 0 5 m and length of 13 m the wind turbine is simplified as a lumped mass with a weight of 98 kn to provide vertical load to the foundation soil samples were constructed by toyoura sand the toyoura sand is a typical clean sand with a mean particle size of 0 17 mm specific gravity of 2 65 g cm3 and void ratio ranges from 0 6 to 0 98 air pluviation method is employed in the preparation dry sand is firstly poured into the test container in a certain height then de aired water flows in from the bottom of the container with a vacuum for at least 24 h for saturation wang et al 2018a the height of the soil deposit is controlled as 7 85 m in each test to maintain the consistency of soil conditions the saturated density is obtained from the measured soil mass and volume the relative density of the soil is calculated as 30 from the density of the soil and parameters of toyoura sand mentioned above the soil sample can be classified as loose sand direct shear tests were carried out to determine the internal friction angle of the sample yang et al 2017 all the properties of the soil sample are listed in table 2 lateral loads are applied at 4 7 m above the ground surface by an actuator seen in figs 2 and 3 the actuator is set to be controlled by the input load data a clip is used to provide roller support at the load point which means lateral load without moment can be exerted on the load point deflections are measured and recorded using a lvdt linear variable differential transformer attached to the clip and the loads can be recorded by the load cell during the loading process 2 2 test procedures the pile was pushed by hand into the soil to its desired penetration depth of 5 25 m under 1 g gravitational level the wheel was then slid along the pile down to the soil surface and contacted with the soil surface firmly after the centrifuge was spun to 50 g lateral load was applied linearly in 125s prototype scale for most of the tests all the tests and their descriptions are listed in table 3 the loading rate in test 3 8 and 9 were adjusted by changing the scan rate of the input load data to examine the effect of the vertical load on performance of the hybrid foundation extra steel disks were placed at the mid height of the tower to offer a higher vertical load as described in test 10 and 11 test 12 examined the benefit of the pre embedment of the wheel in test 12 after threading the wheel to the pile the wheel was slowly rotated by hand and pressed into the soil to a depth 0 48 m of half the wheel thickness test 13 studied the influence of friction coefficient between the pile and wheel the interface of the pile and wheel was greased by motor oil in this test 3 centrifuge tests results the lateral load displacement curves of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m under different loading rates are displayed in fig 5 the loads and displacements are related to the load position which is 4 7 m above the ground level the curves are similar especially in the beginning part which means the loading rate has little effect on the bearing capacity of hybrid foundation in the sand deposit of the tests the results are reasonable since the soil permeability in prototype is 50 times that of the toyoura sand in tests the excess pore water pressure during the loading may dissipate quickly at these loading rates the conclusion is consistent with that in the research of wang et al 2017 where the soil conditions are similar and it was stated that no obvious increases of pore water pressure were recorded by the pore water pressure transducers consequently the loading time of 125s is selected for the tests in the subsequent paragraphs fig 6 depicts the load displacement curves of monopile friction wheel foundations with different wheel diameters as well as the monopile foundation considerable enhancement of lateral loading resistance can be observed for the hybrid foundations when compared with the monopile the larger the diameter of the wheel the higher the lateral loading resistance to assess the bearing capacity quantitatively two methods are adopted here to determine the bearing capacity of each foundation in method one the significant changing point of the load displacement curve is defined as the ultimate bearing state as shown in fig 6 if the turning point is difficult to identify the curve is fitted as three lines and the first turnoff point is corresponding to the critical lateral capacity and the second turnoff point is the ultimate lateral capacity graham et al 1982 in method two failure load was taken as the load in a displacement of 10 of the pile diameter peng et al 2010 which is 0 111 m in the present study the bearing capacities of the foundations and their improvements the bearing capacity of monopile is selected as the benchmark are listed in table 4 the stiffness of the hybrid foundations and monopoles are similar at the initial point fig 6 it may be because the clip used in the loading system is not firmly attached to the tower in order to reduce the friction in vertical direction so that all vertical loads from the upper structure are transmitted to the foundation this configuration may interfere the initial stiffness revealed in the load displacement curves since there may be some tiny gaps between the clip and tower however the slope of the load displacement curves quickly differentiates after the initial point and it is apparent that the stiffness improves when the pile is in conjunction with a wheel the secant stiffness displacement relationships are plotted in fig 7 the stiffness increases with the increase of wheel diameter the enhancement in stiffness is very beneficial for offshore wind turbines as the height of the turbines are relatively high compared with other offshore structures and the allowable deflection of the wind tower is much stricter the post test photographs of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m are displayed in fig 8 after the lateral loading the wheel rotates into the soil along with translation resulting in a soil heave in front of the wheel and separation of the rear part of the wheel from the soil underneath as identified in the previous studies pedram 2015 the embedment of the front wheel will help to withstand the lateral resistance some trivial cracks can be observed in the soil heave in fig 8 due to the squeeze of the wheel because of the uplift of the rear part of the wheel the shear stress occurs under only part of the wheel to resist the later load fig 9 and fig 10 show a set of load displacement curves and stiffness displacement curves for the hybrid foundations with different wheel thicknesses it can be seen that the initial stiffness is larger when a thicker wheel is combined to the pile one interesting thing is that for the hybrid foundation with a thinner wheel l 0 48 m the lateral load resistance is smaller at a small deflection however the load resistance increases continuously with the deflection and reaches the level of the foundation with a thicker wheel l 0 95 m one possible explanation is that the front part of the thinner wheel may embeds into the soil totally during the rotation which leads to a better resistance to lateral loading due to the involvement of the upper face of the front wheel the bearing capacity is defined as the load at a displacement of 0 1d since it is more conservative marked in fig 9 the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundations with wheel thickness of 0 48 m 0 95 m and 1 6 m are 248 kn 338 kn and 480 kn the improvements compared with the monopile 136 kn are 82 144 and 253 respectively the lateral loading capacity of the hybrid foundation is generally not a simple algebraic sum of the separate capacity of the wheel and pile in freestanding state akinmusuru 1980 wang et al 2018a the lateral loading test of a single wheel foundation was also conducted and the comparison of the hybrid foundation single wheel monopile foundation and the sum capacity of the two individual foundations are plotted in fig 11 in the present tests the lateral loading resistance of the hybrid system is lower than the sum of the capacity of monopile and single wheel foundation the post test photo of the single wheel foundation is shown in fig 12 it seems the dominant motion pattern of the single wheel is sliding which is different from that in the hybrid system the soil heave is almost invisible in front of the wheel no obvious separation between the wheel and soil can be observed thus the shear stress can generate in the whole underside of the wheel to resist the lateral loads fig 13 presents the effects of vertical loads on the lateral response of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m the lateral resistance grows when the weight of upper structure rises to 404 kn nevertheless the lateral resistance at large deflection declines when the upper weight increases to 572 kn one possible cause is that the additional vertical load will result in an overturning moment with the deflection of the tower since the extra load is added on the middle point of the tower the lateral resistance at small deflection increases with the increase of vertical load and the lateral bearing capacity at 0 1d rises slightly with the addition of the vertical load as shown in fig 13 the increase is not that significant because the wheel is not fixed on the pile thus the extra weight will not increase the initial pressure under the wheel significantly the response of hybrid foundation with a pre embedment of the wheel is presented in fig 14 as discussed previously if the wheel is embedded to some extent lateral loads may also be resisted by the soil in front of the wheel in fig 14 the lateral resistance with a pre embedment indeed improves at large deflection whereas it is lower at small deflection one possibility is that as the wheel was rotated by hand to press in the soil during the installation this disturbed and loosen the shallow surrounding soil and decreased the lateral resistance at the beginning of loading the post test photo is shown in fig 15 a larger area of soil bulges and obvious cracks occurs in the soil heave which means the soil in front of the wheel plays a greater role to withstand the lateral load fig 16 plots the results of the hybrid foundation with a greased interface of the wheel and pile the smoothen of the pile wheel interface leads to a marginal effect slight improvement at large deflections compared with the original configuration the phenomena is consistent with the conclusion in previous studies in which the hybrid foundation system tends to be more effective if vertical movements are allowed at the pile footing connection arshi et al 2013 the lateral resistance at small deflections decreases with the grease since the lubrication will reduce the portion of the vertical load undertaken by the wheel resulting in a lower bearing pressure underneath the wheel 4 finite element analyses 4 1 finite element models it is assumed that the installation process has a negligible effect on the bearing behavior of the foundations the pile is modelled wished in place and small strain finite element ssfe analyses are utilized zhang et al 2011 fe models including the pile foundation and monopile friction wheel foundations with wheel diameter of 3 175 m 5 m 7 m and thickness 0 95 m are built in the prototype scale of the centrifuge tests using commercial software abaqus hibbit 2007 the geometry of the soil is equivalent to the soil in tests to duplicate the boundary conditions typical fe model and meshes are shown in fig 17 relatively fine meshes are adopted around the foundation while coarser mesh sizes are employed in the soil away from the foundation to reduce the computer resources needed three dimensional 8 node 6 degrees of freedom per node linear brick elements c3d8r with reduced integration are used in the models according to the boundary conditions in the tests movements in all degrees of freedom are restricted on the base of the soil block and only vertical motion is permitted on the side of the soil block the interactions in the pile wheel wheel soil and pile soil interfaces are simulated using normal hard contact model with coulomb s tangent friction separation is allowed during the loading to mimic the realistic contact behavior the friction coefficient of the aluminum and soil was measured to be 0 4 using a modified direct shear apparatus yang et al 2017 and the friction coefficient between the pile and wheel is set as 1 davis 1997 the pile wheel and upper structures are modelled as elastic perfectly plastic materials based on their material properties listed in table 5 the soil is simulated in an elastic plastic model governed by the mohr coulomb criteria as mentioned in the test section the internal friction angle φ was measured as 33 7 for sand the angle of internal friction from direct shear test is usually higher than that obtained from the simple shear test and triaxial test wu 2006 an internal friction angle of 31 is selected referring to the discussion of chakraborty et al chakraborty and salgado 2010 the dilation angle is 5 for loose sand vermeer and de borst 1984 the young s modulus e is equal to the unloading reloading modulus of soils e ur the accepted variation of soil modulus with depth that given by schanz and vermeer 1998 and vermeer 2001 is considered e 50 p r e f 150 σ x p r e f a n d e u r 4 e 50 where e 50 symbolizes the secant stiffness at 50 stress level at the associated confining pressure p ref is a reference pressure equal to 100 kpa σ x is the horizontal pressure at a certain depth here σ x k 0 γ z k 0 is the coefficient of earth pressure at rest and k 0 1 sin φ is used the soil properties are summarized in table 6 in each fe calculation loads are applied in three steps initially gravity is applied to the soil as a body force to establish geostatic stresses and the lateral earth pressure at rest is calculated by the recommended formula k 0 1 sin φ stress balance is undertaken to avoid deformation of soil under gravity next gravities are applied on structures and foundations finally horizontal load and resultant moment are applied by displacement control method a lateral displacement is applied linearly on the load point which is 4 7 m above ground level the corresponding load is recorded from the reaction force at the load point 4 2 validation of the fem the load displacement curves of different foundations from fe analysis are compared with those of the centrifuge tests as seen in fig 18 the responses fit well and the general trends are similar the stiffness and lateral loading resistance both enhances with the addition of the wheels one dissimilarity is that for the hybrid foundation with a larger wheel diameter especially for d 7 m the lateral load resistance develops quickly and reaches the maximum in small deflection and then declines slightly while in the fem no decrease exhibits it is probably due to that the embedment of the wheel induced by the rotation may play a greater role in the lateral resistance especially for wheels with larger diameter and this enhancement undermines when the soil heave is squeezed and ruptured at a larger defection whereas the embedment behavior cannot be simulated actually since the soil elements under the wheel cannot spilt for offshore wind turbine the serviceability constraints of the turbine lead to a strict limited rotation angle of the wind tower which in recommended as 0 5 kuo et al 2009 therefore the lateral operating capacities at a rotation angle of 0 5 are extracted from fe results and compared with the corresponding loads from the centrifuge tests as listed in table 7 the lateral bearing capacity with a deflection of 0 1d are also listed in table 7 4 3 boundary effects the dimension of soil sample 26 6 m 12 0 m 8 85 m in the test is restricted by the size of the strongbox which may result in boundary effects therefore two supplementary boundary conditions are imposed on the hybrid model d 5 m l 0 95 m in boundary condition 1 the soil block is created as a cylinder with a diameter 40 m 8d and depth equal to the test 7 85 m in boundary condition 2 the soil is modelled as a cylinder with a diameter 40 m 8d and depth 21 m 4l to minimize the boundary effect the comparisons are plotted in fig 19 it is clear that the constraint of the strongbox has little effect on the initial stiffness the ultimate capacity rises approximately 10 in the boundary condition with the strongbox and the increase is mainly due to the constriction in the depth 4 4 load transfer mechanism the fem offers a possibility to explore how the different components in the hybrid system interact with each other and contributes to the total capacity of the hybrid system the load resistance and sharing factor of the pile and wheel in the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m are shown in figs 20 and 21 the load resistance of the wheel grows rapidly and plateaus at a maximum value in a small deflection it can be concluded that the initial behavior of the hybrid system is controlled by the wheel component on the contrary the lateral load resistance provided by the pile increases slightly initially then the curve accelerates and continues rising with the development of deflection the sharing factor of the pile and wheel component are about 60 and 40 at the ultimate stage 4 5 stress distribution in the fe results the stresses in the structures do not exceed the yielding point indicating that the bearing capacity of the system is governed by the shear strength of the soil the contact earth pressure as well as the lateral deflection along the pile in both the hybrid system and the monopile foundation at the ultimate state 0 1d are depicted in fig 22 the main difference of the stress distribution appears in the part adjacent to the soil surface where the lateral earth pressure increases apparently while wheel is added due to the bearing pressure under the friction wheel in addition the deflection of the pile in the hybrid system is smaller than that in the monopile owing to the restraint of the wheel 4 6 bending moment the wheel provides a restraint moment at the pile head which will result in a pronounced reduction in the bending moment fig 23 presents the section bending moments of the tower and pile obtained from the fem in ultimate state 0 1d the ground level is set as coordinate 0 for the hybrid system the wheel decreases the bending moment at the pile head from 1264 knm to 761 knm when the ultimate state of the hybrid foundation 338 kn is approached which accounts for a reduction of 40 of the bending moment induced by the lateral load the bending moments in the hybrid system at a vertical load of 136 kn is significant lower than that of the monopile owing to the moment and shear force provided by the wheel in the ultimate state of both the monopile 136 kn and hybrid foundation 338 kn the bending moments in the piles are similar demonstrating that the addition of the wheel can considerably increase the lateral loading capacity without raising the section bending moment in the pile this effect is advantageous as the structural capacity of the pile or tower dictates the maximum moment that can be resisted by the foundation in many offshore engineering practices 4 7 load eccentricity the effects of load eccentricity are investigated by fem the load eccentricity is defined as the distance from the load application point to the ground level fig 24 and fig 25 plot the moment rotation relationships of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m and monopile in various load eccentricities the moments are calculated with respect to the ground level the initial rotation stiffness of the hybrid foundation decreases with the increase of load eccentricity on the contrary the initial rotation stiffness generally increases with the increase of load eccentricity in the moment rotation curves of monopile the moment in serviceability limit state tower rotation angle 0 5 of the hybrid foundation and monopile with different lateral load eccentricities are listed in table 8 the relative improvements by the addition of the wheel declines when the load point elevates it can be concluded that the efficiency of the enhancement diminishes with the increase of the load eccentricity 4 8 vertical load the initial bearing pressure under the wheel from the gravity of the upper structures plays a significant role in the lateral performance of the hybrid system arshi 2016 to advantageously utilize the vertical load the wheel is fixed on the pile in the fe models called the coupled hybrid foundation to study the effect of vertical load on the lateral performance of the hybrid foundation d 5 m l 0 95 m the soil is modelled as large cylindrical block with a diameter 40 m 8d and height 21 m 4l to minimize the boundary effect in the computation the vertical load is applied to specified vertical elevation 4 7 m from ground level then a horizontal load is applied at the same point with the vertical load remains constant fig 26 presents lateral load displacement curves of the coupled hybrid foundation under different vertical loads the value of vertical load excludes the weight of the pile and wheel the lateral load resistance at large defection increases with the increase of vertical load when the vertical load does not exceed 4000 kn while the initial stiffness declines with the increase of vertical load the vertical load v at a settlement of 0 111 m 0 1d is 5092 kn which is selected as the reference value v r the relationship of the normalized lateral loading capacity and vertical load is plotted in fig 27 the lateral loading capacity h is determined by the load resistance at a deflection of 0 1d it is found that the maximum lateral loading capacity occurs when the vertical load is approximately half the vertical bearing capacity 0 1d and the maximum value is about 0 09 times the vertical bearing capacity of the hybrid system 5 conclusions the conclusions relate to the structural configuration where a solid friction wheel is combined with a short rigid pile and the shear strength of the soil governs the lateral bearing performance of the hybrid system 1 the hybrid monopile friction wheel foundation shows a significant improvement in both lateral bearing capacity and stiffness over the monopile as shown in the results of centrifuge tests and supporting fe analyses in the tests the bearing capacity increases with the increase of the wheel diameter or thickness the vertical load from the gravity of upper structures helps to improve the lateral performance of the hybrid foundation however the improvement is limited in the present configuration where sliding is allowed between the pile and wheel due to the overturning moment induced by the vertical load when the tower is tilt in the lateral loading 2 in the tests of hybrid foundations the wheel in the hybrid system rotates into the ground with a soil heave in front of the wheel and a separation of the rear part of the wheel from the soil in the single wheel tests the dominant motion mode is sliding and no obvious soil heave is observed 3 the fem is proved to be capable of simulating the response of the hybrid foundation under lateral moment loading with the validation by centrifuge tests the fe analysis indicates that the lateral load is initially undertaken by the wheel component and the pile is involved more to resist the lateral load with the development of pile deflection the lateral earth pressure in front of the pile increases due to the bearing pressure generated underneath the front part of wheel results in a positive effect on the lateral resistance of pile the wheel also imparts an additional moment on the pile head which will considerably reduce the bending moment in the pile 4 according to the results of fe analyses the efficiency of adding a wheel to a pile diminishes with the increase of lateral load eccentricity the wheel is fixed to the pile in the fe models to advantageously utilize the vertical load it is shown that the maximum lateral bearing capacity occurs when the vertical load is about half of the vertical bearing capacity 
22738,the supercavitating vehicle are capable of achieving high speed through cavitation reduction technology however the model of the vehicle is inferior stability and nonlinear dynamics inferior stability is mainly reflected in the sensitivity to the interference the strong nonlinear characteristics embodies in the special planing force caused by water cavity interaction on the aft part of the vehicle regarding to the inferior stability and strong nonlinear dynamics of the supercavitating vehicle sliding mode controllers are presented in this paper by using boundary sliding mode control boundary of nonlinear planing force is estimated in order to reduce the switch gain of the boundary sliding mode controller the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer is proposed the disturbance observer is designed the stability of the system is proved by lyapunov stability theorem evaluations results through simulation on tracking performance of the nominal and uncertainty system with time delay show the effectiveness of the control method keywords supercavitating vehicle sliding mode control nonlinear model observer 1 introduction when an underwater vehicle travels at sufficiently high speed the fluid pressure drops below a certain value which could not sustain the liquid state the vehicle will be enveloped by a large continuous gas bubble this type vehicle is referred to as high speed supercavitating vehicle hssv the gas bubble is called supercavity generated from a sharp edge of the cavitator thus there are only control surfaces such as cavitator and parts of fins and the tail of the hull contacting with the water the existence of the supercavity offers an opportunity for high speed and skin friction drag reduction simultaneously it also makes the dynamics modeling and control design of the supercavitating vehicle challenging in recent years many works have been done on dynamics modeling of the supercavitating vehicle dzielski and kurdila 2003 kamada 2005 kirschner et al 2002 escobar sanabria et al 2014 wang et al 2010 shao et al 2003 goel 2002 vanek et al 2007 sanabria and balasgaryarndt 2015 the model in reference dzielski and kurdila 2003 is a two freedom degree model and mostly exploited and cited by researchers for its refine and precise expression six freedom degree model of the supercavitating vehicle is presented in kamada 2005 and kirschner et al 2002 based on extensive experimental data a new dynamics model of a supercavitating vehicle is constructed based on experimental data the nonlinear model is simplified to a lti system in feedback with a time delay and a dead zone nonlinearity escobar sanabria et al 2014 the accelerated motion of the supercavitating vehicle is presented in wang et al 2010 the remarkable differences of the dynamics characteristic between fully wetted vehicle and supercavitating vehicle are the high speed and the nonlinear planing force the nonlinear planing force is generated due to tail slap contact of the vehicle afterbody with the cavity therefore the control strategies designed for ordinary vehicle may not suit for the supercavitating vehicle control strategies designed for supercavitating vehicle have been studied in a series of papers linear quadratic regulator lqr was proposed to control a straight and level flight of the supercavitating vehicle and a feedforward feedback for the bank to turn strategy in kirschner et al 2002 where the model was linearized by small interrupt theory a feedback linearization controller was proposed by dzielski and kurdila 2003 the controller presented in the paper required a precise mathematical model therefore it is not robust with respect to system uncertainties switch control method was designed for the supercavitating vehicle based on a bi modal plant one was with planing force and the other was without planing force in shao et al 2003 robust control and lqg control were used in goel 2002 where the supercavitating vehicle was linear and the planing force was considered as an interrupt the model uncertainty was considered in the paper and the controller was robust in vanek et al 2007 inner loop and outer loop controller were designed for the supercavitating vehicle the inner loop controller was designed based on a dynamic inversion technique and the outer loop controller was designed by pole place and receding horizon control rhc method a linear parameter varying lpv controller is synthesized for the angle rate tracking problem in the presence of model uncertainty of the supercavitating vehicle several lpv controllers synthesized for smaller overlapping regions of the parameter space are blended together providing a single controller for the full flight envelope in vanek et al 2009 an optimization approach with or without operation conditions was adopted in ahn et al 2010 yahyazadeh and noei 2015 and kamada 2005 for the supercavitating vehicle and the optimization trajectory was proposed robust control method was exploited in escobar sanabria et al 2014 goel 2002 mao and wang 2009 and mao and wang 2011 zhang et al 2015 where h inf method and lpv h inf method were proposed although the robust controller can make the controlled system robust with uncertainties and the controller usually is complicated however the supercavitating vehicle is nonlinear and contains many uncertainties such as model coefficient uncertainty cavity shape uncertainty and time delay uncertainty therefore sliding model control that is simplicity in design robustness and ability to reject model uncertainties and external disturbance was used to control the supercavitating vehicle mao and wang 2009 lv et al 2010 in lv et al 2010 and mao and wang 2015 an adaptive technology was presented to estimate the unknown upper bound of mismatched uncertainties of continuous sliding mode controller designed for the supercavitating vehicle a feed forward compensation and nonlinear state feedback were introduced into the supercavitating vehicle to transfer the system into a multi input and multi output mimo linear system in this brief the sliding mode control method was exploited for design the controller of the supercavitating vehicle firstly the sliding mode controller based on upper and lower bound was designed for the supercavitating vehicle in the control system the maximum and minimum value of the disturbance were estimated and the switch gain is large to solve the problem the sliding mode controller based on a disturbance observer was redesigned for the vehicle where the disturbance observer was proposed and the switch gain was reduced finally the system stability was proved by the lyapunov theorem compared with previously published papers the results shown in this paper have the following features first a nonlinear dynamic model of the supercavitating vehicle involving model uncertainty is considered the upper bound uncertainty of the system was considered in lv et al 2010 and mao and wang 2015 the lower uncertainty bound of the system was not contained second the proposed control method sliding mode controller based on a disturbance observer does not depend on the measurements of the interrupt kawamura et al 1994 the difference between real object and nominal model can be equivalent to control input and the equivalent compensation is introduced in the control system to fully suppress the interference in many previously published papers mentioned above the disturbance observer was not introduced in the control system third the stability of the controlled system is proven by the lyapunov theorem compare with the ordinary sliding mode controller the disturbance observer proposed in this paper can reduce the switch gain and improve the system stability this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the nonlinear model of the supercavitating vehicle is briefly introduced and the sliding mode control problem is formulated section 3 presents boundary sliding mode controller for the supercavitating vehicle the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer is designed in section 4 simulation results are given in section 5 and the concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 mathematical model of a supercavitating vehicle when the supercavitating vehicle travels in the water the most parts of the body are enveloped by the cavity only cavitator and fins and the aft body contact with water the cavitator and fins produce lift and control force the aft body impacts between the cavity wall and the water which produces the

3 3 continuous sliding mode control based on disturbance observer disturbance observer can significantly improve disturbance attenuation ability and performance robustness and is easy to combine with other traditional feedback control methods such as nonlinear asymptotic control h variable structure control and sliding mode control pashaei and badamchizadeh 2016 in order to reduce the chattering problem in smc and maintain nominal performances several authors introduced a disturbance observer ginoya et al 2015 lee et al 2016 a sliding mode control via a disturbance observer is used to counteract the mismatched uncertainties and reduce chattering in the systems liu et al 2012 researchers have designed a sliding surface based on the disturbance estimation for systems that are subjected to mismatched disturbance to drive the state variables to the desired equilibrium points a sliding mode exact disturbance observer is exploited to exactly estimate the lumped disturbance in finite time for the air breathing hypersonic flight vehicle to obtain the capability of handling external disturbances an et al 2017 the disturbance observer designed in this paper not only estimates the unknown disturbances but also tackles the state error terms the dynamic model of the supercavitating vehicle can be rewritten as 28 y 1 t y 2 t η 1 0 ξ y 1 t y 2 t 1 0 0 1 η r t f t 0 a u t where

0191 m σ 0 03 l 1 8 m n 0 5 the initial responses are simulated where the initial condition is z 0 m θ 0 rad w 0 1 m s and q 0 1 rad s then the tracking responses for w and q are conducted and the step tracking responses are simulated too in order to test the robust characteristics the 50 uncertainty is exerted into the system and the monte carlo simulation is implemented the simulation results show that the sliding mode controller is effective and the system is robust 4 1 simulations for boundary sliding mode controller sliding mode controller is robust to the disturbance and the parameter uncertainty of the system in this system white noise pressure disturbance and parameter uncertainty are manifested in the cavitation number variation according to section 2 the cavitation number variation will affect the fluent dynamics of the vehicle such as lift on the cavitator and fins and the planing force therefore the parameter uncertainty white noise and pressure disturbance are both considered as the effect of the cavitation number meanwhile the time delay characteristics of the planing force is conducted in the simulation the simulation of the boundary sliding mode controller bsmc is conducted such as tracking responses for the nominal system and the uncertainty system respectively the simulations for the nominal system are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 fig 2 is the tracking responses for w step and q step reference signals of the boundary sliding mode controller and the reference signal is w r q r u t 0 5 from fig 2 we can see that w and q can track the reference signal quickly and the response time is short control signal δ f has high frequency concussion in initial stage and ascending state which is induced by the large switch gain as for tracking the reference sinusoidal signal w and q can follow the reference signal simultaneously however the control signal δ f is large if the amplitude of the reference sinusoidal signal increases and δ f will increase further in order to analyze the robustness of the system fig 4 and fig 5 draw the stochastic envelops of the state and control histories based on 100 monte carlo simulations of the tracking responses the uncertainties used in the monte carlo simulations are 50 variation in the cavitation number the stochastic envelops consist of maximum mean and minimum values in the simulation figs 4 and 5 show that the boundary sliding mode controller is robust to uncertainties 4 2 simulations for sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer do estimates the value of the planing force and the observation result is shown in fig 6 according to section iii the gain of the controller is proportional to the observation error the smaller the observation error leads to the smaller gain of the controller from fig 6 the observation result of the planing force is preferable fig 7 shows the initial responses performance of the nominal system by using the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer fig 7 shows that state w θ and δ f have high frequency chattering for the initial responses and state q has better initial response for the step signal tracking fig 8 shows that the state z and θ have well tracking responses and the simulation curves of w and q are consistent with the results of theoretical analysis as for the sinusoidal signal the tracking result of w q θ is good in fig 9 from the simulation of the nominal system we can see that although the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer could reduce the switch gain the chattering of the system increases to analyze the robustness of the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer figs 10 12 plots the stochastic envelops of the state and control histories based on 100 monte carlo simulations of the tracking responses the uncertainties and random samples used in the monte carlo simulations for evaluating the sliding mode controller based on observer are the same with the boundary sliding mode controller the stochastic envelops also consist of maximum mean and minimum values at the simulation time we can see that the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer will achieve satisfactory tracking performance in the presence of parameter and planning force uncertainties 5 conclusion this paper presents a boundary sliding mode controller and a sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer for the dive plane dynamics of a supercavitating vehicle the presented sliding mode controllers have shown

22738,the supercavitating vehicle are capable of achieving high speed through cavitation reduction technology however the model of the vehicle is inferior stability and nonlinear dynamics inferior stability is mainly reflected in the sensitivity to the interference the strong nonlinear characteristics embodies in the special planing force caused by water cavity interaction on the aft part of the vehicle regarding to the inferior stability and strong nonlinear dynamics of the supercavitating vehicle sliding mode controllers are presented in this paper by using boundary sliding mode control boundary of nonlinear planing force is estimated in order to reduce the switch gain of the boundary sliding mode controller the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer is proposed the disturbance observer is designed the stability of the system is proved by lyapunov stability theorem evaluations results through simulation on tracking performance of the nominal and uncertainty system with time delay show the effectiveness of the control method keywords supercavitating vehicle sliding mode control nonlinear model observer 1 introduction when an underwater vehicle travels at sufficiently high speed the fluid pressure drops below a certain value which could not sustain the liquid state the vehicle will be enveloped by a large continuous gas bubble this type vehicle is referred to as high speed supercavitating vehicle hssv the gas bubble is called supercavity generated from a sharp edge of the cavitator thus there are only control surfaces such as cavitator and parts of fins and the tail of the hull contacting with the water the existence of the supercavity offers an opportunity for high speed and skin friction drag reduction simultaneously it also makes the dynamics modeling and control design of the supercavitating vehicle challenging in recent years many works have been done on dynamics modeling of the supercavitating vehicle dzielski and kurdila 2003 kamada 2005 kirschner et al 2002 escobar sanabria et al 2014 wang et al 2010 shao et al 2003 goel 2002 vanek et al 2007 sanabria and balasgaryarndt 2015 the model in reference dzielski and kurdila 2003 is a two freedom degree model and mostly exploited and cited by researchers for its refine and precise expression six freedom degree model of the supercavitating vehicle is presented in kamada 2005 and kirschner et al 2002 based on extensive experimental data a new dynamics model of a supercavitating vehicle is constructed based on experimental data the nonlinear model is simplified to a lti system in feedback with a time delay and a dead zone nonlinearity escobar sanabria et al 2014 the accelerated motion of the supercavitating vehicle is presented in wang et al 2010 the remarkable differences of the dynamics characteristic between fully wetted vehicle and supercavitating vehicle are the high speed and the nonlinear planing force the nonlinear planing force is generated due to tail slap contact of the vehicle afterbody with the cavity therefore the control strategies designed for ordinary vehicle may not suit for the supercavitating vehicle control strategies designed for supercavitating vehicle have been studied in a series of papers linear quadratic regulator lqr was proposed to control a straight and level flight of the supercavitating vehicle and a feedforward feedback for the bank to turn strategy in kirschner et al 2002 where the model was linearized by small interrupt theory a feedback linearization controller was proposed by dzielski and kurdila 2003 the controller presented in the paper required a precise mathematical model therefore it is not robust with respect to system uncertainties switch control method was designed for the supercavitating vehicle based on a bi modal plant one was with planing force and the other was without planing force in shao et al 2003 robust control and lqg control were used in goel 2002 where the supercavitating vehicle was linear and the planing force was considered as an interrupt the model uncertainty was considered in the paper and the controller was robust in vanek et al 2007 inner loop and outer loop controller were designed for the supercavitating vehicle the inner loop controller was designed based on a dynamic inversion technique and the outer loop controller was designed by pole place and receding horizon control rhc method a linear parameter varying lpv controller is synthesized for the angle rate tracking problem in the presence of model uncertainty of the supercavitating vehicle several lpv controllers synthesized for smaller overlapping regions of the parameter space are blended together providing a single controller for the full flight envelope in vanek et al 2009 an optimization approach with or without operation conditions was adopted in ahn et al 2010 yahyazadeh and noei 2015 and kamada 2005 for the supercavitating vehicle and the optimization trajectory was proposed robust control method was exploited in escobar sanabria et al 2014 goel 2002 mao and wang 2009 and mao and wang 2011 zhang et al 2015 where h inf method and lpv h inf method were proposed although the robust controller can make the controlled system robust with uncertainties and the controller usually is complicated however the supercavitating vehicle is nonlinear and contains many uncertainties such as model coefficient uncertainty cavity shape uncertainty and time delay uncertainty therefore sliding model control that is simplicity in design robustness and ability to reject model uncertainties and external disturbance was used to control the supercavitating vehicle mao and wang 2009 lv et al 2010 in lv et al 2010 and mao and wang 2015 an adaptive technology was presented to estimate the unknown upper bound of mismatched uncertainties of continuous sliding mode controller designed for the supercavitating vehicle a feed forward compensation and nonlinear state feedback were introduced into the supercavitating vehicle to transfer the system into a multi input and multi output mimo linear system in this brief the sliding mode control method was exploited for design the controller of the supercavitating vehicle firstly the sliding mode controller based on upper and lower bound was designed for the supercavitating vehicle in the control system the maximum and minimum value of the disturbance were estimated and the switch gain is large to solve the problem the sliding mode controller based on a disturbance observer was redesigned for the vehicle where the disturbance observer was proposed and the switch gain was reduced finally the system stability was proved by the lyapunov theorem compared with previously published papers the results shown in this paper have the following features first a nonlinear dynamic model of the supercavitating vehicle involving model uncertainty is considered the upper bound uncertainty of the system was considered in lv et al 2010 and mao and wang 2015 the lower uncertainty bound of the system was not contained second the proposed control method sliding mode controller based on a disturbance observer does not depend on the measurements of the interrupt kawamura et al 1994 the difference between real object and nominal model can be equivalent to control input and the equivalent compensation is introduced in the control system to fully suppress the interference in many previously published papers mentioned above the disturbance observer was not introduced in the control system third the stability of the controlled system is proven by the lyapunov theorem compare with the ordinary sliding mode controller the disturbance observer proposed in this paper can reduce the switch gain and improve the system stability this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the nonlinear model of the supercavitating vehicle is briefly introduced and the sliding mode control problem is formulated section 3 presents boundary sliding mode controller for the supercavitating vehicle the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer is designed in section 4 simulation results are given in section 5 and the

3 3 continuous sliding mode control based on disturbance observer disturbance observer can significantly improve disturbance attenuation ability and performance robustness and is easy to combine with other traditional feedback control methods such as nonlinear asymptotic control h variable structure control and sliding mode control pashaei and badamchizadeh 2016 in order to reduce the chattering problem in smc and maintain nominal performances several authors introduced a disturbance observer ginoya et al 2015 lee et al 2016 a sliding mode control via a disturbance observer is used to counteract the mismatched uncertainties and reduce chattering in the systems liu et al 2012 researchers have designed a sliding surface based on the disturbance estimation for systems that are subjected to mismatched disturbance to drive the state variables to the desired equilibrium points a sliding mode exact disturbance observer is exploited to exactly estimate the lumped disturbance in finite time for the air breathing hypersonic flight vehicle to obtain the capability of handling external disturbances an et al 2017 the disturbance observer designed in this paper not only estimates the unknown disturbances but also tackles the state error terms the dynamic model of the supercavitating vehicle can be rewritten as 28 y 1 t y 2 t η 1 0 ξ y 1 t y 2 t 1 0 0 1 η r t f t 0 a u t where

the disturbance observer 4 simulation results in this section the simulation of the sliding mode control of the system is conducted the simulation parameter is g 9 81 m s 2 v 85 m s r 0 0508 m r n 0 0191 m σ 0 03 l 1 8 m n 0 5 the initial responses are simulated where the initial condition is z 0 m θ 0 rad w 0 1 m s and q 0 1 rad s then the tracking responses for w and q are conducted and the step tracking responses are simulated too in order to test the robust characteristics the 50 uncertainty is exerted into the system and the monte carlo simulation is implemented the simulation results show that the sliding mode controller is effective and the system is robust 4 1 simulations for boundary sliding mode controller sliding mode controller is robust to the disturbance and the parameter uncertainty of the system in this system white noise pressure disturbance and parameter uncertainty are manifested in the cavitation number variation according to section 2 the cavitation number variation will affect the fluent dynamics of the vehicle such as lift on the cavitator and fins and the planing force therefore the parameter uncertainty white noise and pressure disturbance are both considered as the effect of the cavitation number meanwhile the time delay characteristics of the planing force is conducted in the simulation the simulation of the boundary sliding mode controller bsmc is conducted such as tracking responses for the nominal system and the uncertainty system respectively the simulations for the nominal system are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 fig 2 is the tracking responses for w step and q step reference signals of the boundary sliding mode controller and the reference signal is w r q r u t 0 5 from fig 2 we can see that w and q can track the reference signal quickly and the response time is short control signal δ f has high frequency concussion in initial stage and ascending state which is induced by the large switch gain as for tracking the reference sinusoidal signal w and q can follow the reference signal simultaneously however the control signal δ f is large if the amplitude of the reference sinusoidal signal increases and δ f will increase further in order to analyze the robustness of the system fig 4 and fig 5 draw the stochastic envelops of the state and control histories based on 100 monte carlo simulations of the tracking responses the uncertainties used in the monte carlo simulations are 50 variation in the cavitation number the stochastic envelops consist of maximum mean and minimum values in the simulation figs 4 and 5 show that the boundary sliding mode controller is robust to uncertainties 4 2 simulations for sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer do estimates the value of the planing force and the observation result is shown in fig 6 according to section iii the gain of the controller is proportional to the observation error the smaller the observation error leads to the smaller gain of the controller from fig 6 the observation result of the planing force is preferable fig 7 shows the initial responses performance of the nominal system by using the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer fig 7 shows that state w θ and δ f have high frequency chattering for the initial responses and state q has better initial response for the step signal tracking fig 8 shows that the state z and θ have well tracking responses and the simulation curves of w and q are consistent with the results of theoretical analysis as for the sinusoidal signal the tracking result of w q θ is good in fig 9 from the simulation of the nominal system we can see that although the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer could reduce the switch gain the chattering of the system increases to analyze the robustness of the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer figs 10 12 plots the stochastic envelops of the state and control histories based on 100 monte carlo simulations of the tracking responses the uncertainties and random samples used in the monte carlo simulations for evaluating the sliding mode controller based on observer are the same with the boundary sliding mode controller the stochastic envelops also consist of maximum mean and minimum values at the simulation time we can see that the sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer will achieve satisfactory tracking performance in the presence of parameter and planning force uncertainties 5 conclusion this paper presents a boundary sliding mode controller and a sliding mode controller based on disturbance observer for the dive plane dynamics of a supercavitating vehicle the presented sliding mode controllers have shown good performance for both stabilization and tracking responses as well as robustness with respect to cavitation number uncertainty in the system however the simulation results also show that the chatter still exists in the system therefore in the future work we plan to incorporate the intelligent method in the controller designs to reduce the chatter in the system acknowledgments this work

22739,in order to study the relationship between ship propeller cavitation and induced pressure fluctuations two propellers with different skew patterns are designed the rans method and the schneer sauer cavitation model were used to solve the cavitation flow of the hsp ⅱpropeller and the results were in agreement with the measured data at the cavitation condition the balanced skew propeller shows a smaller cavitation volume than the biased skew propeller for monitoring points above the propeller skew type has little effect on the pressure fluctuations the balanced propeller shows slightly lower pressure fluctuations for a clockwise propeller from the stern the pressure fluctuations on the starboard are stronger than the port side finally the fast fourier transform fft of the pressure signal shows that whether it is cavitation or full wetted flow the point above the propeller contains first 3 harmonics of blade passing frequency bpf while the point in the wake shows only 1bpf at cavitation condition keywords propeller cavitation patterns skew pressure fluctuation 1 introduction cavitation is a complex phase transition process and the study of cavitation was mostly in view of visual cavitation lacking complete evaluation index with the development of the era ships generally require high speeds and loads and therefore the cavitation of the propellers is difficult to avoid propeller cavitation may cause the stern s exciting force trigger erosion or result in high intensity underwater radiation noise viitanen and siikonen 2017 appropriate skew can reduce propeller induced hull vibration without significantly affecting the efficiency of the propeller mosaad and yehia 2011 it is necessary to study the internal relationship between the propeller skew cavitation and pressure fluctuation which paves the way for the design of the propeller there are three main methods for the study of propeller cavitation theoretical methods experimental studies and numerical simulations theoretical methods have strict theoretical limitations and cannot capture the details of propeller cavitation experimental studies can easily observe many phenomena but limited by measurement techniques many important flow characteristics cannot be expressed bensow and bark 2010 numerical methods can capture the details of cavitation flow such as the period of bubble collapse the re entrant jets and the horseshoe vortex can be presented in the simulation of the hydrofoil da qing li et al 2010 zi ru li et al 2010 ji et al 2013 ji et al 2015 the numerical method is also increasingly used for the cavitation flow of the propeller vaz et al 2015 used ansys cfx ansys fluent excalibur finetm marine openfoam procal refresco star ccm to solve the e779a propeller the study showed that the results of the solution were very similar when using the same cavitation model unstructured meshes were efficient compared to structural meshes in acceptable accuracy for engineering applications the cavitation flow around a marine propeller was studied by rhee et al 2005 using an unstructured grid based reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics method and the results were in good agreement with the experimental observations the mesh size in the simulation of propeller cavitation was always cared about especially the initial height of the boundary layer mesh is significant for the simulation of the sheet cavitation the initial heights of the boundary layers of 0 0001d and 0 001d were used in the e779a propeller respectively it was suggested that the sheet cavitation patterns on the suction surface is in good agreement with the experimental results although the tip vortex cavitation is not shown zhu 2012 the rans and pans methods combined with sst k ω turbulence model and mass transport cavitation model were used to predict the unsteady cavitation characteristics of full size propellers in non uniform flow the simulations showed that large cavity volume fluctuation is resolved better by the pans method than the rans method with the k ε or sst k ω turbulence models ji et al 2010 2012 although tip vortex cavitation does not affect the propeller propulsion efficiency it has been found that tip vortex cavitation increases the propeller s radiated noise gaggero et al 2014 linear turbulence models and fine tip meshes were used by zhu 2015 but the results only showed short tip vortex cavitation while the tip vortex cavitation calculated by the nonlinear turbulence model was longer liu et al 2016 several papers show that the tendency of 1bpf components of pressure fluctuation was predicted fairly well sato et al 2009 paik et al 2013a b the influence of skew angle on the cavitation flow of the propeller was also considered by the researchers in order to study the effect of the propeller skew on pressure fluctuation four propellers with different skew angle in the non uniform inflow was analyzed by liu 2012 the results demonstrated that for a given wake and thrust the 20 skew angle is the best choice with minimum pressure fluctuations the mass transport cavitation model and the sst k ω turbulence model were used by ji et al 2011 to study the cavitation flow and pressure fluctuation of the highly skewed propeller analysis showed that the amplitudes of the dominant components corresponding to the first second and third blade passing frequencies were satisfactorily predicted ji et al 2014 in conclusion the study of the skewed propeller cavitation flow is focused on the comparison of different skew angles few papers have studied the cavitation flow of propellers with the same skew angle but different skew patterns in this paper numerical methods are used to study the difference of cavitation patterns and pressure fluctuations between two types of propellers with the same skew angle but different skew patterns at the same operating conditions pressure fluctuation differences between different cavitation numbers and measuring point locations are analyzed finally the pressure fluctuation characteristics of different field points are studied and the fft pressure signal is analyzed 2

the mixing coefficient ϕ 1 ϕ 2 represent the coefficients in k ω equations and k ε equations respectively all the coefficients are shown in table 1 3 numerical model 3 1 geometry and boundary conditions based on the dtmb 4119 propeller two propellers with the same skew angle of 55 but different skew patterns are modeled the propeller geometry is shown in fig 1 and the skew distributions are shown in fig 2 the skew of the new propellers are different from the dtmb 4119 propeller and other parameters rake pitch blade section expand area ratio etc are the same as the dtmb 4119 propeller the dtmb 4119 propeller parameters were listed by jessup 1989 to simulate the open water and cavitation performance of the propeller a small rotational zone around the propeller and a large stationary zone were used in fig 3 with velocity inlet pressure outlet and wall boundary conditions the distance from upstream to propeller is 2d subhas et al 2012 bensow and bark 2010 and in order to ensure the full development of the propeller wake the distance from the downstream to the propeller is set to 8d the diameters of the rotational and stationary domains are 1 4d and 6d respectively d is propeller diameter 3 2 validation of numerical model unstructured grids and hexahedral grids are used in the rotational and stationary domains the coincident faces of the two regions are defined as interface the maximum size of the blade surface cell is 0 01d and the maximum cell size of 0 05d is selected in rotational zone ji et al 2014 a boundary layer is generated on the surface of the blade the height of the first layer is 0 0005d zhu 2015 the stretching factor is 1 1 for 5 layers which provides the y of 2 70 with our simulation as shown in fig 4 the total number of cells is 4 21 million in this paper the open water performance and cavitation pattern of highly skewed propeller hsp ii kurobe y et al 1983 is calculated to verify the validity of the numerical method as is shown in fig 5 the results of steady open water simulation in 7 operating conditions are compared with the measurement data kurobe y et al 1983 where the advance ratio is j v a n d the thrust and torque coefficients are k t t h r u s t ρ n 2 d 4 k q t o r q u e ρ n 2 d 5 respectively v a v inlet n rps is propeller rotation rate the advance ratio is only changed by the inlet velocity a user defined profile is used to generate the wake kurobe y et al 1983 as shown in fig 6 left and the right figure is a numerical axial velocity distribution obtained by interpolation in the unsteady simulation only the axial wake component is calculated ignoring the small scale tangential and radial components the calculation domain is as shown in fig 3 the only change is that the distance from the upstream to the propeller is reduced to 0 7d to improve flow dissipation the schnerr sauer model combined with the sst k ω model and the coupled scheme of the pressure velocity coupling solution are selected to solve cavitation flow the green gauss cell based method is used to discretize gradient and the discrete format of the pressure is presto in the end the discrete formats of momentum turbulent kinetic energy volume fraction and dissipation rate are all second order upwind scheme the comparison between the experimental pictures kurobe y et al 1983 and the numerical results at the condition of cavitation number σ 2 99 is shown in fig 7 the cavitation number is defined as σ p r e f p v 0 5 ρ n 2 d 2 where p r e f p o u t l e t p v is vapor pressure whether it is open water performance or cavitation patterns the numerical results are consistent with the experimental data which proved that the numerical approach is appropriate it should be noted that the numerical simulation does not effectively simulate the obvious tip vortex cavitation but this is not germane to our research 4 results and discussion the balanced skew propeller and the biased skew propeller are simulated under unsteady and non uniform inflow conditions in order to facilitate writing we will record the balanced skew propeller and the biased skew propeller as balanced prop and biased prop respectively the calculation domain the mesh generation and the calculation methods are consistent with the previous verification part and the non uniform flow uses the interpolation result shown in fig 6 to simulate the tunnel depressurization the change of cavitation number is achieved by different outlet pressure in this paper the propeller angular velocity is fixed at 1050 rpm and the calculation time step is set to the time elapsed when the propeller rotates 1 5 that is the time step is 0 000238095 s the physical properties of the water used for the calculation are all parameters of water at 20 c ρ 998 2 k g m 3 ν 1 003 10 6 m 2 s p v a p 2339 p a operating conditions are shown in table 2 in order to study the pressure pulsation characteristics of different monitoring points we arranged the monitoring points near the propeller as shown in fig 8 the coordinates of the specific monitoring points are listed in table 3 4 1 comparison of water vapor volume of balanced prop and biased prop the difference of water vapor volume at the second operating condition σ 1 6 is illustrated in fig 9 a1 a2 and a3 show the cavitation patterns of the biased prop at 90 150 and 240 b1 b2 and b3 show the cavitation patterns of the balanced prop at 90 150 and 240 as it can be seen the cavitation area of the biased prop is larger than that of the balanced prop but the exact water vapor volume need to be obtained from the calculated source file in order to avoid the interpolation error caused by interface only the water vapor volume of the rotational zone is calculated the calculation result of the specific water vapor volume is shown in table 4 and it can be clearly seen that the volume is variable the sample of the case file at three times is randomly selected one file is selected at intervals of 100 steps which means that the sample is not special under the same operating conditions the water vapor volume of the balanced prop is smaller than that of the biased prop especially when the propeller rotates to 150 and 240 the water vapor volume of the balanced prop is 2 56 and 9 36 smaller than the biased prop therefore it can be considered that the balanced prop has better cavitation performance 4 2 pressure pulsations of balanced prop at different monitoring points this section analyzes the pressure pulsations at different points under σ 1 3 operating condition pressure pulsation is defined by dimensionless pressure coefficient k p 13 k p k b δ p ρ n 2 d 2 where k b 2 is the solid boundary factor and δ p is the pressure fluctuation amplitude from the mean pressure the pressure time history at each monitoring points except c are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 as can be seen by comparing figs 10 and 11 the pressure fluctuations amplitude of the monitoring points on the plane z 0 53 d closer to the blade tips is much larger than the pressure amplitude on the plane z 0 73 d as shown in the first image in fig 10 the pressure fluctuations amplitude at point b2 closer to the center of the propeller is larger than b1 and the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b4 is also larger than b5 the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b1 is greater than b5 the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b2 is greater than b4 and the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b3 behave in exactly the same as b2 from the above description if the two measuring points are symmetrically distributed on both sides of the center of the propeller it can be concluded that the fluctuations amplitude at starboard side is greater than the port side this is because the cavitation on the right side of the right rotation propeller is more severe so the pressure pulsation amplitude is larger as is shown in fig 11 in the plane of z 0 73 d the pressure pulsations of the port side monitoring points a1 and a2 are also larger than the starboard side a5 and a4 respectively the above is the analysis of the monitoring points on the propeller plane x 0 and the axial monitoring points are analyzed below the location of the axial monitoring point b7 and b6 can be clearly seen from fig 8 although the two points are the same length to the center of the propeller b7 located downstream and b6 located upstream the comparison pressure time history is shown in fig 10 the pressure pulsation at point b6 is roughly sinusoidal and fluctuates around zero however there are large negative pressure peak at point b7 because the cavitation at the leading edge of the blade suction surface flow to the downstream with the tip vortex and this point is periodically in the water vapor cavity cavitation has a limited impact on the pressure fluctuation of a6 a7 because they are too far from the blade tips fig 12 shows the pressure pulsation of the balanced prop at point c under three operating conditions as is shown in fig 8 point c is located 0 5d downstream of the propeller plane and the projection of point c on the plane is inside the blade it can be used to study the pressure pulsation of the wake after the propeller taking into account the reliability of the results the curve after 0 04 s was used for analysis it should be noted that the pressure peaks under the same operating conditions are slightly different which may be due to the subtle differences in each blade grid but this does not affect our research clearly the pressure pulsation amplitude of point c in the full wetted flow state is smaller than the cavitation state and under cavitation condition the pressure pulsation is not significantly increased with the decrease of cavitation number to conclude we believe that once cavitation occurs the degree of pressure pulsation of the wake behind the propeller is not very sensitive and varies with the cavitation number 4 3 pressure fluctuations comparison of balanced prop and biased prop in ship engineering the pressure pulsation of the stern is usually concerned and the sensor is placed on the hull closest to the blade tip during the test although the propeller geometry we used is no rake the blade tip is inclined in the axial downstream direction due to the skew so the b7 point is selected fig 13 a shows pressure time history of the balanced prop and biased prop at b7 on the whole the pressure pulsation curves of the two propellers have roughly the same trend and the positive pressure peak is flat while the negative pressure peak is steep under the same working conditions the pressure pulsation of the balanced prop is slightly smaller than the biased prop it can be seen from fig 13 b that the pressure pulsation of the two propellers in the full wetted flow state is slightly smaller than the cavitation condition and the pressure pulsation at the condition of σ 1 3 is the largest the pressure signal spectrums of b7 and c under different operating conditions are shown in fig 14 the angular velocity of the propeller is 17 5 rps first order axial frequency and the first blade passing frequency 1bpf is 3 17 5 hz it can be seen from fig 14 that the pressure signal component at point b7 is rich the main frequency is 1bpf and 2bpf 3bpf also have larger components however the main frequency component of point c is only 1bpf and the blade frequency harmonic component is almost negligible but under full wetted flow conditions point c exhibits a larger component of the first order axial passing frequency 17 5 hz and at the cavitation condition the first order axial frequency is not obvious under cavitation conditions the amplitude of the first three harmonics of blade frequency is greater than the amplitude of the full wetted flow and as the cavitation number decreases the cavitation becomes severe the main frequency of the biased prop is increased the 2bpf 3bpf of the balanced prop are slightly enhanced the main frequency of point c at cavitation condition is greater than wetted flow condition when the cavitation number is reduced from 1 6 to 1 3 the amplitude of the main frequency changes slightly at point b7 the main frequency magnitude of the biased prop is higher than the balanced prop for point c the main frequency magnitude of the balanced prop is higher than the biased prop in the cavitation state and the balanced prop behave in exactly the same as the biased prop in the full wetted flow state based on the above discussion it shows that the main component of the pressure pulsation in the propeller plane is the first three harmonics of blade frequency component the main component of the pressure pulsation in the wake is the first order blade frequency and under the condition of no cavitation the first order axial frequency also shows a large component 5 conclusions based on the rans method and the schneer sauer cavitation model the simulation of the steady open water performance and cavitation flow of the hspⅱ propeller is carried out the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data and the validity of the selected numerical model and calculation method is verified in this paper two propellers based on dtmb 4119 with different skew patterns and same skew angle was designed to study the cavitation patterns and pressure fluctuations from the numerical results one can draw some conclusions above all the vapor volume induced by the balanced prop is always smaller than that of the biased prop at the same operating condition it can be considered that the cavitation performance of the balanced prop is better besides studying pressure pulsations of balanced prop at different monitoring points it is found that for a clockwise propeller from the stern the pressure fluctuations on the starboard side is stronger than the port side those axially placed monitoring points the pressure fluctuations near the wake are stronger with the comparison of the pressure fluctuations at point c we found that once cavitation occurs the pressure fluctuation amplitudes of the point in the wake are higher than the amplitudes of the full wetted flow condition on the other hand the skew type has little effect on the pressure pulsation at point b7 where the pressure pulsation of the balanced prop is only slightly smaller than the biased prop finally we use fft technology to process the time domain pressure signal and obtain the frequency characteristics of the signal we conclude that whether it is cavitation or full wetted flow the b7 point above the propeller contains more harmonics of blade frequency the c point in the wake shows only the 1bpf at cavitation condition and also shows the first order axial frequency in the full wetted flow 
22739,in order to study the relationship between ship propeller cavitation and induced pressure fluctuations two propellers with different skew patterns are designed the rans method and the schneer sauer cavitation model were used to solve the cavitation flow of the hsp ⅱpropeller and the results were in agreement with the measured data at the cavitation condition the balanced skew propeller shows a smaller cavitation volume than the biased skew propeller for monitoring points above the propeller skew type has little effect on the pressure fluctuations the balanced propeller shows slightly lower pressure fluctuations for a clockwise propeller from the stern the pressure fluctuations on the starboard are stronger than the port side finally the fast fourier transform fft of the pressure signal shows that whether it is cavitation or full wetted flow the point above the propeller contains first 3 harmonics of blade passing frequency bpf while the point in the wake shows only 1bpf at cavitation condition keywords propeller cavitation patterns skew pressure fluctuation 1 introduction cavitation is a complex phase transition process and the study of cavitation was mostly in view of visual cavitation lacking complete evaluation index with the development of the era ships generally require high speeds and loads and therefore the cavitation of the propellers is difficult to avoid propeller cavitation may cause the stern s exciting force trigger erosion or result in high intensity underwater radiation noise viitanen and siikonen 2017 appropriate skew can reduce propeller induced hull vibration without significantly affecting the efficiency of the propeller mosaad and yehia 2011 it is necessary to study the internal relationship between the propeller skew cavitation and pressure fluctuation which paves the way for the design of the propeller there are three main methods for the study of propeller cavitation theoretical methods experimental studies and numerical simulations theoretical methods have strict theoretical limitations and cannot capture the details of propeller cavitation experimental studies can easily observe many phenomena but limited by measurement techniques many important flow characteristics cannot be expressed bensow and bark 2010 numerical methods can capture the details of cavitation flow such as the period of bubble collapse the re entrant jets and the horseshoe vortex can be presented in the simulation of the hydrofoil da qing li et al 2010 zi ru li et al 2010 ji et al 2013 ji et al 2015 the numerical method is also increasingly used for the cavitation flow of the propeller vaz et al 2015 used ansys cfx ansys fluent excalibur finetm marine openfoam procal refresco star ccm to solve the e779a propeller the study showed that the results of the solution were very similar when using the same cavitation model unstructured meshes were efficient compared to structural meshes in acceptable accuracy for engineering applications the cavitation flow around a marine propeller was studied by rhee et al 2005 using an unstructured grid based reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics method and the results were in good agreement with the experimental observations the mesh size in the simulation of propeller cavitation was always cared about especially the initial height of the boundary layer mesh is significant for the simulation of the sheet cavitation the initial heights of the boundary layers of 0 0001d and 0 001d were used in the e779a propeller respectively it was suggested that the sheet cavitation patterns on the suction surface is in good agreement with the experimental results although the tip vortex cavitation is not shown zhu 2012 the rans and pans methods combined with sst k ω turbulence model and mass transport cavitation model were used to predict the unsteady cavitation characteristics of full size propellers in non uniform flow the simulations showed that large cavity volume fluctuation is resolved better by the pans method than the rans method with the k ε or sst k ω turbulence models ji et al 2010 2012 although tip vortex cavitation does not affect the propeller propulsion efficiency it has been found that tip vortex cavitation increases the propeller s radiated noise gaggero et al 2014 linear turbulence models and fine tip meshes were used by zhu 2015 but the results only showed short tip vortex cavitation while the tip vortex cavitation calculated by the nonlinear turbulence model was longer liu et al 2016 several papers show that the tendency of 1bpf components of pressure fluctuation was predicted fairly well sato et al 2009 paik et al 2013a b the influence of skew angle on the cavitation flow of the propeller was also considered by the researchers in order to study the effect of the propeller skew on pressure fluctuation four propellers with different skew angle in the non uniform inflow was analyzed by liu 2012 the results demonstrated that for a given wake and thrust the 20 skew angle is the best choice with minimum pressure fluctuations the mass transport cavitation model and the sst k ω turbulence model were used by ji et al 2011 to study the cavitation flow and pressure fluctuation of the highly skewed propeller analysis showed that the amplitudes of the dominant components corresponding to the first second and third blade passing frequencies were satisfactorily predicted ji et al 2014 in conclusion the study of the skewed propeller cavitation flow is focused on the comparison of different skew angles few papers have studied the cavitation flow of propellers with the same skew angle but different skew patterns in this paper numerical methods are used to study the difference of cavitation patterns and pressure fluctuations between two types of propellers with the same skew angle but different skew patterns at the same operating conditions pressure fluctuation differences between different cavitation numbers and measuring point locations are analyzed finally the pressure fluctuation characteristics of different field points are studied and the fft pressure signal is analyzed 2

second operating condition σ 1 6 is illustrated in fig 9 a1 a2 and a3 show the cavitation patterns of the biased prop at 90 150 and 240 b1 b2 and b3 show the cavitation patterns of the balanced prop at 90 150 and 240 as it can be seen the cavitation area of the biased prop is larger than that of the balanced prop but the exact water vapor volume need to be obtained from the calculated source file in order to avoid the interpolation error caused by interface only the water vapor volume of the rotational zone is calculated the calculation result of the specific water vapor volume is shown in table 4 and it can be clearly seen that the volume is variable the sample of the case file at three times is randomly selected one file is selected at intervals of 100 steps which means that the sample is not special under the same operating conditions the water vapor volume of the balanced prop is smaller than that of the biased prop especially when the propeller rotates to 150 and 240 the water vapor volume of the balanced prop is 2 56 and 9 36 smaller than the biased prop therefore it can be considered that the balanced prop has better cavitation performance 4 2 pressure pulsations of balanced prop at different monitoring points this section analyzes the pressure pulsations at different points under σ 1 3 operating condition pressure pulsation is defined by dimensionless pressure coefficient k p 13 k p k b δ p ρ n 2 d 2 where k b 2 is the solid boundary factor and δ p is the pressure fluctuation amplitude from the mean pressure the pressure time history at each monitoring points except c are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 as can be seen by comparing figs 10 and 11 the pressure fluctuations amplitude of the monitoring points on the plane z 0 53 d closer to the blade tips is much larger than the pressure amplitude on the plane z 0 73 d as shown in the first image in fig 10 the pressure fluctuations amplitude at point b2 closer to the center of the propeller is larger than b1 and the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b4 is also larger than b5 the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b1 is greater than b5 the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b2 is greater than b4 and the pressure fluctuations amplitude of b3 behave in exactly the same as b2 from the above description if the two measuring points are symmetrically distributed on both sides of the center of the propeller it can be concluded that the fluctuations amplitude at starboard side is greater than the port side this is because the cavitation on the right side of the right rotation propeller is more severe so the pressure pulsation amplitude is larger as is shown in fig 11 in the plane of z 0 73 d the pressure pulsations of the port side monitoring points a1 and a2 are also larger than the starboard side a5 and a4 respectively the above is the analysis of the monitoring points on the propeller plane x 0 and the axial monitoring points are analyzed below the location of the axial monitoring point b7 and b6 can be clearly seen from fig 8 although the two points are the same length to the center of the propeller b7 located downstream and b6 located upstream the comparison pressure time history is shown in fig 10 the pressure pulsation at point b6 is roughly sinusoidal and fluctuates around zero however there are large negative pressure peak at point b7 because the cavitation at the leading edge of the blade suction surface flow to the downstream with the tip vortex and this point is periodically in the water vapor cavity cavitation has a limited impact on the pressure fluctuation of a6 a7 because they are too far from the blade tips fig 12 shows the pressure pulsation of the balanced prop at point c under three operating conditions as is shown in fig 8 point c is located 0 5d downstream of the propeller plane and the projection of point c on the plane is inside the blade it can be used to study the pressure pulsation of the wake after the propeller taking into account the reliability of the results the curve after 0 04 s was used for analysis it should be noted that the pressure peaks under the same operating conditions are slightly different which may be due to the subtle differences in each blade grid but this does not affect our research clearly the pressure pulsation amplitude of point c in the full wetted flow state is smaller than the cavitation state and under cavitation condition the pressure pulsation is not significantly increased with the decrease of cavitation number to conclude we believe that once cavitation occurs the degree of pressure pulsation of the wake behind the propeller is not very sensitive and varies with the cavitation number 4 3 pressure fluctuations comparison of balanced prop and biased prop in ship engineering the pressure pulsation of the stern is usually concerned and the sensor is placed on the hull closest to the blade tip during the test although the propeller geometry we used is no rake the blade tip is inclined in the axial downstream direction due to the skew so the b7 point is selected fig 13 a shows pressure time history of the balanced prop and biased prop at b7 on the whole the pressure pulsation curves of the two propellers have roughly the same trend and the positive pressure peak is flat while the negative pressure peak is steep under the same working conditions the pressure pulsation of the balanced prop is slightly smaller than the biased prop it can be seen from fig 13 b that the pressure pulsation of the two propellers in the full wetted flow state is slightly smaller than the cavitation condition and the pressure pulsation at the condition of σ 1 3 is the largest the pressure signal spectrums of b7 and c under different operating conditions are shown in fig 14 the angular velocity of the propeller is 17 5 rps first order axial frequency and the first blade passing frequency 1bpf is 3 17 5 hz it can be seen from fig 14 that the pressure signal component at point b7 is rich the main frequency is 1bpf and 2bpf 3bpf also have larger components however the main frequency component of point c is only 1bpf and the blade frequency harmonic component is almost negligible but under full wetted flow conditions point c exhibits a larger component of the first order axial passing frequency 17 5 hz and at the cavitation condition the first order axial frequency is not obvious under cavitation conditions the amplitude of the first three harmonics of blade frequency is greater than the amplitude of the full wetted flow and as the cavitation number decreases the cavitation becomes severe the main frequency of the biased prop is increased the 2bpf 3bpf of the balanced prop are slightly enhanced the main frequency of point c at cavitation condition is greater than wetted flow condition when the cavitation number is reduced from 1 6 to 1 3 the amplitude of the main frequency changes slightly at point b7 the main frequency magnitude of the biased prop is higher than the balanced prop for point c the main frequency magnitude of the balanced prop is higher than the biased prop in the cavitation state and the balanced prop behave in exactly the same as the biased prop in the full wetted flow state based on the above discussion it shows that the main component of the pressure pulsation in the propeller plane is the first three harmonics of blade frequency component the main component of the pressure pulsation in the wake is the first order blade frequency and under the condition of no cavitation the first order axial frequency also shows a large component 5 conclusions based on the rans method and the schneer sauer cavitation model the simulation of the steady open water performance and cavitation flow of the hspⅱ propeller is carried out the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data and the validity of the selected numerical model and calculation method is verified in this paper two propellers based on dtmb 4119 with different skew patterns and same skew angle was designed to study the cavitation patterns and pressure fluctuations from the numerical results one can draw some conclusions above all the vapor volume induced by the balanced prop is always smaller than that of the biased prop at the same operating condition it can be considered that the cavitation performance of the balanced prop is better besides studying pressure pulsations of balanced prop at different monitoring points it is found that for a clockwise propeller from the stern the pressure fluctuations on the starboard side is stronger than the port side those axially placed monitoring points the pressure fluctuations near the wake are stronger with the comparison of the pressure fluctuations at point c we found that once cavitation occurs the pressure fluctuation amplitudes of the point in the wake are higher than the amplitudes of the full wetted flow condition on the other hand the skew type has little effect on the pressure pulsation at point b7 where the pressure pulsation of the balanced prop is only slightly smaller than the biased prop finally we use fft technology to process the time domain pressure signal and obtain the frequency characteristics of the signal we conclude that whether it is cavitation or full wetted flow the b7 point above the propeller contains more harmonics of blade frequency the c point in the wake shows only the 1bpf at cavitation condition and also shows the first order axial frequency in the full wetted flow
