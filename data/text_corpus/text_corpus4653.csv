nowadays micron and submicron structures for example micro bars micro beams and micro plates are utilized in a lot of applications including several micro nano electro mechanical systems mems and nems such as micro actuators chaterjee and pohit 2009 micro switches samaali et al 2011 micro pumps laser and santiago 2004 nisar et al 2008 and atomic force microscopes afms rahaeifard et al 2009 in addition they have been used in different fields such as microbiology singh 2009 radiology dilmanianet al 2008 and biotechnology filippini et al 2003 small scale low potency usage and extraordinary mechanical properties are the main advantages of using these systems so there is a noteworthy interest among the researchers to study the mechanical behavior of such structures the size dependent vibration behaviors and deformations in micron and submicron elements are experimentally observed fleck et al 1994 mcfarland and colton 2005 stölken and evans 1998 these experiments have revealed a notable difference between the stiffness of materials in micro scale and those of the free scale that have been evaluated by the classical continuum mechanics theory so within the past years the researchers have found that the size dependent behavior is an intrinsic property of materials which will be appeared when the characteristic size e g diameter thickness is close to the material length scale parameter the length scale parameter of the materials can be obtained by experiments fleck et al 1994 stölken and evans 1998 lam et al 2003 therefore the classical deformation theories which have no internal material length scale parameter are unable to interpret the size dependent behavior of micron and submicron systems accordingly employing the higher order elasticity theories is inevitable which are acceptably adequate to capture the size dependency for this purpose some higher order elasticity theories such as strain gradient theory fleck and hutchinson 1993 2001 nonlocal elasticity theory eringen 1983 and couple stress theory kolter 1964 mindlin and tiersten 1962 toupin 1962 have been developed during the past years the couple stress theory is a non classical continuum theory proposed by mindlin and tiersten 1962 toupin 1962 and koiter 1964 in which the constitutive equations includes four material constants i e two lame constants and two higher order material length scale parameters it is worth mentioning that determining the material length scale parameters by experiments require much computational cost and plenty of time thus yang et al 2002 have proposed another higher order equilibrium equation to govern the behavior of couples in addition to the conventional equilibrium relations of forces and moments with this concept they have deduced that the material length scale parameters reduced to one rather than two in classical couple stress theory their formulations are well known as the modified couple stress theory jomehzadeh et al 2011 have utilized the kirchhoff plate model along with the modified couple stress theory to investigate the dynamic analysis of circular and rectangular microplates they have used the levy s method to obtain the solution the free vibration analysis of a mindlin microplate based on the modified couple stress theory has been carried out by ma et al 2011 and ke et al 2012 asghari and taati 2013 have investigated the static and dynamic behavior of a functionally graded fg microplate based on the kirchhoff theory along with the modified couple stress theory simsek et al 2015 have used the kirchhoff plate model and the modified couple stress theory to study the forced vibration analysis of a microplate that is subjected to a moving load according to the numerical results they have studied the influence of the material length scale parameter aspect ratio boundary conditions and the moving load velocity on the vibratory response of the microplate askari and tahani 2015 have established the extended kantorovich method ekm to obtain the free vibrational characteristics of the rectangular kirchhoff microplates with clamped boundary conditions and based on the modified couple stress theory thai and choi 2013 have studied the size dependent models for bending buckling and vibrations of the plate with simple boundary conditions the plate is made of functionally graded material fgm and they have used the kirchhoff and mindlin assumptions to model the kinematics of the plate li and pan 2015 have developed a size dependent model for static bending and free vibration of a functionally graded piezoelectric microplate they have adopted the modified couple stress and the extended sinusoidal plate theories adopting the kirchhoff plate theory in conjunction with the modified couple stress theory akgöz and civalek 2013 have investigated the effects of the additional length scale parameter and elastic foundation on the bending buckling and vibration of a thin microplate mounted on an elastic winkler foundation in recent years the study of fluid structure interaction fsi is increased it is well known that the vibration behavior of plates totally or partially immersed in fluid is certainly distinct from those in air this is due to the fact that the existence of fluid causes a noteworthy enhancement in the total kinetic energy of the plate consequently the natural frequencies relating to wet modes decrease notably compared with those relating to dry modes some selected published papers for the plate models in contact with a fluid are reviewed here as follows bauer 1981 has presented an analytical solution for the vibration of an elastic bottom of a rectangular tank which has been filled with an ideal fluid the simple end conditions have been considered for the plate vibrational characteristics of the vertical and horizontal square plates with fully clamped boundary conditions have been presented by fu and price 1987 the combination of the finite element method and a singularity panel distribution has been used by the authors in another study zhou and cheung 2000 have investigated the dynamic responses of an elastic plate which is in contact with an ideal fluid on one side by employing the rayleigh ritz method ergin and uğurlu 2003 have reported the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of cantilever plates contacting with a fluid they have verified their results with the experimental data of lindholm et al u s lindholm et al 1962 numerical data of fu and price 1987 and ansys a finite element software khorshidi and farhadi 2013 have carried out the free vibration analysis of a laminated composite rectangular plate partially or totally in contact with a finite fluid by using the rayleigh ritz method uğurlu et al 2008 and hosseini hashemi et al 2010 have examined the effects of pasternak foundation and ideal fluid on the natural frequencies of rectangular kirchhoff and mindlin plates respectively amabili 2000 has usefully considered the sloshing condition into the eigenvalue problems of vibrating structures contacting with stationary fluids and free surface area zhou and liu 2007 have investigated the dynamic response of the flexible rectangular tanks partially filled with an ideal fluid taking into account the surface waves bulging mode and sloshing mode they have used a combination of the rayleigh ritz method and the galerkin method to obtain the solution liao and ma 2016 have investigated the wet resonant frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of a rectangular plate located at the rigid bottom slab of a container which is filled with non viscose and compressible fluid kerboua et al 2008 have presented a comprehensive investigation on the natural frequencies of rectangular plates contacting with fluid by adopting the so called hybrid approach this approach is the combination of finite element framework and sander s shell theory as can be seen the analysis of a macroplate in contact with a fluid and also the static and dynamic analysis of a microplate based on the modified couple stress theory have been investigated and well discussed by the researchers to the best of the author s knowledge there is only one research in which that the vibrational analysis of a microplates contacting with a fluid has been performed by omiddezyani et al 2017 the assumptions of kirchhoff theory and also the modified couple stress theory have been used by the authors the purpose of this study is to investigate the size effect and fluid structure interaction on the vibrational characteristics of a rectangular microplate by taking into account the influences of rotary inertia and transverse shear deformation which have the remarkable role in the analysis of moderately thick microplates the first order shear deformation theory along with the modified couple stress theory has been used to perform the free vibrational analysis of the considered problem by employing the hamilton s principle the non classical equations of motion and also the corresponding boundary conditions are derived then the rayleigh ritz method has been applied to calculate the natural frequencies of the system finally based on the obtained results the effects of side to thickness ratio aspect ratio material length scale parameter and also the fluid height on the natural frequencies are discussed in detail 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 modified couple stress theory as mentioned earlier the modified couple stress theory has been successfully clarified by yang et al 2002 according to this new theory the couple stress tensor must be a symmetric tensor and since the strain energy u is assumed as an explicit function of strain tensor conjugate with symmetric stress tensor and symmetric curvature tensor conjugate with deviatoric part of the couple stress tensor there is only one material length scale parameter which is incorporated in the formulation of this theory the strain energy u of an isotropic linear elastic material is written as 1 u 1 2 λ σ ε m χ d λ where σ is the symmetric stress tensor ε is the strain tensor m is the deviatoric part of the couple stress tensor and χ is the symmetric curvature tensor which are respectively given by yang et al 2002 2 σ λ t r ε i 2 μ ε 3 ε 1 2 u u t 4 m 2 l 2 μ χ 5 χ 1 2 θ θ t here λ and μ are the lame constants and l is a material length scale parameter also u is the displacement vector and θ is the rotation vector expressed as 6 θ 1 2 curl u symmetry of σ and m are introduced in eqs 2 and 4 accordingly the symmetry of ε and χ can be deduced respectively it should be noted that the ratio of the curvature modulus to the shear modulus is the square of the material length scale parameter which appears in eq 4 and is an inherent property characterizing the influence of the couple stress mindlin 1963 2 2 microplate formulation as shown in fig 1 a fully simply supported rectangular isotropic microplate having length a width b and thickness h is considered it is supposed that the microplate is a part of the vertical wall of a rigid tank with width c and contacting with a bounded fluid on one side the fluid with depth d and mass density ρ f is assumed inviscid incompressible and its motion is irrotational in order to present the displacement components the cartesian coordinate system o x y z is selected so that the x y and z axes are in the directions along the length width and thickness of the plate respectively at any time t u v and w denote the displacements of an arbitrary point in the plate along the x y and z directions respectively on the basis of mindlin theory for the moderately thick plates the displacement components of an arbitrary point x y z in the plate can be written as 7 u x y z t z ψ x x y t 8 v x y z t z ψ y x y t 9 w x y z t w 0 x y t in which w 0 w is the transverse displacement of the middle surface and ψ x and are the rotation angle of a line originally normal to the mid surface before deformation about y and x axes respectively by assuming infinitesimal strain the non zero strain components can be expressed in view of eqs 3 and 7 9 10 ε x x z ψ x x ε y y z ψ y y γ x y z ψ x y ψ y x γ y z ψ y w y γ x z ψ x w x inserting eqs 7 9 into eq 6 yields 11 θ x 1 2 w y ψ y θ y 1 2 ψ x w x θ z 1 2 z ψ y x ψ x y using eq 11 into eq 5 we have 12 χ x x 1 2 2 w x y ψ y x χ y y 1 2 ψ x y 2 w x y χ z z 1 2 ψ y x ψ x y χ x y 1 4 2 w y 2 ψ y y ψ x x 2 w x 2 χ x z 1 4 z 2 ψ y x 2 2 ψ x x y χ y z 1 4 z 2 ψ y x y 2 ψ x y 2 and substituting eq 10 into eq 2 and eq 12 into eq 4 leads to the components of σ and m as 13 m x x μ l 2 2 w x y ψ y x m y y μ l 2 ψ x y 2 w x y m z z μ l 2 ψ y x ψ x y m x y 1 2 μ l 2 2 w y 2 ψ y y

x y ψ y x σ x z k s e 2 1 ν w x ψ x σ y z k s e 2 1 ν w y ψ y due to the fact that the shear stresses σ x z and σ y z are not constant over the thickness of the plate a shear correction factor should be used the shear correction coefficient is taken to be k s 5 6 moreover e and ν are the young modulus and poisson s ratio respectively which are related to the lamé constants as follow 15 λ e ν 1 ν 2 μ e 2 1 ν in view of eq 1 the total strain energy u p due to the deformation of the microplate can be expressed as 16 u p u c u n c 1 2 ω σ ε d v 1 2 ω m χ d v with the help of eq 10 and eq 14 the first integration on the right hand side of eq 16 i e u c can be written as 17a u c 1 2 0 a 0 b m x x ψ x x m y y ψ y y m x y ψ x y ψ y x n x ψ x w x n y ψ y w y d y d x the complete expression of the

should be mentioned that in eq 17b and the subsequent ones δ is used for the variation symbol substituting eq 14 into eqs 18a and 18b leads to 18c n x n y k s e h 2 1 υ 1 0 0 1 w x ψ x w y ψ y 18d m x

where the term 2 w x y is decomposed as 1 2 2 w x y 1 2 2 w y x similarly we have carried out this procedure for expressions 2 ψ x x y and 2 ψ y x y it should be mentioned that the couple moments υ i j i j x y z and higher order couple moments h i j i j x y z which are introduced in the above equation are stated as 20a υ x x υ y y υ z z υ x y h 2 h 2 m x x m y y m z z m x y d z 20b h x z h y z h 2 h 2 m x z m y z z d z substituting eq 13 into eqs 20a and 20b leads to 20c υ x x υ y y υ z z υ x y e l 2 h 2 1 υ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 2 w x y ψ y x ψ x y 2 w x y ψ y x ψ x y 2 w y 2 2 w x

the mass moments of inertia i 0 i 2 can be described as follows 22 i 0 i 2 h 2 h 2 ρ 1 z 2 d z ρ h h 3 12 2 3 fluid formulation it is beneficial to note that there are two familiar vibrational modes in the fluid structure systems the bulging modes and the sloshing ones the bulging modes are caused by the vibration of the flexible structure which moves the fluid on the contrary the sloshing modes are related to the rigid body movement of the container that makes vibration in the fluid free surface amabili 2000 the reason for division of the fluid velocity potential into two parts i e bulging and sloshing potentials is to apply the boundary conditions of the problem in a better and simple manner as stated above the dynamic behavior of the fluid can be described by the fluid velocity potential if φ b x y z t and φ s x y z t are used to denote the fluid velocity potential associated with the bulging modes and sloshing ones respectively we can obtain the total velocity potential of the fluid φ o x y z t by using the concept of superposition principle as 23 φ o φ b φ s also the velocity potential φ o x y z t is related to the deformation potential φ o x y z as follows amabili 2000 24 φ o x y z t φ o x y z t t i ω φ o x y z e i ω t in which ω is the angular frequency i 1 denotes the imaginary unit and t is the time the fluid velocity is equal to the gradient of the velocity potential i e v φ o likewise the continuity equation for an incompressible flow with constant density is v 0 by inserting the above equation in the equation v φ o one can find that the velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation then we have 25 2 φ o 2 φ b 2 φ s 0 2 φ b 0 2 φ s 0 where 2 is the laplace operator and in two dimensions of cartesian coordinate it has the form 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 for the rigid surfaces of the container the impermeability condition can be given as 26a φ b x x 0 a 0 φ b y y 0 0 φ b z z c 0 26b φ s x x 0 a 0 φ s y y 0 0 φ s z z 0 c 0 neglecting the waves on the free surface φ b must satisfy the following boundary condition 27 φ b y d 0 moreover the velocity components of the fluid and elastic plate in the transverse direction must be equal at the fluid plate interface so the compatibility condition can be written as 28 φ b z z 0 w t the linearized sloshing condition at the fluid free surface can be expressed as amabili 2000 29 φ o y y d ω 2 g φ o y d where g is the acceleration due to gravity inserting eq 23 in eq 29 and considering eq 27 eq 29 takes the following form 30 φ b y y d φ s y y d ω 2 g φ s y d multiplying this equation by ρ f φ s and integrating over the fluid free surface one can get 31 u φ b u φ s ω 2 t φ s in which 32 u φ b ρ f 0 a 0 c φ s φ b y y d d z d x u φ s ρ f 0 a 0 c φ s φ s y y d d z d x t φ s ρ f g 0 a 0 c φ s 2 y d d z d x the corresponding fluid velocity potentials can be easily obtained by solving eq 25 and with the help of boundary conditions which have been presented in eq 26a applying the method of separation of variables it follows that 33a φ b x y z t i ω φ b x y z e i ω t 33b φ b x y z φ b x x φ b y y φ b z z 33c 2 φ b x 2 2 φ b y 2 2 φ b z 2 0 by inserting eq 33b in eq 33c we can obtain 34 1 φ bx x d 2 φ bx x d x 2 1 φ by y d 2 φ by y d y 2 1 φ bz z d 2 φ bz z d z 2 0 eq 34 can be separated as 35a 1 φ b x x d 2 φ b x x d x 2 p 1 2 35b 1 φ by y d 2 φ by y d y 2 q 1 2 35c 1 φ b z z d 2 φ b z z d z 2 p 1 2 q 1 2 where p 1 2 and q 1 2 are optional nonnegative real number now the general solution of equations 35a 35b and 35c will become 36a φ b x x a 1 sin p 1 x a 2 cos p 1 x 36b φ b y y a 3 sin q 1 y a 4 cos q 1 y 36c φ b z z a 5 e p 1 2 q 1 2 z a 6 e p 1 2 q 1 2 z considering the boundary conditions i e eq 26 and then substituting into eq 33a one obtains the expression of the fluid velocity potential for the corresponding bulging modes as follows 37 φ b x y z t l 0 k 0 i ω a l k t cos l π a x cos 2 k 1 π 2 d y e σ z e σ 2 c z where l and k are nonnegative integers and a l k t is the undetermined coefficients and 38 σ π l a 2 2 k 1 2 d 2 in the following the compatibility condition is written as 39 l 0 k 0 i ω a l k t σ 1 e 2 c σ cos l π a x cos 2 k 1 π 2 d y w x y t t we can consider the above equation as the double fourier series this leads to determine the corresponding fourier coefficient a l k t in the form 40 a l k t ε l k i ω a d σ 1 e 2 c σ 0 a 0 d w x y t t cos l π a x cos 2 k 1 π 2 d y d y d x where 41 ε l k 1 i f l a n d k 0 2 i f l o r k 0 4 i f l a n d k 0 similarly by employing the separation of variables method φ s x y z t φ s x x φ s y y φ s z z e i ω t gives the following linear differential equation 42 1 φ sx x d 2 φ sx x d x 2 1 φ sy y d 2 φ sy y d y 2 1 φ sz z d 2 φ sz z d z 2 0 which can be written as 43a 1 φ s x x d 2 φ s x x d x 2 p 2 2 43b 1 φ s z z d 2 φ s z z d z 2 q 2 2 43c 1 φ s y y d 2 φ s y y d y 2 p 2 2 q 2 2 where p 2 2 and q 2 2 are optional nonnegative real number we obtain the general solutions of equations 43a 43b and 43c by employing the fundamental ordinary differential equations 44a φ s x x a 7 sin p 1 x a 8 c o s p 2 x 44b φ s z z a 9 sin q 2 z a 10 c o s q 2 z 44c φ s y y a 11 e p 2 2 q 2 2 y a 12 e p 2 2 q 2 2 y which should satisfy the boundary conditions 26b afterward the expression for the fluid velocity potential of the sloshing mode is expressed as follows 45 φ s x y z t i 0 j 0 i ω b i j t cos i π a x cosh τ y c o s j π c z where i and j are nonnegative integers and b i j t is the undetermined coefficients and 46 τ π i a 2 j c 2 based on our assumptions for the fluid i e incompressible inviscid and irrotational the kinetic energy of the fluid can be written as 47 t f 1 2 ρ f v φ o 2 d v where φ o v and ρ f are the velocity vector fluid domain and fluid density respectively by adopting the divergence s theorem to the abovementioned equation and considering the boundary and compatibility conditions i e eq 26b and eq 28 the total fluid kinetic energy can be expressed more conveniently as 48 t f t f b t f s 1 2 ρ f 0 a 0 d φ o φ o z z 0 d a 1 2 ρ f 0 a 0 d φ b φ s z 0 w t d y d x taking the first variation of t f gives 49 δ t f 1 2 ρ f 0 a 0 d φ b φ s z 0 t δ w d y d x 3 governing

eqs 17 19 21 and 49 into eq 50 applying divergence s theorem and making some mathematical calculations and simplifications the size dependent governing equation of motion and corresponding boundary conditions are derived as follows 51 n x x n y y 1 2 2 υ x x x y 2 υ y y x y 2 υ x y y 2 2 υ x y x 2 1 2 ρ f φ b φ s z 0 i 0 2 w t 2 m x x x m x y y n x 1 2 υ y y y υ z z y υ x y x 2 h x z x y 2 h y z

eigenvalue problem out of which the natural frequencies as the eigenvalues and corresponding mode shapes as the eigenvectors can be determined 4 numerical results and discussion by considering that the series solution has been used in this research we require to assay the convergence of the numerical results which is provided in table 1 this table represents the first three dimensionless natural frequencies here defined as ω ω a 2 ρ h d for a rectangular microplate partially coupled with fluid the parameter d e h 3 12 1 ν 2 is the flexural rigidity of the plate based on this convergence study it is clearly seen that as the number of terms used in series summation increases the natural frequencies converge to the specified amounts hence we used m n 10 for the approximation series of microplate and m 1 n 1 6 for the fluid velocity potential hereafter in the following to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the present method a comparison effort has been carried the comparison has been performed with the results given by omiddezyani et al 2017 uğurlu et al 2008 and khorshidi and farhadi 2013 for a rectangular macroplate in contact with a fluid the results are tabulated in table 2 in this table the natural frequencies for the simply supported macroplate coupled with an incompressible fluid are presented for various ratios of fluid depth the numerical results given in this table are obtained for a macroplate which is made of concrete with the following geometrical and material properties a 10 m b 10 m h 0 15 m ρ 2400 k g m 3 e 25 g p a a n d υ 0 15 the mass density of fluid and the width of the container are considered to be ρ f 1000 k g m 3 and c 100 m respectively from table 2 it can be seen that the results obtained through the present solution are in excellent agreement with those presented in refs khorshidi and farhadi 2013 uğurlu et al 2008 omiddezyani et al 2017 another comparative study has been carried out for the first three natural frequencies of a simply supported square microplate in air and the results have been listed in table 3 it is assumed that the microplate is made of epoxy with the following dimensions and material properties e 1 44 g p a υ 0 38 ρ 1220 kg m 3 l 17 6 μ m a b 1 a n d h l 2 it should be mentioned that the mindlin plate theory and kirchhoff plate theory have been used by refs ke et al 2012 omiddezyani et al 2017 yin et al 2010 respectively as it can be seen from this table very good agreements have been observed likewise the differences in natural frequencies for mindlin and kirchhoff theories are nearly large when the side to thickness ratio of the microplate is small e g a h 20 but they are dwindling by increasing the side to thickness ratio this is due to the fact that the influences of the shear deformation and rotary inertia are considered in the mindlin theory while they are omitted in kirchhoff theory next the influences of different parameters such as dimensionless thickness h l material length scale parameter l side to thickness ratio a h aspect ratio a b and fluid depth ratio d b on the wet natural frequencies of simply supported microplates in contact with fluid are assessed in detail unless mentioned otherwise it is considered that the microplate is made of epoxy and the material properties are assumed the same as those presented in previous examples in fig 2 the variation of the fundamental natural frequency versus the dimensionless thickness of a square microplate in contact with the fluid has been investigated also a comparison between the fundamental frequency predicted by the modified couple stress theory and those of the classical ones is demonstrated in this figure the numerical results have been obtained for the values of a h 5 and d b 0 3 it should be noted that in obtaining the results for the classical one we set the material length scale parameter to zero and the plate thickness is calculated via the relation h the ratio of h l 17 6 μ m the ratio of h l is taken from the axial axes of fig 2 it is observed that the fundamental frequencies obtained by the present mindlin plate model are always greater than those obtained by the classical mindlin theory it reveals that the microplate model based on the modified couple stress theory is stiffer than ones modeled by the classical plate theory moreover it comes to conclusion that the differences between the frequencies anticipated by the present and classical models are notable when the dimensionless thickness of the microplate is relatively small h l 5 but they are declining when the dimensionless thickness of the microplate becomes large h l 5 this behavior can be interpreted as when the microplate thickness is comparable to its material length scale parameter the size effects are significant the influences of length scale parameter l and also aspect ratio a b on the first three natural frequencies of a rectangular microplate contacting with the fluid are presented in table 4 the results have been extracted for the values of h 100 μ m a h 10 and d b 0 2 in accordance with these results it is found that by increasing the material length scale parameter l and aspect ratio a b of microplate the natural frequencies will increase fig 3 displays the effect of side to thickness ratio a h on the fundamental frequency of a microplate in contact with fluid for different values of dimensionless thickness ratio h l it is evident that by increasing the side to thickness ratio a h the fundamental frequencies of the system decrease which is due to the decreasing of the overall stiffness of the microplate it is worth mentioning that the rate of this decrease is considerable for thick or moderately thick microplates e g a h 20 the variation of fundamental frequency of the microplate in contact with fluid versus the aspect ratio a b and for different values of h l is depicted in fig 4 it is clearly observed that the fundamental frequency reduces dramatically when the aspect ratio a b increases from 0 5 to 1 5 this reduction becomes less pronounced by increasing the aspect ratio besides the effect of h l on the frequency is more significant for small values of aspect ratio e g a b 1 fig 5 shows the variation of fundamental natural frequency versus the fluid depth d b and for various values of thickness ratio a h as a result one can say that the fundamental natural frequency of the square microplate in contact with fluid decreases as the depth of fluid d b increases moreover in order to study this effect on the higher order natural frequencies the first ten dimensionless natural frequencies of a rectangular microplate with h 5 l a 12 h and b a 0 5 and coupled with fluid are listed in table 5 in which the depth of fluid is varying from 0 to 0 5 according to table 5 it is again concluded that increasing the fluid depth ratio d b leads to a reduction in the natural frequencies of microplate in order to have a suitable sense of the interaction between fluid and structure the first six mode shapes of a rectangular microplate are depicted in figs 6 and 7 for the microplate in air and in contact with fluid respectively it is clearly shown in these figures that the shapes of the typical first six modes are distorted because of the fluid microplate interaction system 5 conclusion in this paper the size dependent vibrational behavior of an elastic isotropic rectangular microplate has been studied in which one side of the microplate has been coupled with an ideal fluid modified couple stress theory based on the first order shear deformation assumptions is used to mathematically model the problem hamilton s principle has been employed to derive non classical governing differential equations of motion and corresponding boundary conditions the obtained eigenvalue problem related to the free vibration of a simply supported rectangular microplate coupled with fluid is analytically solved by directly utilizing the rayleigh ritz method the efficiency and accuracy of the obtained results have been validated and examined by comparing the results with those reported in the literature and very good agreement has been achieved eventually a parametric study has been performed to figure out the influences of main parameters such as the material length scale parameter dimensionless thickness side to thickness ratio aspect ratio and fluid depth ratio on the natural frequencies of rectangular mindlin microplate contacting with fluid based on the derived results there are the following main conclusions in the case of interaction between microplate and fluid it was seen that increasing the fluid depth ratio leads to a reduction in the natural frequencies of microplate the wet mode shapes of the microplate have a direct relation with the depth of fluid that means the shapes of wet mode are more distorted as the fluid depth ratio increases considering the size effects it was observed that the natural frequencies of microplate coupled with fluid which predicted by present mindlin plate model are always greater than those obtained by classical mindlin theory the fundamental natural frequencies of microplate coupled with fluid increases as the material length scale parameter increases by increasing the values of side to thickness and aspect ratio the fundamental natural frequencies of the system decreases for different values of dimensionless thickness appendix a upon substituting eqs 18c and 18d for the shear forces n i j and bending moments m i j into the classical strain energy 17a it can be expressed in the following form a 1 u c 1 2 0 a 0 b e h 3 12 1 ν 2 ψ x x 2 ψ y y 2 2 ν ψ y y ψ x x 1 ν 2 ψ x y 2 1 ν ψ y x ψ x y 1 ν 2 ψ y x 2 k s e h 2 1 υ w x 2 ψ x 2 2 w

23265,in this paper the size effect and fluid structure interaction on the vibrational characteristics of a simply supported rectangular microplate is investigated the influences of rotary inertia and transverse shear deformation which have the remarkable role in the analysis of moderately thick microplates are considered the first order shear deformation theory along with the modified couple stress theory has been used to perform the free vibrational analysis of the considered problem the hamilton s principle is employed to derive the governing differential equations of motion and the corresponding boundary conditions the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational the fluid velocity potential is obtained using the boundary and compatibility conditions then the rayleigh ritz method has been applied to calculate the natural frequencies of the system a convergence study is carried out the obtained results are compared against available data in the published papers and very good agreements have been observed finally by referring to the numerical results the effects of dimensionless thickness side to thickness ratio aspect ratio material length scale parameter and fluid depth ratio on the natural frequencies are discussed in details keywords free vibration fluid microplate interaction modified couple stress rayleigh ritz method 1 introduction nowadays micron and submicron structures for example micro bars micro beams and micro plates are utilized in a lot of applications including several micro nano electro mechanical systems mems and nems such as micro actuators chaterjee and pohit 2009 micro switches samaali et al 2011 micro pumps laser and santiago 2004 nisar et al 2008 and atomic force microscopes afms rahaeifard et al 2009 in addition they have been used in different fields such as microbiology singh 2009 radiology dilmanianet al 2008 and biotechnology filippini et al 2003 small scale low potency usage and extraordinary mechanical properties are the main advantages of using these systems so there is a noteworthy interest among the researchers to study the mechanical behavior of such structures the size dependent vibration behaviors and deformations in micron and submicron elements are experimentally observed fleck et al 1994 mcfarland and colton 2005 stölken and evans 1998 these experiments have revealed a notable difference between the stiffness of materials in micro scale and those of the free scale that have been evaluated by the classical continuum mechanics theory so within the past years the researchers have found that the size dependent behavior is an intrinsic property of materials which will be appeared when the characteristic size e g diameter thickness is close to the material length scale parameter the length scale parameter of the materials can be obtained by experiments fleck et al 1994 stölken and evans 1998 lam et al 2003 therefore the classical deformation theories which have no internal material length scale parameter are unable to interpret the size dependent behavior of micron and submicron systems accordingly employing the higher order elasticity theories is inevitable which are acceptably adequate to capture the size dependency for this purpose some higher order elasticity theories such as strain gradient theory fleck and hutchinson 1993 2001 nonlocal elasticity theory eringen 1983 and couple stress theory kolter 1964 mindlin and tiersten 1962 toupin 1962 have been developed during the past years the couple stress theory is a non classical continuum theory proposed by mindlin and tiersten 1962 toupin 1962 and koiter 1964 in which the constitutive equations includes four material constants i e two lame constants and two higher order material length scale parameters it is worth mentioning that determining the material length scale parameters by experiments require much computational cost and plenty of time thus yang et al 2002 have proposed another higher order equilibrium equation to govern the behavior of couples in addition to the conventional equilibrium relations of forces and moments with this concept they have deduced that the material length scale parameters reduced to one rather than two in classical couple stress theory their formulations are well known as the modified couple stress theory jomehzadeh et al 2011 have utilized the kirchhoff plate model along with the modified couple stress theory to investigate the dynamic analysis of circular and rectangular microplates they have used the levy s method to obtain the solution the free vibration analysis of a mindlin microplate based on the modified couple stress theory has been carried out by ma et al 2011 and ke et al 2012 asghari and taati 2013 have investigated the static and dynamic behavior of a functionally graded fg microplate based on the kirchhoff theory along with the modified couple stress theory simsek et al 2015 have used the kirchhoff plate model and the modified couple stress theory to study the forced vibration analysis of a microplate that is subjected to a moving load according to the numerical results they have studied the influence of the material length scale parameter aspect ratio boundary conditions and the moving load velocity on the vibratory response of the microplate askari and tahani 2015 have established the extended kantorovich method ekm to obtain the free vibrational characteristics of the rectangular kirchhoff microplates with clamped boundary conditions and based on the modified couple stress theory thai and choi 2013 have studied the size dependent models for bending buckling and vibrations of the plate with simple boundary conditions the plate is made of functionally graded material fgm and they have used the kirchhoff and mindlin assumptions to model the kinematics of the plate li and pan 2015 have developed a size dependent model for static bending and free vibration of a functionally graded piezoelectric microplate they have adopted the modified couple stress and the extended sinusoidal plate theories adopting the kirchhoff plate theory in conjunction with the modified couple stress theory akgöz and civalek 2013 have investigated the effects of the additional length scale parameter and elastic foundation on the bending buckling and vibration of a thin microplate mounted on an elastic winkler foundation in recent years the study of fluid structure interaction fsi is increased it is well known that the vibration behavior of plates totally or partially immersed in fluid is certainly distinct from those in air this is due to the fact that the existence of fluid causes a noteworthy enhancement in the total kinetic energy of the plate consequently the natural frequencies relating to wet modes decrease notably compared with those relating to dry modes some selected published papers for the plate models in contact with a fluid are reviewed here as follows bauer 1981 has presented an analytical solution for the vibration of an elastic bottom of a rectangular tank which has been filled with an ideal fluid the simple end conditions have been considered for the plate vibrational characteristics of the vertical and horizontal square plates with fully clamped boundary conditions have been presented by fu and price 1987 the combination of the finite element method and a singularity panel distribution has been used by the authors in another study zhou and cheung 2000 have investigated the dynamic responses of an elastic plate which is in contact with an ideal fluid on one side by employing the rayleigh ritz method ergin and uğurlu 2003 have reported the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of cantilever plates contacting with a fluid they have verified their results with the experimental data of lindholm et al u s lindholm et al 1962 numerical data of fu and price 1987 and ansys a finite element software khorshidi and farhadi 2013 have carried out the free vibration analysis of a laminated composite rectangular plate partially or totally in contact with a finite fluid by using the rayleigh ritz method uğurlu et al 2008 and hosseini hashemi et al 2010 have examined the effects of pasternak foundation and ideal fluid on the natural frequencies of rectangular kirchhoff and mindlin plates respectively amabili 2000 has usefully considered the sloshing condition into the eigenvalue problems of vibrating structures contacting with stationary fluids and free surface area zhou and liu 2007 have investigated the dynamic response of the flexible rectangular tanks partially filled with an ideal fluid taking into account the surface waves bulging mode and sloshing mode they have used a combination of the rayleigh ritz method and the galerkin method to obtain the solution liao and ma 2016 have investigated the wet resonant frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of a rectangular plate located at the rigid bottom slab of a container which is filled with non viscose and compressible fluid kerboua et al 2008 have presented a comprehensive investigation on the natural frequencies of rectangular plates contacting with fluid by adopting the so called hybrid approach this approach is the combination of finite element framework and sander s shell theory as can be seen the analysis of a macroplate in contact with a fluid and also the static and dynamic analysis of a microplate based on the modified couple stress theory have been investigated and well discussed by the researchers to the best of the author s knowledge there is only one research in which that the vibrational analysis of a microplates contacting with a fluid has been performed by omiddezyani et al 2017 the assumptions of kirchhoff theory and also the modified couple stress theory have been used by the authors the purpose of this study is to investigate the size effect and fluid structure interaction on the vibrational characteristics of a rectangular microplate by taking into account the influences of rotary inertia and transverse shear deformation which have the remarkable role in the analysis of moderately thick microplates the first order shear deformation theory along with the modified couple stress theory has been used to perform the free vibrational analysis of the considered problem by employing the hamilton s principle the non classical equations of motion and also the corresponding boundary conditions are derived then the rayleigh ritz method has been applied to calculate the natural frequencies of the system finally based on the obtained results the effects of side to thickness ratio aspect ratio material length scale parameter and also the fluid height on the natural frequencies are discussed in detail 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 modified couple stress theory as mentioned earlier the modified couple stress theory has been successfully clarified by yang et al 2002 according to this new theory the couple stress tensor must be a symmetric tensor and since the strain energy u is assumed as an explicit function of strain tensor conjugate with symmetric stress tensor and symmetric curvature tensor conjugate with deviatoric part of the couple stress tensor there is only one material length scale parameter which is incorporated in the formulation of this theory the strain energy u of an isotropic linear elastic material is written as 1 u 1 2 λ σ ε m χ d λ where σ is the symmetric stress tensor ε is the strain tensor m is the deviatoric part of the couple stress tensor and χ is the symmetric curvature tensor which are respectively given by yang et al 2002 2 σ λ t r ε i 2 μ ε 3 ε 1 2 u u t 4 m 2 l 2 μ χ 5 χ 1 2 θ θ t here λ and μ are the lame constants and l is a material length scale parameter also u is the displacement vector and θ is the rotation vector expressed as 6 θ 1 2 curl u symmetry of σ and m are introduced in eqs 2 and 4 accordingly the symmetry of ε and χ can be deduced respectively it should be noted that the ratio of the curvature modulus to the shear modulus is the square of the material length scale parameter which appears in eq 4 and is an inherent property characterizing the influence of the couple stress mindlin 1963 2 2 microplate formulation as shown in fig 1 a fully simply supported rectangular isotropic microplate having length a width b and thickness h is considered it is supposed that the microplate is a part of the vertical wall of a rigid tank with width c and contacting with a bounded fluid on one side the fluid with depth d and mass density ρ f is assumed inviscid incompressible and its motion is irrotational in order to present the displacement components the cartesian coordinate system o x y z is selected so that the x y and z axes are in the directions along the length width and thickness of the plate respectively at any time t u v and w denote the displacements of an arbitrary point in the plate along the x y and z directions respectively on the basis of mindlin theory for the moderately thick plates the displacement components of an arbitrary point x y z in the plate can be written as 7 u x y z t z ψ x x y t 8 v x y z t z ψ y x y t 9 w x y z t w 0 x y t in which w 0 w is the transverse displacement of the middle surface and ψ x and are the rotation angle of a line originally normal to the mid surface before deformation about y and x axes respectively by assuming infinitesimal strain the non zero strain components can be expressed in view of eqs 3 and 7 9 10 ε x x z ψ x x ε y y z ψ y y γ x y z ψ x y ψ y x γ y z ψ y w y γ x z ψ x w x inserting eqs 7 9 into eq 6 yields 11 θ x 1 2 w y ψ y θ y 1 2 ψ x w x θ z 1 2 z ψ y x ψ x y using

be used the shear correction coefficient is taken to be k s 5 6 moreover e and ν are the young modulus and poisson s ratio respectively which are related to the lamé constants as follow 15 λ e ν 1 ν 2 μ e 2 1 ν in view of eq 1 the total strain energy u p due to the deformation of the microplate can be expressed as 16 u p u c u n c 1 2 ω σ ε d v 1 2 ω m χ d v with the help of eq 10 and eq 14 the

in the fluid structure systems the bulging modes and the sloshing ones the bulging modes are caused by the vibration of the flexible structure which moves the fluid on the contrary the sloshing modes are related to the rigid body movement of the container that makes vibration in the fluid free surface amabili 2000 the reason for division of the fluid velocity potential into two parts i e bulging and sloshing potentials is to apply the boundary conditions of the problem in a better and simple manner as stated above the dynamic behavior of the fluid can be described by the fluid velocity potential if φ b x y z t and φ s x y z t are used to denote the fluid velocity potential associated with the bulging modes and sloshing ones respectively we can obtain the total velocity potential of the fluid φ o x y z t by using the concept of superposition principle as 23 φ o φ b φ s also the velocity potential φ o x y z t is related to the deformation potential φ o x y z as follows amabili 2000 24 φ o x y z t φ o x y z t t i ω φ o x y z e i ω t in which ω is the angular frequency i 1 denotes the imaginary unit and t is the time the fluid velocity is equal to the gradient of the velocity potential i e v φ o likewise the continuity equation for an incompressible flow with constant density is v 0 by inserting the above equation in the equation v φ o one can find that the velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation then we have 25 2 φ o 2 φ b 2 φ s 0 2 φ b 0 2 φ s 0 where 2 is the laplace operator and in two dimensions of cartesian coordinate it has the form 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 for the rigid surfaces of the container the impermeability condition can be given as 26a φ b x x 0 a 0 φ b y y 0 0 φ b z z c 0 26b φ s x x 0 a 0 φ s y y 0 0 φ s z z 0 c 0 neglecting the waves on the free surface φ b must satisfy the following boundary condition 27 φ b y d 0 moreover the velocity components of the fluid and elastic plate in the transverse direction must be equal at the fluid plate interface so the compatibility condition can be written as 28 φ b z z 0 w t the linearized sloshing condition at the fluid free surface can be expressed as amabili 2000 29 φ o y y d ω 2 g φ o y d where g is the acceleration due to gravity inserting eq 23 in eq 29 and considering eq 27 eq 29 takes the following form 30 φ b y y d φ s y y d ω 2 g φ s y d multiplying this equation by ρ f φ s and integrating over the fluid free surface one can get 31 u φ b u φ s ω 2 t φ s in which 32 u φ b ρ f 0 a 0 c φ s φ b y y d d z d x u φ s ρ f 0 a 0 c φ s φ s y y d d z d x t φ s ρ f g 0 a 0 c φ s 2 y d d z d x the corresponding fluid velocity potentials can be easily obtained by solving eq 25 and with the help of boundary conditions which have been presented in eq 26a applying the method of separation of variables it follows that 33a φ b x y z t i ω φ b x y z e i ω t 33b φ b x y z φ b x x φ b y y φ b z z 33c 2 φ b x 2 2 φ b y 2 2 φ b z 2 0 by inserting eq 33b in eq 33c we can obtain 34 1 φ bx x d 2 φ bx x d x 2 1 φ by y d 2 φ by y d y 2 1 φ bz z d 2 φ bz z d z 2 0 eq 34 can be separated as 35a 1 φ b x x d 2 φ b x x d x 2 p 1 2 35b 1 φ by y d 2 φ by y d y 2 q 1 2 35c 1 φ b z z d 2 φ b z z d z 2 p 1 2 q 1 2 where p 1 2 and q 1 2 are optional nonnegative real number now the general solution of equations 35a 35b and 35c will become 36a φ b x x a 1 sin p 1 x a 2 cos p 1 x 36b φ b y y a 3 sin q 1 y a 4 cos q 1 y 36c φ b z z a 5 e p 1 2 q 1 2 z a 6 e p 1 2 q 1 2 z considering the boundary conditions i e eq 26 and then substituting into eq 33a one obtains the expression of the fluid velocity potential for the corresponding bulging modes as follows 37 φ b x y z t l 0 k 0 i ω a l k t cos l π a x cos 2 k 1 π 2 d y e σ z e σ 2 c z where l and k are nonnegative integers and a l k t is the undetermined coefficients and 38 σ π l a 2 2 k 1 2 d 2 in the following the compatibility condition is written as 39 l 0 k 0 i ω a l k t σ 1 e 2 c σ cos l π a x cos 2 k 1 π 2 d y w x y t t we can consider the above equation as the double fourier series this leads to determine the corresponding fourier coefficient a l k t in the form 40 a l k t ε l k i ω a d σ 1 e 2 c σ 0 a 0 d w x y t t cos l π a x cos 2 k 1 π 2 d y d y d x where 41 ε l k 1 i f l a n d k 0 2 i f l o r k 0 4 i f l a n d k 0 similarly by employing the separation of variables method φ s x y z t φ s x x φ s y y φ s z z e i ω t gives the following linear differential equation 42 1 φ sx x d 2 φ sx x d x 2 1 φ sy y d 2 φ sy y d y 2 1 φ sz z d 2 φ sz z d z 2 0 which can be written as 43a 1 φ s x x d 2 φ s x x d x 2 p 2 2 43b 1 φ s z z d 2 φ s z z d z 2 q 2 2 43c 1 φ s y y d 2 φ s y y d y 2 p 2 2 q 2 2 where p 2 2 and q 2 2 are optional nonnegative real number we obtain the general solutions of equations 43a 43b and 43c by employing the fundamental ordinary differential equations 44a φ s x x a 7 sin p 1 x a 8 c o s p 2 x 44b φ s z z a 9 sin q 2 z a 10 c o s q 2 z 44c φ s y y a 11 e p 2 2 q 2 2 y a 12 e p 2 2 q 2 2 y which should satisfy the boundary conditions 26b afterward the expression for the fluid velocity potential of the sloshing mode is expressed as follows 45 φ s x y z t i 0 j 0 i ω b i j t cos i π a x cosh τ y c o s j π c z where i and j are nonnegative integers and b i j t is the undetermined coefficients and 46 τ π i a 2 j c 2 based on our assumptions for the fluid i e incompressible inviscid and irrotational the kinetic energy of the fluid can be written as 47 t f 1 2 ρ f v φ o 2 d v where φ o v and ρ f are the velocity vector fluid domain and fluid density respectively by adopting the divergence s theorem to the abovementioned equation and considering the boundary and compatibility conditions i e eq 26b and eq 28 the total fluid kinetic energy can be expressed more conveniently as

eigenvalue problem out of which the natural frequencies as the eigenvalues and corresponding mode shapes as the eigenvectors can be determined 4 numerical results and discussion by considering that the series solution has been used in this research we require to assay the convergence of the numerical results which is provided in table 1 this table represents the first three dimensionless natural frequencies here defined as ω ω a 2 ρ h d for a rectangular microplate partially coupled with fluid the parameter d e h 3 12 1 ν 2 is the flexural rigidity of the plate based on this convergence study it is clearly seen that as the number of terms used in series summation increases the natural frequencies converge to the specified amounts hence we used m n 10 for the approximation series of microplate and m 1 n 1 6 for the fluid velocity potential hereafter in the following to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the present method a comparison effort has been carried the comparison has been performed with the results given by omiddezyani et al 2017 uğurlu et al 2008 and khorshidi and farhadi 2013 for a rectangular macroplate in contact with a fluid the results are tabulated in table 2 in this table the natural frequencies for the simply supported macroplate coupled with an incompressible fluid are presented for various ratios of fluid depth the numerical results given in this table are obtained for a macroplate which is made of concrete with the following geometrical and material properties a 10 m b 10 m h 0 15 m ρ 2400 k g m 3 e 25 g p a a n d υ 0 15 the mass density of fluid and the width of the container are considered to be ρ f 1000 k g m 3 and c 100 m respectively from table 2 it can be seen that the results obtained through the present solution are in excellent agreement with those presented in refs khorshidi and farhadi 2013 uğurlu et al 2008 omiddezyani et al 2017 another comparative study has been carried out for the first three natural frequencies of a simply supported square microplate in air and the results have been listed in table 3 it is assumed that the microplate is made of epoxy with the following dimensions and material properties e 1 44 g p a υ 0 38 ρ 1220 kg m 3 l 17 6 μ m a b 1 a n d h l 2 it should be mentioned that the mindlin plate theory and kirchhoff plate theory have been used by refs ke et al 2012 omiddezyani et al 2017 yin et al 2010 respectively as it can be seen from this table very good agreements have been observed likewise the differences in natural frequencies for mindlin and kirchhoff theories are nearly large when the side to thickness ratio of the microplate is small e g a h 20 but they are dwindling by increasing the side to thickness ratio this is due to the fact that the influences of the shear deformation and rotary inertia are considered in the mindlin theory while they are omitted in kirchhoff theory next the influences of different parameters such as dimensionless thickness h l material length scale parameter l side to thickness ratio a h aspect ratio a b and fluid depth ratio d b on the wet natural frequencies of simply supported microplates in contact with fluid are assessed in detail unless mentioned otherwise it is considered that the microplate is made of epoxy and the material properties are assumed the same as those presented in previous examples in fig 2 the variation of the fundamental natural frequency versus the dimensionless thickness of a square microplate in contact with the fluid has been investigated also a comparison between the fundamental frequency predicted by the modified couple stress theory and those of the classical ones is demonstrated in this figure the numerical results have been obtained for the values of a h 5 and d b 0 3 it should be noted that in obtaining the results for the classical one we set the material length scale parameter to zero and the plate thickness is calculated via the relation h the ratio of h l 17 6 μ m the ratio of h l is taken from the axial axes of fig 2 it is observed that the fundamental frequencies obtained by the present mindlin plate model are always greater than those obtained by the classical mindlin theory it reveals that the microplate model based on the modified couple stress theory is stiffer than ones modeled by the classical plate theory moreover it comes to conclusion that the differences between the frequencies anticipated by the present and classical models are notable when the dimensionless thickness of the microplate is relatively small h l 5 but they are declining when the dimensionless thickness of the microplate becomes large h l 5 this behavior can be interpreted as when the microplate thickness is comparable to its material length scale parameter the size effects are significant the influences of length scale parameter l and also aspect ratio a b on the first three natural frequencies of a rectangular microplate contacting with the fluid are presented in table 4 the results have been extracted for the values of h 100 μ m a h 10 and d b 0 2 in accordance with these results it is found that by increasing the material length scale parameter l and aspect ratio a b of microplate the natural frequencies will increase fig 3 displays the effect of side to thickness ratio a h on the fundamental frequency of a microplate in contact with fluid for different values of dimensionless thickness ratio h l it is evident that by increasing the side to thickness ratio a h the fundamental frequencies of the system decrease which is due to the decreasing of the overall stiffness of the microplate it is worth mentioning that the rate of this decrease is considerable for thick or moderately thick microplates e g a h 20 the variation of fundamental frequency of the microplate in contact with fluid versus the aspect ratio a b and for different values of h l is depicted in fig 4 it is clearly observed that the fundamental frequency reduces dramatically when the aspect ratio a b increases from 0 5 to 1 5 this reduction becomes less pronounced by increasing the aspect ratio besides the effect of h l on the frequency is more significant for small values of aspect ratio e g a b 1 fig 5 shows the variation of fundamental natural frequency versus the fluid depth d b and for various values of thickness ratio a h as a result one can say that the fundamental natural frequency of the square microplate in contact with fluid decreases as the depth of fluid d b increases moreover in order to study this effect on the higher order natural frequencies the first ten dimensionless natural frequencies of a rectangular microplate with h 5 l a 12 h and b a 0 5 and coupled with fluid are listed in table 5 in which the depth of fluid is varying from 0 to 0 5 according to table 5 it is again concluded that increasing the fluid depth ratio d b leads to a reduction in the natural frequencies of microplate in order to have a suitable sense of the interaction between fluid and structure the first six mode shapes of a rectangular microplate are depicted in figs 6 and 7 for the microplate in air and in contact with fluid respectively it is clearly shown in these figures that the shapes of the typical first six modes are distorted because of the fluid microplate interaction system 5 conclusion in this paper the size dependent vibrational behavior of an elastic isotropic rectangular microplate has been studied in which one side of the microplate has been coupled with an ideal fluid modified couple stress theory based on the first order shear deformation assumptions is used to mathematically model the problem hamilton s principle has been employed to derive non classical governing differential equations of motion and corresponding boundary conditions the obtained eigenvalue problem related to the free vibration of a simply supported rectangular microplate coupled with fluid is analytically solved by directly utilizing the rayleigh ritz method the efficiency and accuracy of the obtained results have been validated and examined by comparing the results with those reported in the literature and very good agreement has been achieved eventually a parametric study has been performed to figure out the influences of main parameters such as the material length scale parameter dimensionless thickness side to thickness ratio aspect ratio and fluid depth ratio on the natural frequencies of rectangular mindlin microplate contacting with fluid based on the derived results there are the following main conclusions in the case of interaction between microplate and fluid it was seen that increasing the fluid depth ratio leads to a reduction in the natural frequencies of microplate the wet mode shapes of the microplate have a direct relation with the depth of fluid that means the shapes of wet mode are more distorted as the fluid depth ratio increases considering the size effects it was observed that the natural frequencies of microplate coupled with fluid which predicted by present mindlin plate model are always greater than those obtained by classical mindlin theory the fundamental natural frequencies of microplate coupled with fluid increases as the material length scale parameter increases by increasing the values of side to thickness and aspect ratio the fundamental natural frequencies of the system decreases for different values of dimensionless thickness appendix a upon substituting eqs 18c and 18d for the shear forces n i j and bending moments m i j into the classical

2013 thomas 2014 miedema and ramsdell 2015 2017 and miedema 2015 2016a 2016b among the calculation methods proposed some typical widely used formulas are the following the durand and condolios 1952 formula which is favoured in the european dredging industry is based on a substantial amount of experimental data meanwhile the wilson 1965 formula is widely used in the american dredging industry the distribution of particles in a pipeline is taken into consideration in the two phase carrier fluid flow model of wasp et al 1977 the turian and yuan 1977 formula was obtained by using different dimensionless parameters collecting experimental data from the literature and performing dimensionless analysis lahiri and ghanta 2008 obtained their formula by fitting experimental data using artificial intelligence the formula developed by doron and barnea 1993 is based on a theoretical model of mechanical equilibrium meanwhile the miedema and ramsdell 2017 framework is based on theoretical analysis previous research results and consideration of the applicability of the formulas using only easily obtainable parameters the pipe froude number particle froude number and additional resistance loss are defined by durand and condolios 1952 the resistance formula was obtained by fitting the relationship between these quantities this formula was verified for slurries with pipe diameters of 40 580 mm average particle sizes of 0 2 25 mm particle weights of 1 5 3 95 and particle concentrations of 2 22 following revision and expansion by worster and denny 1955 gibert 1960 and wasp et al 1977 this formula has continued to be used and remains the most popular calculation method in the dredging industry however by using terms such as particle arithmetic mean size d m and particle froude number f r p v t g d to simplify the in situ distribution in the formula results in significant calculation bias if the gradation is wide especially in high concentration slurry transport the resistance growth mechanisms in different scenarios such as the sliding bed heterogeneous and homogeneous regimes and the effects of the particle size distribution on the resistance were researched by wilson et al 2006 the impact of large particles on the resistance in a pipeline was considered for a heterogeneous situation in the formula and the particle size distribution was described using d 85 and d 50 for a broadly graded slurry the particles can be divided into four categories according to size the first category includes particles with diameters less than 0 04 mm and corresponds to the homogeneous regime the second category includes particles with diameters greater than 0 04 mm and less than 0 15 mm and corresponds to the pseudo homogeneous regime the third category corresponds to the heterogeneous regime and consists of particles ranging in size from 0 15 mm to 0 018 times the pipeline diameter the fourth category includes particles with diameters more than 0 018 times the pipeline diameter and corresponds to the sliding bed regime obviously the particle size ranges defining the different categories are not fixed in varying flow conditions such as when the flow rate and particle concentration increase in actual practice for uniformly sized particles detailed division and research has been performed for different slurry regimes with varying flow rates and pipe resistance formulas for the fixed bed sliding bed heterogeneous and homogeneous regimes were derived by miedema and ramsdell 2017 based on different theories such as two layer flow and energy theory miedema and ramsdell 2017 divided graded slurries into two components the first component is in the carrier phase with a stokes number s tk of less than 0 03 at the limit deposit velocity and the carrier density and viscosity are corrected according to the volume concentration of this component the component particles do not participate in the remainder of the resistance calculations the remaining particles comprise the second component in which flow regime depends on the particle size and flow velocity the contributions of durand and condolios 1952 and wilson et al 2006 were incorporated by miedema and ramsdell 2017 and the experimental diameter was expanded to 1 m however the miedema and ramsdell 2017 model only incorporates the effects of fine particles carriers on the effective slurry viscosity and pipe resistance without considering the effect of the in situ gradation uniformity on the pipe resistance which is significant particularly when the particle concentration is high 3 sjtu hmspd in multi sized slurry transport via pipelines the flow regimes of differently sized particles may change with the flow rate and mixture concentration over time when the flow rate and concentration are low the shear stress on the fixed bed is low and insufficient to make the particles move thus the particles remain in the stationary bed regime at the bottom of the pipe as the flow rate and solid concentration increase the shear stress increases and the particles begin to slip jump and become suspended and forming a sliding bed or heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous or even homogeneous flow in the spatial dimension differently sized particles in the pipe will be in different regimes in most situations in certain flow rate conditions the smallest particles are evenly distributed in the slurry their slip velocities are close to zero and liquid characteristics are observable these particles comprise the homogeneous part in which the size of the largest particles is called the non settling particle size some particles which are slightly larger than those in the homogeneous regime although their velocity distribution is similar to that of the liquid part and their resistance characteristics are also similar to those of the homogeneous part have a non uniform vertical distribution in the pipeline owing to gravity and are called the pseudo homogeneous component the larger particles although suspended owing to the lift force are distributed more unevenly they are mainly situated in the lower half of the pipe a large slip velocity is generated and the resistance characteristics are different these particles are in the heterogeneous regime flow the largest particles can no longer be suspended by the lift force and move by sliding along the bottom of the pipe this part is known as the sliding bed part if the flow velocity and concentration are low the larger particles may also be deposited at the bottom of the pipeline and not move forming a fixed bed figs 1 and 2 present the results of a simulation of the solid volume distribution profiles of differently sized particles different phases in a multi sized slurry using computational fluid dynamics and their mixture concentration given by kaushal et al 2005 fig 1 shows the trend of the solid distribution with increasing slurry velocity at a solid concentration of 30 and fig 2 shows the trend with increasing solid concentration at a velocity of 2 m s according to the slurry flow regime result obtained by wasp et al 1977 if the relative solid volume concentration ratio in the vertical centreline of the pipe 0 1 c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 where c v y a is the specific local the dimensionless position along the vertical axis of the pipe y a defined as y y d p where y is the distance from the pipe bottom and d p is the pipe diameter is solid volume concentration the slurry is in the heterogeneous regime and the regime of each phase containing differently sized particles is clearly observable in the figures a more complete study of the aforementioned phenomenon was published in li et al 2018 in the sjtu hmspd the sands in situ are divided into five parts homogeneous pseudo homogeneous heterogeneous sliding bed and fixed bed parts according to the movement properties and concentration distributions the collision and suspension energy consumptions of the particles in the heterogeneous regime and the effects of the fine particles on the coarse particles are all considered in the sjtu hmspd compared to the setting velocity and conveying speed of the coarser particles the setting velocity of the finer particles is smaller and their transport speed is slightly higher furthermore the effective viscosity of the carrier liquid is increased due to exit of the finer particles which means that a lift force is provided by fine sands therefore in the sjtu hmspd the effective viscosity of the pseudo homogeneous part is corrected by the homogeneous partial particle concentration the effective viscosity of the heterogeneous part is corrected by the total concentration of homogeneous and pseudo homogeneous particles furthermore the total concentration of the homogeneous pseudo homogeneous and heterogeneous components can be used to correct the effective viscosity of the sliding bed and fixed bed parts additionally an unevenness coefficient is included in the sjtu hmspd to describe the unevenness of the graded slurry and together with the solid concentration is used to define a coefficient describing the effect of the particle size distribution on the pipe resistance with varying sand concentration 3 1 particle size distribution for convenience and standardization of the particle size distribution psd gradation in the sjtu hmspd the in situ psd is split into n equal groups according to mass based on the particle size that is the volume of particles contained in each group is 1 n of the total particle volume the mass of each group is given by 1 w i 1 n w the characteristic particle size of each group is its median particle size thus the more the number of groups the more representative are the obtained median particle sizes 3 2 parameter correction the sand volume concentration in the jth regime is as follows in the sjtu hmspd 2 c v j x j c v 1 c v x j c v where x j is the weight percentage of the particles in the jth regime and the sum of x j in five regimes is 1 3 j 1 5 x j 1 if the particles are large smaller particles increase the effective viscosity of the carrier liquid therefore the dynamic viscosity must be modified according to the number of smaller particles the correction coefficient in the sjtu hmspd is given by thomas 1965 as follows 4 μ x m μ 1 1 2 5 c v x m 10 05 c v c m 2 0 00273 e 16 6 c v c m where c vs xm is the volume concentration of the particles smaller than the particle size of part x that is d m d x 5 c v x m j 1 m c v j correspondingly the viscosity coefficient of the liquid carrying the particles of part x is 6 ν x m μ x m ρ x m where ρ xm is the slurry density 7 ρ x m ρ l ρ l i 1 m x i c v r s d x m 1 c v i 1 m x i c v and r xd xm is the net weight 8 r s d x m ρ s ρ x m ρ x m 3 3 resistance reducing coefficient owing to the presence of finer particles the viscosity of the carrier liquid increases causing the carrier liquid resistance to increase as well however the increased carrier liquid viscosity inhibits the turbulence of the slurry simultaneously the rotational energy consumption is reduced owing to particle particle and particle wall collisions of the larger particles consequently the frictional resistance of the coarse particles in the slurry is reduced in addition to the effect of the fine particles on the slurry viscosity the effect of the particle gradation on the additional resistance becomes more significant as the concentration increases the sjtu hmspd can be modified using the following formula 9 α 0 69 0 99 lg μ r 0 075 lg c u 1 27 lg μ r lg c u 0 165 lg μ r 2 0 082 lg c u 2 where 10 μ r μ m μ l and 11 c u d 60 d 10 3 4 resistance calculation for fixed bed slurry flow the flow rate is very small the particle size is relatively large and the particles will be completely precipitated at the bottom of the pipeline thus the upper part of the pipe will be filled with pure water the resistance formula is given by miedema and ramsdell 2017 12 i fb i l λ 1 o 1 λ 12 o 12 1 1 c v r 3 λ 1 o p v l s 2 8 g a p where 13 i l 1 2 λ 1 v l s 2 g d p 14 λ 1 1 325 ln 0 27 ε d p 5 75

094 where 20 r s d ρ s ρ l ρ l for the sliding bed slurry flow the particles slide or saltate at the bottom of the pipe thus the resistance in this regime is mainly frictional resistance and the

flow regimes are calculated according to the parameters such as flow velocity sand volume concentration and pipe diameter based on the gradation curve of the transport in situ the percentages of particles in different regimes are calculated by interpolation and then the contributions of the particles in different regimes to the pipe resistance are determined finally the total pipe resistance is evaluated the detailed steps are as follows a determine the non settling particle size the default non settling particle size is taken to be 0 04 mm in the sjtu hmspd it can also be calculated using s tk 0 03 b calculate the homogeneous partial resistance equation 26 is used to calculate the resistance of the homogeneous component in the sjtu hmspd c correct the slurry parameters equations 4 7 are applied to correct the pseudo homogeneous flow slurry viscosity density and other parameters d calculate the size and content of the particles in different regimes by interpolation using eqs 12 and 23 or 24 25 and 26 calculate the resistance of each component in the fixed bed sliding bed heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous and homogeneous regimes determine the regime of each particle group according to the following logical relationships image 1 the regime of each group of particles is determined and then the carrier liquid parameters are corrected and interpolated to determine the limiting particle size and percentage by mass in each regime the above mentioned parameters are shown in fig 3 e calculate the resistance of each regime according to the proportions of different regimes in each gradation group of equal mass use the median particle size of the group to calculate the resistance of each regime in each gradation group the total resistance of a certain regime is the sum of the resistances of the five groups in that regime 27 i j i 1 n i j i x i j f calculate the total resistance the total resistance is obtained by summing the resistances of the particles in the five regimes and multiplying by α given in equation 9 28 i m α i h o i s h o i h e i s b i f b 4 data inspection the formula for the pipeline resistance in different regimes that is presented in this paper was derived from that of miedema and ramsdell 2017 which was obtained by improving previous formulas and verified by extensive experimental data for single sized particles therefore only the validation for graded particles is presented in this paper in this study the experimental data of sundqvist et al 1996 were selected to verify the sjtu hmspd the experimental sand gradation is presented in fig 4 in the calculations the three types of sand were divided into five groups consisting of particles with equal masses and similar sizes where the smallest 20 of particles comprised the smallest group those ranging from 20 to 40 made up the small group those from 40 to 60 were defined as the middle group those ranging from 60 to 80 comprised the large group and those from 80 to 100 made up the largest group in addition the particle sizes for which 10 30 50 70 and 90 of the particles had lesser weights were taken as the characteristic particle sizes for the aforementioned groups named d 10 d 30 d 50 d 70 and d 90 respectively the experimental sand characteristic particle sizes are presented in table 1 5 analysis and discussion fig 5 shows the percentages of sand 3 in each regime at different slurry velocities that were calculated using the sjtu hmspd model fig 5 reveals that the fixed layer heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous and homogeneous flow regimes exist simultaneously when the slurry velocity of sand 3 is less than 1 m s the proportion in the heterogeneous regime gradually increases with increasing slurry velocity when the flow rate is greater than 0 8 m s the fixed bed proportion decreases rapidly with increasing slurry velocity and most of the sands begin to slide and jump to form a large sliding bed proportion the fixed bed component disappears in the pipe after the flow rate exceeds 1 2 m s which is also the limiting deposit velocity defined by miedema and ramsdell 2017 the sliding bed flow vanishes when the flow rate exceeds 4 m s and most of the particles are in the heterogeneous regime as the slurry velocity increases further the heterogeneous proportion decreases and the pseudo homogeneous proportion increases the maximum particle sizes in sand 3 that were determined using the sjtu hmspd model for each regime at different slurry velocities are depicted in fig 6 fixed bed flow was generated in sand 3 at flow velocities less than 0 8 m s and particle sizes greater than 0 15 mm as illustrated in fig 5 more than 90 of sand 3 is in this regime the fixed bed component disappears when the flow velocity reaches 1 2 m s and the particles larger than 0 27 mm are in the sliding bed regime and amount to 76 of sand 3 the sands larger than 0 086 mm are in the heterogeneous regime and comprise approximately 18 of sand 3 meanwhile the pseudo homogeneous component amounts to 3 3 and the homogeneous regime accounts for 2 7 the sliding bed flow disappears when the flow rate reaches 4 m s and the sands larger than 0 22 mm are in the heterogeneous regime which amounts to 81 the pseudo homogeneous regime sands account for 16 3 and the homogeneous component amounts to approximately 2 7 when the flow velocity reaches 9 m s the sands larger than 1 75 mm are in the heterogeneous regime accounting for 34 5 the pseudo homogeneous sands amount to 62 8 and the homogeneous regime accounts for approximately 2 7 fig 7 presents the percentages of sand 1 in each regime at different slurry velocities that were calculated using the sjtu hmspd model comparison of figs 5 and 7 reveals that flow regime conversion occurs faster in sand 1 than in sand 3 in sand 1 the percentages of sands in adjacent regimes change rapidly since the gradation of sand 1 is narrow if the particle size of a certain regime changes slightly the percentages will soon change accordingly in sand 1 in addition the maximum particle sizes in sand 1 that were computed using the sjtu hmspd model for each regime at different slurry velocities are shown in fig 8 comparison of figs 6 and 8 demonstrates that the sand regimes change more slowly with the flow velocity in sand 1 than in sand 3 the sand size corresponding to the boundary between the two regimes in sand 3 changes faster with varying flow velocity the reason for this behaviour is the broad gradation of sand 3 so small size changes can cause the carrier phase viscosity of relatively coarse particles to increase consequently transformation of the coarse particle regime is promoted fig 9 shows an error ratio less than 20 between the experimental and calculated data more than 10 of the slurry concentration fluctuations in the original experimental data correspond to the resistance and the calculated values were taken from the median experimental concentrations thus the 20 error is acceptable for example a concentration of 39 1 was used in the calculations for sand 3 corresponding to high concentration experimental measurements with concentrations of 36 5 41 7 a concentration of 12 1 was used in the calculations for sand 2 corresponding to experimental measurements with concentrations of 9 9 13 finally the actual constructed work point data and calculated results are compared in fig 10 the result illustrates that the predictions obtained using the sjtu hmspd agree well with the measurements in the brazilian dredging project 6 conclusion a series of formulas in the delft head loss and limit deposit velocity framework published by miedema and ramsdell 2017 which have been confirmed by extensive experimental data are applied in the sjtu hmspd to calculate the friction resistances of certain portions of narrow graded particles in pipeline transport and the resistance calculations are corrected for broad graded particles especially those in a high concentration slurry the model was verified using experimental data published by sundqvist et al 1996 with three types of multi sized slurries with concentrations of 10 41 the same median particle size and unevenness coefficients of 1 2 8 2 the experimental results agree closely with the experimental data in the sjtu hmspd not only the particle regimes in different flow conditions over time are considered but the different regimes of particles grouped by size that occur simultaneously in situ are also considered in this process the influence of the smaller particles on the coarse particles is considered as is the effect of the in situ gradation on the friction resistance the calculation results demonstrated that the factor defined by the particle concentration and in situ gradation in the sjtu hmspd can accurately reflect the effect of the fine particles on the friction resistance reduction in broad graded high concentration particle transport in pipelines and can also reflect the sharp increase in resistance in narrow graded slurry above a certain concentration the resistance characteristics of high concentration broad and narrow graded slurry transportation are portrayed effectively the sjtu hmspd results were compared with actual dredging engineering work point data and the results illustrate that the sjtu hmspd can predict the pipeline transmission resistances of slurries with complex gradations the input parameters such as flow velocity pipe diameter and solid concentration are all available in practice making the application of the model very convenient these models lay a solid foundation for further study of the resistance mechanism and specific energy consumption they can be used for design optimization and intelligent control of slurry transport by pipelines especially with high concentration graded particles acknowledgments this research work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779143 and state key

than 0 018 times the pipeline diameter and corresponds to the sliding bed regime obviously the particle size ranges defining the different categories are not fixed in varying flow conditions such as when the flow rate and particle concentration increase in actual practice for uniformly sized particles detailed division and research has been performed for different slurry regimes with varying flow rates and pipe resistance formulas for the fixed bed sliding bed heterogeneous and homogeneous regimes were derived by miedema and ramsdell 2017 based on different theories such as two layer flow and energy theory miedema and ramsdell 2017 divided graded slurries into two components the first component is in the carrier phase with a stokes number s tk of less than 0 03 at the limit deposit velocity and the carrier density and viscosity are corrected according to the volume concentration of this component the component particles do not participate in the remainder of the resistance calculations the remaining particles comprise the second component in which flow regime depends on the particle size and flow velocity the contributions of durand and condolios 1952 and wilson et al 2006 were incorporated by miedema and ramsdell 2017 and the experimental diameter was expanded to 1 m however the miedema and ramsdell 2017 model only incorporates the effects of fine particles carriers on the effective slurry viscosity and pipe resistance without considering the effect of the in situ gradation uniformity on the pipe resistance which is significant particularly when the particle concentration is high 3 sjtu hmspd in multi sized slurry transport via pipelines the flow regimes of differently sized particles may change with the flow rate and mixture concentration over time when the flow rate and concentration are low the shear stress on the fixed bed is low and insufficient to make the particles move thus the particles remain in the stationary bed regime at the bottom of the pipe as the flow rate and solid concentration increase the shear stress increases and the particles begin to slip jump and become suspended and forming a sliding bed or heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous or even homogeneous flow in the spatial dimension differently sized particles in the pipe will be in different regimes in most situations in certain flow rate conditions the smallest particles are evenly distributed in the slurry their slip velocities are close to zero and liquid characteristics are observable these particles comprise the homogeneous part in which the size of the largest particles is called the non settling particle size some particles which are slightly larger than those in the homogeneous regime although their velocity distribution is similar to that of the liquid part and their resistance characteristics are also similar to those of the homogeneous part have a non uniform vertical distribution in the pipeline owing to gravity and are called the pseudo homogeneous component the larger particles although suspended owing to the lift force are distributed more unevenly they are mainly situated in the lower half of the pipe a large slip velocity is generated and the resistance characteristics are different these particles are in the heterogeneous regime flow the largest particles can no longer be suspended by the lift force and move by sliding along the bottom of the pipe this part is known as the sliding bed part if the flow velocity and concentration are low the larger particles may also be deposited at the bottom of the pipeline and not move forming a fixed bed figs 1 and 2 present the results of a simulation of the solid volume distribution profiles of differently sized particles different phases in a multi sized slurry using computational fluid dynamics and their mixture concentration given by kaushal et al 2005 fig 1 shows the trend of the solid distribution with increasing slurry velocity at a solid concentration of 30 and fig 2 shows the trend with increasing solid concentration at a velocity of 2 m s according to the slurry flow regime result obtained by wasp et al 1977 if the relative solid volume concentration ratio in the vertical centreline of the pipe 0 1 c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 where c v y a is the specific local the dimensionless position along the vertical axis of the pipe y a defined as y y d p where y is the distance from the pipe bottom and d p is the pipe diameter is solid volume concentration the slurry is in the heterogeneous regime and the regime of each phase containing differently sized particles is clearly observable in the figures a more complete study of the aforementioned phenomenon was published in li et al 2018 in the sjtu hmspd the sands in situ are divided into five parts homogeneous pseudo homogeneous heterogeneous sliding bed and fixed bed parts according to the movement properties and concentration distributions the collision and suspension energy consumptions of the particles in the heterogeneous regime and the effects of the fine particles on the coarse particles are all considered in the sjtu hmspd compared to the setting velocity and conveying speed of the coarser particles the setting velocity of the finer particles is smaller and their transport speed is slightly higher furthermore the effective viscosity of the carrier liquid is increased due to exit of the finer particles which means that a lift force is provided by fine sands therefore in the sjtu hmspd the effective viscosity of the pseudo homogeneous part is corrected by the homogeneous partial particle concentration the effective viscosity of the heterogeneous part is corrected by the total concentration of homogeneous and pseudo homogeneous particles furthermore the total concentration of the homogeneous pseudo homogeneous and heterogeneous components can be used to correct the effective viscosity of the sliding bed and fixed bed parts additionally an unevenness coefficient is included in the sjtu hmspd to describe the unevenness of the graded slurry and together with the solid concentration is used to define a coefficient describing the effect of the particle size distribution on the pipe resistance with varying sand concentration 3 1 particle size distribution for convenience and standardization of the particle size distribution psd gradation in the sjtu hmspd the in situ psd is split into n equal groups according to mass based on the particle size that is the volume of particles contained in each group is 1 n of the total particle volume the mass of each group is given by 1 w i 1 n w the characteristic particle size of each group is its median particle size thus the more the number of groups the more representative are the obtained median particle sizes 3 2 parameter correction the sand volume concentration in the jth regime is as follows in the sjtu hmspd 2 c v j x j c v 1 c v x j c v where x j is the weight percentage of the particles in the jth regime and the sum of x j in five regimes is 1 3 j 1 5 x j 1 if the particles are large smaller particles increase the effective viscosity of the carrier liquid therefore the dynamic viscosity must be modified according to the number of smaller particles the correction coefficient in the sjtu hmspd is given by thomas 1965 as follows 4 μ x m μ 1 1 2 5 c v x m 10 05 c v c m 2 0 00273 e 16 6 c v c m where c vs xm is the volume concentration of the particles smaller than the particle size of part x that is d m d x 5 c v x m j 1 m c v j correspondingly the viscosity coefficient of the liquid carrying the particles of part x is 6 ν x m μ x m ρ x m where ρ xm is the slurry density 7 ρ x m ρ l ρ l i 1 m x i c v r s d x m 1 c v i 1 m x i c v and r xd xm is the net weight 8 r s d x m ρ s ρ x m ρ x m 3 3 resistance reducing coefficient owing to the presence of finer particles the viscosity of the carrier liquid increases causing the carrier liquid resistance to increase as well however the increased carrier liquid viscosity inhibits the turbulence of the slurry simultaneously the rotational energy consumption is reduced owing to particle particle and particle wall collisions of the larger particles consequently the frictional resistance of the coarse particles in the slurry is reduced in addition to the effect of the fine particles on the slurry viscosity the effect of the particle gradation on the additional resistance becomes more significant as the concentration increases the sjtu hmspd can be modified using the following formula 9 α 0 69 0 99 lg μ r 0 075 lg c u 1 27 lg μ r lg c u 0 165 lg μ r 2 0 082 lg c u 2 where 10 μ r μ m μ l and 11 c u d 60 d 10 3 4 resistance calculation for fixed bed slurry flow the flow rate is very small the particle size is relatively large and the particles will be completely precipitated at the bottom of the pipeline thus the upper part of the pipe will be filled with pure water the resistance formula is given by miedema and ramsdell 2017 12 i fb i l λ 1 o 1 λ 12 o 12 1 1 c v r 3 λ 1 o p v l s 2 8 g a p where 13 i l 1 2 λ 1 v l s 2 g d p 14 λ 1 1 325 ln 0 27 ε d p 5 75

flow regimes are calculated according to the parameters such as flow velocity sand volume concentration and pipe diameter based on the gradation curve of the transport in situ the percentages of particles in different regimes are calculated by interpolation and then the contributions of the particles in different regimes to the pipe resistance are determined finally the total pipe resistance is evaluated the detailed steps are as follows a determine the non settling particle size the default non settling particle size is taken to be 0 04 mm in the sjtu hmspd it can also be calculated using s tk 0 03 b calculate the homogeneous partial resistance equation 26 is used to calculate the resistance of the homogeneous component in the sjtu hmspd c correct the slurry parameters equations 4 7 are applied to correct the pseudo homogeneous flow slurry viscosity density and other parameters d calculate the size and content of the particles in different regimes by interpolation using eqs 12 and 23 or 24 25 and 26 calculate the resistance of each component in the fixed bed sliding bed heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous and homogeneous regimes determine the regime of each particle group according to the following logical relationships image 1 the regime of each group of particles is determined and then the carrier liquid parameters are corrected and interpolated to determine the limiting particle size and percentage by mass in each regime the above mentioned parameters are shown in fig 3 e calculate the resistance of each regime according to the proportions of different regimes in each gradation group of equal mass use the median particle size of the group to calculate the resistance of each regime in each gradation group the total resistance of a certain regime is the sum of the resistances of the five groups in that regime 27 i j i 1 n i j i x i j f calculate the total resistance the total resistance is obtained by summing the resistances of the particles in the five regimes and multiplying by α given in equation 9 28 i m α i h o i s h o i h e i s b i f b 4 data inspection the formula for the pipeline resistance in different regimes that is presented in this paper was derived from that of miedema and ramsdell 2017 which was obtained by improving previous formulas and verified by extensive experimental data for single sized particles therefore only the validation for graded particles is presented in this paper in this study the experimental data of sundqvist et al 1996 were selected to verify the sjtu hmspd the experimental sand gradation is presented in fig 4 in the calculations the three types of sand were divided into five groups consisting of particles with equal masses and similar sizes where the smallest 20 of particles comprised the smallest group those ranging from 20 to 40 made up the small group those from 40 to 60 were defined as the middle group those ranging from 60 to 80 comprised the large group and those from 80 to 100 made up the largest group in addition the particle sizes for which 10 30 50 70 and 90 of the particles had lesser weights were taken as the characteristic particle sizes for the aforementioned groups named d 10 d 30 d 50 d 70 and d 90 respectively the experimental sand characteristic particle sizes are presented in table 1 5 analysis and discussion fig 5 shows the percentages of sand 3 in each regime at different slurry velocities that were calculated using the sjtu hmspd model fig 5 reveals that the fixed layer heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous and homogeneous flow regimes exist simultaneously when the slurry velocity of sand 3 is less than 1 m s the proportion in the heterogeneous regime gradually increases with increasing slurry velocity when the flow rate is greater than 0 8 m s the fixed bed proportion decreases rapidly with increasing slurry velocity and most of the sands begin to slide and jump to form a large sliding bed proportion the fixed bed component disappears in the pipe after the flow rate exceeds 1 2 m s which is also the limiting deposit velocity defined by miedema and ramsdell 2017 the sliding bed flow vanishes when the flow rate exceeds 4 m s and most of the particles are in the heterogeneous regime as the slurry velocity increases further the heterogeneous proportion decreases and the pseudo homogeneous proportion increases the maximum particle sizes in sand 3 that were determined using the sjtu hmspd model for each regime at different slurry velocities are depicted in fig 6 fixed bed flow was generated in sand 3 at flow velocities less than 0 8 m s and particle sizes greater than 0 15 mm as illustrated in fig 5 more than 90 of sand 3 is in this regime the fixed bed component disappears when the flow velocity reaches 1 2 m s and the particles larger than 0 27 mm are in the sliding bed regime and amount to 76 of sand 3 the sands larger than 0 086 mm are in the heterogeneous regime and comprise approximately 18 of sand 3 meanwhile the pseudo homogeneous component amounts to 3 3 and the homogeneous regime accounts for 2 7 the sliding bed flow disappears when the flow rate reaches 4 m s and the sands larger than 0 22 mm are in the heterogeneous regime which amounts to 81 the pseudo homogeneous regime sands account for 16 3 and the homogeneous component amounts to approximately 2 7 when the flow velocity reaches 9 m s the sands larger than 1 75 mm are in the heterogeneous regime accounting for 34 5 the pseudo homogeneous sands amount to 62 8 and the homogeneous regime accounts for approximately 2 7 fig 7 presents the percentages of sand 1 in each regime at different slurry velocities that were calculated using the sjtu hmspd model comparison of figs 5 and 7 reveals that flow regime conversion occurs faster in sand 1 than in sand 3 in sand 1 the percentages of sands in adjacent regimes change rapidly since the gradation of sand 1 is narrow if the particle size of a certain regime changes slightly the percentages will soon change accordingly in sand 1 in addition the maximum particle sizes in sand 1 that were computed using the sjtu hmspd model for each regime at different slurry velocities are shown in fig 8 comparison of figs 6 and 8 demonstrates that the sand regimes change more slowly with the flow velocity in sand 1 than in sand 3 the sand size corresponding to the boundary between the two regimes in sand 3 changes faster with varying flow velocity the reason for this behaviour is the broad gradation of sand 3 so small size changes can cause the carrier phase viscosity of relatively coarse particles to increase consequently transformation of the coarse particle regime is promoted fig 9 shows an error ratio less than 20 between the experimental and calculated data more than 10 of the slurry concentration fluctuations in the original experimental data correspond to the resistance and the calculated values were taken from the median experimental concentrations thus the 20 error is acceptable for example a concentration of 39 1 was used in the calculations for sand 3 corresponding to high concentration experimental measurements with concentrations of 36 5 41 7 a concentration of 12 1 was used in the calculations for sand 2 corresponding to experimental measurements with concentrations of 9 9 13 finally the actual constructed work point data and calculated results are compared in fig 10 the result illustrates that the predictions obtained using the sjtu hmspd agree well with the measurements in the brazilian dredging project 6 conclusion a series of formulas in the delft head loss and limit deposit velocity framework published by miedema and ramsdell 2017 which have been confirmed by extensive experimental data are applied in the sjtu hmspd to calculate the friction resistances of certain portions of narrow graded particles in pipeline transport and the resistance calculations are corrected for broad graded particles especially those in a high concentration slurry the model was verified using experimental data published by sundqvist et al 1996 with three types of multi sized slurries with concentrations of 10 41 the same median particle size and unevenness coefficients of 1 2 8 2 the experimental results agree closely with the experimental data in the sjtu hmspd not only the particle regimes in different flow conditions over time are considered but the different regimes of particles grouped by size that occur simultaneously in situ are also considered in this process the influence of the smaller particles on the coarse particles is considered as is the effect of the in situ gradation on the friction resistance the calculation results demonstrated that the factor defined by the particle concentration and in situ gradation in the sjtu hmspd can accurately reflect the effect of the fine particles on the friction resistance reduction in broad graded high concentration particle transport in pipelines and can also reflect the sharp increase in resistance in narrow graded slurry above a certain concentration the resistance characteristics of high concentration broad and narrow graded slurry transportation are portrayed effectively the sjtu hmspd results were compared with actual dredging engineering work point data and the results illustrate that the sjtu hmspd can predict the pipeline transmission resistances of slurries with complex gradations the input parameters such as flow velocity pipe diameter and solid concentration are all available in practice making the application of the model very convenient these models lay a solid foundation for further study of the resistance mechanism and specific energy consumption they can be used for design optimization and intelligent control of slurry transport by pipelines especially with high concentration graded particles acknowledgments this research work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779143 and state key

23267,the performance of two hybrid mooring systems applied on a semi submersible are studied experimentally and numerically single mooring model calibration tests were carried out first to check static tension displacement characteristics and the experimental results were in good agreement with target values afterwards the generated wave in wave basin and mooring system model were carefully calibrated and the measured results matched well with numerical values finally irregular model tests which aims to measure the dynamics of semi submersible and mooring system in one hundred year sea state in south china sea were conducted the experimental results considered beam sea heading sea and quarter sea states the waves were simulated in the wave basin by jonswap spectrum the concerned motion responses of semi submersible and mooring tensions were recorded and compared with fully coupled dynamic analysis results keywords experimental study fully coupled dynamic analysis semi submersible hybrid mooring systems 1 introduction floating platform concepts including semi submersible spar tension leg platform tlp floating production storage and offloading unit fpso are widely used in ocean oil and gas exploitation activities the floating structure which is subjected to different environmental loads such as wave wind current and ice is moored to be kept in station the mooring system is closely related to the operation efficiency and safety and needs to be carefully designed generally the mooring system is divided into two types namely the taut and catenary the catenary chain provides restoring force to the top floating structure by the weight of the suspended segment the length of the suspended line varies with the dynamic motion responses of top floating structure which indicates that the segment lays on the seafloor should be long enough to prevent it from being fully lifted up since such scenario would lead the anchor to be subjected to vertical load which is strictly forbidden consequently the catenary mooring lines are very long and could be several times to water depth as a consequence the mooring system footprint is relatively large which may interfere with other ocean engineering operations furthermore the floater effective working payload is reduced due to the additional significant weight from the chain the working principle of taut mooring system is totally different from the catenary mooring system where the restoring force is provided through axial stretching this type of mooring system seems to be superior to catenary mooring system in deepwater and ultra deepwater activities owing to the fact that it has small footprint and good station keeping capacity besides the taut mooring line is more economic than catenary mooring line however the taut mooring line is usually fixed to seabed by suction anchor which are more expensive than the anchor used by catenary chain including production and installation furthermore the trench induced by taut mooring line would degrade anchor capacity and lead to the replacement of mooring system during service which cause to economic loss bhattacharjee et al 2014 the ideal to attach clump weights to mooring line has long history finn 1976 proposed a guyed tower for deep water platform mooring in his design each mooring line was composed by the catenary chain and clump weight the clump weight was installed to increase mooring restoring force in extreme sea inspired by this idea ji et al 2011 presented a novel mooring system by noticing the shortcomings of traditional mooring systems it integrated catenary with taut mooring in their study the fully coupled dynamic analysis was carried out to study semi submersible system dynamic responses when it was moored by traditional taut mooring system and novel mooring system respectively where the superiority of the novel mooring system was clear the results showed that the surge and sway motion were reduced by 25 5 and 22 8 respectively while the maximum mooring tension was increased slightly compared with taut mooring system in another work the feasibility study of this novel mooring system for a fpso system operated in five wave depths was discussed ji et al 2012 the results showed that the novel mooring system reduced the low frequency motion amplitudes compared with the traditional mooring system besides the reduced amplitudes were related to the water depth when the water depth was less than 2000m the maximum motion amplitude was reduced by 8 however more than 12 reduction was found if the water depth over 2000 m recently this hybrid mooring system was further developed by including buoys yuan et al 2014 the effects of buoy volume and installation position on system dynamics were studied to predict the dynamics of floating structure systems accurately is a very important issue during the design process since it is closely related to the system safety the uncoupled time domain method coupled frequency domain method coupled time domain method and experimental method are the general methods for the calculating floating system dynamics the fully coupled time domain method is considered as the most rigorous numerical method the research of coupled dynamic analysis for floating structure mooring riser system started at the end of 90 s and it has been a hot research topic since 2000s chaudhuly 2001 proposed a coupled method to analyse the motion responses of a classic spar moored by 14 mooring lines and attached by 23 risers in 3 000 6 000 and 10 000 feet water depths the hydrodynamic loads on lines were considered however the motions of risers and mooring lines were presented in a quasi static manner a more rigorous model which was considered as fully coupled dynamic model and calculated floater motion response and mooring dynamics simultaneously can be found in ran et al 1996 1999 ormberg and larsen 1998 garret 2005 ormberg et al 2005 low and langley 2006 2008 jacob et al 2012 in these studies the lines were modelled by the finite element method ran et al 1996 1999 ormberg and larsen 1998 garrett 2005 ormberg et al 2005 jacob et al 2012 or the lumped mass method low and langley 2006 2008 and then coupled into governing equations of platform motions ran 2000 developed a code for floating structure mooring systems coupled dynamic analysis the code was further developed to be applied on couple dynamic analysis of floating structures moored by elastic polyester mooring lines tahar and kim 2008 however the input coefficients should be accurate enough to make sure that the simulations are credible since incorrect coefficients could induce prediction errors wichers and devlin 2001 carried out the fully coupled dynamic analysis for a turret moored fpso operated in 3000 and 10 000 feet the drag coefficients were varied in the range of 0 2 it was found that mooring tension was increased with the drag coefficients in another study it can be found that drag coefficient are closely related to mooring induced damping yang et al 2016 while it is known that the mooring induced damping plays a significant role in low frequency motion reduction according to the research of huse 1991 mooring system damping can contribute to 80 total system damping in surge unfortunately the hydrodynamic drag coefficients are closely related to the mooring line and current characteristics and there s no clear rules for determining the drag coefficient accurately in view of this the experimental study is necessary in order to accurately study the performance of hybrid mooring systems ji and yuan 2015 carried out model tests to investigate the dynamics of a semi submersible moored by taut mooring system and two hybrid mooring systems with the identical pretension however the effect of pretension was not discussed in their study whereas the pretension of mooring line should be taken with great care as it affected mooring system stiffness as well as mooring induced damping webster 1995 johanning et al 2007 xu et al 2018 directly and caused the difference of system dynamics in this paper the hybrid mooring systems described above are going to be further studied by experimental and fully coupled dynamic method in order to investigate the effects of pretension on system dynamics two hybrid mooring systems with identical mooring radius but different pretensions are discussed besides a detail procedure is proposed to test the statistics of mooring line model with buoy considered which provides valuable reference for other similar studies furthermore a detail procedure is presented to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients of mooring line weights and buoy 2 governing equations the deepc code dnv 2015 is implemented to analyse semi

only the most loaded and least loaded mooring lines top tensions will be discussed including 3 mooring anchor tensions all the results shown in this section are transformed to the full scale value follow the research of zhao et al 2014 the damping coefficients are tuned to make the numerical results match to measured values as close as possible in this study the quadratic damping coefficients are used which are presented in table 6 the welch s method is applied to obtain system responses spectra density the hanning window with length of 5800 is applied and the overlapped samples are set as 1000 4 1 mooring line model calibration tests the mooring line model characteristics test in the wave basin is not an easy job this test was conducted out of the basin in order to simplify the measuring procedure a simple test platform which was constructed by several battens was designed to obtain mooring line static tension displacement curve the schematic and photo of this platform are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 a respectively as shown in these two figures a series of nails were deployed on the horizontal brace which were used to hang load sensor connected to mooring line model the mooring line was first installed on this device according to the design check fig 9 a then the load sensor was moved to different positions by fixing it on different nails to obtain top tension displacement curve the mooring tension was acquired by reading the data from a data acquisition system check fig 9 b connected to load sensor it is noticed that a buoy was attached to twb mooring line in order to simulate the buoyancy in the air the weights whose gravity equal to the net buoyancy of buoy were selected and installed on the same position to buoy by connecting a string through pulley for detail please check fig 9 d the pulley was fixed on a wood strip in the model tests during the testing process the mooring line was installed on the desired nails first then the wood strip with pulley was moved to a proper position and adjusted slightly to make sure the string connected with weights was in the same vertical line with the connecting point the position where the buoy was installed after that this wood strip was fixed to the horizontal brace by a c clump the mooring tension was recorded after system was stable the comparisons of measured and numerical results of tw and twb static top tension curves are given in fig 10 as shown in this figure the experimental results are in good agreement with simulations which illustrates that both the tw and twb models were made accurately enough to carry out the other tests and the numerical results are convincing 4 2 wave calibration tests the waves generated by the wave maker need to be calibrated before carrying out irregular model tests the wave elevation was recorded by the wave probe and the wave spectrum was estimated by the welch s method the results are shown in fig 11 it can be seen in this figure the measured spectrum is in good agreement with the target which implies the wave generator worked well and capable of conducting the next irregular model tests 4 3 mooring system calibration tests the characteristics of the mooring system need to be calibrated before conducting irregular wave model tests firstly a small length of nylon line was used to connect each mooring line model to the load sensor installed on the fairlead and mooring lines were arranged according to the design plan after finishing this read the pretension of each mooring line in the data acquisition system if the pretension was not similar to the design value then the corresponding nylon line length was slightly adjusted until to obtain a satisfactory result after each mooring line obtained satisfied result the platform was given a specified force and the equilibrium position was recorded by the motion capture system keep changing specified force and measuring the corresponding displacement the mooring system surge restoring force were then obtained by plotting specified force against to displacements the numerical mooring system surge restoring force are compared with measured results in fig 12 it can be observed that both measured results of tw and twb were smaller than numerical data and the differences increase with the displacement however the differences between them are small furthermore no distinguish differences can be found between tw and twb surge restoring force the results show that it is reasonable to carry out the irregular wave model tests 4 4 calibration of hydrodynamic coefficients the hydrodynamic coefficients are strong associated with mooring line dynamics which need to be determined accurately before carrying out fully coupled dynamic analysis in this study a step by step calibration procedure is proposed to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients of mooring line clump weights and buoy first of all the hydrodynamic coefficients of wire are determined which is implemented by comparing the numerical results with measured data of taut system ji and yuan 2015 the cd are adjusted carefully until the numerical data fit well with measured ones the similar procedure is applied to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of clump weighs and buoy i e by tuning cd of clump weight and buoy to make simulated results close to measured data of tw system and twb system respectively the detail procedure is shown in fig 13 where ta denotes the taut system and the experimental data are from ji and yuan 2015 the influence of hydrodynamic coefficients on system dynamics in beam sea will be discussed in this case the sway motion responses are most interested as for the mooring line the 4 mooring line is studied since the most loaded mooring is gotten more concern than other mooring lines 4 4 1 sensitivity studies of drag coefficients as shown in table 7 totally 25 drag coefficients cases are studied including 7 cases for mooring line 10 cases for clump weights and others are for buoy drag coefficients during the study process the inertial coefficients are set as constants i e ca t 1 4 ca n 1 8 for wire and the inertial coefficients of clump weights and buoy are identical which equal to 1 the results of system dynamics in different mooring drag coefficients are given in fig 14 it is observed that the mooring tension increases with the tangential drag coefficient e g the tension is found to be increased from 3255 kn to 3401 kn when cd t is developed from 0 2 to 2 it is explained that the hydrodynamic loads are determined by cd t directly which then affect the mooring tension however the effect of cd t on sway motion is limited on the contrary it is found the influence of normal drag coefficient cd n on sway motion response is evident an apparent motion amplitude reduction is seen with cd n increasing this phenomenon can be understood that the mooring induced damping level is enlarged due to the increase of cd n which contributes to the reduction of sway motion amplitude as a consequence the mooring tension is decreased due to reduced motion amplitude according to the comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental data the case with cd t 0 6 cd n 1 85 provides the most satisfied results in the following study these two values will be used the statistics of tw system responses in different drag coefficients of clump weights are shown in fig 15 it is observed that the effects of clump weights drag coefficients on system dynamics are limited which can be neglected the results show that it is reasonable to set the clump weights drag coefficients in x y and z to be 1 4 1 1 fig 16 shows the system dynamics when buoys adopt different drag coefficients for numerical simulations the similar phenomenon to fig 15 can be found which is the system dynamics are insensitive to the buoy drag coefficients the buoy coefficients are determined to be 1 1 and 0 8 in x y and z directions which will be used in the following studies 4 4 2 sensitivity studies of inertial coefficients in this study the drag coefficients from last discussion are applied to the simulation the sensitivity analysis matrix are given in table 8 the results of ta tw and twb are shown in figs 17 19 respectively it is observed in fig 17 that the inertial coefficients of mooring segment have limited effect on sway motion and mooring tension the case which has the closest results to test data is selected as the final decision according to the comparisons the ca t and ca n for mooring line are determined as 1 4 and 1 8 respectively as for the clump weights and buoy it is observed that their inertial coefficients effects on system dynamics are limited which can be neglected the inertial coefficients of weights and buoy are determined to be identical which equal to 1 4 5 beam sea 4 5 1 platform motion response analysis the three main degree of freedom dof motion responses namely sway in y direction heave in z direction and roll rotate around x axis will be discussed in this study 1000s time series contain the maximum measured response amplitude are plotted against to the numerical simulations the motion responses of tw and twb are shown in figs 20 and 21 respectively according to these two figures the measured and simulated motion response amplitudes of each dof are similar no distinguishing differences are found for comparing the motion results clearly the motion statistics are analyzed and listed in table 9 according to the results it can be found that both the numerical data of tw and twb match well with the experimental results which confirm that the numerical simulations were well modelled the maximum differences between measured and simulated sway response are 15 5 and 3 6 for tw and twb respectively besides the sway and roll motion response are reduced when the buoys were installed it is also observed that the standard deviations of numerical results are greater than the experimental data in all dofs which may be explained that the numerical damping level is lower than experimental values the motion responses spectral density of tw and twb are shown in fig 22 and fig 23 as shown in fig 22 a and fig 23 a the surge motion is dominated by the low frequency component a predominant peak can be found close to the corresponding sway natural period due to resonance besides the wave frequency peak can also be observed for each surge spectrum which appears around wave peak period by comparing the numerical and experimental results it is seen numerical spectral peaks occur in the similar locations to experimental data which indicates that the tw and twb mooring system were well modelled in the model tests however the sway motion damping is slightly underestimated in the numerical simulation in fig 22 it can be observed that for heave responses the wave frequency are the most important component two peaks one locates in the wave peak period and the other one occurs near heave natural period which can be found in ji and yuan 2015 can be observed the roll response spectrum is a trimodal distribution which demonstrates that both low frequency and wave frequency play significant role in roll motion the first peak is the largest one which appears around the natural sway period due to the sway roll coupled effect the second peak is caused by the resonance which happens around roll natural period the corresponding value can also be found in ji and xu 2014 similar to sway and heave spectra an obvious peak is found close to the wave peak period the numerical motion response spectra have the similar shapes to measured data despite of the differences between spectral peaks for tw it can be clearly seen that the numerical spectral peaks are greater than the measured ones except for the roll resonance spectral peaks as for twb the numerical model overestimates the low frequency sway spectrum peak slightly however wave frequency components of all discussed motion responses are overestimated slightly by the numerical model 4 5 2 mooring tension analysis for tw the 4 and 8 which suffers from the greatest and the lowest load will be discussed as for twb the 3 and 7 mooring line are selected based on the same rule the numerical mooring tension time series of tw and twb are plotted against to experimental results in figs 24 and 25 as shown in fig 24 the measured data of tw stay in the similar range to the numerical results for the twb it is observed that the mean value of simulated anchor tension are slightly greater than the experimental results for giving a more convenient comparison between numerical and experimental results the statistics of mooring tensions are summarized in table 10 where fmax denotes the most loaded mooring line fmin is the least loaded mooring line an excellent agreement can be found between measured and simulated data for the tw the difference between maximum values of most loaded line is 4 7 as for least loaded mooring line the maximum tension error is 11 0 the error of maximum 3 anchor tension of tw is also negligible which accounts for 5 9 a good agreement between numerical and experimental results can also be found in twb system the errors of 3 and 7 maximum fairlead tension and 3 maximum anchor tension are 3 3 7 7 and 7 2 respectively according to the statistics the greatest errors are found in the standard deviations where the simulation results are always greater than the experimental ones despite of the position fairlead or anchor point and mooring system meanwhile the numerical mean tensions are extremely close to the measured values the errors are below 10 for all cases furthermore by comparing the experimental results of tw and twb it is found that the buoys have some influence on the fairlead tension reduction while their effects on anchor tension are limited for example the top tension of most loaded mooring line and 3 anchor tension are reduced by 7 4 and 1 6 respectively if the buoys are considered it can be explained that the suspension angle angle between top of mooring and z axis of the mooring line was increased once the buoy was installed which helps to increase the horizontal restoring force furthermore the installed buoys helped to increase mooring line damping as a consequence the sway motion response amplitude is reduced which induces mooring top tension decrease for a better understanding of the mooring tension characteristics spectral analysis is carried out and the results are given in figs 26 and 27 as shown in figures the results of tw and twb are similar for all the discussed mooring lines both the low frequency and wave frequency components can be found for upwind mooring lines 4 3 the low frequency components which appear close to the natural sway periods play the dominant role while the wave frequency components are negligible however an opposite result can be found in the leeward mooring lines 8 7 the wave frequency components are dominant to low frequency part furthermore it is seen that the numerical tension spectral peaks are always greater than the measured ones both for the low frequency component and wave frequency component it can be understood that the numerical system damping level is lower than the experimental one which leads to the motion responses are overestimated slightly as a consequence the numerical mooring tension responses are more violent by comparing the results of fig 26 b with fig 27 b it is found that the wave frequency tension difference between numerical and experimental values are more significant once the buoys are installed this phenomenon is understood that the top end mooring line segments are slacker once the buoys are attached in other words the mooring tensions are more sensitivity to hydrodynamic loads in addition the buoys help to increase hydrodynamic loads on the mooring line as a result the twb wave frequency tension are greater and more sensitivity to uncertain input coefficients 4 6 head sea 4 6 1 platform motion response three main dof motion responses in this sea state are surge in y direction heave and pitch rotating around y axis the tw and twb motion responses are shown in figs 28 and 29 the statistics are given in table 11 according to the values in table 11 the numerical simulations present reliable predictions the numerical motions are close to the experimental data the errors of maximum surge amplitudes for tw and twb are 6 9 and 6 5 respectively the measured value are slightly greater than simulations due to the lower restoring stiffness the errors of maximum pitch motion responses are very small which are 1 3 and 7 0 for tw and twb respectively the phenomenon that the motion response reduction when buoys being installed does not find in head sea the surge motion responses of twb are competent to tw in general the effects of buoy on platform motion responses are ignorable in head sea figs 30 and 31 give the tw and twb motion response spectra respectively it is found that the numerical spectra match well with experimental results similar to sway motion response in beam sea the surge motion is dominated by the low frequency component a significant peak can be found around the natural period of surge motion obviously the heave motion shows strong wave frequency characteristic two wave frequency peaks one locates on the heave natural period and the other one closes to wave peak period are found it is observed that the numerical heave natural peaks are much greater than the experimental ones which may be explained that the hydrodynamic heave damping in numerical model is lower than the actual value since the viscous effects are not easy to be estimated accurately the numerical pitch spectra have similar shapes to measured results totally three peaks could be found which are located near natural surge periods natural pitch periods and wave peak periods respectively 4 6 2 mooring tension analysis the concerned mooring tensions of tw and twb are shown in figs 32 and 33 as shown in fig 32 a and fig 33 a the 1 mooring tensions are varying intensively with time several abrupt peaks could be observed on the contrary the tensions of slackest mooring line 9 are comparatively stable the 3 mean anchor tension of tw was underestimated clearly by numerical model the similar results can be observed in the twb which could be the reason that the pretension of 3 mooring line were not accurate enough for better presenting mooring tensions the statistics are summarized in table 12 it is demonstrated that the mooring tensions are reduced due to effects of buoys the maximum 1 fairlead tension and 3 anchor tension are reduced by 3 6 and 1 5 respectively according to the experimental values however their influences on anchor tensions are negligible the numerical results are in good agreement with the measured values the errors of maximum 1 fairlead tension 9 fairlead tension and 3 anchor tension are 9 5 5 1 and 2 7 respectively in tw it is found that the errors of twb maximum tensions are slightly greater than tw which could be the effects of buoy since it is not easy to simulate the hydrodynamic loads of buoy precisely however the results are still satisfactory it is observed that errors of maximum tension are below than 11 the greatest difference between numerical and tested values are found in the standard deviations which are over 20 in figs 34 and 35 it can be seen that both low frequency and wave frequency components can be found in the mooring tension spectra for the upwind mooring lines 1 and 3 the low frequency parts are dominant to the wave frequency parts while for the leeward mooring line 9 the areas under wave frequency tension spectra are comparable to the low frequency part despite of they have smaller peaks the numerical and experimental tension spectra have similar configurations despite of the differences between peak values it is found that the numerical spectra peaks are always greater than the experimental values and differences in twb are greater than tw the reasons have been described in beam sea case discussion 4 7 quartering sea 4 7 1 platform motion response analysis in quartering sea state all the six dof motions are considered and discussed the results for these two different systems are given in figs 36 and 37 and the corresponding statistics are given in table 13 as shown in table 13 the errors of platform motion responses are greater compared to the results of beam sea and head sea however the results are still convincing despite of the differences for details the errors of maximum surge amplitude here is the minimum value in table 13 are 18 7 and 7 0 for tw and twb as for sway these two values are 7 8 and 18 6 respectively the greatest differences can be found in yaw motion responses where the numerical responses are greater than actual data furthermore by comparing the measured data of tw and twb it is observed that the motion responses are slightly reduced once the buoys are considered especially for the surge motion the motion response spectra of tw and twb are given in figs 38 and 39 for all concerned motions the numerical and experimental motion spectra have similar configurations which indicate that the numerical results are reliable besides it is found that the experimental surge and sway motion spectra are very close to the simulated results except for the low frequency peak of tw surge spectrum which is clearly lower than numerical one due to higher damping level the comparisons between heave spectra are similar to the other two sea states which are the numerical heave spectra are slightly higher than the measured ones the clear differences can be found in the peaks occur in the natural periods which illustrate that the heave resonance phenomenon are more severe in numerical simulations due to lower heave damping in numerical simulations for the roll spectra it is seen that the measured spectra were dominated by resonant components besides the wave frequency components are the most significant parts in the numerical results and their low frequency components are smaller than the corresponding measured ones the numerical and experimental low frequency pitch spectra components seem comparable while the simulated spectra are always greater than measured in wave frequency by observing fig 38 f and fig 39 f it is found that the numerical yaw spectra peaks are always greater than the experimental values the discrepancy between numerical and experimental motion responses are due to the fact that the nonlinear damping cannot be equivalent represented by damping coefficients 4 7 2 mooring tensions in this situation the 1 and 5 mooring line are the tautest and slackest lines of tw while 2 is the most loaded one among all mooring lines in twb the corresponding fairlead mooring tensions most and least loaded and 3 anchor tensions time series of tw and twb are given in figs 40 and 41 in fig 40 it is observed that the numerical fairlead tensions of most loaded line are varied in the similar range to experimental data besides it is found that the fairlead mean tension of 5 in tw are overestimated slightly by numerical model while the opposite results can be found in the 3 anchor tensions it may be explained that the pretension of these two mooring lines were not well adjusted before conducting the irregular wave model tests table 14 gives the mooring tension statistics where it can be seen that the numerical model is precise enough which overestimates the actual tensions slightly for the tw the errors of maximum mooring tension for fmax fmin and 3 achor are 6 5 11 7 and 0 9 respectively as for the twb the numerical model also provides favorable predictions for the fairlead tensions it is observed that the errors of 2 and 5 maximum top tensions are negligible which are 0 4 and 7 0 in details the discrepancies of 3 anchor tensions are greater than discussed top tensions however the result is still satisfactory besides the prior observation that the greatest mooring tension will be reduced if buoys are attached can also be found in this sea state furthermore a similar phenomenon to the former two cases is also seen which is the greatest differences exist in the standard deviations the numerical tensions are varied more dramatically with time due to smaller damping level for further discussing the mooring tension characteristics the spectral analysis is carried out and mooring tension spectra are plotted in figs 42 and 43 it is seen in fig 42 that the low frequency component plays a dominant role in the all concerned tensions spectra besides the numerical and experimental low frequency tension spectra peaks appear almost simultaneously however the simulated values are greater than measured ones especially for the fairlead tension spectra due to the differences between low frequency motion responses the wave frequency component which contributes comparatively less to the upwind mooring tensions becomes a considerable part of the leeward mooring fairlead tension furthermore it is seen that the wave frequency tensions are always overestimated by numerical model the phenomenon is caused by many reasons such as the difference between numerical and experimental motion responses and the uncertain hydrodynamic coefficients the differences between numerical and experimental mooring tension standard deviations are reflected in the mooring tension spectra which can be observed that the area under simulated tension spectra are greater than the corresponding measured values for both of these two mooring systems 5 conclusions a series of 1 50 model tests were carried out to study the dynamics of semi submersible moored by tw and twb mooring systems and corresponding mooring tensions were measured and compared with numerical predictions the results of irregular wave model tests show that the numerical model provides good predictions of semi submersible motion responses the greatest errors of maximum motion responses for beam sea and head sea are below 19 for the motion responses the results in quartering sea are less well compared the beam sea and head sea in quartering sea it can be found that the greatest errors in six dof motions are pitch and yaw however for surge and sway the numerical results still match well with experimental data the errors of maximum values are below 19 furthermore the numerical model performs well in predicting mooring tensions the errors of all concerned maximum mooring tensions for tw are below 12 satisfactory results can also be found in twb the greatest error of maximum tension is found in 1 mooring line in head sea which is 11 the main difference between numerical simulations and experimental data is the standard deviation the installed buoys can reduce fairlead mooring tension slightly while their influence on floating structure motion response is not obvious for beam sea and quartering sea the motions are reduced slightly by attaching the buoys on mooring lines however an opposite result can be found in head sea generally the simulated system responses behave slightly severer than measured including motion responses and mooring tension acknowledgement the first author has been funded by the strategic research plan of

23267,the performance of two hybrid mooring systems applied on a semi submersible are studied experimentally and numerically single mooring model calibration tests were carried out first to check static tension displacement characteristics and the experimental results were in good agreement with target values afterwards the generated wave in wave basin and mooring system model were carefully calibrated and the measured results matched well with numerical values finally irregular model tests which aims to measure the dynamics of semi submersible and mooring system in one hundred year sea state in south china sea were conducted the experimental results considered beam sea heading sea and quarter sea states the waves were simulated in the wave basin by jonswap spectrum the concerned motion responses of semi submersible and mooring tensions were recorded and compared with fully coupled dynamic analysis results keywords experimental study fully coupled dynamic analysis semi submersible hybrid mooring systems 1 introduction floating platform concepts including semi submersible spar tension leg platform tlp floating production storage and offloading unit fpso are widely used in ocean oil and gas exploitation activities the floating structure which is subjected to different environmental loads such as wave wind current and ice is moored to be kept in station the mooring system is closely related to the operation efficiency and safety and needs to be carefully designed generally the mooring system is divided into two types namely the taut and catenary the catenary chain provides restoring force to the top floating structure by the weight of the suspended segment the length of the suspended line varies with the dynamic motion responses of top floating structure which indicates that the segment lays on the seafloor should be long enough to prevent it from being fully lifted up since such scenario would lead the anchor to be subjected to vertical load which is strictly forbidden consequently the catenary mooring lines are very long and could be several times to water depth as a consequence the mooring system footprint is relatively large which may interfere with other ocean engineering operations furthermore the floater effective working payload is reduced due to the additional significant weight from the chain the working principle of taut mooring system is totally different from the catenary mooring system where the restoring force is provided through axial stretching this type of mooring system seems to be superior to catenary mooring system in deepwater and ultra deepwater activities owing to the fact that it has small footprint and good station keeping capacity besides the taut mooring line is more economic than catenary mooring line however the taut mooring line is usually fixed to seabed by suction anchor which are more expensive than the anchor used by catenary chain including production and installation furthermore the trench induced by taut mooring line would degrade anchor capacity and lead to the replacement of mooring system during service which cause to economic loss bhattacharjee et al 2014 the ideal to attach clump weights to mooring line has long history finn 1976 proposed a guyed tower for deep water platform mooring in his design each mooring line was composed by the catenary chain and clump weight the clump weight was installed to increase mooring restoring force in extreme sea inspired by this idea ji et al 2011 presented a novel mooring system by noticing the shortcomings of traditional mooring systems it integrated catenary with taut mooring in their study the fully coupled dynamic analysis was carried out to study semi submersible system dynamic responses when it was moored by traditional taut mooring system and novel mooring system respectively where the superiority of the novel mooring system was clear the results showed that the surge and sway motion were reduced by 25 5 and 22 8 respectively while the maximum mooring tension was increased slightly compared with taut mooring system in another work the feasibility study of this novel mooring system for a fpso system operated in five wave depths was discussed ji et al 2012 the results showed that the novel mooring system reduced the low frequency motion amplitudes compared with the traditional mooring system besides the reduced amplitudes were related to the water depth when the water depth was less than 2000m the maximum motion amplitude was reduced by 8 however more than 12 reduction was found if the water depth over 2000 m recently this hybrid mooring system was further developed by including buoys yuan et al 2014 the effects of buoy volume and installation position on system dynamics were studied to predict the dynamics of floating structure systems accurately is a very important issue during the design process since it is closely related to the system safety the uncoupled time domain method coupled frequency domain method coupled time domain method and experimental method are the general methods for the calculating floating system dynamics the fully coupled time domain method is considered as the most rigorous numerical method the research of coupled dynamic analysis for floating structure mooring riser system started at the end of 90 s and it has been a hot research topic since 2000s chaudhuly 2001 proposed a coupled method to analyse the motion responses of a classic spar moored by 14 mooring lines and attached by 23 risers in 3 000 6 000 and 10 000 feet water depths the hydrodynamic loads on lines were considered however the motions of risers and mooring lines were presented in a quasi static manner a more rigorous model which was considered as fully coupled dynamic model and calculated floater motion response and mooring dynamics simultaneously can be found in ran et al 1996 1999 ormberg and larsen 1998 garret 2005 ormberg et al 2005 low and langley 2006 2008 jacob et al 2012 in these studies the lines were modelled by the finite element method ran et al 1996 1999 ormberg and larsen 1998 garrett 2005 ormberg et al 2005 jacob et al 2012 or the lumped mass method low and langley 2006 2008 and then coupled into governing equations of platform motions ran 2000 developed a code for floating structure mooring systems coupled dynamic analysis the code was further developed to be applied on couple dynamic analysis of floating structures moored by elastic polyester mooring lines tahar and kim 2008 however the input coefficients should be accurate enough to make sure that the simulations are credible since incorrect coefficients could induce prediction errors wichers and devlin 2001 carried out the fully coupled dynamic analysis for a turret moored fpso operated in 3000 and 10 000 feet the drag coefficients were varied in the range of 0 2 it was found that mooring tension was increased with the drag coefficients in another study it can be found that drag coefficient are closely related to mooring induced damping yang et al 2016 while it is known that the mooring induced damping plays a significant role in low frequency motion reduction according to the research of huse 1991 mooring system damping can contribute to 80 total system damping in surge unfortunately the hydrodynamic drag coefficients are closely related to the mooring line and current characteristics and there s no clear rules for determining the drag coefficient accurately in view of this the experimental study is necessary in order to accurately study the performance of hybrid mooring systems ji and yuan 2015 carried out model tests to investigate the dynamics of a semi submersible moored by taut mooring system and two hybrid mooring systems with the identical pretension however the effect of pretension was not discussed in their study whereas the pretension of mooring line should be taken with great care as it affected mooring system stiffness as well as mooring induced damping webster 1995 johanning et al 2007 xu et al 2018 directly and caused the difference of system dynamics in this paper the hybrid mooring systems described above are going to be further studied by experimental and fully coupled dynamic method in order to investigate the effects of pretension on system dynamics two hybrid mooring systems with identical mooring radius but different pretensions are discussed besides a detail procedure is proposed to test the statistics of mooring line model with buoy considered which provides valuable reference for other similar studies furthermore a detail procedure is presented to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients of mooring line weights and buoy 2 governing equations the deepc code dnv 2015 is implemented to analyse semi

identical distance on the end part of mooring line with weight decreasing from top to seafloor the construction of twb was identical to tw except for an additional buoy being attached on the top

are used which are presented in table 6 the welch s method is applied to obtain system responses spectra density the hanning window with length of 5800 is applied and the overlapped samples are set as 1000 4 1 mooring line model calibration tests the mooring line model characteristics test in the wave basin is not an easy job this test was conducted out of the basin in order to simplify the measuring procedure a simple test platform which was constructed by several battens was designed to obtain mooring line static tension displacement curve the schematic and photo of this platform are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 a respectively as shown in these two figures a series of nails were deployed on the horizontal brace which were used to hang load sensor connected to mooring line model the mooring line was first installed on this device according to the design check fig 9 a then the load sensor was moved to different positions by fixing it on different nails to obtain top tension displacement curve the mooring tension was acquired by reading the data from a data acquisition system check fig 9 b connected to load sensor it is noticed that a buoy was attached to twb mooring line in order to simulate the buoyancy in the air the weights whose gravity equal to the net buoyancy of buoy were selected and installed on the same position to buoy by connecting a string through pulley for detail please check fig 9 d the pulley was fixed on a wood strip in the model tests during the testing process the mooring line was installed on the desired nails first then the wood strip with pulley was moved to a proper position and adjusted slightly to make sure the string connected with weights was in the same vertical line with the connecting point the position where the buoy was installed after that this wood strip was fixed to the horizontal brace by a c clump the mooring tension was recorded after system was stable the comparisons of measured and numerical results of tw and twb static top tension curves are given in fig 10 as shown in this figure the experimental results are in good agreement with simulations which illustrates that both the tw and twb models were made accurately enough to carry out the other tests and the numerical results are convincing 4 2 wave calibration tests the waves generated by the wave maker need to be calibrated before carrying out irregular model tests the wave elevation was recorded by the wave probe and the wave spectrum was estimated by the welch s method the results are shown in fig 11 it can be seen in this figure the measured spectrum is in good agreement with the target which implies the wave generator worked well and capable of conducting the next irregular model tests 4 3 mooring system calibration tests the characteristics of the mooring system need to be calibrated before conducting irregular wave model tests firstly a small length of nylon line was used to connect each mooring line model to the load sensor installed on the fairlead and mooring lines were arranged according to the design plan after finishing this read the pretension of each mooring line in the data acquisition system if the pretension was not similar to the design value then the corresponding nylon line length was slightly adjusted until to obtain a satisfactory result after each mooring line obtained satisfied result the platform was given a specified force and the equilibrium position was recorded by the motion capture system keep changing specified force and measuring the corresponding displacement the mooring system surge restoring force were then obtained by plotting specified force against to displacements the numerical mooring system surge restoring force are compared with measured results in fig 12 it can be observed that both measured results of tw and twb were smaller than numerical data and the differences increase with the displacement however the differences between them are small furthermore no distinguish differences can be found between tw and twb surge restoring force the results show that it is reasonable to carry out the irregular wave model tests 4 4 calibration of hydrodynamic coefficients the hydrodynamic coefficients are strong associated with mooring line dynamics which need to be determined accurately before carrying out fully coupled dynamic analysis in this study a step by step calibration procedure is proposed to calibrate the hydrodynamic coefficients of mooring line clump weights and buoy first of all the hydrodynamic coefficients of wire are determined which is implemented by comparing the numerical results with measured data of taut system ji and yuan 2015 the cd are adjusted carefully until the numerical data fit well with measured ones the similar procedure is applied to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of clump weighs and buoy i e by tuning cd of clump weight and buoy to make simulated results close to measured data of tw system and twb system respectively the detail procedure is shown in fig 13 where ta denotes the taut system and the experimental data are from ji and yuan 2015 the influence of hydrodynamic coefficients on system dynamics in beam sea will be discussed in this case the sway motion responses are most interested as for the mooring line the 4 mooring line is studied since the most loaded mooring is gotten more concern than other mooring lines 4 4 1 sensitivity studies of drag coefficients as shown in table 7 totally 25 drag coefficients cases are studied including 7 cases for mooring line 10 cases for clump weights and others are for buoy drag coefficients during the study process the inertial coefficients are set as constants i e ca t 1 4 ca n 1 8 for wire and the inertial coefficients of clump weights and buoy are identical which equal to 1 the results of system dynamics in different mooring drag coefficients are given in fig 14 it is observed that the mooring tension increases with the tangential drag coefficient e g the tension is found to be increased from 3255 kn to 3401 kn when cd t is developed from 0 2 to 2 it is explained that the hydrodynamic loads are determined by cd t directly which then affect the mooring tension however the effect of cd t on sway motion is limited on the contrary it is found the influence of normal drag coefficient cd n on sway motion response is evident an apparent motion amplitude reduction is seen with cd n increasing this phenomenon can be understood that the mooring induced damping level is enlarged due to the increase of cd n which contributes to the reduction of sway motion amplitude as a consequence the mooring tension is decreased due to reduced motion amplitude according to the comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental data the case with cd t 0 6 cd n 1 85 provides the most satisfied results in the following study these two values will be used the statistics of tw system responses in different drag coefficients of clump weights are shown in fig 15 it is observed that the effects of clump weights drag coefficients on system dynamics are limited which can be neglected the results show that it is reasonable to set the clump weights drag coefficients in x y and z to be 1 4 1 1 fig 16 shows the system dynamics when buoys adopt different drag coefficients for numerical simulations the similar phenomenon to fig 15 can be found which is the system dynamics are insensitive to the buoy drag coefficients the buoy coefficients are determined to be 1 1 and 0 8 in x y and z directions which will be used in the following studies 4 4 2 sensitivity studies of inertial coefficients in this study the drag coefficients from last discussion are applied to the simulation the sensitivity analysis matrix are given in table 8 the results of ta tw and twb are shown in figs 17 19 respectively it is observed in fig 17 that the inertial coefficients of mooring segment have limited effect on sway motion and mooring tension the case which has the closest results to test data is selected as the final decision according to the comparisons the ca t and ca n for mooring line are determined as 1 4 and 1 8 respectively as for the clump weights and buoy it is observed that their inertial coefficients effects on system dynamics are limited which can be neglected the inertial coefficients of weights and buoy are determined to be identical which equal to 1 4 5 beam sea 4 5 1 platform motion response analysis the three main degree of freedom dof motion responses namely sway in y direction heave in z direction and roll rotate around x axis will be discussed in this study 1000s time series contain the maximum measured response amplitude are plotted against to the numerical simulations the motion responses of tw and twb are shown in figs 20 and 21 respectively according to these two figures the measured and simulated motion response amplitudes of each dof are similar no distinguishing differences are found for comparing the motion results clearly the motion statistics are analyzed and listed in table 9 according to the results it can be found that both the numerical data of tw and twb match well with the experimental results which confirm that the numerical simulations were well modelled the maximum differences between measured and simulated sway response are 15 5 and 3 6 for tw and twb respectively besides the sway and roll motion response are reduced when the buoys were installed it is also observed that the standard deviations of numerical results are greater than the experimental data in all dofs which may be explained that the numerical damping level is lower than experimental values the motion responses spectral density of tw and twb are shown in fig 22 and fig 23 as shown in fig 22 a and fig 23 a the surge motion is dominated by the low frequency component a predominant peak can be found close to the corresponding sway natural period due to resonance besides the wave frequency peak can also be observed for each surge spectrum which appears around wave peak period by comparing the numerical and experimental results it is seen numerical spectral peaks occur in the similar locations to experimental data which indicates that the tw and twb mooring system were well modelled in the model tests however the sway motion damping is slightly underestimated in the numerical simulation in fig 22 it can be observed that for heave responses the wave frequency are the most important component two peaks one locates in the wave peak period and the other one occurs near heave natural period which can be found in ji and yuan 2015 can be observed the roll response spectrum is a trimodal distribution which demonstrates that both low frequency and wave frequency play significant role in roll motion the first peak is the largest one which appears around the natural sway period due to the sway roll coupled effect the second peak is caused by the resonance which happens around roll natural period the corresponding value can also be found in ji and xu 2014 similar to sway and heave spectra an obvious peak is found close to the wave peak period the numerical motion response spectra have the similar shapes to measured data despite of the differences between spectral peaks for tw it can be clearly seen that the numerical spectral peaks are greater than the measured ones except for the roll resonance spectral peaks as for twb the numerical model overestimates the low frequency sway spectrum peak slightly however wave frequency components of all discussed motion responses are overestimated slightly by the numerical model 4 5 2 mooring tension analysis for tw the 4 and 8 which suffers from the greatest and the lowest load will be discussed as for twb the 3 and 7 mooring line are selected based on the same rule the numerical mooring tension time series of tw and twb are plotted against to experimental results in figs 24 and 25 as shown in fig 24 the measured data of tw stay in the similar range to the numerical results for the twb it is observed that the mean value of simulated anchor tension are slightly greater than the experimental results for giving a more convenient comparison between numerical and experimental results the statistics of mooring tensions are summarized in table 10 where fmax denotes the most loaded mooring line fmin is the least loaded mooring line an excellent agreement can be found between measured and simulated data for the tw the difference between maximum values of most loaded line is 4 7 as for least loaded mooring line the maximum tension error is 11 0 the error of maximum 3 anchor tension of tw is also negligible which accounts for 5 9 a good agreement between numerical and experimental results can also be found in twb system the errors of 3 and 7 maximum fairlead tension and 3 maximum anchor tension are 3 3 7 7 and 7 2 respectively according to the statistics the greatest errors are found in the standard deviations where the simulation results are always greater than the experimental ones despite of the position fairlead or anchor point and mooring system meanwhile the numerical mean tensions are extremely close to the measured values the errors are below 10 for all cases furthermore by comparing the experimental results of tw and twb it is found that the buoys have some influence on the fairlead tension reduction while their effects on anchor tension are limited for example the top tension of most loaded mooring line and 3 anchor tension are reduced by 7 4 and 1 6 respectively if the buoys are considered it can be explained that the suspension angle angle between top of mooring and z axis of the mooring line was increased once the buoy was installed which helps to increase the horizontal restoring force furthermore the installed buoys helped to increase mooring line damping as a consequence the sway motion response amplitude is reduced which induces mooring top tension decrease for a better understanding of the mooring tension characteristics spectral analysis is carried out and the results are given in figs 26 and 27 as shown in figures the results of tw and twb are similar for all the discussed mooring lines both the low frequency and wave frequency components can be found for upwind mooring lines 4 3 the low frequency components which appear close to the natural sway periods play the dominant role while the wave frequency components are negligible however an opposite result can be found in the leeward mooring lines 8 7 the wave frequency components are dominant to low frequency part furthermore it is seen that the numerical tension spectral peaks are always greater than the measured ones both for the low frequency component and wave frequency component it can be understood that the numerical system damping level is lower than the experimental one which leads to the motion responses are overestimated slightly as a consequence the numerical mooring tension responses are more violent by comparing the results of fig 26 b with fig 27 b it is found that the wave frequency tension difference between numerical and experimental values are more significant once the buoys are installed this phenomenon is understood that the top end mooring line segments are slacker once the buoys are attached in other words the mooring tensions are more sensitivity to hydrodynamic loads in addition the buoys help to increase hydrodynamic loads on the mooring line as a result the twb wave frequency tension are greater and more sensitivity to uncertain input coefficients 4 6 head sea 4 6 1 platform motion response three main dof motion responses in this sea state are surge in y direction heave and pitch rotating around y axis the tw and twb motion responses are shown in figs 28 and 29 the statistics are given in table 11 according to the values in table 11 the numerical simulations present reliable predictions the numerical motions are close to the experimental data the errors of maximum surge amplitudes for tw and twb are 6 9 and 6 5 respectively the measured value are slightly greater than simulations due to the lower restoring stiffness the errors of maximum pitch motion responses are very small which are 1 3 and 7 0 for tw and twb respectively the phenomenon that the motion response reduction when buoys being installed does not find in head sea the surge motion responses of twb are competent to tw in general the effects of buoy on platform motion responses are ignorable in head sea figs 30 and 31 give the tw and twb motion response spectra respectively it is found that the numerical spectra match well with experimental results similar to sway motion response in beam sea the surge motion is dominated by the low frequency component a significant peak can be found around the natural period of surge motion obviously the heave motion shows strong wave frequency characteristic two wave frequency peaks one locates on the heave natural period and the other one closes to wave peak period are found it is observed that the numerical heave natural peaks are much greater than the experimental ones which may be explained that the hydrodynamic heave damping in numerical model is lower than the actual value since the viscous effects are not easy to be estimated accurately the numerical pitch spectra have similar shapes to measured results totally three peaks could be found which are located near natural surge periods natural pitch periods and wave peak periods respectively 4 6 2 mooring tension analysis the concerned mooring tensions of tw and twb are shown in figs 32 and 33 as shown in fig 32 a and fig 33 a the 1 mooring tensions are varying intensively with time several abrupt peaks could be observed on the contrary the tensions of slackest mooring line 9 are comparatively stable the 3 mean anchor tension of tw was underestimated clearly by numerical model the similar results can be observed in the twb which could be the reason that the pretension of 3 mooring line were not accurate enough for better presenting mooring tensions the statistics are summarized in table 12 it is demonstrated that the mooring tensions are reduced due to effects of buoys the maximum 1 fairlead tension and 3 anchor tension are reduced by 3 6 and 1 5 respectively according to the experimental values however their influences on anchor tensions are negligible the numerical results are in good agreement with the measured values the errors of maximum 1 fairlead tension 9 fairlead tension and 3 anchor tension are 9 5 5 1 and 2 7 respectively in tw it is found that the errors of twb maximum tensions are slightly greater than tw which could be the effects of buoy since it is not easy to simulate the hydrodynamic loads of buoy precisely however the results are still satisfactory it is observed that errors of maximum tension are below than 11 the greatest difference between numerical and tested values are found in the standard deviations which are over 20 in figs 34 and 35 it can be seen that both low frequency and wave frequency components can be found in the mooring tension spectra for the upwind mooring lines 1 and 3 the low frequency parts are dominant to the wave frequency parts while for the leeward mooring line 9 the areas under wave frequency tension spectra are comparable to the low frequency part despite of they have smaller peaks the numerical and experimental tension spectra have similar configurations despite of the differences between peak values it is found that the numerical spectra peaks are always greater than the experimental values and differences in twb are greater than tw the reasons have been described in beam sea case discussion 4 7 quartering sea 4 7 1 platform motion response analysis in quartering sea state all the six dof motions are considered and discussed the results for these two different systems are given in figs 36 and 37 and the corresponding statistics are given in table 13 as shown in table 13 the errors of platform motion responses are greater compared to the results of beam sea and head sea however the results are still convincing despite of the differences for details the errors of maximum surge amplitude here is the minimum value in table 13 are 18 7 and 7 0 for tw and twb as for sway these two values are 7 8 and 18 6 respectively the greatest differences can be found in yaw motion responses where the numerical responses are greater than actual data furthermore by comparing the measured data of tw and twb it is observed that the motion responses are slightly reduced once the buoys are considered especially for the surge motion the motion response spectra of tw and twb are given in figs 38 and 39 for all concerned motions the numerical and experimental motion spectra have similar configurations which indicate that the numerical results are reliable besides it is found that the experimental surge and sway motion spectra are very close to the simulated results except for the low frequency peak of tw surge spectrum which is clearly lower than numerical one due to higher damping level the comparisons between heave spectra are similar to the other two sea states which are the numerical heave spectra are slightly higher than the measured ones the clear differences can be found in the peaks occur in the natural periods which illustrate that the heave resonance phenomenon are more severe in numerical simulations due to lower heave damping in numerical simulations for the roll spectra it is seen that the measured spectra were dominated by resonant components besides the wave frequency components are the most significant parts in the numerical results and their low frequency components are smaller than the corresponding measured ones the numerical and experimental low frequency pitch spectra components seem comparable while the simulated spectra are always greater than measured in wave frequency by observing fig 38 f and fig 39 f it is found that the numerical yaw spectra peaks are always greater than the experimental values the discrepancy between numerical and experimental motion responses are due to the fact that the nonlinear damping cannot be equivalent represented by damping coefficients 4 7 2 mooring tensions in this situation the 1 and 5 mooring line are the tautest and slackest lines of tw while 2 is the most loaded one among all mooring lines in twb the corresponding fairlead mooring tensions most and least loaded and 3 anchor tensions time series of tw and twb are given in figs 40 and 41 in fig 40 it is observed that the numerical fairlead tensions of most loaded line are varied in the similar range to experimental data besides it is found that the fairlead mean tension of 5 in tw are overestimated slightly by numerical model while the opposite results can be found in the 3 anchor tensions it may be explained that the pretension of these two mooring lines were not well adjusted before conducting the irregular wave model tests table 14 gives the mooring tension statistics where it can be seen that the numerical model is precise enough which overestimates the actual tensions slightly for the tw the errors of maximum mooring tension for fmax fmin and 3 achor are 6 5 11 7 and 0 9 respectively as for the twb the numerical model also provides favorable predictions for the fairlead tensions it is observed that the errors of 2 and 5 maximum top tensions are negligible which are 0 4 and 7 0 in details the discrepancies of 3 anchor tensions are greater than discussed top tensions however the result is still satisfactory besides the prior observation that the greatest mooring tension will be reduced if buoys are attached can also be found in this sea state furthermore a similar phenomenon to the former two cases is also seen which is the greatest differences exist in the standard deviations the numerical tensions are varied more dramatically with time due to smaller damping level for further discussing the mooring tension characteristics the spectral analysis is carried out and mooring tension spectra are plotted in figs 42 and 43 it is seen in fig 42 that the low frequency component plays a dominant role in the all concerned tensions spectra besides the numerical and experimental low frequency tension spectra peaks appear almost simultaneously however the simulated values are greater than measured ones especially for the fairlead tension spectra due to the differences between low frequency motion responses the wave frequency component which contributes comparatively less to the upwind mooring tensions becomes a considerable part of the leeward mooring fairlead tension furthermore it is seen that the wave frequency tensions are always overestimated by numerical model the phenomenon is caused by many reasons such as the difference between numerical and experimental motion responses and the uncertain hydrodynamic coefficients the differences between numerical and experimental mooring tension standard deviations are reflected in the mooring tension spectra which can be observed that the area under simulated tension spectra are greater than the corresponding measured values for both of these two mooring systems 5 conclusions a series of 1 50 model tests were carried out to study the dynamics of semi submersible moored by tw and twb mooring systems and corresponding mooring tensions were measured and compared with numerical predictions the results of irregular wave model tests show that the numerical model provides good predictions of semi submersible motion responses the greatest errors of maximum motion responses for beam sea and head sea are below 19 for the motion responses the results in quartering sea are less well compared the beam sea and head sea in quartering sea it can be found that the greatest errors in six dof motions are pitch and yaw however for surge and sway the numerical results still match well with experimental data the errors of maximum values are below 19 furthermore the numerical model performs well in predicting mooring tensions the errors of all concerned maximum mooring tensions for tw are below 12 satisfactory results can also be found in twb the greatest error of maximum tension is found in 1 mooring line in head sea which is 11 the main difference between numerical simulations and experimental data is the standard deviation the installed buoys can reduce fairlead mooring tension slightly while their influence on floating structure motion response is not obvious for beam sea and quartering sea the motions are reduced slightly by attaching the buoys on mooring lines however an opposite result can be found in head sea generally the simulated system responses behave slightly severer than measured including motion responses and mooring tension acknowledgement the first author has been funded by the strategic research plan of

applied in such technological fields as naval ocean mechanical and civil engineering on account of their good mechanical property thang and lee 2018 mu et al 2015 the international maritime organization imo states that the ships shall be constructed to reduce on board noise and to protect personnel from noise in accordance with the code of noise on board ships code on noise levels has been adopted due to the recognized need to establish mandatory noise limits in different spaces of the ships this new code comes into force on 1st of july 2014 much progress has to be made especially in the topics of noise and vibration on board the vibration performance is very important and useful for designers to satisfy the code as one of special composite materials the orthotropic material owing an excellent mechanical behavior results in a lot of applications in the industrial field thus it is very important and useful for designers to understand the free vibration characteristic of the thick orthotropic annular sector plate with general boundary conditions which directly relates to realizing the reasonable and precise mechanical structure design in the past decade great efforts on annular sector plates have been made and also a huge development has been obtained by using the sector fourier p element houmat 2001 surveyed the vibration behavior of the thin sectorial plates

studied the flexural vibrations of an annular sector plate by means of a variational approximation procedure shi et al 2014 used the ritz solutions for vibration analysis of annular circular and sector plates with arbitrary boundary conditions wong et al 2000 extended the mode subtraction method to investigate the sensitivity of changes in displacement mode shape of annular plates relative to the whole size in the above literature the research status of thin plates has been given in detail next we will give a detailed summary of the research results of thick annular sector plates aghdam and mohammadi 2009 applied the extended kantorovich method ekm to conduct the bending analysis of thick annular sector plates with classical boundary conditions based on the mindlin plate theory liew et al 1995 liew and liu 2000 presented the differential quadrature method dqm for free vibration analysis of moderately thick annular sector plates on the basis of the mindlin first order shear deformation theory in their solution the boundary conditions are limited to classical cases mcgee et al 1995 firstly presented an exact solution to solve for the free vibration problem of thick mindlin annular sectorial plates it must be pointed out that the boundary condition is defined to be simply supported in the radial edges and arbitrary classical conditions along the circular edge of the thick plate mizusawa 1991 applied semi analytical methods which are the finite strip method and finite prism method to study the thick annular sector plates with simply supported straight edges cheung and chan 1981 extended the finite strip method to perform the analysis of thin and thick sectorial plates with variable thicknesses and different combinations of boundary conditions jomehzadeh and saidi 2009a b proposed an analytical method to solve the free vibration problem of transversely isotropic moderately thick annular sector plates the boundary conditions under assuming are simply

jomehzadeh and saidi 2009a b using the boundary layer function where the plate radial edges were simply supported and circular edges were subject to arbitrary boundary conditions es haghi 2014 presented an exact closed form solution to study the free vibration of thick circular annular sector plates which are with hard simply supported radial edges and subject to all combinations of free

shear deformation plate theory vaidyanathan et al 1994 apply the rayleigh ritz method to determine the flexural behavior of a cantilevered annular sector mindlin plate of variable rigidity including the effects of the shear deformation and its boundary conditions were limited to some classical cases shi et al 2017 adopted an improved fourier series method and the first order beam theory to study in plane free vibration behaviors of functionally graded carbon nanotube reinforced composite fg cntrc circular arches curved beams under elastic boundary restraints as far as the authors know there has been no specified work for the subject of free vibration of orthotropic annular sector mindlin plates subject to general boundary conditions and with internal radial line and circumferential arc supports most contributions only focus on the free vibration analysis of isotropic annular sector mindlin plates which is with classic boundary supports thus the starting point of this paper is to present a semi analytical solution served for studying the titled problem for the first time based on the mindlin plate theory an energy functional is derived and then minimized by the rayleigh ritz method the admissible displacement functions are reconstructed by using the improved fourier series method to break the barrier of the classical boundary which is caused by the traditional fourier series resulting in the relevant discontinuities of the traditional fourier series and their derivatives at the edges the convergence correctness and accuracy of the present method is validated by several examples for further enriching the research some new results involving the free vibration of thick orthotropic annular sector plates are presented where these plates are subject to different classical boundary conditions and elastic boundary conditions and internal radial line and circumferential arc supports are also added to the plate since there have been no related reference data so far they may serve as reference for future researchers to verify alternative numerical methods besides the effects of boundary springs sector angle orthotropic stiffness radial arc line support location on the frequency parameters of the thick orthotropic annular sector plates will be studied and then some vital and useful conclusions are obtained 2 theoretical and numerical formulations as

18 we can easily acquire the natural frequencies or eigenvalues and associated mode shapes or eigenvectors of thick orthotropic annular sector plates 3 numerical results and discussion by comparing the two results from the proposed solving method and other published methods it proves that the present method is feasible reliable and of high accuracy if no special instructions in this paper the ω

sector plate with f free c clamped s simply support and e elastic restrain boundary conditions at r r 0 θ 0 r r 1 and θ ϕ 3 1 convergence and comparison studies in the theoretical and numerical formulations we can know that the calculation accuracy strongly relies on the total number of the expansion series of the admissible displacement functions thus the primary task of the whole paper is to study the convergence of the current solutions to provide a reasonable number of truncation of the admissible displacement functions in the next examples fig 2 shows the variation of the frequency parameters ω versus the truncated numbers m n for thick orthotropic annular sector plates having cccc and ssss boundary condition without arc radial support and with central arc radial support the geometrical parameter of the plate are defined as ϕ 120 o h r 1 0 1 and r 0 r 1 0 5 it is obvious that the present solutions have a fast convergence speed and good stability results it is worth noting that fig 2 only shows the comparison of its own convergence but it does not mean that this method is not superior to other numerical methods such as discrete singular convolution method meshless method or differential quadrature method thus the advantages and superiority of the present method should been investigated in detail the comparison of the convergence of the differential quadrature method dqm and the present method for a simply supported sector plate is shown in table 1 liu and liew 1999a b also table 2 shows the comparison of the convergence of the discrete singular convolution dsc method and present method for ssss plate with different modulus ratios ömer 2008 we can know that the present method have the good convergence speed and convergence accuracy moreover we also can know that a highly desired convergence characteristic is observed in that the sufficiently accurate results can be obtained with only a small number of terms in the series expansions thus the truncation number of admissible displacement functions of the annular sector plate are uniformly chosen as m n 14 in the rest of this research in both comparison and parametric studies based on the convergence study the next task of this subsection is to verify the validation and the correctness of the present method table 3 and table 4 show the first six frequency parameters ω of the thick isotropic annular sector plates with different boundary conditions for comparison the reference results taken from liew et al 1995 liew and liu 2000 by means of dqm are also given there in table 4 the first four frequency parameters ω for thick orthotropic annular sector plates with different boundary conditions are presented the comparison results are made with the finite element method of abaqus software due to lack of the published values the element type and element size of the finite element modeling are s4r and 0 01 0 01 respectively from the previous tables the results obtained by the present method and other methods are in close agreement next we will focus on the free vibrations of thick orthotropic annular sector plates with internal radial line and circumferential arc supports in table 6 taking three types of classical boundary conditions for example the detailed results acquired from the present method are listed by liew et al 1995 dqm are also given for the comparison it s very clear that the two results coincide with each other well 3 2 new results and parameter studies based on the convergence and comparison studies the accuracy and reliability of the current solution has been validated by the previous examples however as mentioned before that the results of the free vibration of thick orthotropic annular sector plates with general boundary conditions internal radial line and circumferential arc supports have not been seen in the past decade research works thus the main task of this paper in to provide the new results of the above mentioned problem with this new results for the thick orthotropic annular sector plates having different boundary conditions without and with radial arc line supports are presented in table 7 and table 8 respectively the four types elastic boundary conditions are considered in those tables and the stiffnesses of the corresponding springs are defined as e1 γ w γ r γ θ 10 6 e2 γ w γ r γ θ 10 8 e3 γ w γ r γ θ 10 10 e4 γ w γ r γ θ 10 12 also the corresponding mode shapes of tables 7 and 8 are illustrated in figs 3 4 after performing new results to provide the benchmark date for the future computing methods next some parameter studies for free vibration characteristics of thick orthotropic annular sector plates are provided in figs 5 8 the effects of boundary spring stiffness on the lowest four frequency parameters for thick orthotropic annular sector plates with respect to the restraint parameters γ w γ r and γ θ are presented in fig 5 fig 5 a and b respectively delegate the plate without and with the radial arc line support the geometry constants of the annular sector plate are the same as tables 5 and 6 the boundary restraint parameters are uniformly changed from 102 to 1016 and the resting type restraint parameters are uniformly chosen as 1016 at all edges from the figures we can clearly see that the vibration behavior of the plate is changed in a certain range in addition we also know that the biggest impact of the boundary springs on vibration characteristics of the plate is the liner type spring γ w on the contrary the influence range of the rotation type spring is less than the liner type spring s fig 6 shows the influence of sector angle on the natural frequencies ω of thick orthotropic annular sector plates with different boundary conditions in which classical boundary condition and elastic boundary condition are included the sector angle is changed from 10 to 350 in addition in order to investigate the relation between the orthotropic stiffness e r e θ and vibration behavior of the orthotropic annular sector plates four kinds of e r e θ 10 20 30 and 40 are considered in fig 6 the rest of material parameter is the same as table 5 and the geometry values of the plate are used as ϕ 120 o h r 1 0 1 r 0 r 1 0 5 as clearly observed from the figures regardless of the boundary condition the frequency parameters of the plate decrease rapidly with the sector angle increasing in addition we also can see that the lower orthotropic stiffness will result in higher frequency parameters no matter what boundary conditions are figs 7 and 8 give the effects of the arc line support location and radial line support location on the frequency frequencies ω with different boundary conditions respectively the geometrical data are consistent with fig 6 for the arc line support location the frequencies ω increase while the location moving from 0 to a critical value and then decline in addition the related curves are not symmetrical about the critical value however for the radial line support location the vibration behavior of the plate changes with respect to the change of the location and all curves are symmetrical about the central location 4 conclusions a first known numerical model of thick orthotropic annular sector plates subject to general boundary conditions and with internal radial line and circumferential arc supports is presented to investigate the free vibration behavior based on the mindlin plate theory an energy functional is derived and then minimized by the rayleigh ritz method the admissible displacement functions are reconstructed by using the improved fourier series method to break the barrier of the classical boundary which is caused by the traditional fourier series resulting in the relevant discontinuities of the traditional fourier series and their derivatives at the edges the convergence correctness and accuracy of the present method is validated by several examples some new results including thick orthotropic annular sector plates with classical boundary condition elastic boundary condition internal radial line and circumferential arc supports are considered which may provide important and useful dates for future researchers for verification of alternative numerical methods in addition the effects of boundary springs sector angle orthotropic stiffness radial arc line support location on the frequency parameters of the thick orthotropic annular sector plates are discussed and some vital and useful conclusions are obtained further acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the

several examples for further enriching the research some new results involving the free vibration of thick orthotropic annular sector plates are presented where these plates are subject to different classical boundary conditions and elastic boundary conditions and internal radial line and circumferential arc supports are also added to the plate since there have been no related reference data so far they may serve as reference for future researchers to verify alternative numerical methods besides the effects of boundary springs sector angle orthotropic stiffness radial arc line support

ωr 1 2 ρh d 11 1 2 which is non dimensional will be used also for the considered material properties the following parameters are adopted e θ 10 gp a e r 20 e θ g r θ 5 gpa g r z 5 gpa g θ z 6 gpa μ r 0 25 ρ 1500 kg m3 in addition for better describing the boundary condition sequence of the annular sector plate a symbolism is employed to simplify this study for example fcse implies an annular sector plate with f free c clamped s simply support and e elastic restrain boundary conditions at r r 0 θ 0 r r 1 and θ ϕ 3 1 convergence and comparison studies in the theoretical and numerical formulations we can know that the calculation accuracy strongly relies on the total number of the expansion series of the admissible displacement functions thus the primary task of the whole paper is to study the convergence of the current solutions to provide a reasonable number of truncation of the admissible displacement functions in the next examples fig 2 shows the variation of the frequency parameters ω versus the truncated numbers m n for thick orthotropic annular sector plates having cccc and ssss boundary condition without arc radial support and with central arc radial support the geometrical parameter of the plate are defined as ϕ 120 o h r 1 0 1 and r 0 r 1 0 5 it is obvious that the present solutions have a fast convergence speed and good stability results it is worth noting that fig 2 only shows the comparison of its own convergence but it does not mean that this method is not superior to other numerical methods such as discrete singular convolution method meshless method or differential quadrature method thus the advantages and superiority of the present method should been investigated in detail the comparison of the convergence of the differential quadrature method dqm and the present method for a simply supported sector plate is shown in table 1 liu and liew 1999a b also table 2 shows the comparison of the convergence of the discrete singular convolution dsc method and present method for ssss plate with different modulus ratios ömer 2008 we can know that the present method have the good convergence speed and convergence accuracy moreover we also can know that a highly desired convergence characteristic is observed in that the sufficiently accurate results can be obtained with only a small number of terms in the series expansions thus the truncation number of admissible displacement functions of the annular sector plate are uniformly chosen as m n 14 in the rest of this research in both comparison and parametric studies based on the convergence study the next task of this subsection is to verify the validation and the correctness of the present method table 3 and table 4 show the first six frequency parameters ω of the thick isotropic annular sector plates with different boundary conditions for comparison the reference results taken from liew et al 1995 liew and liu 2000 by means of dqm are also given there in table 4 the first four frequency parameters ω for thick orthotropic annular sector plates with different boundary conditions are presented the comparison results are made with the finite element method of abaqus software due to lack of the published values the element type and element size of the finite element modeling are s4r and 0 01 0 01 respectively from the previous tables the results obtained by the present method and other methods are in close agreement next we will focus on the free vibrations of thick orthotropic annular sector plates with internal radial line and circumferential arc supports in table 6 taking three types of classical boundary conditions for example the detailed results acquired from the present method are listed by liew et al 1995 dqm are also given for the comparison it s very clear that the two results coincide with each other well 3 2 new results and parameter studies based on the convergence and comparison studies the accuracy and reliability of the current solution has been validated by the previous examples however as mentioned before that the results of the free vibration of thick orthotropic annular sector plates with general boundary conditions internal radial line and circumferential arc supports have not been seen in the past decade research works thus the main task of this paper in to provide the new results of the above mentioned problem with this new results for the thick orthotropic annular sector plates having different boundary conditions without and with radial arc line supports are presented in table 7 and table 8 respectively the four types elastic boundary conditions are considered in those tables and the stiffnesses of the corresponding springs are defined as e1 γ w γ r γ θ 10 6 e2 γ w γ r γ θ 10 8 e3 γ w γ r γ θ 10 10 e4 γ w γ r γ θ 10 12 also the corresponding mode shapes of tables 7 and 8 are illustrated in figs 3 4 after performing new results to provide the benchmark date for the future computing methods next some parameter studies for free vibration characteristics of thick orthotropic annular sector plates are provided in figs 5 8 the effects of boundary spring stiffness on the lowest four frequency parameters for thick orthotropic annular sector plates with respect to the restraint parameters γ w γ r and γ θ are presented in fig 5 fig 5 a and b respectively delegate the plate without and with the radial arc line support the geometry constants of the annular sector plate are the same as tables 5 and 6 the boundary restraint parameters are uniformly changed from 102 to 1016 and the resting type restraint parameters are uniformly chosen as 1016 at all edges from the figures we can clearly see that the vibration behavior of the plate is changed in a certain range in addition we also know that the biggest impact of the boundary springs on vibration characteristics of the plate is the liner type spring γ w on the contrary the influence range of the rotation type spring is less than the liner type spring s fig 6 shows the influence of sector angle on the natural frequencies ω of thick orthotropic annular sector plates with different boundary conditions in which classical boundary condition and elastic boundary condition are included the sector angle is changed from 10 to 350 in addition in order to investigate the relation between the orthotropic stiffness e r e θ and vibration behavior of the orthotropic annular sector plates four kinds of e r e θ 10 20 30 and 40 are considered in fig 6 the rest of material parameter is the same as table 5 and the geometry values of the plate are used as ϕ 120 o h r 1 0 1 r 0 r 1 0 5 as clearly observed from the figures regardless of the boundary condition the frequency parameters of the plate decrease rapidly with the sector angle increasing in addition we also can see that the lower orthotropic stiffness will result in higher frequency parameters no matter what boundary conditions are figs 7 and 8 give the effects of the arc line support location and radial line support location on the frequency frequencies ω with different boundary conditions respectively the geometrical data are consistent with fig 6 for the arc line support location the frequencies ω increase while the location moving from 0 to a critical value and then decline in addition the related curves are not symmetrical about the critical value however for the radial line support location the vibration behavior of the plate changes with respect to the change of the location and all curves are symmetrical about the central location 4 conclusions a first known numerical model of thick orthotropic annular sector plates subject to general boundary conditions and with internal radial line and circumferential arc supports is presented to investigate the free vibration behavior based on the mindlin plate theory an energy functional is derived and then minimized by the rayleigh ritz method the admissible displacement functions are reconstructed by using the improved fourier series method to break the barrier of the classical boundary which is caused by the traditional fourier series resulting in the relevant discontinuities of the traditional fourier series and their derivatives at the edges the convergence correctness and accuracy of the present method is validated by several examples some new results including thick orthotropic annular sector plates with classical boundary condition elastic boundary condition internal radial line and circumferential arc supports are considered which may provide important and useful dates for future researchers for verification of alternative numerical methods in addition the effects of boundary springs sector angle orthotropic stiffness radial arc line support location on the frequency parameters of the thick orthotropic annular sector plates are discussed and some vital and useful conclusions are obtained further acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the

23269,a steady state three dimensional multiphase hydrodynamic model based on the kinetic theory of granular flow is developed to investigate the distributions of solid concentration flow velocity granular pressure and wall shear stress in multi sized slurry two particle sizes d p 0 125 mm and 0 44 mm equal fraction by mass transport by pipelines d 54 9 mm the trends of the variation in transport properties with varying efflux particle concentrations c vf 20 30 40 and 50 and flow velocities v 2 3 4 and 5 m s are studied and the effects of other different sized particles on characteristics are modeled simulation results agree well with the corresponding experimental results in literature the simulation results show that coarse and fine particle phases have different characteristics in each operating condition the degree of deviation of the characteristics of different sized particles increases as solid concentration or mixture velocity decreases additionally the distinct effects of near wall lift force and particle wall collision on the characteristics of different sized particles in multi sized slurry are observed the results obtained in this work elucidate the characteristics of different sized particles in multi sized slurry and provide a solid foundation for studying the mesoscopic processes of slurry transport by pipelines keywords eulerian multiphase model pipeline transport multi sized particle high concentration slurry dredging deep sea mining 1 introduction in the last few decades the pipeline transport of particulate materials has been promoted in dredging because pipelines are insulated from the environment and can be run in uninterrupted mode to reduce investment operating costs achieve high efficiency energy saving environmental protection and easily implement optimized control this method has been widely applied in several fields such as coal metallurgy and mining according to statistics pipeline transport in the dredging industry has contributed hundreds of billion dollars to the global economy in recent years in addition pipelines are considered as the tool with the most potential in emerging markets such as ocean mining in the past few decades most studies on slurry pipeline transport have focused on the prediction of friction loss and critical velocity no stable particle bed the lowest pressure loss point in recent years enterprises have focused on the increase in operation cost caused by pipeline wear and maintenance generally industrial slurry operates in the heterogeneous regime for economic benefit in which the solid concentration in the lower half of a pipe is higher than that in the upper half owing to the gravitational effect thus the wear of the bottom of the pipe is worse to improve safety performance and enhance economic returns pipelines are rotated according to pipeline abrasion level therefore the knowledge of slurry concentration and velocity distributions which leads to accurate prediction of the degree of pipeline wear is an effective method of ensuring the safety of construction and improving economic benefits existing models of slurry pipeline transport can accurately predict parameters such as pressure drop particle settling velocity and solid concentration distribution under different operating conditions using pipe diameter particle size slurry concentration etc however most of these models are empirical formulae based on dimensionless parameters such as excess pressure froude number and solid concentration derived from experimental data or semi empirical formulae based on the theory of gravity energy etc it is impossible to characterize performance in theory such as the turbulence intensity and particle momentum exchange in pipelines however these microscopic characteristics significantly affect pipeline characteristics in several cases with a variety of graded particles of multiple sizes understanding the changes in these parameters at different positions within a pipeline is critical for improving the understanding of the microscopic characteristics such as pipes wear energy loss and slurry flow regime in slurry pipeline transport existing models cannot accurately predict the particle concentration distribution close to the bottom of a pipe particularly when the maximum concentration of coarse particles deviates from that observed at the bottom of a pipe in the experiment performed by kaushal and tomita 2007 however the solid concentration distribution close to a pipe wall determines the local solid pressure wall shear stress and friction resistance moreover it is a critical factor in pipeline wear thus accurate prediction of the solid concentration distribution particular close to a pipeline wall is the key to predicting pipeline wear and calculating friction resistance the knowledge of solid concentration velocity distribution and their variation in a pipe under different conditions is important for understanding the mechanism of pressure drop and predicting the degree of wear in pipelines in addition it is important for improving economic efficiency with the development of computer technology computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely applied for predicting the properties of pipeline transported slurry in addition the improvement in calculation methods makes cfd faster more convenient and more adaptable to engineering applications even though cfd is still in the developing stage for solid liquid two phase flow most models refer to the gas liquid two phase flow theory it is relatively well developed in terms of velocity distribution and solid concentration distribution simulations in view of the current status of cfd technology a three dimensional 3d cfd model based on the granular kinetic theory is established for a horizontal pipeline the results obtained using the model are compared with published experimental results to study the variation in velocity distribution and concentration distribution with particle concentration particle size slurry velocity and pipe diameter the next section provides a brief review of the existing work in this field 2 previous work in the last few decades extensive research has been performed on slurry pipeline transport however the primary direction of research has always been pressure drop and critical velocity which are typically given by the durand 1952 formula this formula is based on experimental data and is used by the majority of the european dredging industry wilson and addie 1997 formula is widely used by the dredging industry of the americas the two phase flow model developed by wasp et al 1977 considers particle concentration distribution in transport processes the formula proposed by turian and yuan 1977 uses different dimensionless parameters to fit experimental data doron and barnea 1993 proposed a three layer model based on mechanical balance the formula developed by lahiri and ghanta 2008 fits existing experimental data using artificial intelligence the delft head loss limit deposit velocity framework provided by miedema 2015 2016a 2016b explains the mechanism of pressure drop it is considerably simple and has widespread applicability owing to the use of easy sampling parameters starting from the earliest empirical formula based on purely dimensionless analysis to the lift theory energy theory and two phase flow theory work is being performed related to theoretical analysis however microscopic parameters such as turbulent dissipation force particle collision force and momentum exchange have not yet been investigated numerous scholars have made significant contributions to the study of concentration distribution for example karabelas 1977 roco and shook 2010 kaushal and tomita 2002 and gillies et al 2004 they have performed several experimental studies for different operating conditions such as different diameters and particle sizes in different flow conditions miedima 2017 and others have developed methods of calculating the solid concentration profile in the vertical direction in pipelines based on previous experimental data with flow parameters such as eddy diffusivity and particle settling velocity these methods can predict a close representation of the concentration distribution in varying degrees however they involve less flow parameters and more empirical coefficients and their range of application and calculation accuracy relies on the experience of a reckoner kaushal and tomita 2007 carried out experiments on particles with a narrow gradation particle diameter 0 125 mm and 0 44 mm experimental results clearly showed that the maximum concentrations of coarse particles occur in the zone that is approximately 0 2d where d is the diameter of the pipe from the wall rather at than the bottom of the pipe this proved the speculation by wilson and sellgren 2003 about the effect of near wall lift on the particle concentration close to the bottom of a pipe however there is no mathematical model to predict and interpret this conclusion kaushal et al 2012 additionally kaushal et al 2005 carried out experiments on a mixture of glass beads of two sizes 0 125 mm and 0 44 mm equal fractions by mass in a horizontal pipe with a diameter of 54 9 mm and analyzed the effect of particle size distribution on the pressure drop and concentration profile in pipelines in the field of numerical simulation ling et al 2003 kaushal et al 2012 gopaliya and kaushal 2015 2016 and kumar et al 2016 numerically simulated single sized slurry flow through horizontal pipe under a wide range of operating conditions using the single solid phase eulerian model in fluent ekambara et al 2009 predicted the behavior of horizontal solid liquid pipeline flows under different conditions using the two fluid model in ansys cfx messa et al 2014 messa and malavasi 2015 proposed a two fluid model and used it to simulate fully suspended liquid solid slurry flow in horizontal pipes using the phoenics software then an improved wall function was developed which clearly enhanced computing speed and accuracy all these models can correctly predict flow characteristics to different degrees however they cannot accurately calculate the particle concentration distribution close to the wall particularly for coarse particles chen et al 2009 considered the coal particles with bimodal distribution as two solid phase components and used the eulerian multiphase model in fluent to investigate the effects of influx velocity total influx concentration and grain composition on slurry flow characteristics such as constituent particle concentration distribution velocity distribution and pressure gradients they found that the pressure drop observed in the simulation results of the double solid phase model is closer to experimental data as compared to the results of the single solid phase model in addition kaushal et al 2017 used the eulerian two phase model in fluent to simulate the pressure drop and particle concentration distribution in the flow of bimodal slurry comprising silica sand and fly ash at different ratios in a horizontal bend and obtained the variation in bend loss coefficient with increase in the percentage of fly ash however the bimodal slurry used in the abovementioned papers contains a large number of other sized particles and the generality of the model and the simulation accuracy of different sized particle characteristics in slurry are limited in addition even though the existing formula for horizontal pipes can predict slurry characteristics in various operating conditions such as friction resistance and solid concentration it cannot be applied to complex geometries such as loop lines and gate valves because the empirical formula cannot consider slurry turbulence intensity particle collision energy exchange etc however in practice all pipeline systems in the dredging mining coal industries inevitably contain pumps angular pipes pipe branches and other complex geometries thus the formula fails to describe the properties of the entire system therefore the development of a universal model is the goal of scholars worldwide for overcoming the abovementioned limitations an integrated model based on the granular kinetic theory is developed using fluent this model can accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of pipeline slurry transport 3 mathematical modeling the eulerian multiphase model is used in this study in which different phases are treated mathematically as interpenetrating continua the granular kinetic theory is used to describe the interaction between particles a single pressure is shared by all phases the conservation equations of mass momentum and energy are solved individually for each phase the coupling of all phases is achieved through pressure and interphase exchange coefficients the model considers energy dissipation energy exchange between particles interfacial forces such as the drag force caused by the difference between the speeds of phases the virtual mass force due to particle acceleration the lift force due to phase velocity gradient and other forces the eulerian multiphase model is extremely suitable for simulating the transport of high concentration graded particles in pipelines 3 1 conservation equations 3 1 1 conservation of mass in the model multiphase flow includes a primary phase and n secondary phases water is considered as the primary phase and every secondary phase represents

time and their sum is equal to one 1 q 1 n 1 α q 1 in multiphase flows the volume fraction of every phase is less than its maximum allowed value thus each phase in the model is considered as a

a fluid solid mixture solid phase stresses are the key elements derived by making an analogy between the random particle motion arising from inelastic particle particle and particle wall collisions

range of application and for its universality for comparison with experimental data this study established several models of horizontal pipes with inner diameter d 54 9 mm and length l 60d separately to ensure good accuracy in computations and to achieve convergence 30 boundary layers were established along the surface with a growth factor of 1 2 each row of the boundary layer mesh is 20 thicker than the previous row and the height of the outermost layer height was approximately 0 08 mm moreover the height of the first layer from the wall was expressed as a dimensionless parameter y where y 5 the total number of cells in each of these 3d models was approximately 10 million as shown in fig 1 the following physical properties were considered phase 1 primary phase water density ρ l 998 2 k g m 3 dynamic viscosity μ l 1 003 10 3 p a s phase 2 secondary phase 0 125 mm glass beads limiting volume concentration 0 61 phase 3 secondary phase 0 44 mm glass beads limiting volume concentration 0 63 particle density ρ s 2470 k g m 3 the default value of 30 was selected for the internal friction angle 4 2 boundary conditions the velocity inlet condition was applied at the inlet specified values were assigned to the velocities and concentrations of both phases the velocity of the particle phase was slightly smaller than that of the liquid phases and the velocity of coarse particles was slightly smaller than that of fine particles the default values of 5 10 and 20 c were selected for turbulent intensity turbulent viscosity ratio and temperature respectively the pressure outlet condition with atmospheric pressure was applied at the outlet the no slip condition was applied at the wall i e the velocity of the liquid phases was set to zero wall roughness was set as 0 02 mm and the specularity coefficient which was taken as 0 2 was selected for the shear condition of the solid phase the johnson jackson model was selected for particles and the restitution coefficient was set as 0 2 4 3 solving process and convergence scheme commercial cfd software fluent 17 0 was used in this study to solve the continuum equations and boundary conditions mentioned above root mean square residuals were used and the residuals for convergence were set as 10 4 the phase coupled simple algorithm was selected to ensure that results were steady and accurate and convergence was obtained the first order upwind method was adopted to solve the momentum equations the pressure relaxation factor and momentum relaxation factor were set as 0 2 each the volume fraction was set as 0 3 and the default values of other factors were used 5 analysis and discussion to analyze a larger range of simulation results and compare with experimental data in a limited space some typical experimental cases with a mixture of two sizes 0 125 and 0 44 mm in equal fractions by mass kaushal et al 2005 were simulated using fluent and they covered a wide range of particle volume concentration 20 50 and slurry flow rate 2 5 m s then the simulation results for two particle concentration distributions were compared with the corresponding measured data 5 1 validation of the model to improve the quality of the model and ensure the accuracy of the simulation it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the calculation methods and boundary conditions set the parameters and validate the model using experimental data initially the sensitivity of the primary parameters in the model to each transport characteristic is analyzed such as the effect of the solution methods of the transport equation external forces particle particle restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient on the solid concentration distribution and pressure drop fig 2 shows the effect of the restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient on the mixture concentration distribution table 1 shows their influence on the pressure drop as shown in fig 2 there is no difference in the mixture concentration distributions for various restitution coefficients and specularity coefficients if only the accuracy of solid concentration distribution and model generality are considered the default values of 0 9 and 0 should be taken for the restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient respectively however based their effects on pressure drop as shown in table 1 0 99 and 0 2 are the optimal values the maximal error is the smallest 7 5 because the behavior of different sized particles in multi sized slurry cannot be measured to validate the simulation models under the current experimental condition the external forces and boundary conditions were first validated using the experimental data for single sized slurry fig 3 shows the validation results for different conditions fig 3a shows the results of the solid concentration distribution validated using the experimental data published by kaushal et al 2005 fig 3b shows the results of the velocity distribution validated using the experimental data published by gillies et al 2004 and roco and shook 1983 then the accuracy of the model in simulating mixture characteristics in multi sized slurry is validated as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the simulation results are in excellent agreement with experimental data the model can accurately predict the transport characteristics in single sized slurry and the mixture behaviors in two sized slurry thus it is considered that the simulation result of different sized particle behaviors in multi sized slurry has significant reference value 5 2 solid concentration distribution figs 4 and 5 exhibit different trends of solid volume concentration in the simulation results separately covering slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 each figure displays solid volume concentration contours on the left and the curve on its centerline is compared with the experimental data on the right of the figure these experimental data were initially reported by kaushal et al 2005 the numerical predictions show reasonable coincidences with the experimental results indicating that the model condition is satisfied by simulating the particle concentration distribution for a wide range of solid concentrations and slurry velocities fig 4 shows the simulation results at a constant mixture velocity 2 m s in different solid volume concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 all secondary phase solid volume concentrations are asymmetric in the perpendicular direction particularly the coarser particle phase at low concentration and velocity in addition the coarser particle concentrations in the higher half portion are clearly lower than those in the other portion of the pipe and this non uniformity is reduced by increasing the solid volume concentration at a given velocity because of increased particle particle collision as shown in fig 4 the deviation of the maximum particle concentration point from the bottom of the pipe is approximately 0 1d which fits with the experimental results this implies that the model can simulate the effect of wall lift force on the multi sized particle concentration distribution additionally in phase 3 the particle diameter was 0 44 mm and the maximum particle concentration point was situated above the bottom of the pipe at approximately 0 1d thus the concentration sharply reduced while nearing the bottom however in phase 2 the particle diameter was 0 125 mm and a significant increase was observed in the solids concentration near the pipe y 0 02d this phenomenon mirrored the effect of near wall lift force finer particles show an opposite trend because the size is less than the thickness of the viscous sublayer thus finer particles are not influenced by the near wall lift force and collide with the wall remained the peak value of solid concentration of phase 2 near the pipe bottom is not displayed in fig 4d because the increasing solid concentration enhances the particle particle and particle wall collisions and the particles become more uniform based on the slurry flow regime judgment by wasp et al 1977 if 0 1 c v y 0 8 c vf 0 8 where c v y 0 8 is the local solid volume concentration at y 0 8 and c vf is the efflux solid volume concentration the flow is heterogeneous in phase 3 the coarser particles flow from the sliding bed as shown in fig 4a attain the initial heterogeneous flow shown in fig 4b the last heterogeneous flow shown in fig 4c and finally the pseudo homogenous flow shown in fig 4d while phase 2 always displays pseudo homogenous flow at different velocities fig 5 provides the simulation results of the solid concentration distribution with 30 concentration at different slurry velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s as shown in the figure the asymmetry of the slurry concentration curve is significantly reduced with the increase of slurry velocity at a given concentration this is because the particle suspension performance enhances with the increase in velocity turbulence intensity and turbulent dissipation forces fig 5 shows that with the increase in velocity from 2 to 5 m s the deviation of the maximum coarse particle concentration point from the bottom of the pipe increases by approximately 20 from 0 076d to 0 092d and the deviation of the peak value of the solid concentration of phase 2 from the pipe bottom increases by approximately 80 from 0 013d to 0 024d similar to fig 4 the phenomena of different high reversals of particle concentration between phases 2 and 3 are shown in fig 5 as the conveying velocity increases the regime of phase 3 0 44 mm also changes from heterogeneous to homogeneous and the performance of phase 2 0 125 mm mainly spreads in upper part of the pipe squeezed by coarser particles at low speed when flow velocity is up to 5 m s as shown in fig 5d the distribution of fine and coarse particles is close to a vertical line this is because the turbulence intensity increases with the increased velocity the virtual mass force on the particle is increased and the particle size distribution is more uniform 5 3 velocity distribution figs 6 and 7 exhibit different trends of solid velocity distribution in the simulation results separately covering slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 the secondary phase velocity contours are plotted on the left and the curves for the three phases at their centerline are plotted on the right the contour plots are derived from the cross section 3 m to the inlet of the cfd model as shown in the figures the velocity distributions of the three phases are considerably similar fig 6 shows the simulation results of solid velocity distribution at a velocity of 2 m s with different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 the solid volume concentration distribution is shown in fig 4 as shown in the figure the point of maximum velocity is situated significantly above the pipe center at a low concentration and it will move down slowly with the increase in solid concentration fig 7 shows the simulation results of solid velocity distribution at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s with 30 concentration the solid volume concentration distribution is shown in fig 5 as shown the point of maximum velocity is situated significantly above the pipe center at a low velocity and it nears the center with the increase in solid concentration in fig 7d a constant velocity characteristic is clearly observed in the turbulent core and agrees excellently with the corresponding concentration distribution in fig 5d it expresses the property of homogeneity 5 4 granular pressure distribution figs 8 and 9 exhibit different trends of granular pressure distribution in the separate simulation results of slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 the contours of the granular pressure distribution of phase 2 are plotted on the left and those of phase 3 are plotted on the right these contour plots are derived from the cross section 3 m inlet of the cfd model fig 8 shows the simulation results of granular pressure distribution at 2 m s velocity with different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 its solid volume concentration and velocity distribution are shown in fig 4 and 6 respectively as shown in the figure for phase 2 the maximum granular pressure is near the pipe wall and close to the central symmetry however for phase 3 the maximum granular pressure is always situated at the bottom of the pipe this is because the coarser particles are mainly distributed in the bottom of the pipe where the intensity of collision is higher than that at the top of the pipe in addition the fine particle distribution is relatively uniform and the collisions at all directions are similar fig 8 also shows that with the increasing concentration the granular pressure in phase 3 increases particularly at the top of the pipe but that in phase 2 decreases this is because the increased concentration compressed the movement space and reduces the fluctuating velocity of the finer particles while simultaneously enhancing the collision of the coarse particles fig 9 shows the simulation results of the granular pressure distributions at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s with 30 concentration the corresponding solid volume concentrations and velocity distributions are shown in fig 5 and 7 as shown in fig 9 the granular pressures of two sizes of solids increased with the concentration because of the increasing turbulence and collision intensity due to the increase in slurry velocity in addition fig 9 shows that with the increase in velocity the granular pressure at the top of the pipe increases corresponding with the concentration distribution shown in fig 5 this is because the particles are closing toward homogeneity with increasing velocity thus enhancing the collision at the top of the pipe 5 5 wall shear stress distribution figs 10 and 11 exhibit different trends of solid wall shear stress distribution in the simulation results of the slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 the contours of the solid wall shear stress of phases 2 and 3 are plotted on the left and right respectively the contour plots are 100 mm long from 3 to 3 1 m at the inlet of the cfd model fig 10 shows the simulation results of the solid wall shear stress distribution at 2 m s velocity with different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 its other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 4 6 and 8 as shown the solid wall shear stresses of both secondary phases increase with the solid concentration and the growth rate of phase 2 is larger than that of phase 3 this mirrors the fact that particles of phase 3 distribution become more uniform and the space of phase 2 is compressed intensively with increasing solid concentration fig 11 shows the simulation results of the solid wall shear stress distribution at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s with 30 concentration its other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 5 7 and 9 as shown the solid wall shear stresses of both secondary phases increase with the solid velocity additionally the solid wall shear stress of phase 3 mainly affects the bottom of pipe at low velocity while phase 2 affects the entire pipe periphery as the slurry velocity or solid concentration increases the solid wall shear stress distribution of phase 3 becomes more uniform 5 6 pressure drop fig 12 shows the simulation results of the pressure drop at a velocity of 2 m s for different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 the other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 4 6 8 and 10 as shown in fig 12 the simulation results are larger than experimental values when c vf 40 this is because the resistance reduction effect of fine particles in multi sized slurry is neglected in the eulerian multiphase model fig 13 shows the simulation results of pressure drop at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s for a concentration of 30 the other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 5 7 9 and 11 as shown in the figure the simulation results are larger than experimental values when v 5 m s 6 conclusion a steady 3d hydrodynamic model of multi sized slurry transport through a pipeline was developed with eulerian multiphase flow in fluent parameters such as the secondary phase solid volume concentration distribution velocity distribution granular pressure distribution and solid wall shear stress distribution were obtained from a wide range of particle volume concentrations and mixture velocities in addition the trend of these parameters was analyzed with varying concentration and velocity the mixture volume concentration distributions obtained through the simulation agree excellently with the experimental data published by kaushal et al 2005 the following conclusions have been drawn based on the present study 1 in multi sized slurry fine particles are typically in the regime of homogeneity or pseudo homogeneity when the flow rate is above the critical velocity moreover a reversal of solid concentration appears in the viscous sublayer at low concentration 2 in multi sized slurry coarse particles are in the regime of sliding from the bed at low concentration and low velocity and passing through heterogeneity and pseudo homogeneity with the increase in solid concentration or velocity additionally owing to the effect of the near wall lift force the maximum particle concentration point was situated above the bottom of the pipe at approximately 0 1d 3 all velocity distributions of each phase in the multi sized slurry are similar at the condition of low concentration and low velocity the point of maximum velocity is situated significantly above the pipe s center moves downward with increasing solid concentration and closes toward the center of the pipe with increase in the slurry velocity 4 with increasing concentration the granular pressure in phase 3 increases particularly at the top of the pipe however the granular pressure in phase 2 decreases in contrast the granular pressures in both secondary phases start increasing with the slurry velocity 5 the increase in the solid wall shear stress is sensitive to the slurry velocity compared with the solid concentration furthermore most of the boundary conditions of the model are default and do not considerably influence the input data this implies that the present model can be considered as a relatively common and useful model for simulating multi sized slurry transport through a pipeline acknowledgments this research work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779143 and

23269,a steady state three dimensional multiphase hydrodynamic model based on the kinetic theory of granular flow is developed to investigate the distributions of solid concentration flow velocity granular pressure and wall shear stress in multi sized slurry two particle sizes d p 0 125 mm and 0 44 mm equal fraction by mass transport by pipelines d 54 9 mm the trends of the variation in transport properties with varying efflux particle concentrations c vf 20 30 40 and 50 and flow velocities v 2 3 4 and 5 m s are studied and the effects of other different sized particles on characteristics are modeled simulation results agree well with the corresponding experimental results in literature the simulation results show that coarse and fine particle phases have different characteristics in each operating condition the degree of deviation of the characteristics of different sized particles increases as solid concentration or mixture velocity decreases additionally the distinct effects of near wall lift force and particle wall collision on the characteristics of different sized particles in multi sized slurry are observed the results obtained in this work elucidate the characteristics of different sized particles in multi sized slurry and provide a solid foundation for studying the mesoscopic processes of slurry transport by pipelines keywords eulerian multiphase model pipeline transport multi sized particle high concentration slurry dredging deep sea mining 1 introduction in the last few decades the pipeline transport of particulate materials has been promoted in dredging because pipelines are insulated from the environment and can be run in uninterrupted mode to reduce investment operating costs achieve high efficiency energy saving environmental protection and easily implement optimized control this method has been widely applied in several fields such as coal metallurgy and mining according to statistics pipeline transport in the dredging industry has contributed hundreds of billion dollars to the global economy in recent years in addition pipelines are considered as the tool with the most potential in emerging markets such as ocean mining in the past few decades most studies on slurry pipeline transport have focused on the prediction of friction loss and critical velocity no stable particle bed the lowest pressure loss point in recent years enterprises have focused on the increase in operation cost caused by pipeline wear and maintenance generally industrial slurry operates in the heterogeneous regime for economic benefit in which the solid concentration in the lower half of a pipe is higher than that in the upper half owing to the gravitational effect thus the wear of the bottom of the pipe is worse to improve safety performance and enhance economic returns pipelines are rotated according to pipeline abrasion level therefore the knowledge of slurry concentration and velocity distributions which leads to accurate prediction of the degree of pipeline wear is an effective method of ensuring the safety of construction and improving economic benefits existing models of slurry pipeline transport can accurately predict parameters such as pressure drop particle settling velocity and solid concentration distribution under different operating conditions using pipe diameter particle size slurry concentration etc however most of these models are empirical formulae based on dimensionless parameters such as excess pressure froude number and solid concentration derived from experimental data or semi empirical formulae based on the theory of gravity energy etc it is impossible to characterize performance in theory such as the turbulence intensity and particle momentum exchange in pipelines however these microscopic characteristics significantly affect pipeline characteristics in several cases with a variety of graded particles of multiple sizes understanding the changes in these parameters at different positions within a pipeline is critical for improving the understanding of the microscopic characteristics such as pipes wear energy loss and slurry flow regime in slurry pipeline transport existing models cannot accurately predict the particle concentration distribution close to the bottom of a pipe particularly when the maximum concentration of coarse particles deviates from that observed at the bottom of a pipe in the experiment performed by kaushal and tomita 2007 however the solid concentration distribution close to a pipe wall determines the local solid pressure wall shear stress and friction resistance moreover it is a critical factor in pipeline wear thus accurate prediction of the solid concentration distribution particular close to a pipeline wall is the key to predicting pipeline wear and calculating friction resistance the knowledge of solid concentration velocity distribution and their variation in a pipe under different conditions is important for understanding the mechanism of pressure drop and predicting the degree of wear in pipelines in addition it is important for improving economic efficiency with the development of computer technology computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely applied for predicting the properties of pipeline transported slurry in addition the improvement in calculation methods makes cfd faster more convenient and more adaptable to engineering applications even though cfd is still in the developing stage for solid liquid two phase flow most models refer to the gas liquid two phase flow theory it is relatively well developed in terms of velocity distribution and solid concentration distribution simulations in view of the current status of cfd technology a three dimensional 3d cfd model based on the granular kinetic theory is established for a horizontal pipeline the results obtained using the model are compared with published experimental results to study the variation in velocity distribution and concentration distribution with particle concentration particle size slurry velocity and pipe diameter the next section provides a brief review of the existing work in this field 2 previous work in the last few decades extensive research has been performed on slurry pipeline transport however the primary direction of research has always been pressure drop and critical velocity which are typically given by the durand 1952 formula this formula is based on experimental data and is used by the majority of the european dredging industry wilson and addie 1997 formula is widely used by the dredging industry of the americas the two phase flow model developed by wasp et al 1977 considers particle concentration distribution in transport processes the formula proposed by turian and yuan 1977 uses different dimensionless parameters to fit experimental data doron and barnea 1993 proposed a three layer model based on mechanical balance the formula developed by lahiri and ghanta 2008 fits existing experimental data using artificial intelligence the delft head loss limit deposit velocity framework provided by miedema 2015 2016a 2016b explains the mechanism of pressure drop it is considerably simple and has widespread applicability owing to the use of easy sampling parameters starting from the earliest empirical formula based on purely dimensionless analysis to the lift theory energy theory and two phase flow theory work is being performed related to theoretical analysis however microscopic parameters such as turbulent dissipation force particle collision force and momentum exchange have not yet been investigated numerous scholars have made significant contributions to the study of concentration distribution for example karabelas 1977 roco and shook 2010 kaushal and tomita 2002 and gillies et al 2004 they have performed several experimental studies for different operating conditions such as different diameters and particle sizes in different flow conditions miedima 2017 and others have developed methods of calculating the solid concentration profile in the vertical direction in pipelines based on previous experimental data with flow parameters such as eddy diffusivity and particle settling velocity these methods can predict a close representation of the concentration distribution in varying degrees however they involve less flow parameters and more empirical coefficients and their range of application and calculation accuracy relies on the experience of a reckoner kaushal and tomita 2007 carried out experiments on particles with a narrow gradation particle diameter 0 125 mm and 0 44 mm experimental results clearly showed that the maximum concentrations of coarse particles occur in the zone that is approximately 0 2d where d is the diameter of the pipe from the wall rather at than the bottom of the pipe this proved the speculation by wilson and sellgren 2003 about the effect of near wall lift on the particle concentration close to the bottom of a pipe however there is no mathematical model to predict and interpret this conclusion kaushal et al 2012 additionally kaushal et al 2005 carried out experiments on a mixture of glass beads of two sizes 0 125 mm and 0 44 mm equal fractions by mass in a horizontal pipe with a diameter of 54 9 mm and analyzed the effect of particle size distribution on the pressure drop and concentration profile in pipelines in the field of numerical simulation ling et al 2003 kaushal et al 2012 gopaliya and kaushal 2015 2016 and kumar et al 2016 numerically simulated single sized slurry flow through horizontal pipe under a wide range of operating conditions using the single solid phase eulerian model in fluent ekambara et al 2009 predicted the behavior of horizontal solid liquid pipeline flows under different conditions using the two fluid model in ansys cfx messa et al 2014 messa and malavasi 2015 proposed a two fluid model and used it to simulate fully suspended liquid solid slurry flow in horizontal pipes using the phoenics software then an improved wall function was developed which clearly enhanced computing speed and accuracy all these models can correctly predict flow characteristics to different degrees however they cannot accurately calculate the particle concentration distribution close to the wall particularly for coarse particles chen et al 2009 considered the coal particles with bimodal distribution as two solid phase components and used the eulerian multiphase model in fluent to investigate the effects of influx velocity total influx concentration and grain composition on slurry flow characteristics such as constituent particle concentration distribution velocity distribution and pressure gradients they found that the pressure drop observed in the simulation results of the double solid phase model is closer to experimental data as compared to the results of the single solid phase model in addition kaushal et al 2017 used the eulerian two phase model in fluent to simulate the pressure drop and particle concentration distribution in the flow of bimodal slurry comprising silica sand and fly ash at different ratios in a horizontal bend and obtained the variation in bend loss coefficient with increase in the percentage of fly ash however the bimodal slurry used in the abovementioned papers contains a large number of other sized particles and the generality of the model and the simulation accuracy of different sized particle characteristics in slurry are limited in addition even though the existing formula for horizontal pipes can predict slurry characteristics in various operating conditions such as friction resistance and solid concentration it cannot be applied to complex geometries such as loop lines and gate valves because the empirical formula cannot consider slurry turbulence intensity particle collision energy exchange etc however in practice all pipeline systems in the dredging mining coal industries inevitably contain pumps angular pipes pipe branches and other complex geometries thus the formula fails to describe the properties of the entire system therefore the development of a universal model is the goal of scholars worldwide for overcoming the abovementioned limitations an integrated model based on the granular kinetic theory is developed using fluent this model can accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of pipeline slurry transport 3 mathematical modeling the eulerian multiphase model is used in this study in which different phases are treated mathematically as interpenetrating continua the granular kinetic theory is used to describe the interaction between particles a single pressure is shared by all phases the conservation equations of mass momentum and energy are solved individually for each phase the coupling of all phases is achieved through pressure and interphase exchange coefficients the model considers energy dissipation energy exchange between particles interfacial forces such as the drag force caused by the difference between the speeds of phases the virtual mass force due to particle acceleration the lift force due to phase velocity gradient and other forces the eulerian multiphase model is extremely suitable for simulating the transport of high concentration graded particles in pipelines 3 1 conservation

time and their sum is equal to one 1 q 1 n 1 α q 1 in multiphase flows the volume fraction of every phase is less than its maximum allowed value thus each phase in the model is considered as a

a fluid solid mixture solid phase stresses are the key elements derived by making an analogy between the random particle motion arising from inelastic particle particle and particle wall collisions

range of application and for its universality for comparison with experimental data this study established several models of horizontal pipes with inner diameter d 54 9 mm and length l 60d separately to ensure good accuracy in computations and to achieve convergence 30 boundary layers were established along the surface with a growth factor of 1 2 each row of the boundary layer mesh is 20 thicker than the previous row and the height of the outermost layer height was approximately 0 08 mm moreover the height of the first layer from the wall was expressed as a dimensionless parameter y where y 5 the total number of cells in each of these 3d models was approximately 10 million as shown in fig 1 the following physical properties were considered phase 1 primary phase water density ρ l 998 2 k g m 3 dynamic viscosity μ l 1 003 10 3 p a s phase 2 secondary phase 0 125 mm glass beads limiting volume concentration 0 61 phase 3 secondary phase 0 44 mm glass beads limiting volume concentration 0 63 particle density ρ s 2470 k g m 3 the default value of 30 was selected for the internal friction angle 4 2 boundary conditions the velocity inlet condition was applied at the inlet specified values were assigned to the velocities and concentrations of both phases the velocity of the particle phase was slightly smaller than that of the liquid phases and the velocity of coarse particles was slightly smaller than that of fine particles the default values of 5 10 and 20 c were selected for turbulent intensity turbulent viscosity ratio and temperature respectively the pressure outlet condition with atmospheric pressure was applied at the outlet the no slip condition was applied at the wall i e the velocity of the liquid phases was set to zero wall roughness was set as 0 02 mm and the specularity coefficient which was taken as 0 2 was selected for the shear condition of the solid phase the johnson jackson model was selected for particles and the restitution coefficient was set as 0 2 4 3 solving process and convergence scheme commercial cfd software fluent 17 0 was used in this study to solve the continuum equations and boundary conditions mentioned above root mean square residuals were used and the residuals for convergence were set as 10 4 the phase coupled simple algorithm was selected to ensure that results were steady and accurate and convergence was obtained the first order upwind method was adopted to solve the momentum equations the pressure relaxation factor and momentum relaxation factor were set as 0 2 each the volume fraction was set as 0 3 and the default values of other factors were used 5 analysis and discussion to analyze a larger range of simulation results and compare with experimental data in a limited space some typical experimental cases with a mixture of two sizes 0 125 and 0 44 mm in equal fractions by mass kaushal et al 2005 were simulated using fluent and they covered a wide range of particle volume concentration 20 50 and slurry flow rate 2 5 m s then the simulation results for two particle concentration distributions were compared with the corresponding measured data 5 1 validation of the model to improve the quality of the model and ensure the accuracy of the simulation it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity of the calculation methods and boundary conditions set the parameters and validate the model using experimental data initially the sensitivity of the primary parameters in the model to each transport characteristic is analyzed such as the effect of the solution methods of the transport equation external forces particle particle restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient on the solid concentration distribution and pressure drop fig 2 shows the effect of the restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient on the mixture concentration distribution table 1 shows their influence on the pressure drop as shown in fig 2 there is no difference in the mixture concentration distributions for various restitution coefficients and specularity coefficients if only the accuracy of solid concentration distribution and model generality are considered the default values of 0 9 and 0 should be taken for the restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient respectively however based their effects on pressure drop as shown in table 1 0 99 and 0 2 are the optimal values the maximal error is the smallest 7 5 because the behavior of different sized particles in multi sized slurry cannot be measured to validate the simulation models under the current experimental condition the external forces and boundary conditions were first validated using the experimental data for single sized slurry fig 3 shows the validation results for different conditions fig 3a shows the results of the solid concentration distribution validated using the experimental data published by kaushal et al 2005 fig 3b shows the results of the velocity distribution validated using the experimental data published by gillies et al 2004 and roco and shook 1983 then the accuracy of the model in simulating mixture characteristics in multi sized slurry is validated as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the simulation results are in excellent agreement with experimental data the model can accurately predict the transport characteristics in single sized slurry and the mixture behaviors in two sized slurry thus it is considered that the simulation result of different sized particle behaviors in multi sized slurry has significant reference value 5 2 solid concentration distribution figs 4 and 5 exhibit different trends of solid volume concentration in the simulation results separately covering slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 each figure displays solid volume concentration contours on the left and the curve on its centerline is compared with the experimental data on the right of the figure these experimental data were initially reported by kaushal et al 2005 the numerical predictions show reasonable coincidences with the experimental results indicating that the model condition is satisfied by simulating the particle concentration distribution for a wide range of solid concentrations and slurry velocities fig 4 shows the simulation results at a constant mixture velocity 2 m s in different solid volume concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 all secondary phase solid volume concentrations are asymmetric in the perpendicular direction particularly the coarser particle phase at low concentration and velocity in addition the coarser particle concentrations in the higher half portion are clearly lower than those in the other portion of the pipe and this non uniformity is reduced by increasing the solid volume concentration at a given velocity because of increased particle particle collision as shown in fig 4 the deviation of the maximum particle concentration point from the bottom of the pipe is approximately 0 1d which fits with the experimental results this implies that the model can simulate the effect of wall lift force on the multi sized particle concentration distribution additionally in phase 3 the particle diameter was 0 44 mm and the maximum particle concentration point was situated above the bottom of the pipe at approximately 0 1d thus the concentration sharply reduced while nearing the bottom however in phase 2 the particle diameter was 0 125 mm and a significant increase was observed in the solids concentration near the pipe y 0 02d this phenomenon mirrored the effect of near wall lift force finer particles show an opposite trend because the size is less than the thickness of the viscous sublayer thus finer particles are not influenced by the near wall lift force and collide with the wall remained the peak value of solid concentration of phase 2 near the pipe bottom is not displayed in fig 4d because the increasing solid concentration enhances the particle particle and particle wall collisions and the particles become more uniform based on the slurry flow regime judgment by wasp et al 1977 if 0 1 c v y 0 8 c vf 0 8 where c v y 0 8 is the local solid volume concentration at y 0 8 and c vf is the efflux solid volume concentration the flow is heterogeneous in phase 3 the coarser particles flow from the sliding bed as shown in fig 4a attain the initial heterogeneous flow shown in fig 4b the last heterogeneous flow shown in fig 4c and finally the pseudo homogenous flow shown in fig 4d while phase 2 always displays pseudo homogenous flow at different velocities fig 5 provides the simulation results of the solid concentration distribution with 30 concentration at different slurry velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s as shown in the figure the asymmetry of the slurry concentration curve is significantly reduced with the increase of slurry velocity at a given concentration this is because the particle suspension performance enhances with the increase in velocity turbulence intensity and turbulent dissipation forces fig 5 shows that with the increase in velocity from 2 to 5 m s the deviation of the maximum coarse particle concentration point from the bottom of the pipe increases by approximately 20 from 0 076d to 0 092d and the deviation of the peak value of the solid concentration of phase 2 from the pipe bottom increases by approximately 80 from 0 013d to 0 024d similar to fig 4 the phenomena of different high reversals of particle concentration between phases 2 and 3 are shown in fig 5 as the conveying velocity increases the regime of phase 3 0 44 mm also changes from heterogeneous to homogeneous and the performance of phase 2 0 125 mm mainly spreads in upper part of the pipe squeezed by coarser particles at low speed when flow velocity is up to 5 m s as shown in fig 5d the distribution of fine and coarse particles is close to a vertical line this is because the turbulence intensity increases with the increased velocity the virtual mass force on the particle is increased and the particle size distribution is more uniform 5 3 velocity distribution figs 6 and 7 exhibit different trends of solid velocity distribution in the simulation results separately covering slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 the secondary phase velocity contours are plotted on the left and the curves for the three phases at their centerline are plotted on the right the contour plots are derived from the cross section 3 m to the inlet of the cfd model as shown in the figures the velocity distributions of the three phases are considerably similar fig 6 shows the simulation results of solid velocity distribution at a velocity of 2 m s with different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 the solid volume concentration distribution is shown in fig 4 as shown in the figure the point of maximum velocity is situated significantly above the pipe center at a low concentration and it will move down slowly with the increase in solid concentration fig 7 shows the simulation results of solid velocity distribution at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s with 30 concentration the solid volume concentration distribution is shown in fig 5 as shown the point of maximum velocity is situated significantly above the pipe center at a low velocity and it nears the center with the increase in solid concentration in fig 7d a constant velocity characteristic is clearly observed in the turbulent core and agrees excellently with the corresponding concentration distribution in fig 5d it expresses the property of homogeneity 5 4 granular pressure distribution figs 8 and 9 exhibit different trends of granular pressure distribution in the separate simulation results of slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 the contours of the granular pressure distribution of phase 2 are plotted on the left and those of phase 3 are plotted on the right these contour plots are derived from the cross section 3 m inlet of the cfd model fig 8 shows the simulation results of granular pressure distribution at 2 m s velocity with different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 its solid volume concentration and velocity distribution are shown in fig 4 and 6 respectively as shown in the figure for phase 2 the maximum granular pressure is near the pipe wall and close to the central symmetry however for phase 3 the maximum granular pressure is always situated at the bottom of the pipe this is because the coarser particles are mainly distributed in the bottom of the pipe where the intensity of collision is higher than that at the top of the pipe in addition the fine particle distribution is relatively uniform and the collisions at all directions are similar fig 8 also shows that with the increasing concentration the granular pressure in phase 3 increases particularly at the top of the pipe but that in phase 2 decreases this is because the increased concentration compressed the movement space and reduces the fluctuating velocity of the finer particles while simultaneously enhancing the collision of the coarse particles fig 9 shows the simulation results of the granular pressure distributions at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s with 30 concentration the corresponding solid volume concentrations and velocity distributions are shown in fig 5 and 7 as shown in fig 9 the granular pressures of two sizes of solids increased with the concentration because of the increasing turbulence and collision intensity due to the increase in slurry velocity in addition fig 9 shows that with the increase in velocity the granular pressure at the top of the pipe increases corresponding with the concentration distribution shown in fig 5 this is because the particles are closing toward homogeneity with increasing velocity thus enhancing the collision at the top of the pipe 5 5 wall shear stress distribution figs 10 and 11 exhibit different trends of solid wall shear stress distribution in the simulation results of the slurry velocity 2 5 m s and solid concentration 20 50 the contours of the solid wall shear stress of phases 2 and 3 are plotted on the left and right respectively the contour plots are 100 mm long from 3 to 3 1 m at the inlet of the cfd model fig 10 shows the simulation results of the solid wall shear stress distribution at 2 m s velocity with different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 its other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 4 6 and 8 as shown the solid wall shear stresses of both secondary phases increase with the solid concentration and the growth rate of phase 2 is larger than that of phase 3 this mirrors the fact that particles of phase 3 distribution become more uniform and the space of phase 2 is compressed intensively with increasing solid concentration fig 11 shows the simulation results of the solid wall shear stress distribution at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s with 30 concentration its other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 5 7 and 9 as shown the solid wall shear stresses of both secondary phases increase with the solid velocity additionally the solid wall shear stress of phase 3 mainly affects the bottom of pipe at low velocity while phase 2 affects the entire pipe periphery as the slurry velocity or solid concentration increases the solid wall shear stress distribution of phase 3 becomes more uniform 5 6 pressure drop fig 12 shows the simulation results of the pressure drop at a velocity of 2 m s for different concentrations 20 30 40 and 50 the other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 4 6 8 and 10 as shown in fig 12 the simulation results are larger than experimental values when c vf 40 this is because the resistance reduction effect of fine particles in multi sized slurry is neglected in the eulerian multiphase model fig 13 shows the simulation results of pressure drop at different velocities 2 3 4 and 5 m s for a concentration of 30 the other corresponding parameters are shown in figs 5 7 9 and 11 as shown in the figure the simulation results are larger than experimental values when v 5 m s 6 conclusion a steady 3d hydrodynamic model of multi sized slurry transport through a pipeline was developed with eulerian multiphase flow in fluent parameters such as the secondary phase solid volume concentration distribution velocity distribution granular pressure distribution and solid wall shear stress distribution were obtained from a wide range of particle volume concentrations and mixture velocities in addition the trend of these parameters was analyzed with varying concentration and velocity the mixture volume concentration distributions obtained through the simulation agree excellently with the experimental data published by kaushal et al 2005 the following conclusions have been drawn based on the present study 1 in multi sized slurry fine particles are typically in the regime of homogeneity or pseudo homogeneity when the flow rate is above the critical velocity moreover a reversal of solid concentration appears in the viscous sublayer at low concentration 2 in multi sized slurry coarse particles are in the regime of sliding from the bed at low concentration and low velocity and passing through heterogeneity and pseudo homogeneity with the increase in solid concentration or velocity additionally owing to the effect of the near wall lift force the maximum particle concentration point was situated above the bottom of the pipe at approximately 0 1d 3 all velocity distributions of each phase in the multi sized slurry are similar at the condition of low concentration and low velocity the point of maximum velocity is situated significantly above the pipe s center moves downward with increasing solid concentration and closes toward the center of the pipe with increase in the slurry velocity 4 with increasing concentration the granular pressure in phase 3 increases particularly at the top of the pipe however the granular pressure in phase 2 decreases in contrast the granular pressures in both secondary phases start increasing with the slurry velocity 5 the increase in the solid wall shear stress is sensitive to the slurry velocity compared with the solid concentration furthermore most of the boundary conditions of the model are default and do not considerably influence the input data this implies that the present model can be considered as a relatively common and useful model for simulating multi sized slurry transport through a pipeline acknowledgments this research work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779143 and
