9435,management strategies that lead to efficient fertigation are essential to minimize nitrate n leakage and environmental issues and to optimize crop yield a helpful way for agricultural water and nutrient management is studying the water and solute movement by models the objective of this study is to use the hydrus 2d model to evaluate different nitrate fertigation strategies for improving fertigation management efficiency the model was calibrated and validated for 2 years field unpublished data with iceberg lettuce lactuca sativa l for subsurface drip irrigation sdi system under wastewater strategies the validation of the water content model showed that the maximum and average of rmse are equal to 1 2 and 0 7 cm3 cm3 respectively also the hydrus model performance was acceptable to simulate soil water content the results of the soil nitrate movement model showed the average rmse is 2 77 mg l with r2 0 97 different scenarios in fertigation intervals fertigation time replacement of drip line nitrate concentration of wastewater different nitrate concentrations and times of fertigation through the growing season were defined the results of these scenarios analyze to find maximum water uptake and minimum deep percolation which help to achieve a drip irrigation design with minimal losses and the best efficiency scenario results showed that reducing fertigation time by 60 and halving the fertigation interval increase the uptake of water and nitrate by 3 89 and 11 55 while the rate of deep percolation decreased by 27 the results of dripline replacement scenarios showed that the depth of 12 cm without moving in the horizontal direction has created more favorable conditions the result of increasing nitrate concentration shows that up to 24 2 mg l nitrate concentration increment the plant nitrate uptake by 63 25 however increasing more than 36 6 mg l of nitrate concentration had no significant effect on plant nitrate uptake for finding the best time of fertigation through the growing season 42 scenarios were defined all applied nitrate injected into 1 2 3 4 6 and 11 irrigation events equally form 6 fertigation strategies of f b t q e and c respectively based on which irrigation number fertigation strategies start indices 1 11 are assigned to these 6 fertigation strategies based on the results the best fertigation strategies in this study were f5 b4 t3 and q3 which have minimum nitrate leaching losses of 17 79 19 9 20 8 and 20 0 respectively while had high root nitrate uptake equal to 25 1 26 3 26 6 and 26 6 respectively therefore fertigation of lettuce is most efficient at 22 30 days after planting equal to 30 38 days before harvesting for the silty clay loam lettuce farm under sdi at 12 cm depth conditions graphical

treated wastewater tww as a source of water and plant nutrients become widespread especially in areas with water crisis to overcome further increases in agricultural water demand chojnacka et al 2020 nitrates from agricultural sources by using tww create water pollution problems and are a restriction factor to consider tww for using in agriculture as a low cost water resource mojid et al 2010 jim√©nez et al 2009 qadir et al 2010 choosing the appropriate irrigation method to avoid contamination when using tww is important an sdi system applies water and nutrients below the soil surface via micro irrigation emitters with a discharge rate of less than 7 5 l h asae standard s526 2 2001 lamm and camp 2007 sdi moreover allows fertilizers release directly into the root zone and can be useful to decrease nitrate leaching jimenez bello et al 2011 bell et al 1998 worldwide studies indicate that fertilizer decrease 25 30 through drip fertigation kumar 2019 a sustainable system requires the accurate allocation and scheduling of irrigation and fertilizer hassan esfahani et al 2015 an intensive study about water and nitrate dynamics is required for the sdi system to offer efficient design operation and management of irrigation and fertigation the knowledge about water and nitrate distribution under sdi can be obtained through hydrus modelling by field data mailhol et al 2011 honari et al 2017 wang et al 2013 arbat et al 2020 provenzano 2007 due to emitter clogging and inspecting problems with detecting clogging position tripathi et al 2014 trooien et al 2000 capra and scicolone 2005 li chen and li 2009 limited efforts were made using sdi with tww several studies have suggested that sdi can be an alternative technique for safer irrigation with tww oron et al 1999 jnab et al 2001 urbano et al 2017 esteves 2020 and for reducing the direct exposure of tww to plants and farmers oron et al 1999 bell 1998 among the studies on crops irrigated with tww by sdi qiu et al 2017 used secondary sewage effluent as irrigation water for maize three lateral depths of 0 cm 15 cm and 30 cm and three irrigation levels of 70 100 and 130 of etc were selected an increasing lateral depth increased the seasonal nitrate leaching while irrigation level imposed an insignificant effect on cumulative nitrate leaching qiu et al 2017 concluded that a drip line depth of 15 cm with deficit irrigation can be conductive in reducing nitrate leaching as well as avoiding sewage effluent contact contamination whereas in the row eaten vegetables like lettuce the greatest health risks are biological contamination and heavy metals accumulation manas et al 2009 zavadil 2009 achakzai et al 2011 limited efforts were made to study nitrate management in lettuce growing under sdi with tww in the drip irrigation system several trials were carried out using tww to irrigate lettuce summerlin et al 2021 makkaew et al 2016 manasfi et al 2021 urbano et al 2017 urbano et al 2017 based on greenhouse drip irrigation of lettuce with tww indicated that the use of tww improved the soil nutrients and increased productivity without causing damage to soil structure and contamination by fecal coliforms they recommended that further research using the same conditions in the field condition is needed among the few nitrogen study of lettuce irrigated with tww by sdi in greenhouse conditions wen et al 2021 conducted a 2 season experiment to analyze the impacts of lateral depth and irrigation interval on inorganic nitrogen distribution in north china wen et al 2021 compared inorganic nitrogen distribution and yield of asparagus lettuce sdi with surface drip irrigation with 4 8 and 12 days irrigation intervals and 0 10 20 cm lateral depths the results indicated that tww increases the lettuce yield and no destructive effect of sewage irrigation on the quality of asparagus lettuce was found by tww numerical modelling for water and nitrate assessment was not used in this study a review of previous studies reveals that using sdi with tww for lettuce in a field condition and using hydrus modelling has not been reported the objective of this study is to simulate the soil water and nitrate distribution taking into account in situ etc under sdi by hydrus field data in this study was collected from a 2 season lettuce cultivation research farm irrigated by tww after well calibrated and well validated hydrus different fertigation scenarios including 1 fertigation intervals 2 time of fertigation 3 different drip line distances 4 different time and 5 amount of fertigation were defined in each scenario the model outputs were determined in fact this model becomes an efficient design tool in the sdi lettuce farm the other purposes of the study contain

the sdi laterals with safely inhibiting root intrusion toro dl2000 were installed at a depth of 15 cm on a polyethylene pipe with a 20 mm nominal diameter and had 1 9 l h discharge based on long time nitrogen and organic fertilizer content in tehranwwtp outlet no chemical fertilizer was used in 2 growing seasons based as assumed by manas et al 2009 achakzai et al 2011 and costa et al 2021 the

irrigation events was determined when the average of four 0 15 m depth tensiometers became 0 03 to 0 04 mpa most of the water uptake and root density in lettuce is in the depth of 0 0 15 m thompson and doerge 1995 sutton and merit 1993 majmudar and hudson 1957 found that in lettuce crops the smt should be maintained at field capacity 0 03 mpa for best yields as reported by thompson et al 1995 and urbano et al 2017 based on this smt limitation irrigation events occurred at 2 5 days intervals and based on the amount of irrigation water needed the irrigation varied between 1 and 5 h acar 2020 showed that lettuce irrigation time was highly dependent on lettuce varieties availability of soil moisture content in root systems and climatological factors 2 3 modelling in this study hydraulic and solute transfer parameters were determined independently in two different stages in the first step the water transport model was calibrated and validated and in the second step with the adjusted values of optimized parameters of the water transport model the solute transfer parameters were calibrated 2 3 1 model description the hydrus 2d model for the water movement is based on richard s

vertical coordinate respectively lt 1 galerkin finite element method was adopted to solve the eq 2 in this study hydrus 2d model first was used for calibration of the hydraulic parameters of van genuchten mualem s analytical model van genuchten 1980 after water transport validation the nitrate movement model was calibrated for dispersivity of nitrate hydrus 2d for solute transport uses the convection dispersion equation is described by eq 3 ≈°imunek et al 2012 3 Œ∏ c t x i Œ∏ d ij c x i q i c x i nu c r z t 4 nu c r z t c r wu r z t where c denotes the nitrate concentration in the soil solution ml 3 the water flux q is computed from eq 2 d ij is the dispersion coefficient l2t 1 and the nu term defines the local passive nitrate uptake by plant roots ml 3t 1 which is a function of time and the spatial coordinates the uptake of solutes including nitrate by plant roots depends on various plant factors salinity and soil moisture wu ebrahimian et al 2013 2002b homaee et al 2002c c r is solute concentration in the sink term taken up solute concentration by plant ml 3 azad et al 2019 solute uptake by roots is done by various mechanisms for medium and high solubility solutes such as nitrate the most important mechanism is mass flow so that soluble solutes are absorbed by the plant roots through water flow d ij in eq 3 in the 2 dimensional model separated to longitudinal dispersivity d l and transversal dispersivity d t according to a previously published study one tenth of the soil profile depth was assigned as the initial value for longitudinal dispersivity d l bristow et al 2001 ramos et al 2012 during simulation the molecular diffusion coefficient and adsorption isotherm were neglected it was assumed that the solutes were non reactive and that there was neither solubilization nor dissolution karandish and simunek 2017 in this study an inverse solution method was applied to estimate longitudinal dispersivity d l and transversal dispersivity d t 2 3 2 model geometry and boundary conditions based on soil experiments results shown in table 1 the properties of all three soil layers were similar and considered to be a homogeneous profile with a 45 cm depth a rectangular domain was selected with dimensions of 0 65 1 00 m fig 5 and assumed that the moisture distribution along drip lines is uniform the soil surface was atmospheric boundary conditions and the emitter was a variable boundary flux lateral water flow along the boundaries was zero flow no flow boundary condition free drainage was selected as the boundary condition below 0 45 m because the groundwater was below 5 m in the site jahani and reyhani 2007 and based on soil profile data there is no impermeable layer plant water uptake rate was determined using the feddes model feddes et al 1978 without consideration of solute stress initial boundary conditions were determined based on the field data before the beginning of simulation time and implemented into the model for the calibration stage field data including smt and tdr data were used and in the validation stage only smt data were used system geometry for the nitrate movement model was similar to the water movement model initial boundary conditions for the nitrate movement model were determined by measured soil gravimetric moisture and nitrate concentration before the simulation time for the solute domain the third type cauchy boundary condition was chosen at the soil surface and emitter place azad et al 2019 2 3 3 calibration and validation model calibration is the process of tuning a model for a

the statistical nature no single statistic is robust over another statistics can be selected to capture different aspects of the model and observation differences in this study six statistics were

line gradient and intercept be reported when r2 is used as a performance measure for a good agreement the intercept should be close to zero and the gradient should be close to one moriasi et al 2015 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation of soil water movement soil water movement model calibrated based on field observation data including gravimetric moisture data tdr data and smp data before and after 2 irrigation events in 172 74 h of growing season since 15 october 2013 calibration was conducted based on 4 data points 4 5 6 and 10 fig 5 hydrus predicted the soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten mualem model 1980 by inverse analysis table 3 parameter n in table 3 was determined based on pressure plate data equal to 1 196 saturated soil water content Œ∏s equal

criteria based on eq 5 to eq 11 are listed in table 3 for more details about model calibration and validation of soil water movement refer to nayebloie et al 2015a and nayebloie et al 2015b the validation of soil water movement model data set included points number 1 10 except point3 fig 5 in 965 h 40 days of growing season 2012 since 14th october was used the data set included 5 irrigation events and three precipitation events at the end of the growing season there is a data gap because of inclement weather and two heavy rain events spatial comparisons of simulated and observed soil water contents in the 9 positions relative to the emitter are shown in fig 6 the last irrigation event occurred on 9 november 2012 in time 505 h in fig 6 table 4 shows the evaluation criteria nrmse me rmse cd ef and crm for examination of the model performance temporal distribution of soil moisture at 1 1 5 3 5 8 24 and 48 h after 5 irrigation events are shown in fig 7 spatial distribution of soil

0 10 and 5 0 0 15 at the beginning of irrigation events showed significant differences between observed and predicted soil moisture it may be caused by the delayed response of tensiometers to instant soil water changes in a short time provenzano 2007 at the end of the simulation after the last irrigation event due to precipitation the model overestimates the soil moisture except at point 7 0 0 10 fig 6 illustrates how the model is capable to predict the soil water content however the position of points relative to the emitter affects the precision of prediction as shown in table 4 estimations of the soil moisture by the model were satisfactory with close to zero values of me and rmse indices varying between 0 010 and 0 04 and 0 002 0 012 cm cm 1 respectively close to one indices of r2 except point 8 varying between 0 67 and 0 97 and cd and ef values close to one indicated that the soil moisture simulation is satisfactory positive values of the crm index in all points except 1 5 8 and 9 indicate the underestimation of the model however the slight absolute value of crm indicates that under overestimation error is slight the minimum rmse occurred in points 1 2 and 4 which are at a distance of 35 cm and depths of 45 and 30 cm equal to 0 003 0 003 0 004 respectively me rmse rmse are maximum at the emitter place 0 043 0 012 0 04 respectively analyzing the spatial soil moisture distribution showed that minimum me rmse rmse and crm occurred in the farthest points from the emitter 1 0 35 0 30 and 2 0 35 0 15 and maximum indices occurred at the emitter place the model precision increased with the increasing distance from the emitter less precision in the emitter place may be caused by ponding the emitter zone and its effect on the emitter discharge ben gal et al 2004 low precision estimation in the emitter point followed by point 7 0 0 10 which is the nearest point to the soil surface at this point the model was underestimated slightly which is commonly related to evaporation influence hydrus accuracy can be affected by the soil variability the accuracy of the measurement techniques and some assumptions that the model uses to solve the two dimensional flow equation arbat et al 2020 furthermore g√§rden√§s et al 2005 reported that it may be caused by preferential flow channels in the soil which were not simulated by hydrus 2d g√§rden√§s et al 2005 subbaiah 2013 the values close to zero of the me rmse rmse and crm statistical indices presented in table 4 indicate a relatively good model simulation for the total data in 9 points and in all the simulation times r2 0 827 r2 0 8 illustrates good agreement for water flow modelling moriasi 2015 temporal distribution of soil water content the average value of statistics in all data points during 5 irrigations 1 1 5 3 5 8 24 and 48 h after irrigation events are shown in fig 7 fig 9 shows that rmse is a function of time provenzano 2007 as shown in fig 7 24 h after each irrigation event the model prediction error increased significantly after 8 h of irrigation the rmse value was 0 42 while after one hour the rmse value was 1 3 after 24 h from the beginning of irrigation events due to the process of redistribution of moisture and transfer of water through the soil profile the error rate has increased to 0 64 and after 48 h the distribution of moisture is over and the humidity has reached uniformity and therefore the error rate has been reduced to 0 41 redistribution occurs as the next stage of infiltration where the infiltrated water is redistributed within the soil profile after irrigation events subbaiah 2013 during the redistribution process the simulated soil moisture is generally upper than the measured faster than the actual measured probably due to the not precision of the model close to the saturation or to the hysteresis in the water retention curve not taken into account in the simulations provenzano 2007 3 2 the calibration and validation of the soil nitrate movement model for calibration of the nitrate transport model measured gravimetrical soil moisture and measured soil nitrate concentrations in 2 irrigation events through 72 18 h in growing season 2013 were used data sets for 3 positions relative to the emitter including points 10 6 and 5 were used results of the calibration for soil nitrate concentration at the 3 points are presented in figs 8 and 9 fig 9 was plotted using the output files obtained from the model and relevant measured soil nitrate concentrations after model calibration hydrus 2d was run for a 2 dataset of measured soil nitrate concentrations on 27 october 2012 and 19 november 2012 to validate the model initial boundary condition of soil nitrate concentration was considered based on soil nitrate and water contents based on measurements at all data points except points 3 and 7 on 15 oct 2012 results of the validation for soil nitrate concentration at the 8 points and at 2 data collection times 27 oct 2012 and 19 nov 2012 are presented in fig 10 fig 10 showed that soil nitrate concentration in the emitter point is the highest followed by points 5 and 9 at 15 cm below the emitter wen et al 2021 showed that soil inorganic n profile for 10 cm below the lateral depth was 39 higher than the value for surface drip irrigation after fertigation fig 11 was plotted using the output files obtained from the model and relevant measured soil nitrate concentrations table 5 shows statistics of model validation performance for predicted soil nitrate concentration on 27 october 2012 fertigation is the only nitrate input source therefore higher amounts of nitrate were observed in points 5 6 9 and 10 which are the nearest to the emitter nitrate concentration decreases with increasing depth below the emitter position as revealed by drip irrigation ajdary et al 2007 a higher amount of nitrate near to emitter could probably be attributed to the proper distribution of nitrate at the upper layers by sdi it would also mean adequate nitrate availability near the plant roots ajdary et al 2007 results indicated that higher deviations in nitrate were observed in the surface layers near the sdi emitter 0 30 cm soil depth where nitrate variations were higher caused by fertigation or nitrate uptake wen et al 2021 alva et al 2006 and bottoms et al 2012 observed higher variations in nitrate concentrations in the surface layers under drip irrigation maximum differences between observed and predicted soil nitrate accrued in points 4 and 8 which are the deeper points 45 cm it may be caused by complex nitrate processes that were not taken into account by hydrus phogat et al 2013 on 19 november 2012 due to previous rainfall events the more amounts of soil nitrate concentrations in deeper layers points 1 4 and 8 are significant qiu et al 2017 conclude that nitrate leaching was mostly driven by the intensive rainfall at the late growth stage of maize because of soil moisture uniformity caused by rainfall the deviation between observed and predicted soil nitrate in all points is informed and the rmse changes are slight deviations between observed and predicted soil nitrate may be caused by the fact that the model assumed a homogeneous soil environment while the field may be far more heterogeneous and anisotropic karandish and simunek 2017 the significant rmse differences in the calibration 0 954 mg l and validation 2 77 mg l stage were due to the precipitation events in the validation stage because the model in the calibration stage only gets fertigation data r2 coefficient value between simulated and observed nitrate concentrations was 0 975 hassan et al 2008 used hydrus 3d simulated on site smp and nitrate movement with r2 0 97 shekofteh et al 2013 showed that the r2 coefficient value between simulated and observed nitrate concentrations was 0 94 moreover other statistics criteria reported in the validation stage show that the model performs as well

evaporation and root water and solute uptake g√§rden√§s et al 2005 kandelous and ≈°im≈Ønek 2010a 2010b shekofteh et al 2013 in this study after well calibrated soil and nitrate movement of the hydrus model different scenarios in fertigation intervals fertigation time replacement of drip line nitrate concentration of tww and different nitrate concentration and times of fertigation through the growing season were defined in each scenario the model output deep percolation lettuce water nitrate uptake actual evaporation from soil water nitrate leaching was determined the results of these scenarios analyze to find maximum water uptake and minimum deep percolation which help to achieve a drip irrigation design with minimal losses and the best efficiency for conducting different scenarios growing season 2013 was selected as a base year base year similar to the real situation has 47 days 1128 h and soil texture of silty clay loam with a 15 cm depth sdi the emitter discharge was 1 9 l h with 11 irrigation events with equal nitrate concentration for simplification in fertigation analysis the changes in wastewater nitrate concentration were assumed to be equal scenario c in fig 14 and were considered based on the average tww nitrate concentration in growing season 2013 equal to 12 1 mg l table 2 irrigation intervals 3 days 0 15 days after transplanting and 5 days for 16 32 days after transplanting of lettuce some output runs of hydrus for the base year are shown in fig 12 analysis of the results of water and solute balance showed that only 21 of the total used water is uptaked by the plant so it is necessary to find better sdi water management to achieve more water use efficiency therefore the following water and nitrate management scenarios were defined to find the optimal conditions for sdi design and implementation although the hydrus model is not able to evaluate the effects of deficit fertigation on yield water use function scenarios with the total volume of water less than the base year were also evaluated increasing irrigation interval can be found for a given lateral depth leading to a decrease trend in yield wen et al 2021 the purpose of evaluating deficit fertigation scenarios e g decrease in fertigation time or increasing irrigation interval was to observe the trend of changes caused by different water and nitrate management scenarios for the first step the decrease in fertigation time t base scenarios in all the fertigation events through the growing season was evaluated decrease in fertigation time equal to 10 20 40 and 50 named 0 9 t base 0 8 t base 0 6 t base 0 5 t base respectively were evaluated in these scenarios actual evaporation from soil plant water uptake water leaching and nitrate uptake by lettuce were examined the results of decreaseing in irrigation times showed in table 6 in table 6 a positive sign indicates the increase of that parameter compared to the base year by percentage and a negative sign indicates the reduction of that parameter compared to the base year by percentage as expected although the decrease in fertigation times scenarios had positive effects on actual evaporation from soil and water leaching but had negative effects on plant water and nitrate uptake therefore in the next step decreasing in fertigation time and fertigation interval i base were examined simultaneously scenarios for reducing fertigation times by 10 20 50 60 and 70 halving the fertigation interval 0 5i base were applied table 6 as shown in table 6 reducing the fertigation time by 60 and halving the fertigation interval increased the uptake of water and nitrate by 3 89 and 11 55 while the rate of water leaching decreased by 27 also wen et al 2021 showed that irrigation frequency influenced inorganic n distribution as the higher water volume enhanced the leaching process when the irrigation interval was lower since 0 5 t base 0 5i base scenario which has no changes in total water use volume relative to the base year was selected for the next evaluations reduction of time of fertigation by 50 and halving of fertigation interval increased 8 5 and 27 59 of water and nitrate uptake by the plant while reducing the rate of deep percolation by 9 23 it can be concluded that the scenario of reducing fertigation time by 50 and halving the fertigation interval is relatively favorable next scenarios were performed by replacement of subsurface drip line relative to the current location in the base year the sdi drip line was in the 15 cm depth and the position of the drip line was shown in figs 4 and 5 four scenarios of 7 5 3 5 cm replacement of drip line in vertical direction and 2 replacement in horizontal direction 5 5 cm were examined results in table 7 showed that the 6 scenarios did not affect water leaching through the 45 cm depth since most of the water uptake and root density in lettuce is 0 0 15 m depth thompson and doerge 1995 sutton and merit 1993 more depths were not examined as shown in table 7 in addition to increasing the installation depth by 20 cm other installation depths have increased water and nitrate uptake and reduced deep percolation however evaporation losses have increased as well in the case of horizontal displacement it is also observed that water and nitrate uptake did not improve therefore it can be concluded that if there are no restrictions in terms of installation depth the installation depth of 12 cm without moving in the horizontal direction provides better conditions wen et al 2021 the yield of asparagus lettuce reached the highest when the lateral depth was 10 cm in sdi in the current study a depth of 12 cm without replacement in the horizontal direction reducing the irrigation time by 60 and halving the irrigation interval has created more favorable conditions qiu et al 2017 presented a drip line depth of 15 cm with deficit irrigation can be conducive to reducing nitrate leaching as well as avoiding sewage effluent contact contamination during the maize growing season further consideration about avoiding lettuce biological contamination is needed at depth of 12 cm based on the results the best scenarios in the current study with 0 5 t base and 0 5i base and 12 cm depth once more were implemented in hydrus the result showed that the best scenarios led to the uptake of water and nitrate by the plant increased by 4 67 and 14 7 respectively and the rate of leaching and evaporation decreased by 27 38 and 1 79 respectively further examination of the quality and quantity of lettuce for the best scenario is needed some researchers showed that decreasing irrigation interval and changing the lateral depth have positive effects on crop yield li wen and li 2014 showed the impact of the interval of irrigation and the depth of sdi on the yield and quality of tomatoes and found that shortening irrigation interval and increasing the lateral depth could increase tomato yield without adverse effect on quality wen et al 2021 revealed that the yield for lateral depth 10 cm and 20 cm treatment was 15 and 6 higher respectively than the surface drip irrigation treatments within the irrigation interval of 4 days other nitrate scenarios were defined for finding the best concentration and time of fertigation to reduce nitrate leaching in the soil profile and nitrate uptake by lettuce for the assay of concentration of nitrate some scenarios with a significant increase in nitrate concentration were examined in these scenarios the total amount of water is equal and only the nitrate concentration increased in the base year the tww was used as an irrigation water source scenario c in fig 14 the amount of nitrate in the effluent depends on many parameters such as the inlet quality of the effluent the duration of the treatment process and the efficiency of treatment systems to assay the trend of scenario impacts on nitrate uptake the assumption of no limitation in nitrate concentration was implemented scenarios by increasing 200 300 400 500 600 and 700 in tww concentration were examined to find out if any further nitrate concentration led to further nitrate uptake by the plant the results of each scenario s plant nitrate uptake showed in fig 14 as fig 14 shows up to 200 nitrate concentration 24 2 mg l the plant nitrate uptake was increased by 63 25 however increasing more than 300 of nitrate concentration 36 3 mg l has no significant effect on plant nitrate uptake it is due to the restriction factor of c r in eq 4 that limits the solute uptake by plants simunek et al 1999 if the concentration of solutes in the soil is equal to cr roots solute absorption can be at the maximum possible rate and more than cr has no effect on absorption of solute by the plant gardenas et al 2005 and azad et al 2019 concluded that the fertigation at the beginning of the irrigation events tends to increase seasonal nitrate leaching and wasted fertilizer in the next step scenarios are defined to find the best time of fertigation not through the irrigation events but through the growing season fertigation strategies were defined with no limitation in the time of the fertigation through the growing season however the total amount of water and nitrate is equal in all scenarios for this purpose some fertigation strategies were defined based on the number of irrigation events with nitrate injection schematic illustrations of these 6 fertigation strategies are shown in fig 14 strategy f b t q e and c applied total lettuce nitrate requirement injected into 1 2 3 4 6 11 irrigation events equally respectively in the field study the base year the total nitrate requirement was used in 11 irrigation events c strategy based on in which irrigation number fertigation strategies start indices 1 11 are assigned to these 6 fertigation strategies e g index 2 in strategy t indicates that fertigatin strategy t starts from the second irrigation event according to this assumption strategies f b t q e and c expand to 42 fertigatin scenarios additional scenarios q9 and q10 were defined to evaluate the impact of the distribution one fourth of total applied n in 2 stages at the beginning and end of the growing season strategy e was defined to evaluate the impact of distribution one fifth of all applied n in 2 stages at the beginning and end of the growing season all these 42 fertigation strategies simulated by hydrus and nitrate leaching and nitrate uptake by plant were calculated and reported as a fraction of the total applied nitrate the results of these 42 fertigation scenarios on nitrate leaching and nitrate uptake were showed in table 8 an optimal strategy aims to have a minimum nitrate leaching value and a maximum root nitrate uptake most of the applied nitrate in all fertigation strategies has been stored in the root zone the average of nitrate uptake in all 42 fertigation scenarios was 21 17 of total applied n and most of the applied nitrate 59 76 was stored in the root zone hassan et al 2008 concludes that plant nitrate uptake was 22 of the total applied n while approximately 48 of the applied nitrate was stored in the soil nitrate losses through nitrate leaching varied from 11 62 in the f11 fertigation scenario to 25 78 in the b1 fertigation scenario as expected nitrate leaching generally occurs in fertigation strategies with initial stage nitrate injection such as f b t and q the nitrate leaching values observed for these fertigation strategies are probably caused by the leaching of the entire applied nitrate in the subsequent irrigation events g√§rden√§s et al 2005 contrariwise the lowest nitrate leaching values occurred in the fertigation scenarios with final stage nitrate injection such as f11 b10 t9 and q8 the slightly smaller nitrate leaching values for these fertigation strategies are probably caused by the application of all nitrates in the last irrigation events which consequently allows no opportunity for leaching during the growing season although f11 has the smallest nitrate leaching however relevant root nitrate uptake 4 04 was unsatisfactory since the hydrus model is not able to estimate the yield based on the water and nitrate input the results of these scenarios are not recommendable and used only for observation trend of scenario impacts based on the results shown in table 8 the best fertigation strategies in our study are f5 b4 t3 and q3 which have minimum nitrate leaching losses 17 69 19 95 20 85 19 97 respectively and good root nitrate uptake 25 11 26 33 26 61 26 52 respectively to implement these scenarios the use of manure or chemical fertilizers may be necessary for the early stages of growth or in the land preparation strategy c which was used in real condition for the base year had satisfactory nitrate leaching of 19 21 and nitrate uptake of 22 68 as well based on the results fertigation of lettuce is most efficient at 22 30 days after planting equal to 30 38 days before harvesting table 8 this result is in agrees with thampson and doerge 1995 field research thampson and doerge 1995 found that lettuce accumulates more than 74 of its total nitrate uptake in the 38 days before harvest in two similar studies zink and yamaguchi 1962 and gardner and pew 1979 found that head lettuce attained 70 80 of nitrate accumulation in the 21 28 days before harvest it should be noted that in all 42 fertigation scenarios the amount of water soil type emitter discharge irrigation time and interval and the total applied nitrogen was constant it is clear that if one of these influential factors changed the results would potentially change accordingly 4 discussion in this study the hydrus 2d model was used to evaluate different nitrate fertigation strategies for improving fertigation management efficiency the model was calibrated and validated by lettuce field data in 2 growing seasons the validation of the water content model showed maximum rmse and average rmse of 1 2 and 0 7 cm3 cm3 respectively furthermore the hydrus model performance was acceptable to simulate soil water content temporal distribution of soil water content after 1 1 5 3 5 8 24 and 48 h after irrigation events were examined after one hour after irrigation events the rmse value was 1 3 however after 48 h and due to redistribution of soil moisture the rmse value reduced to 0 41 the results of the soil nitrate movement model showed an average rmse of 2 77 mg l and r2 0 97 the performance of the model indicates that hydrus 2d can simulate the nitrate distribution with good accuracy so the model was used to evaluate different fertigation scenarios different scenarios in fertigation intervals fertigation time replacement of drip line nitrate concentration of wastewater and different nitrate concentration and times of fertigation through the growing season were defined the results of these scenarios analyze to find maximum water uptake and minimum deep percolation which help to achieve a drip irrigation design with minimal losses and the best efficiency scenario results showed that reducing fertigation time by 50 and halving the fertigation interval increased the uptake of water and nitrate by 3 89 and 11 55 while the rate of deep percolation decreased by 27 the results of dripline replacement scenarios showed that the depth of 12 cm without moving in the horizontal direction has created more favorable conditions the result of increasing nitrate concentration shows that up to 200 nitrate concentration 24 2 mg l increment the plant nitrate uptake by 63 25 however increasing more than 300 times of nitrate concentration 36 3 mg l has no significant effect on plant nitrate uptake in the next step to find the best time of fertigation through the growing season 42 scenarios were defined all applied nitrate injected into 1 2 3 4 6 and 11 irrigation events equally create 6 fertigation strategies of f b t q e and c respectively based on in which irrigation number fertigation strategies start indices 1 11 are assigned to these 6 fertigation strategies based on the results the best fertigation strategies in this study are f5 b4 t3 and q3 which have minimum nitrate leaching losses 17 69 19 95 20 85 19 97 respectively and good root nitrate uptake 25 11 26 33 26 61 26 52 respectively we conclude that fertigation in the middle of the lettuce plant growing season strategy f4 or f5 b4 t3 and q3 generally reduces the potential of nitrate leaching therefore fertigation of lettuce is most efficient at 22 30 days after planting equal to 30 38 days before harvesting for the silty clay loam lettuce farm under sdi at 15 cm depth we recommend that farmers fertigate 30 38 days before the end of the growing season because the hydrus model is not capable to estimate yield to implement these scenarios the use of manure or chemical fertilizers may be necessary for the early stages of growth or in the land preparation the advantage of the proposed method is maybe using short data sets and adaption to other situations however some required input data especially in situ eto is not available in developing countries furthermore some sources of error occur in dataset and modelling and lead to uncertainties these errors originate from uncertainties in input datasets which include measurement and interpolation errors and in models that include conceptual logical mathematical and computational errors brownand heuvelink 2006 further studies suggested determining model uncertainties and evaluation of simulated scenarios compared to the field conditions also evaluate the effect of crop root architecture and its uptake pattern because the hydrus model is not capable to estimate yield further field studies are needed to develop a yield model with soil water weather plant input parameters joined to the hydrus model it is recommended that based on the mentioned systematic studies on

9435,management strategies that lead to efficient fertigation are essential to minimize nitrate n leakage and environmental issues and to optimize crop yield a helpful way for agricultural water and nutrient management is studying the water and solute movement by models the objective of this study is to use the hydrus 2d model to evaluate different nitrate fertigation strategies for improving fertigation management efficiency the model was calibrated and validated for 2 years field unpublished data with iceberg lettuce lactuca sativa l for subsurface drip irrigation sdi system under wastewater strategies the validation of the water content model showed that the maximum and average of rmse are equal to 1 2 and 0 7 cm3 cm3 respectively also the hydrus model performance was acceptable to simulate soil water content the results of the soil nitrate movement model showed the average rmse is 2 77 mg l with r2 0 97 different scenarios in fertigation intervals fertigation time replacement of drip line nitrate concentration of wastewater different nitrate concentrations and times of fertigation through the growing season were defined the results of these scenarios analyze to find maximum water uptake and minimum deep percolation which help to achieve a drip irrigation design with minimal losses and the best efficiency scenario results showed that reducing fertigation time by 60 and halving the fertigation interval increase the uptake of water and nitrate by 3 89 and 11 55 while the rate of deep percolation decreased by 27 the results of dripline replacement scenarios showed that the depth of 12 cm without moving in the horizontal direction has created more favorable conditions the result of increasing nitrate concentration shows that up to 24 2 mg l nitrate concentration increment the plant nitrate uptake by 63 25 however increasing more than 36 6 mg l of nitrate concentration had no significant effect on plant nitrate uptake for finding the best time of fertigation through the growing season 42 scenarios were defined all applied nitrate injected into 1 2 3 4 6 and 11 irrigation events equally form 6 fertigation strategies of f b t q e and c respectively based on which irrigation number fertigation strategies start indices 1 11 are assigned to these 6 fertigation strategies based on the results the best fertigation strategies in this study were f5 b4 t3 and q3 which have minimum nitrate leaching losses of 17 79 19 9 20 8 and 20 0 respectively while had high root nitrate uptake equal to 25 1 26 3 26 6 and 26 6 respectively therefore fertigation of lettuce is most efficient at 22 30 days after planting equal to 30 38 days before harvesting for the silty clay loam lettuce farm under sdi at 12 cm depth conditions graphical

2005 li chen and li 2009 limited efforts were made using sdi with tww several studies have suggested that sdi can be an alternative technique for safer irrigation with tww oron et al 1999 jnab et al 2001 urbano et al 2017 esteves 2020 and for reducing the direct exposure of tww to plants and farmers oron et al 1999 bell 1998 among the studies on crops irrigated with tww by sdi qiu et al 2017 used secondary sewage effluent as irrigation water for maize three lateral depths of 0 cm 15 cm and 30 cm and three irrigation levels of 70 100 and 130 of etc were selected an increasing lateral depth increased the seasonal nitrate leaching while irrigation level imposed an insignificant effect on cumulative nitrate leaching qiu et al 2017 concluded that a drip line depth of 15 cm with deficit irrigation can be conductive in reducing nitrate leaching as well as avoiding sewage effluent contact contamination whereas in the row eaten vegetables like lettuce the greatest health risks are biological contamination and heavy metals accumulation manas et al 2009 zavadil 2009 achakzai et al 2011 limited efforts were made to study nitrate management in lettuce growing under sdi with tww in the drip irrigation system several trials were carried out using tww to irrigate lettuce summerlin et al 2021 makkaew et al 2016 manasfi et al 2021 urbano et al 2017 urbano et al 2017 based on greenhouse drip irrigation of lettuce with tww indicated that the use of tww improved the soil nutrients and increased productivity without causing damage to soil structure and contamination by fecal coliforms they recommended that further research using the same conditions in the field condition is needed among the few nitrogen study of lettuce irrigated with tww by sdi in greenhouse conditions wen et al 2021 conducted a 2 season experiment to analyze the impacts of lateral depth and irrigation interval on inorganic nitrogen distribution in north china wen et al 2021 compared inorganic nitrogen distribution and yield of asparagus lettuce sdi with surface drip irrigation with 4 8 and 12 days irrigation intervals and 0 10 20 cm lateral depths the results indicated that tww increases the lettuce yield and no destructive effect of sewage irrigation on the quality of asparagus lettuce was found by tww numerical modelling for water and nitrate assessment was not used in this study a review of previous studies reveals that using sdi with tww for lettuce in a field condition and using hydrus modelling has not been reported the objective of this study is to simulate the soil water

calibrated and well validated hydrus different fertigation scenarios including 1 fertigation intervals 2 time of fertigation 3 different drip line distances 4 different time and 5 amount of

and doerge 1995 sutton and merit 1993 majmudar and hudson 1957 found that in lettuce crops the smt should be maintained at field capacity 0 03 mpa for best yields as reported by thompson et al 1995 and urbano et al 2017 based on this smt limitation irrigation events occurred at 2 5 days intervals and based on the amount of irrigation water needed the irrigation varied between 1 and 5 h acar 2020 showed that lettuce irrigation time was highly dependent on lettuce varieties availability of soil moisture content in root systems and climatological factors 2 3 modelling in this study hydraulic and solute transfer parameters were determined independently in two different stages in the first step the water transport model was calibrated and validated and in the second step with the adjusted values of optimized parameters of the water transport model the solute transfer parameters were calibrated 2 3 1 model description the hydrus 2d model for the water movement is based on richard s

neither solubilization nor dissolution karandish and simunek 2017 in this study an inverse solution method was applied to estimate longitudinal dispersivity d l and transversal dispersivity d t 2 3 2 model geometry and boundary conditions based on soil experiments results shown in table 1 the properties of all three soil layers were similar and considered to be a homogeneous profile with a 45 cm depth a rectangular domain was selected with dimensions of 0 65 1 00 m fig 5 and assumed that the moisture distribution along drip lines is uniform the soil surface was atmospheric boundary conditions and the emitter was a variable boundary flux lateral water flow along the boundaries was zero flow no flow boundary condition free drainage was selected as the boundary condition below 0 45 m because the groundwater was below 5 m in the site jahani and reyhani 2007 and based on soil profile data there is no impermeable layer plant water uptake rate was determined using the feddes model feddes et al 1978 without consideration of solute stress initial boundary conditions were determined based on the field data before the beginning of simulation time and implemented into the model for the calibration stage field data including smt and tdr data were used and in the validation stage only smt data were used system geometry for the nitrate movement model was similar to the water movement model initial boundary conditions for the nitrate movement model were determined by measured soil gravimetric moisture and nitrate concentration before the simulation time for the solute domain the third type cauchy boundary condition was chosen at the soil surface and emitter place azad et al 2019 2 3 3 calibration and validation model calibration is the process of tuning a model for a

validation of soil water movement model data set included points number 1 10 except point3 fig 5 in 965 h 40 days of growing season 2012 since 14th october was used the data set included 5 irrigation events and three precipitation events at the end of the growing season there is a data gap because of inclement weather and two heavy rain events spatial comparisons of simulated and observed soil

soil water changes in a short time provenzano 2007 at the end of the simulation after the last irrigation event due to precipitation the model overestimates the soil moisture except at point 7 0 0 10 fig 6 illustrates how the model is capable to predict the soil water content however the position of points relative to the emitter affects the precision of prediction as shown in table 4 estimations of the soil moisture by the model were satisfactory with close to zero values of me and rmse indices varying between 0 010 and 0 04 and 0 002 0 012 cm cm 1 respectively close to one indices of r2 except point 8 varying between 0 67 and 0 97 and cd and ef values close to one indicated that the soil moisture simulation is satisfactory positive values of the crm index in all points except 1 5 8 and 9 indicate the underestimation of the model however the slight absolute value of crm indicates that under overestimation error is slight the minimum rmse occurred in points 1 2 and 4 which are at

distribution showed that minimum me rmse rmse and crm occurred in the farthest points from the emitter 1 0 35 0 30 and 2 0 35 0 15 and maximum indices occurred at the emitter place the model precision increased with the increasing distance from the emitter less precision in the emitter place may be caused by ponding the emitter zone and its effect on the emitter discharge ben gal et al 2004 low precision estimation in the emitter point followed by point 7 0 0 10 which is the nearest point to the soil surface at this point the model was underestimated slightly which is commonly related to evaporation influence hydrus accuracy can be affected by the soil variability the accuracy of the measurement techniques and some assumptions that the model uses to solve the two dimensional flow equation arbat et al 2020 furthermore g√§rden√§s et al 2005 reported that it may be caused by preferential flow channels in the soil which were not simulated by hydrus 2d g√§rden√§s et al 2005 subbaiah 2013 the values close to zero of the me rmse rmse and crm statistical indices presented in table 4 indicate a relatively good model simulation for the total data in 9 points and in all the

5 irrigations 1 1 5 3 5 8 24 and 48 h after irrigation events are shown in fig 7 fig 9 shows that rmse is a function of time provenzano 2007 as shown in fig 7 24 h after each irrigation event the model prediction error increased significantly after 8 h of irrigation the rmse value was 0 42 while after one hour the rmse value was 1 3 after 24 h from the beginning of irrigation events due to the process of redistribution of moisture and transfer of water through the soil profile the error rate has increased to 0 64 and after 48 h the distribution of moisture is over and the humidity has reached uniformity and therefore the error rate has been reduced to 0 41 redistribution occurs as the next stage of infiltration where the infiltrated water is redistributed within the soil profile after irrigation events subbaiah 2013 during the redistribution process the simulated soil moisture is generally upper than the measured faster than the actual measured probably due to the not precision of the model close to the saturation or to the hysteresis in the water retention curve not taken into account in the simulations provenzano 2007 3 2 the calibration and validation of the soil nitrate movement model for calibration of the nitrate transport model measured gravimetrical soil moisture and measured soil nitrate concentrations in 2 irrigation events through 72 18 h in growing season 2013 were used data sets for 3 positions relative to the emitter including points 10 6 and 5 were used results of the calibration for soil nitrate concentration at the 3 points are presented in figs 8 and 9 fig 9 was plotted using the output files obtained from the model and relevant measured soil nitrate concentrations after model calibration hydrus 2d was run for a 2 dataset of measured soil nitrate concentrations on 27 october 2012 and 19 november 2012 to validate the model initial boundary condition of soil nitrate concentration was considered based on soil nitrate and water contents based on measurements at all data points except points 3 and 7 on 15 oct 2012 results of the validation for soil nitrate concentration at the 8 points and at 2 data collection times 27 oct 2012 and 19 nov 2012 are presented in fig 10 fig 10 showed that soil nitrate concentration in the emitter point is the highest followed by points 5 and 9 at 15 cm below the emitter wen et al 2021 showed that soil inorganic n profile for 10 cm below the lateral depth was 39 higher than the value for surface drip irrigation after fertigation fig 11 was plotted using the output files obtained from the model and relevant measured soil nitrate concentrations table 5 shows statistics of model validation performance for predicted soil nitrate concentration on 27 october 2012 fertigation is the only nitrate input source therefore higher amounts of nitrate were observed in points 5 6 9 and 10 which are the nearest to the emitter nitrate concentration decreases with increasing depth below the emitter position as revealed by drip irrigation ajdary et al 2007 a higher amount of nitrate near to emitter could probably be attributed to the proper distribution of nitrate at the upper layers by sdi it would also mean adequate nitrate availability near the plant roots ajdary et al 2007 results indicated that higher deviations in nitrate were observed in the surface layers near the sdi emitter 0 30 cm soil depth where nitrate variations were higher caused by fertigation or nitrate uptake wen et al 2021 alva et al 2006 and bottoms et al 2012 observed higher variations in nitrate concentrations in the surface layers under drip irrigation maximum differences between observed and predicted soil nitrate accrued in points 4 and 8 which are the deeper points 45 cm it may be caused by complex nitrate processes that were not taken into account by hydrus phogat et al 2013 on 19 november 2012 due to previous rainfall events the more amounts of soil nitrate concentrations in deeper layers points 1 4 and 8 are significant qiu et al 2017 conclude that nitrate leaching was mostly driven by the intensive rainfall at the late growth stage of maize because of soil moisture uniformity caused by rainfall the deviation between observed and predicted soil nitrate in all points is informed and the rmse changes are slight deviations between observed and predicted soil nitrate may be caused by the fact that the model assumed a homogeneous soil environment while the field may be far more heterogeneous and anisotropic karandish and simunek 2017 the significant rmse differences in the calibration 0 954 mg l and validation 2 77 mg l stage were due to the precipitation events in the validation stage because the model in the calibration stage only gets fertigation data r2 coefficient value between simulated and observed nitrate concentrations was 0 975 hassan et al 2008 used hydrus 3d simulated on site smp and nitrate movement with r2 0 97 shekofteh et al 2013 showed that the r2 coefficient value between simulated and observed nitrate concentrations was 0 94 moreover other statistics criteria reported in the validation stage show that the model performs as well rmse 2 770 cd 0 881 ef 0 966 3 3 fertigation management scenarios if the hydrud model is well calibrated with the field soil and water measured data it is capable of simulation of the actual evaporation and root water and solute uptake g√§rden√§s et al 2005 kandelous and ≈°im≈Ønek 2010a 2010b shekofteh et al 2013 in this study after well calibrated soil and nitrate movement of the hydrus model different scenarios in fertigation intervals fertigation time replacement of drip line nitrate concentration of tww and different nitrate concentration and times of fertigation through the growing season were defined in each scenario the model output deep percolation lettuce water nitrate uptake actual evaporation from soil water nitrate leaching was determined the results of these scenarios analyze to find maximum water uptake and minimum deep percolation which help to achieve a drip irrigation design with minimal losses and the best efficiency for conducting different scenarios growing season 2013 was selected as a base year base year similar to the real situation has 47 days 1128 h and soil texture of silty clay loam with a 15 cm depth sdi the emitter discharge was 1 9 l h with 11 irrigation events with equal nitrate concentration for simplification in fertigation analysis the changes in wastewater nitrate concentration were assumed to be equal scenario c in fig 14 and were considered based on the average tww nitrate concentration in growing season 2013 equal to 12 1 mg l table 2 irrigation intervals 3 days 0 15 days after transplanting and 5 days for 16 32 days after transplanting of lettuce some output runs of hydrus for the base year are shown in fig 12 analysis of the results of water and solute balance showed that only 21 of the total used water is uptaked by the plant so it is necessary to find better sdi water management to achieve more water use efficiency therefore the following water and nitrate management scenarios were defined to find the optimal conditions for sdi design and implementation although the hydrus model is not able to evaluate the effects of deficit fertigation on yield water use function scenarios with the total volume of water less than the base year were also evaluated increasing irrigation interval can be found for a given lateral depth leading to a decrease trend in yield wen et al 2021 the purpose of evaluating deficit fertigation scenarios e g decrease in fertigation time or increasing irrigation interval was to observe the trend of changes caused by different water and nitrate management scenarios for the first step the decrease in fertigation time t base scenarios in all the fertigation events through the growing season was evaluated decrease in fertigation time equal to 10 20 40 and 50 named 0 9 t base 0 8 t base 0 6 t base 0 5 t base respectively were evaluated in these scenarios actual evaporation from soil plant water uptake water leaching and nitrate uptake by lettuce were examined the results of decreaseing in irrigation times showed in table 6 in table 6 a positive sign indicates the increase of that parameter compared to the base year by percentage and a negative sign indicates the reduction of that parameter compared to the base year by percentage as expected although the decrease in fertigation times scenarios had positive effects on actual evaporation from soil and water leaching but had negative effects on plant water and nitrate uptake therefore in the next step decreasing in fertigation time and fertigation interval i base were examined simultaneously scenarios for reducing fertigation times by 10 20 50 60 and 70 halving the fertigation interval 0 5i base were applied table 6 as shown in table 6 reducing the fertigation time by 60 and halving the fertigation interval increased the uptake of water and nitrate by 3 89 and 11 55 while the rate of water leaching decreased by 27 also wen et al 2021 showed that irrigation frequency influenced inorganic n distribution as the higher water volume enhanced the leaching process when the irrigation interval was lower since 0 5 t base 0 5i base scenario which has no changes in total water use volume relative to the base year was selected for the next evaluations reduction of time of fertigation by 50 and halving of fertigation interval increased 8 5 and 27 59 of water and nitrate uptake by the plant while reducing the rate of deep percolation by 9 23 it can be concluded that the scenario of reducing fertigation time by 50 and halving the fertigation interval is relatively favorable next scenarios were performed by replacement of subsurface drip line relative to the current location in the base year the sdi drip line was in the 15 cm depth and the position of the drip line was shown in figs 4 and 5 four scenarios of 7 5 3 5 cm replacement of drip line in vertical direction and 2 replacement in horizontal direction 5 5 cm were examined results in table 7 showed that the 6 scenarios did not affect water leaching through the 45 cm depth since most of the water uptake and root density in lettuce is 0 0 15 m depth thompson and doerge 1995 sutton and merit 1993 more depths were not examined as shown in table 7 in addition to increasing the installation depth by 20 cm other installation depths have increased water and nitrate uptake and reduced deep percolation however evaporation losses have increased as well in the case of horizontal displacement it is also observed that water and nitrate uptake did not improve therefore it can be concluded that if there are no restrictions in terms of installation depth the installation depth of 12 cm without moving in the horizontal direction provides better conditions wen et al 2021 the yield of asparagus lettuce reached the highest when the lateral depth was 10 cm in sdi in the current study a depth of 12 cm without replacement in the horizontal direction reducing the irrigation time by 60 and halving the irrigation interval has created more favorable conditions qiu et al 2017 presented a drip line depth of 15 cm with deficit irrigation can be conducive to reducing nitrate leaching as well as avoiding sewage effluent contact contamination during the maize growing season further consideration about avoiding lettuce biological contamination is needed at depth of 12 cm based on the results the best scenarios in the current study with 0 5 t base and 0 5i base and 12 cm depth once more were implemented in hydrus the result showed that the best scenarios led to the uptake of water and nitrate by the plant increased by 4 67 and 14 7 respectively and the rate of leaching and evaporation decreased by 27 38 and 1 79 respectively further examination of the quality and quantity of lettuce for the best scenario is needed some researchers showed that decreasing irrigation interval and changing the lateral depth have positive effects on crop yield li wen and li 2014 showed the impact of the interval of irrigation and the depth of sdi on the yield and quality of tomatoes and found that shortening irrigation interval and increasing the lateral depth could increase tomato yield without adverse effect on quality wen et al 2021 revealed that the yield for lateral depth 10 cm and 20 cm treatment was 15 and 6 higher respectively than the surface drip irrigation treatments within the irrigation interval of 4 days other nitrate scenarios were defined for finding the best concentration and time of fertigation to reduce nitrate leaching in the soil profile and nitrate uptake by lettuce for the assay of concentration of nitrate some scenarios with a significant increase in nitrate concentration were examined in these scenarios the total amount of water is equal and only the nitrate concentration increased in the base year the tww was used as an irrigation water source scenario c in fig 14 the amount of nitrate in the effluent depends on many parameters such as the inlet quality of the effluent the duration of the treatment process and the efficiency of treatment systems to assay the trend of scenario impacts on nitrate uptake the assumption of no limitation in nitrate concentration was implemented scenarios by increasing 200 300 400 500 600 and 700 in tww concentration were examined to find out if any further nitrate concentration led to further nitrate uptake by the plant the results of each scenario s plant nitrate uptake showed in fig 14 as fig 14 shows up to 200 nitrate concentration 24 2 mg l the plant nitrate uptake was increased by 63 25 however increasing more than 300 of nitrate concentration 36 3 mg l has no significant effect on plant nitrate uptake it is due to the restriction factor of c r in eq 4 that limits the solute uptake by plants simunek et al 1999 if the concentration of solutes in the soil is equal to cr roots solute absorption can be at the maximum possible rate and more than cr has no effect on absorption of solute by the plant gardenas et al 2005 and azad et al 2019 concluded that the fertigation at the beginning of the irrigation events tends to increase seasonal nitrate leaching and wasted fertilizer in the next step scenarios are defined to find the best time of fertigation not through the irrigation events but through the growing season fertigation strategies were defined with no limitation in the time of the fertigation through the growing season however the total amount of water and nitrate is equal in all scenarios for this purpose some fertigation strategies were defined based on the number of irrigation events with nitrate injection schematic illustrations of these 6 fertigation strategies are shown in fig 14 strategy f b t q e and c applied total lettuce nitrate requirement injected into 1 2 3 4 6 11 irrigation events equally respectively in the field study the base year the total nitrate requirement was used in 11 irrigation events c strategy based on in which irrigation number fertigation strategies start indices 1 11 are assigned to these 6 fertigation strategies e g index 2 in strategy t indicates that fertigatin strategy t starts from the second irrigation event according to this assumption strategies f b t q e and c expand to 42 fertigatin scenarios additional scenarios q9 and q10 were defined to evaluate the impact of the distribution one fourth of total applied n in 2 stages at the beginning and end of the growing season strategy e was defined to evaluate the impact of distribution one fifth of all applied n in 2 stages at the beginning and end of the growing season all these 42 fertigation strategies simulated by hydrus and nitrate leaching and nitrate uptake by plant were calculated and reported as a fraction of the total applied nitrate the results of these 42 fertigation scenarios on nitrate leaching and nitrate uptake were showed in table 8 an optimal strategy aims to have a minimum nitrate leaching value and a maximum root nitrate uptake most of the applied nitrate in all fertigation strategies has been stored in the root zone the average of nitrate uptake in all 42 fertigation scenarios was 21 17 of total applied n and most of the applied nitrate 59 76 was stored in the root zone hassan et al 2008 concludes that plant nitrate uptake was 22 of the total applied n while approximately 48 of the applied nitrate was stored in the soil nitrate losses through nitrate leaching varied from 11 62 in the f11 fertigation scenario to 25 78 in the b1 fertigation scenario as expected nitrate leaching generally occurs in fertigation strategies with initial stage nitrate injection such as f b t and q the nitrate leaching values observed for these fertigation strategies are probably caused by the leaching of the entire applied nitrate in the subsequent irrigation events g√§rden√§s et al 2005 contrariwise the lowest nitrate leaching values occurred in the fertigation scenarios with final stage nitrate injection such as f11 b10 t9 and q8 the slightly smaller nitrate leaching values for these fertigation strategies are probably caused by the application of all nitrates in the last irrigation events which consequently allows no opportunity for leaching during the growing season although f11 has the smallest nitrate leaching however relevant root nitrate uptake 4 04 was unsatisfactory since the hydrus model is not able to estimate the yield based on the water and nitrate input the results of these scenarios are not recommendable and used only for observation trend of scenario impacts based on the results shown in table 8 the best fertigation strategies in our study are f5 b4 t3 and q3 which have minimum nitrate leaching losses 17 69 19 95 20 85 19 97 respectively and good root nitrate uptake 25 11 26 33 26 61 26 52 respectively to implement these scenarios the use of manure or chemical fertilizers may be necessary for the early stages of growth or in the land preparation strategy c which was used in real condition for the base year had satisfactory nitrate leaching of 19 21 and nitrate uptake of 22 68 as well based on the results fertigation of lettuce is most efficient at 22 30 days after planting equal to 30 38 days before harvesting table 8 this result is in agrees with thampson and doerge 1995 field research thampson and doerge 1995 found that lettuce accumulates more than 74 of its total nitrate uptake in the 38 days before harvest in two similar studies zink and yamaguchi 1962 and gardner and pew 1979 found that head lettuce attained 70 80 of nitrate accumulation in the 21 28 days before harvest it should be noted that in all 42 fertigation scenarios the amount of water soil type emitter discharge irrigation time and interval and the total applied nitrogen was constant it is clear that if one of these influential factors changed the results would potentially change accordingly 4 discussion in this study the hydrus 2d model was used to evaluate different nitrate fertigation strategies for improving fertigation management efficiency the model was calibrated and validated by lettuce field data in 2 growing seasons the validation of the water content model showed maximum rmse and average rmse of 1 2 and 0 7 cm3 cm3 respectively furthermore the hydrus model performance was acceptable to simulate soil water content temporal distribution of soil water content after 1 1 5 3 5 8 24 and 48 h after irrigation events were examined after one hour after irrigation events the rmse value was 1 3 however after 48 h and due to redistribution of soil moisture the rmse value reduced to 0 41 the results of the soil nitrate movement model showed an average rmse of 2 77 mg l and r2 0 97 the performance of the model indicates that hydrus 2d can simulate the nitrate distribution with good accuracy so the model was used to evaluate different fertigation scenarios different scenarios in fertigation intervals fertigation time replacement of drip line nitrate concentration of wastewater and different nitrate concentration and times of fertigation through the growing season were defined the results of these scenarios analyze to find maximum water uptake and minimum deep percolation which help to achieve a drip irrigation design with minimal losses and the best efficiency scenario results showed that reducing fertigation time by 50 and halving the fertigation interval increased the uptake of water and nitrate by 3 89 and 11 55 while the rate of deep percolation decreased by 27 the results of dripline replacement scenarios showed that the depth of 12 cm without moving in the horizontal direction has created more favorable conditions the result of increasing nitrate concentration shows that up to 200 nitrate concentration 24 2 mg l increment the plant nitrate uptake by 63 25 however increasing more than 300 times of nitrate concentration 36 3 mg l has no significant effect on plant nitrate uptake in the next step to find the best time of fertigation through the growing season 42 scenarios were defined all applied nitrate injected into 1 2 3 4 6 and 11 irrigation events equally create 6 fertigation strategies of f b t q e and c respectively based on in which irrigation number fertigation strategies start indices 1 11 are assigned to these 6 fertigation strategies based on the results the best fertigation strategies in this study are f5 b4 t3 and q3 which have minimum nitrate leaching losses 17 69 19 95 20 85 19 97 respectively and good root nitrate uptake 25 11 26 33 26 61 26 52 respectively we conclude that fertigation in the middle of the lettuce plant growing season strategy f4 or f5 b4 t3 and q3 generally reduces the potential of nitrate leaching therefore fertigation of lettuce is most efficient at 22 30 days after planting equal to 30 38 days before harvesting for the silty clay loam lettuce farm under sdi at 15 cm depth we recommend that farmers fertigate 30 38 days before the end of the growing season because the hydrus model is not capable to estimate yield to implement these scenarios the use of manure or chemical fertilizers may be necessary for the early stages of growth or in the land preparation the advantage of the proposed method is maybe using short data sets and adaption to other situations however some required input data especially in situ eto is not available in developing countries furthermore some sources of error occur in dataset and modelling and lead to uncertainties these errors originate from uncertainties in input datasets which include measurement and interpolation errors and in models that include conceptual logical mathematical and computational errors brownand heuvelink 2006 further studies suggested determining model uncertainties and evaluation of simulated scenarios compared to the field conditions also evaluate the effect of crop root architecture and its uptake pattern because the hydrus model is not capable to estimate yield

bastiaanssen 2004 molden et al 2003 however these techniques should generally consider not only the level of water stress on crop yield and wp but also crops sensitivity to water stress at different growth stages fereres and soriano 2007 deficit irrigation stress di stress is often applied considering the irrigation amount or the duration of the water stress during the crop growing cycle and long term di stress could lead to severe crop yield reduction compared to short term di stress pandey et al 2000a however there is still a lack of global synthetic information on how the amount based di stress and duration based di stress impact crop yield at different crop growth stages the effect of di stress on both crop yield and water productivity has gained much attention due to the significant contribution of water to agricultural production systems the impact of di stress on crop yield or wp depends also on several specific factors including crop type and variety adu et al 2018 moser et al 2006 water management practices pandey et al 2000a al ghobari and dewidar 2018 li et al 2007 yi et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 climate ma et al 2017 crop management practices ramlow et al 2019 rasool et al 2010 soil characteristics li et al 2019 mustafa et al 2017 and fertilizers management romero et al 2004 for instance based on a global meta analysis study both wheat yield and its wp increase in areas where total precipitation during the growing season is less than 200 mm and under loamy or sandy soils yu et al 2020a moreover different crop types can perform better under di stress on different soils and climates adu et al 2018 besides nitrogen supply can raise wheat yield wp and its biochemical parameters compared to unfertilized treatments agami et al 2018 however all these scenarios can be achieved with di stress either at a specific growth stage or throughout the season and it is still unclear whether they are valid for other cropping systems such as maize production systems research on di stress has mainly focused on crops such as tomatoes lu et al 2019 grapes apples pepper orange and potatoes maize sorghum bell et al 2018 wheat and rice adu et al 2018 bell et al 2018 carrijo et al 2017 comas et al 2019 daryanto et al 2016 mustafa et al 2017 yu et al 2020b among these crops maize crop has also attracted more attention due to its high use as the main cereal worldwide ranum et al 2014 sarwar 2013 however previous reviews unlike experimental studies on maize crop have only focused on the impact of di stress on yield daryanto et al 2016 with less attention on its evapotranspiration or its water productivity for instance daryanto et al 2016 compared the effect of drought on maize and wheat yield under different climates with no interest in water productivity even more recent meta analyses on maize water productivity did not cover the response of actual crop evapotranspiration to di stress cheng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 therefore we still have a gap in our knowledge concerning the global scale impact of di stress on maize yield actual evapotranspiration and water productivity at different crop growth stages this study aims to fill this gap and thus expand our knowledge using a meta analysis method the current study investigates the impact of di stress on maize yield actual evapotranspiration and water productivity at different crop growth stages and under various crop management practices on a global scale we assumed that the effect of di stress on maize yield varies among maize growth stages n p and k rates climates soil textures di stress application mode and growing cycle we considered three main research questions i does di stress differently affect maize crop among climates ii what are the effects of fertilizer soil texture and growing cycle on maize crop under di stress iii does maize growth stage affect its response to deficit irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 selection criteria and data collection the database of this meta analysis arose from peer reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2020 and referenced in scopus and web of sciences databases the key words of the search of articles were maize or corn or mays and yield or productivity and irrigation or water and stress or deficit or shortage or drought and stage or phase or step or level a total of 6220 articles were identified from the databases and 167 articles with 1192 data points were obtained after the screening of articles titles abstracts and full texts fig 1 in total we collected 1155 437 and 473 observations for grain yield etc act and wp respectively an article was selected when it meets the following selection criteria 1 the results are from experiments on maize crop 2 the article reports at least one of the three response variables grain yield actual crop evapotranspiration and crop water productivity 3 the article presents the standard deviations sd of the optimal irrigation no stress and di stress treatments or the level of significance of the results and the number of replicates articles that reported data from pot experiments were excluded from this review the response variables were extracted directly from tables or figures using web plot digitizer version 4 5 rohatgi 2020 data was also collected on the moderators susceptible to affect crop sensitivity to water stress di stress

di stress timing payero et al 2009 and length of maize crop cycle menkir et al 2009 holzk√§mper 2020 we considered three distinct treatments regarding the growth stages treatments with di stress applied only at the vegetative stage v only at the reproductive stage r and both at vegetative and reproductive stages or along the crop cycle v r these main growth stages and their substages are presented in the supplementary material sm 4 table sm 3 following the classification of doorenbos et al 1979 the n p and k rates and the effect sizes of all response variables were grouped into classes for each nutrient and each response variable was analyzed and compared among these classes at each growth stage fig 3 classes of nutrient rates were identified based on the trend of the cumulative frequency curve and defined as following 200 200 400 and 400 kg ha 1 for nitrogen rates 200 200 500 and 500 kg ha 1 for phosphorus rates 150 and 150 kg ha 1 for potassium the climate of a study area was either taken directly from the article or identified based on the aridity index ai of the united nations environmental programme unep climate classification system fig 2 the ai was computed from the collected annual rainfalls and the annual evapotranspiration when these latter were not found in a selected article they were estimated using the fao climwat 2 0 database smith 1993 the unep climate classification system includes the hyper arid arid semi arid dry sub humid and humid climates unep 1997 the spatial distribution of the selected studies based on these climates is presented in fig 2 and the studies are listed according to the climates and continents in supplementary material sm 3 table sm 2 the soil texture was collected either directly from the selected articles or identified using sand silt and clay contents each soil texture was then grouped into three classes based on the usda textural soil classification tonitto and rickler gilbert 2016 ou√©draogo et al 2020 light soil sandy sandy loam loamy sand sandy clay loam medium soil loamy silt loam sandy clay and heavy soil clay clay loam silt silt clay silt clay loam di stress timing included i application of di stress through a reduction in irrigation frequency alone ifr ii a reduction in irrigation amount iar and iii both reduction in irrigation amount and frequency ifar 2 2 statistical analysis 2 2 1 variables effect sizes and variances maize grain yield gy actual evapotranspiration etc act and water productivity wp were the response variables in this meta analysis the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act as described by allen et al 2000 and updated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b is the evapotranspiration from crop grown under management and environmental conditions that is the real amount of water used by the crop for its physiological processes during the growing season in the selected papers maize etc act was estimated using the soil water balance method or lysimeters in case of non availability of these methods the crop etc act of the control treatment was considered as the standard crop etc which is estimated from the single crop coefficient kc x eto where kc is the crop coefficient and eto is the reference evapotranspiration from the penman monteith equation the crop wp which represents the gy obtained per unit etc act expresses the crop yield per unit of crop etc act the effect sizes of maize gy etc act and wp were estimated as log response ratios rr eq 1 rr is the log ratio of a given response variable in experimental di stress treatments x t over the same response ratio in the control treatments x c 1 rr log x t x c where x t and x c are the means of a given response variable in di stress treatments and control or optimal treatments respectively the log response ratio has the advantage to measure variables that have a physical scale which is the case of maize yield expressed in mass borenstein et al 2009 the rr were reported as unitless with extreme limits between 1 and 1 thus a variable with a zero effect size rr 0 suggests the average response variable in di stress treatments is similar to that of its corresponding control treatments a negative effect size rr 0 indicates a decline or reduction of the response variable in di stress treatments as a result of di stress i e mean value is higher in control treatments than in di stress treatments and vice versa finally the sampling variances œÉ 2 rr were estimated using the following formula eq 2 as described in benitez lopez et al 2017 this statistical meta analysis was computed using the metafor package viechtbauer 2010 with r version 4 0 3 r core team 2021 2 œÉ 2 rr sd t 2 n t x t 2 sd c 2 n c x c 2 where sd t and sd c represent the standard deviations of x t and x c respectively and n t and n c are the sizes of experimental and control optimal treatment replicates respectively maize gy wp and etc act were predicted for the usda soil texture using an ordinary kriging interpolation technique in the spatial analyst tool arcgis version 10 5 0 6491 akhtar et al 2016 the soil textural triangle was first georeferenced then the axes sand silt and clay were transformed into a cartesian coordinate system the y axis value y and the x axis value x of the cartesian coordinate system were computed using eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 y y 2 y 2 2 0 5 4 x 100 x y tan 30 where x is the percentage of sand and y is the percentage of silt from the textural triangle 2 2 2 meta analysis this meta analysis used a random effect model to merge the studies effect sizes to compute the pooled effect sizes and to access the trend of yield wp and etc act under di stress across climates growth stages nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer rates soil textures and crop cycle the random effect model was used because the difference of variance between studies was statistically significant we quantified the heterogeneity of true effect sizes between studies using the p value associated with the heterogeneity test q and i 2 statistics a p value less than 0 05 indicates heterogeneous effect sizes among studies or groups of studies assuming all studies or groups of studies do not share a common effect size the i 2 value which represents the proportion of true variance was used to appreciate the homogeneity the effect sizes that depends neither on the number of studies nor on the scale of the effect size borenstein et al 2009 the proportion of true variance i 2 is given in eq 5 as follows 5 i 2 œÑ 2 œÑ 2 œÉ 2 where œÑ 2 is the variance of the true effect size and œÉ 2 the variance due to sampling error higgins and thompson 2002 i 2 values are between 0 and 100 and p values vary between 0 and 1 a value of i 2 superior to 50 indicates a presence of heterogeneity between effect sizes borenstein et al 2009 the present meta analysis used forest plots to synthesize the pooled studies outcomes borenstein et al 2009 forest plots sub meta analysis were processed across maize growth stages subgroups for other independent variables climates nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer rates soil texture deficit irrigation application modes and varieties maturing cycle per zakari et al 2021 we presented each factor level effect size with a diamond box with the width representing the confidence interval of the effect size in short the size of the box is proportional to the weight assigned to the corresponding factor level the vertical line at zero represents the line of no effect where the effect size under di stress equals that of the control or optimal irrigation a factor level effect size climates and nitrogen rates or the model summary effect size was significant when the width of the effect size points does not cross the vertical black continuous line at rr 0 figs 3 7 2 2 3 meta regression meta regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between response variable effect sizes and di stress at different maize growth stages it used a random effect model because of existing heterogeneity between studies effects size the significance of the regression model estimates was checked with the two tailed p value 0 05 of a z distribution 2 2 4 publication bias publication bias was evaluated using rosenthal s test benitez lopez et al 2017 pittelkow et al 2015 rosenthal s fail safe numbers nfs indicate the number of missing studies needed to nullify the summary effect size adu et al 2018 egger et al 1997 publication bias results were presented using funnel plots supplementary materials sm 1 these are two dimensional plots displaying sample size or variance or standard error on the y axis against study effect size on x axis the standard error which has an advantage of plotting studies with low precision i e with small sample size and low precision at the bottom half of the funnel plot was used as y axis here the values of standard error were reversed such that studies with low standard errors i e with high sample size and high precision are at the top of the funnel plot borenstein et al 2009 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium rates on maize gy etc act and wp the response ratios of gy etc act and wp ranged from 0 28 to 0 23 0 25 to 0 20 and 0 01 0 06 under nitrogen application respectively from 0 27 to 0 22 0 25 to 0 20 and 0 01 0 06 under phosphorus application and from 0 28 to 0 22 0 27 to 0 22 and 0 02 0 09 under potassium application the highest response ratios of gy and etc act occurred for the 400 kg n ha 1 class yield p 0 023 and etc act p 0 001 fig 3a b c moreover 23 higher di stress resulted in 1 6 and 2 1 fold lower gy and etc act in the 200 kg n ha 1 than the 400 kg n ha 1 class respectively indicating that higher di stress intensity associated with lower nitrogen rate may limit the reduction of maize gy or vice versa agami et al 2018 similarly found that wheat plants exposed to di stress and treated with nitrogen have higher growth and yield characteristics compared to the plants non treated with nitrogen the high crops growth under di stress can be related to the ease of nutrient uptake under nitrogen application eissa and roshdy 2019 eissa and negim 2019 which is caused by optimal roots development grevek et al 2012 di stress limits soil nitrogen leaching compared to optimal irrigation thereby making soil nitrogen more available to crops gheysari et al 2009 moreover the response ratios of gy were significantly different between potassium classes p 0 005 while those of etc act were significantly different only among phosphorus classes p 0 001 the highest response ratios of gy and etc act occurred for the 150 kg k ha 1 rr 0 22 and 200 500 kg p ha 1 rr 0 15 classes respectively fig 3b previous studies demonstrated that potassium fertilizers alleviate water stress induced damage on crops for instance bhattacharyya et al 2018 reported higher maize gy for 150 kg k ha 1 rates under 50 soil moisture stress because of the potential of potassium to improve nutrients uptake under optimal soil potassium conditions and even under di stress unfortunately our database did not have enough data on potassium uptake by maize crop to highlight its relationships with grain yield the di stress was 42 43 and 39 under nitrogen phosphorus and potassium applications respectively leading to 26 25 and 25 lower gy and 23 23 and 25 lower etc act in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments fig 3a b furthermore 22 17 and 37 di stress at vegetative reproductive and v r stages respectively resulted in 6 14 and 30 lower gy in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for the 400 kg n ha 1 class however the response ratio of gy was not significantly different between the di stress at the reproductive stage and at the v r stage for the 400 kg n ha 1 class p 0 06 although the di stress was lower at the reproductive stage than the v r stage p 0 001 these findings suggest that maize gy may not be reduced under di stress at both vegetative and reproductive stages compared to di stress at the reproductive stage for high nitrogen rates furthermore a positive correlation occurred between gy and wp for nitrogen 0 62 p 0 001 phosphorus 0 64 p 0 001 and potassium 0 63 p 0 001 the response ratio of wp was not significantly different among nitrogen phosphorus and potassium classes however wp increased by 3 4 and 6 under nitrogen phosphorus and potassium application respectively in fact maize wp was higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for the 200 kg n ha 1 rr 0 06 p 0 001 the 200 kg p ha 1 rr 0 06 p 0 001 and all potassium classes p 0 05 fig 3c yu et al 2018 highlighted a similar trend of wp for wheat crop under 200 kg n ha 1 class more nitrogen fertilizer under moderate applications simulates crop growth and improves wp through stomatal closure and water loss reduction liao et al 2022 igbadun et al 2008 mansouri far et al 2010 3 2 changes in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for different climates maize gy and etc act were significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments in all the climates p 0 001 fig 4a b while wp was significantly higher in the semi arid climate rr 0 06 p 0 001 and significantly lower in the hyper arid climate rr 0 27 p 0 0396 fig 4b overall the di stress followed the order hyper arid arid semi arid humid dry sub humid leading to response ratios of gy and etc act in the order semi arid humid dry sub humid arid hyper arid and hyper arid semi arid arid dry sub humid humid p 0 05 respectively the response ratio of gy was 64 higher in the semi arid climate compared to the humid climate despite the similar di stress in these two climates indicating a different effect of climates on maize crop yield under similar di stress daryanto et al 2016 oppositely reported no difference in maize gy between dryland and non dryland regions however most studies on the breeding of maize varieties for drought or water stress resilience have mainly been conducted in low water availability or arid and semi arid environments rather than humid climate areas prasanna et al 2021 santos et al 2021 resulting in increasing use of drought resistant maize varieties in arid or semi arid areas consequently there is an overall higher response ratio of maize gy under di stress in the arid and semi arid climates compared to the humid climate 3 3 change in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for various soil textures maize gy and etc act were significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for all soil textures p 0 001 figs 5a and 5b but the response ratio of gy was not significantly different among the soil textures generally the predicted response ratio of gy was higher for the heavy soils than the light soils figs 6b and 6c here 35 44 and 40 of di stress resulted in 23 23 and 29 lower gy under the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for light medium and heavy soils respectively fig 5a no significant difference in the response ratio of gy occurred between the light and medium soils although they experienced different di stress intensities however daryanto et al 2016 have reported similar grain yield among soil textures under the same di stress intensity di stress was applied mainly through irrigation amount reduction both on light and medium soils 74 and 61 of observations respectively but the di stress applied through frequency reduction on medium soil was 26 higher than that on light soils the frequent application of di stress on light soils low water retention capacity resulted in similar grain yield compared with the irregular and higher di stress on medium soils medium water retention capacity the response ratio of etc act point based effect size was 1 8 and 2 4 times lower for the heavy soils 0 33 compared to the light 0 18 p 0 001 and medium soils 0 14 p 0 001 respectively this lower response ratio of etc act can be due to the higher di stress intensities on heavy soils 42 than di stress on light soils 26 on the one hand and equal di stress intensities between heavy soils and medium soils 42 on the other hand fig 5b fig 6d the response ratio of etc act was predicted for the different soil textures using the kriging method fig 6 and the predicted effect size of etc act exhibited a similar trend with lower response ratios for the silty soils compared to the loamy and sandy clayey soils fig 6e in fact soil texture is strongly associated with soil water holding capacity and soil fertility particularly heavy soils have higher water content but higher soil matric potential than light and medium soils because of the dominance of fine particles jabro et al 2009 saxton et al 2006 thus water becomes less accessible to crops roots under high di stress on heavy soils leading to lower etc act in this soil compared to the light and medium soils maize wp was not significantly different between di stress treatments and optimal treatments for light and medium soils however both the point based and predicted response ratios of wp were significantly higher than zero for the heavy soils especially for the clayey and silty soils figs 5c 6 f and 6 g the increase in wp of maize crop under di stress on heavy soils confirms the results of cheng et al 2021 where the increase of crops maize wheat and cotton wp is higher for clay loam heavy soil here the response ratio of wp was 10 higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for heavy soils suggesting that heavy soils are more convenient to increase maize wp under di stress conditions the response ratio of maize gy was significantly lower at the v r stage lower rr 0 28 p 0 001 than the vegetative stage highest rr 0 16 p 0 001 for both the medium and heavy soils however no significant difference in the response ratios of etc act and wp occurred among growth stages for all the soil textures p 0 05 except for the heavy soils where the response ratio of etc act was higher at the vegetative stage rr 0 14 compared to the other stages p 0 001 the response ratio of wp was higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments only at the reproductive stage rr 0 12 p 0 062 and the v r stage rr 0 08 p 0 001 for heavy soils fig 5b finally the response ratio of gy was strongly and positively correlated with those of wp with correlation coefficients of 0 45 and 0 81 for medium and light soils respectively 3 4 change in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for di stress intensities and frequencies three types of di stress applications arose from the collected data i irrigation frequency reduction ifr which is the reduction of the number of irrigation events for a specific period ii irrigation amount reduction iar and iii both irrigation frequency and amount reductions ifar fig 7 overall the response ratio of gy followed the order iar ifar ifr for the ifr the response ratio of gy was significantly lower at v r stage compared to the vegetative stage and the reproductive stage while no significant difference occurred among the growth stages for iar and ifar fig 7a previous studies reported similar grain yield under ifr iar and ifar but only under the association of high and medium irrigation frequencies with low and medium irrigation intensities respectively or vice versa el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 these differences might have emerged from methodological differences for instance their primary data were based only on one experimental data whereas our data cover several experimental studies used in the present meta analysis moreover high ifr under optimal irrigation levels may lead to high water loss through drainage which amplifies the di stress level through longer irrigation intervals el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 as a result high ifr may lead to lower gy compared to iar and ifar regular application of low intensity of irrigation and or moderate irrigation intensities associated with medium irrigation frequency can be more effective to limit maize grain yield loss the etc act was significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments irrespective of the di stress application modes which showed no significant difference in the response ratio of etc act fig 7b the response ratio of etc act was higher at the vegetative stage compared to the v r stage for the ifr p 0 003 and at the reproductive stage compared to the v r stage for the iar p 0 001 the wp was significantly higher in the di stress treatments than the optimal treatments for the iar rr 0 04 p 0 001 whereas it was not different between the two treatments for ifr and ifar p 0 05 fig 7c the wp of iar was higher in the di stress treatments than the optimal treatments only at the v r stage rr 0 055 p 0 001 finally the response ratios of wp and maize gy were strongly and positively correlated for the ifr r 0 68 p 0 001 and the iar r 0 59 p 0 001 but not for the ifar r 0 70 p 0 08 3 5 change in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for different growing cycle maize gy and etc act were significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for all maize growing cycles p 0 001 while the wp was significantly higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for the short maize cycle 90 days compared to the two others rr 0 14 p 0 001 fig 8 the response ratio of gy was 1 8 and 2 3 fold higher p 0 001 for the short maize cycle than the medium 90 120 days and the long maize cycles 120 days respectively despite the higher di stress for the short cycle 0 32 than for the medium on and the long cycle a similar trend occurred for wp which response ratio was 14 and 3 7 fold p 0 001 significantly higher for the short cycle than the medium 90 120 days and the long maize cycle varieties 120 days but the response ratio of etc act exhibited an opposite trend for the medium maize cycle the response ratio of gy was significantly different among growth stages and followed the order v r stage 0 43 reproductive stage 0 25 vegetative stage 0 11 fig 8a previous studies highlighted that early maturing varieties are relevant in the context of water resources scarcity although late maturing varieties have higher grain yields than early maturing maize varieties menkir et al 2009 noviana et al 2021 nyirenda et al 2021 moreover the production of late maturing varieties requires more water than early maturing varieties asfaw et al 2019 holzk√§mper 2020 araya et al 2021 thus maize varieties with a short cycles early maturing are less susceptible to yield loss than those with longer cycles late maturing under di stress 3 6 regression between di stress and maize gy etc act and wp for different growth stages the response ratio of gy decreased with increasing di stress with regression slopes following the order vegetative 0 69 p 0 001 v r 0 37 p 0 001 reproductive 0 34 p 0 001 stages thus a unit increase of the response ratio of di stress resulted in 69 37 and 34 decrease of the response ratio of gy at vegetative v r and reproductive stage respectively fig 9a similarly the response ratio of wp decreased with raising di stress at both vegetative 0 16 p 0 022 and reproductive 0 26 p 0 002 stages but an opposite trend occurred at the v r stage 0 15 p 0 001 fig 9c however the response ratio of etc act significantly decreased with increasing di stress only at the vegetative 0 21 p 0 032 and the v r 0 26 p 0 001 stages fig 9b the response ratio of gy was not significantly different between the reproductive and the v r stages but was higher at the vegetative stage compared to the v r stages figs 5 and 8 these results suggest that the application of di stress at any stage before the reproductive stage can lead to a similar response with the application of di stress only at the reproductive stage as a result maize crop is expected to be more sensitive to di stress at v r stage because the di stress is applied at both vegetative and reproductive stages however the application of di stress only at the vegetative stage or at the vegetative stage prior to the reproductive stage limited the reduction of grain yield or maintained optimal grain yield compared to the application of di stress only at the reproductive stage previous studies similarly reported that low to moderate intensity of di stress at early vegetative growth stage maintains or even increases maize yield du et al 2015 while the application of di stress at stages following the vegetative stage reproductive or maturity reduces maize yield comas et al 2019 thus the application of di stress on maize crops only at the vegetative stage or at the vegetative stage prior to a stress at the reproductive stage may induce an adaptation strategy of maize plants to limit the reduction of grain yield kang et al 2000 with di stress under the vegetative stage maize plants use an adaptive strategy that involves the extension of root depth and the increase of water extraction from the deeper soil profile pandey et al 2000b 3 7 implications and future research needs maize production consumes 400 750 mm of water per growing period fao 1992 tan and zheng 2017 however severe shortage of water resources becomes a major problem leading to high crops yield loss to face this problem in different regions of the world di stress has been used during maize crops irrigation to optimize water use for better yields ali and talukder 2008 the optimization of crops production under water scarcity requires good water resources management however several other factors can affect crop yield and wp under di stress here we evaluated and synthesized the influence of di stress on maize gy etc act and wp at a global scale and considering factors such as growth stage nutrients rates climates soil textures irrigation timing and maize growing cycle the major trends include i the application of di on maize at an early stage minimum at the vegetative stage induce an adaptation strategy limiting yield loss ii a higher di stress intensity associated with lower nitrogen rates could limit yield loss or reciprocally iii maize crop is more sensitive to di stress in humid climate than semi arid climate iv heavy soils are more convenient to increase maize wp under id stress and v maize varieties with short cycles early maturing are less susceptible to yield loss than those with longer cycles late maturing under di stress the results from the investigated factors suggest that maize gy and etc act were lower in the di stress treatments than the optimal treatments while wp generally showed an opposite trend moreover the overall di stress level was 44 which significantly enhanced wp 3 but reduced gy 28 and etc act 22 previous studies reported that di stress potentially increases wp chai et al 2015 du et al 2010 kang et al 2000 gomaa et al 2021 but generally reduces crops growth and crop yield chai et al 2015 comas et al 2018 li et al 2018 wp increases under di stress because of two different relationships between irrigation water and crop yield during crop growth fereres and soriano 2007 in fact crop yield is linearly linked to irrigation water at the beginning of crop growth but the relationship becomes curvilinear later since only part of the applied water is used for crop evapotranspiration fereres and soriano 2007 chai et al 2015 therefore di stress is a strategy that helps to optimize wp and minimizes water losses our findings extend our knowledge on factors that can lower maize grain yield loss and or improve maize wp under di practice the choice of maize growth stage crop cycle and di stress intensity especially in humid climates is quite important thus short crop cycles should be more promoted in the context of water scarcity despite their recognized lower yield potential consequently we recommend that efforts towards the selection and breeding of early maturing varieties with higher yields may help to increase these varieties yield potential under di stress or water scarcity conditions several questions remained unaddressed despite the findings of this meta analysis current available studies on the factors affecting plants response to di stress are strongly oriented to crop yield and wp and rarely assess the crop response to nutrients n p and k uptake we hypothesized that nutrient uptake by crops under di might probably be influenced by the rates of fertilizers however it was not possible to determine how nutrient uptake is affected by fertilizer rates under di stress and the relationships between nutrient uptake and grain yield due to insufficient data on nutrient uptake thus further studies may consider nutrient uptake associated with di stress 4 conclusion overall maize crop was more sensitive to di stress in humid climates than in drier climates and lower nitrogen rates associated with a higher di stress intensity limited the yield loss or vice versa in addition di stress application only at the vegetative stage or at a stage prior to the reproductive stage limits maize yield loss di stress significantly reduces maize yield loss for short cycle varieties compared to medium and long cycle varieties future investigations should be geared towards improving the yield potential of early maturing maize varieties to reinforce their use under di stress hopefully when data become available subsequent reviews should focus on examining nutrients uptake under di stress this will further improve our understanding on the physiological behavior of maize

9436,deficit irrigation di has been implemented in arid regions to improve water productivity while maintaining or increasing crop yield in this study we carried out a global scale meta analysis to 1 quantify the response ratios of grain yield gy actual crop evapotranspiration etc act and water productivity wp under di stress then we 2 examined the effects of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizer rates climate soil texture di application mode and maize growing cycle on gy etc act and wp a total of 1192 observations retrieved from 167 studies were used to estimate the effect size and generate forest plots for each factor at three different growth stages the response ratio rr of maize gy was higher for short cycle varieties rr 0 14 in semi arid climates rr 0 25 and under irrigation amount reduction rr 0 21 maize etc act was higher for long and medium cycle varieties rr 0 22 for medium textured soils rr 0 14 and drier climates the wp improved by 9 on heavy soils compared to both light and medium soils indicating that heavy soils are more suitable for growing maize under di this study highlights that high di stress was often applied with low nitrogen rates to limit reciprocal effect on yield loss the application of di stress before the reproductive stage induced an adaptation strategy that limits maize yield loss and improves wp thus the application of di stress should start earlier at the vegetative stage to be more beneficial to maize furthermore di stress should target early maturing maize varieties to achieve higher crop wp the findings imply that di stress could be a promising strategy for water management in maize cropping systems while considering appropriate soil growing stages varieties and climate keywords corn grain yield response ratio water saving practice actual evapotranspiration water productivity 1 introduction the ultimate goal of crop production systems has always targeted optimal productivity to achieve a maximum crop yield output using optimal and low cost management systems inputs however not only water scarcity challenges the achievement of such goal in areas where crop water use has a high economic value exp√≥sito and berbel 2016 but also adverse impacts of climate change coupled with poor management of water resources amali et al 2016 cassardo and jones 2011 plessis 2017 in such an environment crop production with less water than optimal conditions without compromising crop yield may become an adequate adaptation option several irrigation techniques including regulated deficit irrigation hereafter deficit irrigation stress di stress partial root zone irrigation and subsurface irrigation have been substantially implemented to increase crops irrigation efficiency and water productivity zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 molden et al 2003 however these techniques should generally consider not only the level of water stress on crop yield and wp but also crops sensitivity to water stress at different growth stages fereres and soriano 2007 deficit irrigation stress di stress is often applied considering the irrigation amount or the duration of the water stress during the crop growing cycle and long term di stress could lead to severe crop yield reduction compared to short term di stress pandey et al 2000a however there is still a lack of global synthetic information on how the amount based di stress and duration based di stress impact crop yield at different crop growth stages the effect of di stress on both crop yield and water productivity has gained much attention due to the significant contribution of water to agricultural production systems the impact of di stress on crop yield or wp depends also on several specific factors including crop type and variety adu et al 2018 moser et al 2006 water management practices pandey et al 2000a al ghobari and dewidar 2018 li et al 2007 yi et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 climate ma et al 2017 crop management practices ramlow et al 2019 rasool et al 2010 soil characteristics li et al 2019 mustafa et al 2017 and fertilizers management romero et al 2004 for instance based on a global meta analysis study both wheat yield and its wp increase in areas where total precipitation during the growing season is less than 200 mm and under loamy or sandy soils yu et al 2020a moreover different crop types can perform better under di stress on different soils and climates adu et al 2018 besides nitrogen supply can raise wheat yield wp and its biochemical parameters compared to unfertilized treatments agami et al 2018 however all these scenarios can be achieved with di stress either at a specific growth stage or throughout the season and it is still unclear whether they are valid for other cropping systems such as maize production systems research on di stress has mainly focused on crops such as tomatoes lu et al 2019 grapes apples pepper orange and potatoes maize sorghum bell et al 2018 wheat and rice adu et al 2018 bell et al 2018 carrijo et al 2017 comas et al 2019 daryanto et al 2016 mustafa et al 2017 yu et al 2020b among these crops maize crop has also attracted more attention due to its high use as the main cereal worldwide ranum et al 2014 sarwar 2013 however previous reviews unlike experimental studies on maize crop have only focused on the impact of di stress on yield daryanto et al 2016 with less attention on its evapotranspiration or its water productivity for instance daryanto et al 2016 compared the effect of drought on maize and wheat yield under different climates with no interest in water productivity even more recent meta analyses on maize water productivity did not cover the response of actual crop evapotranspiration to di stress cheng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 therefore we still have a gap in our knowledge concerning the global scale impact of di stress on maize yield actual evapotranspiration and water productivity at different crop growth stages this study aims to fill this gap and thus expand our knowledge using a meta analysis method the current study investigates the impact of di stress on maize yield actual evapotranspiration and water productivity at different crop growth stages and under various crop management practices on a global scale we assumed that the effect of di stress on maize yield varies among maize growth stages n p and k rates climates soil textures di stress application mode and growing cycle we considered three main research questions i does di stress differently affect maize crop among climates ii what are the effects of fertilizer soil texture and growing cycle on maize crop under di stress iii does maize growth stage affect its response to deficit irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 selection criteria and data collection the database of this meta analysis arose from peer reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2020 and referenced in scopus and web of sciences databases the key words of the search of articles were maize or corn or mays and yield or productivity and irrigation or water and stress or deficit or shortage or drought and stage or phase or step or level a total of 6220 articles were identified from the databases and 167 articles with 1192 data points were obtained after the screening of articles titles abstracts and full texts fig 1 in total we collected 1155 437 and 473 observations for grain yield etc act and wp respectively an article was selected when it meets the following selection criteria 1 the results are from experiments on maize crop 2 the article reports at least one of the three response variables grain yield actual crop evapotranspiration and crop water productivity 3 the article presents the standard deviations sd of the optimal irrigation no stress and di stress treatments or the level of significance of the results and the number of replicates articles that reported data from pot experiments were excluded from this review the response variables were extracted directly from tables or figures using web plot digitizer version 4 5 rohatgi 2020 data was also collected on the moderators susceptible to affect crop sensitivity to water stress di stress

di stress timing payero et al 2009 and length of maize crop cycle menkir et al 2009 holzk√§mper 2020 we considered three distinct treatments regarding the growth stages treatments with di stress applied only at the vegetative stage v only at the reproductive stage r and both at vegetative and reproductive stages or along the crop cycle v r these main growth stages and their substages are presented in the supplementary material sm 4 table sm 3 following the classification of doorenbos et al 1979 the n p and k rates and the effect sizes of all response variables were grouped into classes for each nutrient and each response variable was analyzed and compared among these classes at each growth stage fig 3 classes of nutrient rates were identified based on the trend of the cumulative frequency curve and defined as following 200 200 400 and 400 kg ha 1 for nitrogen rates 200 200 500 and 500 kg ha 1 for phosphorus rates 150 and 150 kg ha 1 for potassium the climate of a study area was either taken directly from the article or identified based on the aridity index ai of the united nations environmental programme unep climate classification system fig 2 the ai was computed from the collected annual rainfalls and the annual evapotranspiration when these latter were not found in a selected article they were estimated using the fao climwat 2 0 database smith 1993 the unep climate classification system includes the hyper arid arid semi arid dry sub humid and humid climates unep 1997 the spatial distribution of the selected studies based on these climates is presented in fig 2 and the studies are listed according to the climates and continents in supplementary material sm 3 table sm 2 the soil texture was collected either directly from the selected articles or identified using sand silt and clay contents each soil texture was then grouped into three classes based on the usda textural soil classification tonitto and rickler gilbert 2016 ou√©draogo et al 2020 light soil sandy sandy loam loamy sand sandy clay loam medium soil loamy silt loam sandy clay and heavy soil clay clay loam silt silt clay silt clay loam di stress timing included i application of di stress through a reduction in irrigation frequency alone ifr ii a reduction in irrigation amount iar and iii both reduction in irrigation amount and frequency ifar 2 2 statistical analysis 2 2 1 variables effect sizes and variances maize grain yield gy actual evapotranspiration etc act and water productivity wp were the response variables in this meta analysis the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act as described by allen et al 2000 and updated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b is the evapotranspiration from crop grown under management and environmental conditions that is the real amount of water used by the crop for its physiological processes during the growing season in the selected papers maize etc act was estimated using the soil water balance method or lysimeters in case of non availability of these methods the crop etc act of the control treatment was considered as the standard crop etc which is estimated from the single crop coefficient kc x eto where kc is the crop coefficient and eto is the reference evapotranspiration from the penman monteith equation the crop wp which represents the gy obtained per unit etc act expresses the crop yield per unit of crop etc act the effect sizes of maize gy etc act and wp were estimated as log response ratios rr eq 1 rr is the log ratio of a given response variable in experimental di stress treatments x t over the same response ratio in the control treatments x c 1 rr log x t x c where x t and x c are the means of a given response variable in di stress treatments and control or optimal treatments respectively the log response ratio has the advantage to measure variables that have a physical scale which is the case of maize yield expressed in mass borenstein et al 2009 the rr were reported as unitless with extreme limits between 1 and 1 thus a variable with a zero effect size rr 0 suggests the average response variable in di stress treatments is similar to that of its corresponding control treatments a negative effect size rr 0 indicates a decline or reduction of the response variable in di stress treatments as a result of di stress i e mean value is higher in control treatments than in di stress treatments and vice versa finally the sampling variances œÉ 2 rr were estimated using the following formula eq 2 as described in benitez lopez et al 2017 this statistical meta analysis was computed using the metafor package viechtbauer 2010 with r version 4 0 3 r core team 2021 2 œÉ 2 rr sd t 2 n t x t 2 sd c 2 n c x c 2 where sd t and sd c represent the standard deviations of x t and x c respectively and n t and n c are the sizes of experimental and control optimal treatment replicates respectively maize gy wp and etc act were predicted for the usda soil texture using an ordinary kriging interpolation technique in the spatial analyst tool arcgis version 10 5 0 6491 akhtar et al 2016 the soil textural triangle was first georeferenced then the axes sand silt and clay were transformed into a cartesian coordinate system the y axis value y and the x axis value x of the cartesian coordinate system were computed using eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 y y 2 y 2 2 0 5 4 x 100 x y tan 30 where x is the percentage of sand and y is the percentage of silt from the textural triangle 2 2 2 meta analysis this meta analysis used a random effect model to merge the studies effect sizes to compute the pooled effect sizes and to access the trend of yield wp and etc act under di stress across climates growth stages nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer rates soil textures and crop cycle the random effect model was used because the difference of variance between studies was statistically significant we quantified the heterogeneity of true effect sizes between studies using the p value associated with the heterogeneity test q and i 2 statistics a p value less than 0 05 indicates heterogeneous effect sizes among studies or groups of studies assuming all studies or groups of studies do not share a common effect size the i 2 value which represents the proportion of true variance was used to appreciate the homogeneity the effect sizes that depends neither on the number of studies nor on the scale of the effect size borenstein et al 2009 the proportion of true variance i 2 is given in eq 5 as follows 5 i 2 œÑ 2 œÑ 2 œÉ 2 where œÑ 2 is the variance of the true effect size and œÉ 2 the variance due to sampling error higgins and thompson 2002 i 2 values are between 0 and 100 and p values vary between 0 and 1 a value of i 2 superior to 50 indicates a presence of heterogeneity between effect sizes borenstein et al 2009 the present meta analysis used forest plots to synthesize the pooled studies outcomes borenstein et al 2009 forest plots sub meta analysis were processed across maize growth stages subgroups for other independent variables climates nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizer rates soil texture deficit irrigation application modes and varieties maturing cycle per zakari et al 2021 we presented each factor level effect size with a diamond box with the width representing the confidence interval of the effect size in short the size of the box is proportional to the weight assigned to the corresponding factor level the vertical line at zero represents the line of no effect where the effect size under di stress equals that of the control or optimal irrigation a factor level effect size climates and nitrogen rates or the model summary effect size was significant when the width of the effect size points does not cross the vertical black continuous line at rr 0 figs 3 7 2 2 3 meta regression meta regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between response variable effect sizes and di stress at different maize growth stages it used a random effect model because of existing heterogeneity between studies effects size the significance of the regression model estimates was checked with the two tailed p value 0 05 of a z distribution 2 2 4 publication bias publication bias was evaluated using rosenthal s test benitez lopez et al 2017 pittelkow et al 2015 rosenthal s fail safe numbers nfs indicate the number of missing studies needed to nullify the summary effect size adu et al 2018 egger et al 1997 publication bias results were presented using funnel plots supplementary materials sm 1 these are two dimensional plots displaying sample size or variance or standard error on the y axis against study effect size on x axis the standard error which has an advantage of plotting studies with low precision i e with small sample size and low precision at the bottom half of the funnel plot was used as y axis here the values of standard error were reversed such that studies with low standard errors i e with high sample size and high precision are at the top of the funnel plot borenstein et al 2009 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium rates on maize gy etc act and wp the response ratios of gy etc act and wp ranged from 0 28 to 0 23 0 25 to 0 20 and 0 01 0 06 under nitrogen application respectively from 0 27 to 0 22 0 25 to 0 20 and 0 01 0 06 under phosphorus application and from 0 28 to 0 22 0 27 to 0 22 and 0 02 0 09 under potassium application the highest response ratios of gy and etc act occurred for the 400 kg n ha 1 class yield p 0 023 and etc act p 0 001 fig 3a b c moreover 23 higher di stress resulted in 1 6 and 2 1 fold lower gy and etc act in the 200 kg n ha 1 than the 400 kg n ha 1 class respectively indicating that higher di stress intensity associated with lower nitrogen rate may limit the reduction of maize gy or vice versa agami et al 2018 similarly found that wheat plants exposed to di stress and treated with nitrogen have higher growth and yield characteristics compared to the plants non treated with nitrogen the high crops growth under di stress can be related to the ease of nutrient uptake under nitrogen application eissa and roshdy 2019 eissa and negim 2019 which is caused by optimal roots development grevek et al 2012 di stress limits soil nitrogen leaching compared to optimal irrigation thereby making soil nitrogen more available to crops gheysari et al 2009 moreover the response ratios of gy were significantly different between potassium classes p 0 005 while those of etc act were significantly different only among phosphorus classes p 0 001 the highest response ratios of gy and etc act occurred for the 150 kg k ha 1 rr 0 22 and 200 500 kg p ha 1 rr 0 15 classes respectively fig 3b previous studies demonstrated that potassium fertilizers alleviate water stress induced damage on crops for instance bhattacharyya et al 2018 reported higher maize gy for 150 kg k ha 1 rates under 50 soil moisture stress because of the potential of potassium to improve nutrients uptake under optimal soil potassium conditions and even under di stress unfortunately our database did not have enough data on potassium uptake by maize crop to highlight its relationships with grain yield the di stress was 42 43 and 39 under nitrogen phosphorus and potassium applications respectively leading to 26 25 and 25 lower gy and 23 23 and 25 lower etc act in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments fig 3a b furthermore 22 17 and 37 di stress at vegetative reproductive and v r stages respectively resulted in 6 14 and 30 lower gy in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for the 400 kg n ha 1 class however the response ratio of gy was not significantly different between the di stress at the reproductive stage and at the v r stage for the 400 kg n ha 1 class p 0 06 although the di stress was lower at the reproductive stage than the v r stage p 0 001 these findings suggest that maize gy may not be reduced under di stress at both vegetative and reproductive stages compared to di stress at the reproductive stage for high nitrogen rates furthermore a positive correlation occurred between gy and wp for nitrogen 0 62 p 0 001 phosphorus 0 64 p 0 001 and potassium 0 63 p 0 001 the response ratio of wp was not significantly different among nitrogen phosphorus and potassium classes however wp increased by 3 4 and 6 under nitrogen phosphorus and potassium application respectively in fact maize wp was higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for the 200 kg n ha 1 rr 0 06 p 0 001 the 200 kg p ha 1 rr 0 06 p 0 001 and all potassium classes p 0 05 fig 3c yu et al 2018 highlighted a similar trend of wp for wheat crop under 200 kg n ha 1 class more nitrogen fertilizer under moderate applications simulates crop growth and improves wp through stomatal closure and water loss reduction liao et al 2022 igbadun et al 2008 mansouri far et al 2010 3 2 changes in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for different climates maize gy and etc act were significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments in all the climates p 0 001 fig 4a b while wp was significantly higher in the semi arid climate rr 0 06 p 0 001 and significantly lower in the hyper arid climate rr 0 27 p 0 0396 fig 4b overall the di stress followed the order hyper arid arid semi arid humid dry sub humid leading to response ratios of gy and etc act in the order semi arid humid dry sub humid arid hyper arid and hyper arid semi arid arid dry sub humid humid p 0 05 respectively the response ratio of gy was 64 higher in the semi arid climate compared to the humid climate despite the similar di stress in these two climates indicating a different effect of climates on maize crop yield under similar di stress daryanto et al 2016 oppositely reported no difference in maize gy between dryland and non dryland regions however most studies on the breeding of maize varieties for drought or water stress resilience have mainly been conducted in low water availability or arid and semi arid environments rather than humid climate areas prasanna et al 2021 santos et al 2021 resulting in increasing use of drought resistant maize varieties in arid or semi arid areas consequently there is an overall higher response ratio of maize gy under di stress in the arid and semi arid climates compared to the humid climate 3 3 change in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for various soil textures maize gy and etc act were significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for all soil textures p 0 001 figs 5a and 5b but the response ratio of gy was not significantly different among the soil textures generally the predicted response ratio of gy was higher for the heavy soils than the light soils figs 6b and 6c here 35 44 and 40 of di stress resulted in 23 23 and 29 lower gy under the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for light medium and heavy soils respectively fig 5a no significant difference in the response ratio of gy occurred between the light and medium soils although they experienced different di stress intensities however daryanto et al 2016 have reported similar grain yield among soil textures under the same di stress intensity di stress was applied mainly through irrigation amount reduction both on light and medium soils 74 and 61 of observations respectively but the di stress applied through frequency reduction on medium soil was 26 higher than that on light soils the frequent application of di stress on light soils low water retention capacity resulted in similar grain yield compared with the irregular and higher di stress on medium soils medium water retention capacity the response ratio of etc act point based effect size was 1 8 and 2 4 times lower for the heavy soils 0 33 compared to the light 0 18 p 0 001 and medium soils 0 14 p 0 001 respectively this lower response ratio of etc act can be due to the higher di stress intensities on heavy soils 42 than di stress on light soils 26 on the one hand and equal di stress intensities between heavy soils and medium soils 42 on the other hand fig 5b fig 6d the response ratio of etc act was predicted for the different soil textures using the kriging method fig 6 and the predicted effect size of etc act exhibited a similar trend with lower response ratios for the silty soils compared to the loamy and sandy clayey soils fig 6e in fact soil texture is strongly associated with soil water holding capacity and soil fertility particularly heavy soils have higher water content but higher soil matric potential than light and medium soils because of the dominance of fine particles jabro et al 2009 saxton et al 2006 thus water becomes less accessible to crops roots under high di stress on heavy soils leading to lower etc act in this soil compared to the light and medium soils maize wp was not significantly different between di stress treatments and optimal treatments for light and medium soils however both the point based and predicted response ratios of wp were significantly higher than zero for the heavy soils especially for the clayey and silty soils figs 5c 6 f and 6 g the increase in wp of maize crop under di stress on heavy soils confirms the results of cheng et al 2021 where the increase of crops maize wheat and cotton wp is higher for clay loam heavy soil here the response ratio of wp was 10 higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for heavy soils suggesting that heavy soils are more convenient to increase maize wp under di stress conditions the response ratio of maize gy was significantly lower at the v r stage lower rr 0 28 p 0 001 than the vegetative stage highest rr 0 16 p 0 001 for both the medium and heavy soils however no significant difference in the response ratios of etc act and wp occurred among growth stages for all the soil textures p 0 05 except for the heavy soils where the response ratio of etc act was higher at the vegetative stage rr 0 14 compared to the other stages p 0 001 the response ratio of wp was higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments only at the reproductive stage rr 0 12 p 0 062 and the v r stage rr 0 08 p 0 001 for heavy soils fig 5b finally the response ratio of gy was strongly and positively correlated with those of wp with correlation coefficients of 0 45 and 0 81 for medium and light soils respectively 3 4 change in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for di stress intensities and frequencies three types of di stress applications arose from the collected data i irrigation frequency reduction ifr which is the reduction of the number of irrigation events for a specific period ii irrigation amount reduction iar and iii both irrigation frequency and amount reductions ifar fig 7 overall the response ratio of gy followed the order iar ifar ifr for the ifr the response ratio of gy was significantly lower at v r stage compared to the vegetative stage and the reproductive stage while no significant difference occurred among the growth stages for iar and ifar fig 7a previous studies reported similar grain yield under ifr iar and ifar but only under the association of high and medium irrigation frequencies with low and medium irrigation intensities respectively or vice versa el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 these differences might have emerged from methodological differences for instance their primary data were based only on one experimental data whereas our data cover several experimental studies used in the present meta analysis moreover high ifr under optimal irrigation levels may lead to high water loss through drainage which amplifies the di stress level through longer irrigation intervals el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 as a result high ifr may lead to lower gy compared to iar and ifar regular application of low intensity of irrigation and or moderate irrigation intensities associated with medium irrigation frequency can be more effective to limit maize grain yield loss the etc act was significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments irrespective of the di stress application modes which showed no significant difference in the response ratio of etc act fig 7b the response ratio of etc act was higher at the vegetative stage compared to the v r stage for the ifr p 0 003 and at the reproductive stage compared to the v r stage for the iar p 0 001 the wp was significantly higher in the di stress treatments than the optimal treatments for the iar rr 0 04 p 0 001 whereas it was not different between the two treatments for ifr and ifar p 0 05 fig 7c the wp of iar was higher in the di stress treatments than the optimal treatments only at the v r stage rr 0 055 p 0 001 finally the response ratios of wp and maize gy were strongly and positively correlated for the ifr r 0 68 p 0 001 and the iar r 0 59 p 0 001 but not for the ifar r 0 70 p 0 08 3 5 change in maize gy etc act and wp among growth stages for different growing cycle maize gy and etc act were significantly lower in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for all maize growing cycles p 0 001 while the wp was significantly higher in the di stress treatments compared to the optimal treatments for the short maize cycle 90 days compared to the two others rr 0 14 p 0 001 fig 8 the response ratio of gy was 1 8 and 2 3 fold higher p 0 001 for the short maize cycle than the medium 90 120 days and the long maize cycles 120 days respectively despite the higher di stress for the short cycle 0 32 than for the medium on and the long cycle a similar trend occurred for wp which response ratio was 14 and 3 7 fold p 0 001 significantly higher for the short cycle than the medium 90 120 days and the long maize cycle varieties 120 days but the response ratio of etc act exhibited an opposite trend for the medium maize cycle the response ratio of gy was significantly different among growth stages and followed the order v r stage 0 43 reproductive stage 0 25 vegetative stage 0 11 fig 8a previous studies highlighted that early maturing varieties are relevant in the context of water resources scarcity although late maturing varieties have higher grain yields than early maturing maize varieties menkir et al 2009 noviana et al 2021 nyirenda et al 2021 moreover the production of late maturing varieties requires more water than early maturing varieties asfaw et al 2019 holzk√§mper 2020 araya et al 2021 thus maize varieties with a short cycles early maturing are less susceptible to yield loss than those with longer cycles late maturing under di stress 3 6 regression between di stress and maize gy etc act and wp for different growth stages the response ratio of gy decreased with increasing di stress with regression slopes following the order vegetative 0 69 p 0 001 v r 0 37 p 0 001 reproductive 0 34 p 0 001 stages thus a unit increase of the response ratio of di stress resulted in 69 37 and 34 decrease of the response ratio of gy at vegetative v r and reproductive stage respectively fig 9a similarly the response ratio of wp decreased with raising di stress at both vegetative 0 16 p 0 022 and reproductive 0 26 p 0 002 stages but an opposite trend occurred at the v r stage 0 15 p 0 001 fig 9c however the response ratio of etc act significantly decreased with increasing di stress only at the vegetative 0 21 p 0 032 and the v r 0 26 p 0 001 stages fig 9b the response ratio of gy was not significantly different between the reproductive and the v r stages but was higher at the vegetative stage compared to the v r stages figs 5 and 8 these results suggest that the application of di stress at any stage before the reproductive stage can lead to a similar response with the application of di stress only at the reproductive stage as a result maize crop is expected to be more sensitive to di stress at v r stage because the di stress is applied at both vegetative and reproductive stages however the application of di stress only at the vegetative stage or at the vegetative stage prior to the reproductive stage limited the reduction of grain yield or maintained optimal grain yield compared to the application of di stress only at the reproductive stage previous studies similarly reported that low to moderate intensity of di stress at early vegetative growth stage maintains or even increases maize yield du et al 2015 while the application of di stress at stages following the vegetative stage reproductive or maturity reduces maize yield comas et al 2019 thus the application of di stress on maize crops only at the vegetative stage or at the vegetative stage prior to a stress at the reproductive stage may induce an adaptation strategy of maize plants to limit the reduction of grain yield kang et al 2000 with di stress under the vegetative stage maize plants use an adaptive strategy that involves the extension of root depth and the increase of water extraction from the deeper soil profile pandey et al 2000b 3 7 implications and future research needs maize production consumes 400 750 mm of water per growing period fao 1992 tan and zheng 2017 however severe shortage of water resources becomes a major problem leading to high crops yield loss to face this problem in different regions of the world di stress has been used during maize crops irrigation to optimize water use for better yields ali and talukder 2008 the optimization of crops production under water scarcity requires good water resources management however several other factors can affect crop yield and wp under di stress here we evaluated and synthesized the influence of di stress on maize gy etc act and wp at a global scale and considering factors such as growth stage nutrients rates climates soil textures irrigation timing and maize growing cycle the major trends include i the application of di on maize at an early stage minimum at the vegetative stage induce an adaptation strategy limiting yield loss ii a higher di stress intensity associated with lower nitrogen rates could limit yield loss or reciprocally iii maize crop is more sensitive to di stress in humid climate than semi arid climate iv heavy soils are more convenient to increase maize wp under id stress and v maize varieties with short cycles early maturing are less susceptible to yield loss than those with longer cycles late maturing under di stress the results from the investigated factors suggest that maize gy and etc act were lower in the di stress treatments than the optimal treatments while wp generally showed an opposite trend moreover the overall di stress level was 44 which significantly enhanced wp 3 but reduced gy 28 and etc act 22 previous studies reported that di stress potentially increases wp chai et al 2015 du et al 2010 kang et al 2000 gomaa et al 2021 but generally reduces crops growth and crop yield chai et al 2015 comas et al 2018 li et al 2018 wp increases under di stress because of two different relationships between irrigation water and crop yield during crop growth fereres and soriano 2007 in fact crop yield is linearly linked to irrigation water at the beginning of crop growth but the relationship becomes curvilinear later since only part of the applied water is used for crop evapotranspiration fereres and soriano 2007 chai et al 2015 therefore di stress is a strategy that helps to optimize wp and minimizes water losses our findings extend our knowledge on factors that can lower maize grain yield loss and or improve maize wp under di practice the choice of maize growth stage crop cycle and di stress intensity especially in humid climates is quite important thus short crop cycles should be more promoted in the context of water scarcity despite their recognized lower yield potential consequently we recommend that efforts towards the selection and breeding of early maturing varieties with higher yields may help to increase these varieties yield potential under di stress or water scarcity conditions several questions remained unaddressed despite the findings of this meta analysis current available studies on the factors affecting plants response to di stress are strongly oriented to crop yield and wp and rarely assess the crop response to nutrients n p and k uptake we hypothesized that nutrient uptake by crops under di might probably be influenced by the rates of fertilizers however it was not possible to determine how nutrient uptake is affected by fertilizer rates under di stress and the relationships between nutrient uptake and grain yield due to insufficient data on nutrient uptake thus further studies may consider nutrient uptake associated with di stress 4 conclusion overall maize crop was more sensitive to di stress in humid climates than in drier climates and lower nitrogen rates associated with a higher di stress intensity limited the yield loss or vice versa in addition di stress application only at the vegetative stage or at a stage prior to the reproductive stage limits maize yield loss di stress significantly reduces maize yield loss for short cycle varieties compared to medium and long cycle varieties future investigations should be geared towards improving the yield potential of early maturing maize varieties to reinforce their use under di stress hopefully when data become available subsequent reviews should focus on examining nutrients uptake under di stress this will further improve our understanding on the physiological behavior of maize

9437,the floodplains play an important role in agricultural development and rural livelihoods in the vietnamese mekong delta as an intensive rice production area of vietnam the floodplain has experienced significant changes in water management regime during the recent decades depending on specific locations and irrigation infrastructure investments four main water management practices have been innovated particularly a planting season of two crops per year 2c1y three crops per year 3c1y three years eight crops 3y8c and two years five crops 2y5c the 4r framework reform result resilience and return was developed based on grounded theory approach for resilience assessment of various innovative water management practices in terms of resilience we found that each crop pattern involves pros and cons and the intensive crop practices are less resilient systems especially in social environmental and ecological aspects the findings provide good lessons learned not only for vietnam but also for the other rice producing deltas implementing ecosystem resilience to adapt to global challenges such as flood drought and salinity intrusion graphical abstract ga1 keywords floodplains grounded theory mekong delta livelihoods resilience rice cropping 1 introduction water is a limited resource and increasingly scarce in the context of climate change and population growth by 2050

aquifers unctad 2011 grafton 2019 irrigated agriculture is considered one of the success stories of the 20th century innovative water supply solutions have helped increase crop yields and enabled farmers to grow more crops per year which has enhanced food security but the expansion of irrigated areas have drastically decreased natural wetlands and as well the cropping intensities have resulted in water pollution and land degradation due to excessive chemical fertilizer and pesticide application which have chronically that damaged the ecological system and destroyed biodiversity cip upward

temperature rise may also consequence in hotter dry seasons and wetter rainy seasons in some areas greater uncertainty and increased risk of more extreme and frequent floods and droughts unctad 2011 cosgrove and loucks 2015 such changes will affect agricultural and ecosystems which in turn can adversely impact people s livelihoods particularly in the wetland and lower delta areas smajlg et al 2015 tanner et al 2015 the vietnamese mekong delta vmd is located downstream of the mekong river the twelfth longest river and the second richest river basin in terms of biodiversity in the world and its topography is characterized as fertile alluvial floodplains with a tropical monsoon climate xuan and matsui 1998 tuan et al 2007 naturally from july to december about 1 2 1 9 million ha 30 48 of the total vmd area in the upstream and middle areas is inundated due to the overflow from the mekong river and local rainfall whereas in the dry season extensive areas along the delta s coastlines experience salinity intrusion tuan et al 2007 binh 2015 this water regime allows farmers to cultivate only one rice crop per year as a result the growth of agriculture in the 1980s did not keep up with the population growth causing food shortages and extreme poverty binh et al 2021 to ensure national food security the vietnamese government invested in many large irrigation works for rice production thanks to irrigation development vietnam shifted from being a food importer in the 1980s to producing enough food for domestic consumption as well as becoming one of the world s leading rice exporters today ut and kajisa 2006 binh et al 2021 according to usda 2021 vietnam exported 6 2 million tons of rice in 2020 accounting for 14 of the total rice export volume in the world market ranking it as the second largest rice exporter globally after india up to 90 of vietnam s rice exports come from the vmd while this region accounts for only 12 of the country s area and 20 of the country s population gov 2017 gso 2020 the investment in irrigation works in the vmd floodplains enables farmers to increase the rice cultivation from 2 to 3 crops per year even in many areas up to 7 crops within 2 years this intensification increases rice production but creates huge environmental costs due to the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides chapman et al 2016 chapman and darby 2016 world bank 2017 minh et al 2020 besides the vmd is also predicted to be one of the most affected deltas by climate change globally ipcc 2007 imhen and undp 2015 in addition the construction of hydropower dams and irrigation infrastructures in the upper countries of the mekong river results in alterations of the natural river flows which decreases sediment supply from the river leading to an increased need for chemical fertilizer application as compensation to maintain soil fertility chapman et al 2016 chapman and darby 2016 all these factors affect the sustainable production and livelihood of local people to adapt to these new conditions it is necessary to have innovative water solutions to promote sustainable development recently local authorities have made changes in water management towards reducing the intensive levels i e shifting from 3 rice crops per year to 5 crops over 2 years in some floodplain areas of the vmd particularly in an giang province many scholars and international institutions recognized that innovative water management practices occurred in agriculture worldwide but assessment of such innovations is still a challenge unctad 2011 iica 2015 colosimo and kim 2016 iwmi 2019 cosgrove and loucks 2015 stressed that many innovations in sustainable water management involve high risk and may incur uncertain returns according to iwmi 2019 enhanced water resources management and more resilient water services are essential for adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change and for strengthening the resilience of communities ecosystems and economies in other words how can water management make agricultural development more resilient under high risk and uncertainty this paper aims to answer the above question by examining various innovative water management practices for rice production in the north vam nao nvn irrigation system which is situated in an giang floodplain province of the vmd lessons learned from this study can benefit other rice producing deltas globally in informing long term adaptation strategies 2 methodology 2 1 application of grounded theory the grounded theory is defined as a qualitative method used to build a theory or an analytical framework for further research the result was achieved through a process of working and interacting continuously with many people to understand the study phenomenon bitsch and creswell 2005 2013 therefore the theory or framework is derived during the process of implementation and further developed based on actual data and information from the ground the grounded theory research process consists of several steps as depicted in fig 1 the process begins with the problem identification and research question formulation the next step is sample selection and data collection sample selection in the grounded theory is theoretical sampling or non probability sampling that is the selection of the observation sample or the interviewee cannot be determined in advance in a statistical way but is very flexible based on the actual situation and the researcher s judgment so that the collected data will reflect the actual nature of the research phenomenon corbin and strauss 1990 charmaz 2006 after data collection the data undergoes coding and analysis according to bitsch 2005 the coding and analysis of field data applies the method of constant comparison that is after each interview or observation the data must be coded and compared in order to recognize the commonalities and differences by this method the data will be classified and sorted into categories and sub categories to see the correlation between them in order to explain the phenomenon being studied in the most appropriate way leedy and ormrod 2015 concepts are then recognized and theory or framework will thus be formed this process ends only when data and information are saturated meaning that further data collection and analysis will not generate new ideas corbin and strauss 1990 if the information is not saturated researchers will revert back to the data collection and analysis step and adjust the research question to suit the actual context as necessary as described by creswell 2013 the grounded theory research is an iterative and adaptive process collect data at the field return to the office for analysis then go back to the field for further data collection return to the office for the second analysis and so forth the process will be continued until there is sufficient data and information to build a theory application of this approach we conducted 4 fieldtrips during november 2019 and april 2021 in an giang province for data collection by using some participatory tools i e historical analysis seasonal calendar in depth interviews and focus group discussion to discuss with various peoples at different levels about livelihood and ecosystem resilience of rice production in different models of water management thanks to the advantages of grounded theory approach a novel framework was developed demonstrating how the relationship between water reform policies or practices with its result resilience and return the so called 4r framework can be used for assessing various water management regimes within other contexts additionally we also interviewed researchers and scientists in the vmd and ho chi minh city who have good knowledge and experiences in the region to assess the resilience by different water management practices details of the process are described in the next sections 2 2 site selection and description an giang province was selected for this study because being situated within the vmd floodplains fig a 1 it has a diverse practice of various water management regimes including innovative water management that can be used as case studies for comparison according to gso 2020 an giang rice production in 2019 reached 3 9 million tons ranking at the second position among 63 provinces in vietnam placing it as one of the major food producers in the country data show that the planted rice areas in an giang continuously increased from 453 2 thousand ha in 000t581 2 thousand ha in 2010 and 632 4 thousand ha in 2020 table a 1 this result was achieved through investment in irrigation infrastructure to prevent floods which facilitated crop extensification and intensification however such investments occurred unevenly amongst districts in the province depending on the level of investment and water management regime two main dike systems exist in an giang the high dike or full dike system can prevent both early and late floods with higher water levels and is suitable for 3 rice crops per year referred to as winter spring ws summer autumn sa and autumn winter aw respectively the low dike or semi dike system could only protect more interior areas from the early floods and allow water to enter the fields during the late floods and therefore 2 rice crops per year ws and sa are dedicated these areas for this study we selected two districts an phu and phu tan each with different water management regimes and cropping patterns and explored how different innovative water management practices influenced the livelihood resilience of local residents an phu district has a total area of 226 km2 and a population of 148 5 thousand inhabitants which is equal to a population density of 656 people per km2 an phu represents low dike areas that are dominating by the two rice crops per year table a 1 shows that the third rice crop aw area in 2010 was only 0 9 thousand ha accounting for 3 of the total cultivated area by 2020 the aw area grew up to 5 5 thousand ha but it still accounted for a relatively low 16 of the total cultivated area in the district phu tan district covers an area of 313 km2 with 188 8 thousand inhabitants which is equal to a population density of 604 people per km2 phu tan represents the high dike areas where a system of dikes has been constructed since 2002 thanks to the joint australian and vietnamese government nvn water control project as a result total rice planted area in phu tan increased remarkably from 49 7 to 66 9 thousand ha between 2000 and 2010 before declining to 60 2 thousand ha in 2020 table a 1 the variation of total planted rice area was caused mainly by the change in aw crop due to recent changes in water management practice in short the two districts had more or less the same condition before 2000 since then phu tan was benefited from the nvn project which allows farmers to grow more crops due to an increased area of aw crop recently the aw crop in phu tan has decreased whereas the aw crop in an phu steadily increased these trends provide a good case study for comparison of different innovative water solutions for agricultural development and livelihood resilience 2 3 data collection both secondary and primary data were collected in an giang province between november 2019 and april 2021 the secondary data were gathered from various sources particularly from the department of natural resources and environment donre the department of agriculture and rural development dard the department of labors invalids and social affair dolisa the statistical office at provincial and district level and annual socio economic reports at communes such secondary data provide a general overview on socio economic and environmental situation including hydrology weather land use water management irrigation infrastructure agriculture aquaculture poverty population and pollution the primary data were collected through four fieldtrips by using some participatory rural appraisal pra tools such as timeline analysis seasonal calendar focus group discussion key informant interview in depth interview and observation at the sites fao 2011 a total of 88 participants were involved in the survey of which 73 persons were residents of an giang province and 15 persons were scientists from can tho and ho chi minh cities table a 2 2 4 data analysis collected information and data were analyzed using the grounded theory approach bitsch 2005 creswell 2013 leedy and ormrod 2015 according to leedy and ormrod 2015 there are three main steps in data analysis applied grounded theory which are summarized below open coding the data are divided into segments and then scrutinized for commonalities that reflect general categories in fact raw data in the form of field notes gathered from the survey were documented in ms word and broken into single word or phrases in vietnamese these pieces of information were used for coding based on the codes they are grouped into four categories namely reform result resilience and return after meaningful categories are identified the data are further examined for properties or sub categories that characterize each category for example the reform category consists of various information such as cropping pattern shift crop yield fluctuation flood regime change irrigation development dike investment sediment reduction etc those were organized into reform context reform process and reform content sub categories this process was done manually on ms excel sheet axial coding during the process of open coding one or few categories might emerge as being central to the investigated phenomenon in axial coding one of these categories is selected as a core category this core category serves as an axis around which certain other categories appear to revolve in some way in this study we did not use multivariate analysis to outline core categories instead the four identified categories were organized in cause effect relation making connections between categories to discover regularities variations and singularities in the data selected coding and theory development a single category is selected as the core concept in the phenomenon and a theory or new framework is developed based on this concept and its interrelationships with other categories in this case reform of water for rice development is selected as the starting point to assess resilience among different innovative water management practices the reform created different results that may have resulted in numerous resilience outcomes such outcomes provided copious lessons learned and policy implications that were identified as discussion themes for the next round therefore the analytical framework is structured logically from reform to result resilience and return categories quantitative data collected during the survey from local statistic offices and related departments are also employed to supplement and confirm the qualitative approach in addition through the grounded theory approach it was necessary to distinguish resilience by different levels because water reform in the research sites may bring positive outcomes for local communities but affect others at a larger scale in this study we consider the cross scale interaction of the complex delta system by assessing livelihood and ecosystem levels of resilience the assessment of ecosystem resilience allows a better understanding of the long term effects of innovative water management but it may be difficult to observe resilience at the household level therefore within this context livelihood resilience has been assessed through five livelihood capitals such as human natural physical financial and social according to the sustainable livelihood approach dfid 1999 uy et al 2011 ecosystem resilience is characterized by four dimensions of sustainable development namely social economic environmental and institutional wass et al 2011 tanner et al 2015 to get more scientific figures the livelihood resilience and ecosystem resilience for each water management scheme were assessed by expert s opinions fifteen scientists from local research institutes and universities who are experts on the field of rice production and irrigation development in the mekong delta were asked to quantify both resilience levels for example to assess livelihood resilience the research team went to meet respondents separately and asked them to score each livelihood capital for a particular water management practice from low 1 point to medium 2 points and high 3 points based on their expertise they were also asked the reason for scoring total scores of livelihood resilience are calculated as an average of all resilience dimensions according to the experts opinions the ecosystem resilience was also evaluated using the same approach application of such above steps the assessment of innovative water management framework is created as fig 2 the information and data are classified into four categories consisting of reform result resilience and return so called 4r framework each category contains sub categories to characterize the category s meanings for example the reform category has three sub categories as context process and content of water reform in the study site in this 4r framework water reform is a core concept but related to result resilience and return that will be presented and discussed in the next sections 3 results and discussions 3 1 reform as an innovative water management practice generally reform means to change something in a positive direction typically a social political economic or institutional practice reform in water sector is defined as an ongoing process in response to crises in relation to water quality and water availability grafton 2019 or water reform requires perseverance continuity and long term commitment from governments to ensure that water resources are managed sustainably to meet changing community needs australian government 2017 in this study reform refers to any changes soft or hard measures to make sure that water is managed more sustainably in response to risk and uncertainty context and to meet community needs for example construction of a canal or a dike to control flood hard adaptation or reduction of crops per year to deal with water flow fluctuation soft adaptation is considered as water reform or an innovative water management practice viewed in this perspective water reform in an giang has a long history since 1819 vinh te canal next to cambodian border had been dug for multi purposes as national security agricultural production and navigation however active reform in water sector was recently implemented particularly after the historical flood in 2000 but it varied place to place based on community needs and resources fig 3 summarizes the context process and content of water reform in phu tan district an giang province the reform process has a strong relationship to crop development since 1975 the cropping pattern has been evolving through four different innovative water management models model 1 a natural flood based practice for two crops per year 2c1y after country reunification in 1975 the government had accelerated the rice production to lift people from the poverty and ensure food security for local people however limited resources did not allow the district invest on big irrigation fig 3 depicts that total rice planted area in phu tan increased from 43 2 thousand ha in 1991 49 7 thousand ha in 2000 the increase of rice area was mainly due to farmers expanding the area of sa and aw crops in favorable lands that were at high elevations and or near canals the historical flood in 2000 dropped the rice planted area to 47 1 thousand ha one year after mostly by reduction of aw crop exposures to annual floods have placed the aw crop production at risk which are prone to very uncertain conditions such as extreme floods fig 4 high dike development was therefore accelerated to control flooding in the district which enabled farmers to shift into a new cropping model model 2 flood prevention for rice intensification with three crops per year 3c1y there were some investments for flood control in the vmd after the extreme flood in 2000 in an giang province the nvn water control project started in 2002 and was considered as an innovative water governance initiative to demonstrate the economic social and environmental benefits in the floodplains through a coordinated water and land management approach according to the key informant interview with dard in 2020 the project consists of a 100 km ring dike with 16 major sluice gates and 39 culverts along the ring dike covering an area of 30 836 ha of natural land of which 24 039 ha agricultural land located mainly in phu tan 88 and tan chau 12 districts the areas are divided into 24 compartments or sub regions each ranges from 300 to 2500 ha depending on canal and inner dike networks data collected at dard in 2020 this well designed system provides a flexible water management for crop production at each sub region the nvn scheme enables farmers to grow more crops as the aw crop is protected from floods consequently planted rice areas increased dramatically following the project completion in 2007 and reached a peak in 2010 with an area of 66 8 thousand ha in phu tan district fig 3 in 2010 the cultivated area in each crop ws sa or aw was more or less the same meaning that the level of rice intensification has increased and the 3c1y model or even a frequency of 7 crops over 2 years was popular this time after some years both the local authorities and farmers realize the disadvantages of intensive farming loss sediment water pollution land degradation wild fish reduction and pest and disease outbreak so they subsequently reduced the level of intensification and changed their strategy by adopting another model of water management model 3 flood control for lower intensification with three years eight crops 3y8c since 2010 there was a change in cropping system from the 3c1y to 3y8c as visualized in fig 3 the 3y8c model means that two consecutive years of doing triple crop pattern then only double crops ws and sa are cultivated in the third year also called 3 3 2 model the land keeps fallow during the flood season aw crop in the third year to get sediments and water to wash the fields it is noted that this flood discharge practice is not applied to the entire nvn area but rotated for each sub region as shown in fig 3 to ensure food production annually as results the aw crop area dropped down from 5000 to 6000 ha in phu tan district per year after 2010 although the lower intensive level agriculture model was applied the 3y8c is not really effective this is due to the water level in the flooding season being lower fig 4 during that period and amount of sediment also decreased due to the impact of hydropower dams in the upstream of the mekong river these factors caused lower rice yields and resulted in farmers applying more agro chemicals to compensate therefore there was a need for water management strategies to adapt to a new situation and cropping patterns in the district shifted yet again to another model model 4 flood control towards more resilience with two years five crops 2y5c the new water management practice for model of 2y5c has been applied since 2019 this model is characterized as follows in a particular sub region farmers applied double crops in the first year triple crops in the second year and so forth as illustrated in fig 3 by application of this new practice the aw crop area in phu tan district has declined about 10 000 ha compared to 2010 in an phu and some other districts the hard measures were also constructed after the nvn project the result was that the aw crop areas in an giang continued to increase up to the present day for example from 21 0 thousand ha in 2000 115 0 thousand ha in 2010 and 171 8 thousand ha in 2020 table a 1 and fig 5 in other words the water reform took place differently leading to different results and resilience outcomes that will be discussed in the next parts 3 2 results a growth in food production and livelihood capitals the water reform process has gone through many stages since 1975 in an giang province that have resulted in changing the food production system and livelihood capitals of local communities data collected from the an giang statistical office shows that rice planted areas increased 2 9 times from 217 6 thousand ha in 1975 637 2 thousand ha in 2020 while rice production grew with a higher level 8 0 times from 0 5 million tons to 4 0 million tons in the same period therefore rice yields increased continuously from 2 2 tons per ha in 1975 6 3 tons per ha in 2020 results also show that food development in general and rice in particular in an giang and the vmd increased rapidly after the government s renovation policy in 1986 shifting from central planning to market orientation binh et al 2021 however the growth in an giang was the most rapid amongst the vmd provinces especially after 2000 as a result of innovative irrigation practices that were implemented to control flooding consequently production of cereals per capita in an giang exceeded that of the vmd overall average for example 2085 kg per capita produced in an giang compared to only 1420 kg in all of the vmd in 2020 fig 5 besides rice development fishery production in an giang has also grown rapidly in recent years the province s fishery production has increased from 114 thousand tons in 1994 540 thousand tons in 2019 equivalent to an increase of 474 of fishery production in the past 25 years it is noted that the growth of fishery production is mainly due to the rapid increase in aquaculture while the wild catch decreased drastically fig 6 shows that the catch production in 1994 accounted for 72 4 of total fishery production but this share decreases substantially to only 3 0 in 2019 farmers and local authorities believe that the decrease in natural fishery production is mainly due to the increase in crop production causing loss of habitat for aquatic species in the flood season indeed there is a strong inverse correlation between catch production and the planted area of aw rice crop in an giang fig 6 similarly thieu and dung 2014 reported that there were five major drivers affecting natural fishery production in an giang including population growth destructive fishing tools dike development pesticide use and decline in mekong river discharge they also found that the income structure of the poor who relied on natural fish has changed towards a reduction of fishing income especially for those fishing inside the dike system in fact income from catch natural production declined from 62 to 28 of total income for insiders in the period of 2003 2012 whereas it declined from 65 to 46 for outsiders in the same period thieu and dung 2014 changes in crop and fishery production systems also change community livelihood capitals statistical results in table a 3 show that some financial capital indicators in an giang such as gross output per hectare of cultivated land monthly income as well as gdp per capita have continuously increased over the years the increase in financial resource promote the increase of other capitals such as human capital i e enrolment rate of general education number of doctor per 10 000 inhabitants or rate of malnutrition of children under 5 years old physical capital i e housing condition access to electricity clean potable water or adequate sanitary systems and social capital i e number of agricultural cooperatives or a decrease in multi dimensional poverty however natural resource especially fisheries catch production has continuously decreased over the years for example wild fish catch has decreased from 42 5 kg per capita in 1994 to 15 0 kg in 2014 and only 8 6 kg in 2019 table a 3 in short the water reform process has created different cropping patterns achieving several positive results such as ensuring food security and socio economic development in an giang province in the last 3 decades however whether these achievements are stable or resilient in the long term is another matter especially considering the large scale interaction of the floodplain and coastal areas of the delta in the context of climate change sea level rise and water flow changes from the upper mekong river this will be discussed under analysis of resilience in the following part 3 3 resilience distinguish between livelihood and ecosystem resilience resilience has become a focus of international development agendas and an important criterion for measuring the development potential of individuals communities or socio ecological systems that is increasingly applied in many studies regarding water related hazards agriculture fishery and rural livelihoods uy et al 2011 nyamwanza 2012 speranza et al 2014 unisdr 2004 tanner et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 gong et al 2020 everard and west 2021 poelma et al 2021 each of the above authors has their own resilience definition in this study resilience refers to the capacity of a system potentially exposed to floods to adapt by changing in order to reach and maintain an acceptable level of functioning and structure based on unisdr 2004 as mentioned it is necessary to distinguish resilience by different levels for example at household livelihood resilience and at a larger scale within the landscape ecosystem context which will be discussed below fig 7 3 3 1 livelihood resilience fig 7a presents the results of expert interviews on livelihood resilience of 4 different water management schemes for rice production in an giang based on five livelihood capitals the results show that the 2c1y model has the highest resilience average of 2 5 points with stdev of 0 501 followed by the models of 2y5c average of 2 3 points with stdev of 0 559 3y8c average of 2 1 points with stdev of 0 584 and 3c1y 1 9 points with stdev of 0 631 the 3c1y model is considered as the lowest resilience of which all five livelihood capitals have lowest results compared to the other models table a 4 shows that although the 3c1y model has the highest productivity 16 6 tons ha year and total revenue 96 1 million vnd ha year but the financial efficiency is the lowest only 0 57 due to high production costs especially high costs for fertilizers and pesticides the high level of fertilizer and pesticide application pollutes the environment reduces wild fish catch yields and adversely affects the health of people the score on human capital is therefore low in addition the intensive farming and mechanization in the 3c1y model also affects the livelihoods of the poor since they rely on aquatic species in the flood season for income or protein sources or engage in labor for manual rice harvesting these contribute to low social capital scores in the 3c1y model in contrast the 2c1y model has the highest financial efficiency 0 99 as well as the best fertilizer efficiency 1 kg of fertilizer for 16 7 kg of rice which results in the model being assessed as the most optimal in the livelihood resilience score the 3y8c and 2y5c models have intermediate values between 2c1y and 3c1y 3 3 2 ecosystem resilience similar to the resilience at the household level the ecosystem resilience is highest for the 2c1y system followed by the 2y5c and 3y8c the most intensive rice production the 3c1y has the lowest resilience scores according to the expert interviews fig 7b the 2c1y is the most extensive rice production before shifting to intensive rice production models and is considered as providing the highest social institutional and environmental benefits the innovation 2y5c that farmers switched to recently has lower environmental benefits compared to 2c1y however is reasonable in terms of institutional and social perspectives compared to 3c1y and 3y8c models for the 3c1y model all resilience dimensions are perceived lower than other production models of which the environmental component is the lowest the negative impacts of intensive rice production on the environment are well recognized in literature minh et al 2019 yokoyama et al 2015 it is necessary to highlight that while the economic resilience of 3c1y is the same as other production models the economic benefits at the ecosystem level are lower than other production models this indicates that the costs of intensive rice production may be higher at the community than at the household level and when taking these costs into account the economic resilience of intensive rice production was not promising as previously anticipated at the household level the 5c2y although having the same economic resilience as the 2c1y it has lower environmental resilience than the previous one it is understandable since the 2c1y model is considered as providing the highest ecosystem benefits to soils water and biodiversity chapman et al 2016 nguyen et al 2019 while experts express consensus on a high resilience regarding environmental capacity at the ecosystem level of the 2c1y model compared to the others especially the 3c1y model environmental parameters from different sources confirmed the situation table a 5 a study in 2019 shows that although the water quality index of aquatic life in the semi dike area 2c1y is higher than the full dike area 3c1y they were both categorized as poor in the dry season 5 40 and 3 70 respectively this parameter improves for both models during the wet season nevertheless it is still poor for the 3c1y 4 7 while upgraded to moderate quality for 2c1y 7 10 minh et al 2019 similarly the number of fish species found in rice fields in 2018 2019 in the semi dike is 1 7 times higher than in the full dike area quang et al 2019 this is consistent with the result from another study in 2010 with the average score per taxon of bmwp vietnam where 2c1y scores 3 13 fair level and 3c1y scores 2 44 poor level thuan et al 2010 the water quality for both models at the ecosystem scale has not improved after a decade in terms of average weight of sediment accumulated the 2c1y model receives 5 times more sediment weight than the 3c1y model 22 5 and 4 4 respectively consequently the amount of total nitrogen of sediment and the total phosphorus of sediment in the 2c1y model is higher than the 3c1y 9 6 and 4 5 times respectively similarly total potassium of sediment in the 2c1y model is higher than the 3c1y model by 2 8 times phung et al 2017 the 2c1y model increases the sediment supply for the soil and as a result reduces the amount of fertilizers used compared to the 3c1y model this is proven by the amount of chemical fertilizers used in the 2c1y model which is 2 2 times lower than the 3c1y model in addition the amount of pesticides and gasoline for irrigation in the 2c1y model is also lower than the 3c1y model which resulted in lower soil water and air pollution levels in the 2c1y model as well this translates to lower expenditures in fertilizer costs comparing an phu district considered as less intensive agriculture as it mostly implements the 2c1y model and phu tan district considered as more intensive agriculture implementing the 3c1y model quantitative data revealed that rice production in phu tan decreased sharply in an extreme flood event during 2011 and recovered slowly while rice production in an phu was relatively unaffected fig a2 this suggests that the degree of resilience of the intensive model is relatively lower than the other models in addition the more intensive model required greater water consumption in fact if water requirement in ws sa and aw are 8080 7520 and 6500 m3 ha crop respectively nhan et al 2007 then the 2c1y model in total would consume about 15 600 m3 ha year compared to 22 100 m3 ha year for the 3c1y 19 933 m3 ha year for the 3y8c and 18 850 m3 ha year for the 2y5c therefore the 2c1y practice facilitates more freshwater conservation which in turn is very beneficial for communities a long or closer to the coastal areas as they are affected by a lack of freshwater supply during the dry season which is exacerbated by hydropower development in upstream countries the resilience assessment at the community level demonstrates that resilience is higher with less intensive rice mostly due to an increase of environmental social and institutional aspects of resilience this implies that the shifts to less intensive crop as observed recently could rapidly increase the environmental and social resilience and to a lesser extent improve institutional and economic resilience these changes may have multiple dimensions and the impact on one resilience aspect may be compensated or compromised by others for example shifting to less intensive rice will improve production efficiency however but unfortunately will also reduce labor demand and thus less employment opportunities for example the 3c1y model requires 803 h ha per year while the 2c1y is about 323 h ha nhut 2008 more solutions are therefore needed to effect more optimal approaches in general there are some differences in terms of resilience at livelihood and ecosystem levels among four water management schemes for example in the 3c1y model the scores of livelihood resilience are higher than that for ecosystem resilience 1 9 points compared to 1 6 points the 3c1y model may bring higher incomes to rice farmers but damages the environment and causes social inequality at the ecosystem level and in the long term data from the household living standard survey in an giang clearly reveals that income gaps between the richest quintile and the poorest quintile increase from 7 0 times in 2008 8 4 times in 2018 anyhow both show the highest resilience in the model of 2c1y and declining by 2y5c 3y8c and 1y3c respectively hence there are many lessons learned for policy implication to expand effective water management model in the future considering not only at household level but also ecosystem level which will be discussed in the return part below 3 4 return discussing lessons learned and policy implication the return aspects of the 4r framework are presented by reflecting on some lessons learned and future policy implication for improving resilience the nvn water innovation system has shown some policy implication aspects that have both positives attributes and some limitations as discussed in the reform section the improved governance structure enhancing the role of participation and collaboration and facilitating local leadership are key achievements observed from the project in addition the farmers expressed feelings of reassurance in food security safety and stable cultivation all of which has proved to be significant advantages of the system these positive aspects for the nvn are included in both official legislation and standard procedures however this innovation in resilience has yet to be expanded to other areas in an giang province and in the mekong delta for example another commune in an phu district upstream of nvn project is covered by a high dike system but adequate water supply that meets requirements is rare rather groundwater extraction in abundant surface water areas land degradation water pollution and misuse of water resources are typical problems in these areas it has been observed that the key successful factor of the nvn project is the involvement of international donors such as ausaid in designing and supporting the implementation of the project tran et al 2020 next from the water innovation perspective wehn and montalvo 2018 wwap 2016 the nvn system has significantly contributed to water infrastructure development and water supply however the system fails to link with regional water management e g impacts of upstream and downstream water resources see fig 8 the system has a limited capacity to adapt to the changes of water flow from the upstream of the mekong delta water flushed out from the system may produce pollutants that can harm downstream ecosystem the benefits e g ecosystem services and the costs such as the sediment reduction biodiversity losses and land degradation of the system have not been assessed holistically contributions of ict based innovation 1 1 examples ict based innovations include improved forecasting systems for floods and drought smart sensors to reduce water consumption in households business and municipalities asset management demand management water reuse and energy saving could be the next steps for improving the nvn system improvement of sediment loss to the nvn areas is another measure in the red river delta of vietnam where almost all the downstream areas are equipped with high dike to protect the region from flooding and salinity intrusion a large amount of inorganic and organic fertilizers are applied to maintain soil fertility diversification of farming system together with the improvement of agronomic measures e g introduction of new varieties and irrigation and drainage systems have helped the delta maintain its functions under low sediment supply from the river morton 2020 tu et al 2019 other solutions such as reservoir management and forest conservation require basin scale changes that go beyond the household or community levels vinh et al 2014 the nvn as well as the vmd is controlled by both upstream river discharge and downstream tidal effects the tidal river management from bangladesh delta seijger et al 2019 adnan et al 2020 could be a reference for improving sediment management practice in the mekong delta given its innovative features designed for a congested river delta such as improvement for livelihoods and sustainability the nvn project is mostly focusing on water management and food security issues in the areas livelihood of local people is still rather limited as shown in the resilience section the project has impacted unequally to different farmer groups such as negatively impacting livelihoods of people whose livelihoods have been based on fishery activities thong and james 2017 this may also lead to the loss of traditional fishing culture baran et al 2007 as well as local biodiversity in addition the dominant rice based livelihood still does not significantly improve the living conditions and incomes of farmers tran et al 2021 the design of the nvn system has some limitation in diversifying cropping system in the areas which limits farmers in adopting new crops that would be more suited to market driven agricultural product lines thus the water management should be incorporated with agricultural transformation and diversification to promote and ensure the livelihood sustainability of local farmers tran and weger 2017 dung et al 2018 tran et al 2019 binh et al 2021 effective land use planning could be one of the key solutions to link water management with livelihood sustainability quan et al 2020 4 conclusions assessing improved resilience of agriculture development under high risk and uncertainty is very challenging in this study based on the grounded theory approach we presented a novel 4r framework reform result resilience and return for the resilience assessment of four dike based innovative water management schemes for rice crop production development over the three decades in an giang one of the upper floodplain provinces of the vietnamese mekong delta we have argued that a water management scheme decoupling with intensive rice production can strengthen the resilience of communities because this production and water management scheme requires less inputs brings more natural benefits and has less impacts to the ecosystems our findings have revealed that the more intensive crop patterns are also the less resilient systems regarding four rice models associated with four water management schemes the rice model of two crops in one year 2c1y is most optimal given its social economic and environmental sustainability while the intensive triple rice cropping pattern 3c1y is overall and in the long term more harmful and also undermines the benefits of floods other so called innovative water management schemes i e 8c3y and 5c2y have some improvements but they both seem only to be temporary measures our findings have implied a need to support agricultural transformation for example from rice intensification to less intensive or flood based farming systems to improve agricultural sustainability and resilience in addition this study assessed the resilience of farming systems and the associated communities based on the proposed criteria capitals the resilience of each farming system or community to specific stressors flooding change of upstream water or fluctuation of market drivers would be different further works could continue to explore this framework for other crops at different places and scales across the floodplains of the mekong delta and for specific climatic and non climatic stressors these will more clearly delineate their relationships in enabling delta wide sustainability strategies and engaging institutional dimensions of governance to assess

9437,the floodplains play an important role in agricultural development and rural livelihoods in the vietnamese mekong delta as an intensive rice production area of vietnam the floodplain has experienced significant changes in water management regime during the recent decades depending on specific locations and irrigation infrastructure investments four main water management practices have been innovated particularly a planting season of two crops per year 2c1y three crops per year 3c1y three years eight crops 3y8c and two years five crops 2y5c the 4r framework reform result resilience and return was developed based on grounded theory approach for resilience assessment of various innovative water management practices in terms of resilience we found that each crop pattern involves pros and cons and the intensive crop practices are less resilient systems especially in social environmental and ecological aspects the findings provide good lessons learned not only for vietnam but also for the other rice producing deltas implementing ecosystem resilience to adapt to global challenges such as flood drought and salinity intrusion graphical abstract ga1 keywords floodplains

farmers to grow more crops per year which has enhanced food security but the expansion of irrigated areas have drastically decreased natural wetlands and as well the cropping intensities have resulted in water pollution and land degradation due to excessive chemical fertilizer and pesticide application which have chronically that damaged the ecological system and destroyed biodiversity cip upward

cosgrove and loucks 2015 such changes will affect agricultural and ecosystems which in turn can adversely impact people s livelihoods particularly in the wetland and lower delta areas smajlg et al 2015 tanner et al 2015 the vietnamese mekong delta vmd is located downstream of the mekong river the twelfth longest river and the second richest river basin in terms of biodiversity in the world and its topography is characterized as fertile alluvial floodplains with a tropical monsoon climate xuan and matsui 1998 tuan et al 2007 naturally from july to december about 1 2 1 9 million ha 30 48 of the total vmd area in the upstream and middle areas is inundated due to the overflow from the mekong river and local rainfall whereas in the dry season extensive areas along the delta s coastlines experience salinity intrusion tuan et al 2007 binh 2015 this water regime allows farmers to cultivate only one rice crop per year as a result the growth of agriculture in the 1980s did not keep up with the population growth causing food shortages and extreme poverty binh et al 2021 to ensure national food security the vietnamese government invested in many large irrigation works for rice production thanks to irrigation development vietnam shifted from being a food importer in the 1980s to producing enough food for domestic consumption as well as becoming one of the world s leading rice exporters today ut and kajisa 2006 binh et al 2021 according to usda 2021 vietnam exported 6 2 million tons of rice in 2020 accounting for 14 of the total rice export volume in the world market

country s population gov 2017 gso 2020 the investment in irrigation works in the vmd floodplains enables farmers to increase the rice cultivation from 2 to 3 crops per year even in many areas up to 7 crops within 2 years this intensification increases rice production but creates huge environmental costs due to the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides chapman et al 2016 chapman and darby 2016 world bank 2017 minh et al 2020 besides the vmd is also predicted to be one of the most affected deltas by climate change globally ipcc 2007 imhen and undp 2015 in addition the construction of hydropower dams and irrigation infrastructures in the upper countries of the mekong river results in alterations of the natural river flows which decreases sediment supply from the river leading to an increased need for chemical fertilizer application as compensation to maintain soil fertility chapman et al 2016 chapman and darby 2016 all these factors affect the sustainable production and livelihood of local people to adapt to these new conditions it is necessary to have innovative water solutions to promote sustainable development recently local authorities have made changes in water management towards reducing the intensive levels i e shifting from 3 rice crops per year to 5 crops over 2 years in some floodplain areas of the vmd particularly in an giang province many scholars and international institutions recognized that innovative water management practices occurred in agriculture worldwide but assessment of such innovations is still a challenge unctad 2011 iica 2015 colosimo and kim 2016 iwmi 2019 cosgrove and loucks 2015 stressed that many innovations in sustainable water management involve high risk and may incur uncertain returns according to iwmi 2019 enhanced water resources management and more resilient water services are essential for adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change and for strengthening the resilience of communities ecosystems and economies in other words how can water management make agricultural development more resilient under high risk and uncertainty this paper aims to answer the above question by examining various innovative water management practices for rice production in the north vam nao nvn irrigation system which is situated in an giang floodplain province of the vmd lessons learned from this study can benefit other rice producing deltas globally in informing long term adaptation strategies 2 methodology 2 1 application of grounded theory the grounded theory is defined as a qualitative method used to build a theory or an analytical framework for further research the result was achieved through a process of working and interacting continuously with many people to understand the study phenomenon bitsch and creswell 2005 2013 therefore the theory or framework is derived during the process of implementation and further developed based on actual data and information from the ground the grounded theory research process consists of several steps as depicted in fig 1 the process begins with the problem identification and research question formulation the next step is sample selection and data collection sample selection in the grounded theory is theoretical sampling or non probability sampling that is the selection of the observation sample or the interviewee cannot be determined in advance in a statistical way but is very flexible based on the actual situation and the researcher s judgment so that the collected data will reflect the actual nature of the research phenomenon corbin and strauss 1990 charmaz 2006 after data collection the data undergoes coding and analysis according to bitsch 2005 the coding and analysis of field data applies the method of constant comparison that is after each interview or observation the data must be coded and compared in order to recognize the commonalities and differences by this method the data will be classified and sorted into categories and sub categories to see the correlation between them in order to explain the phenomenon being studied in the most appropriate way leedy and ormrod 2015 concepts are then recognized and theory or framework will thus be formed this process ends only when data and information are saturated meaning that further data collection and analysis will not generate new ideas corbin and strauss 1990 if the information is not saturated researchers will revert back to the data collection and analysis step and adjust the research question to suit the actual context as necessary as described by creswell 2013 the grounded theory research is an iterative and adaptive process collect data at the field return to the office for analysis then go back to the field for further data collection return to the office for the second analysis and so forth the process will be continued until there is sufficient data and information to build a theory application of this approach we conducted 4 fieldtrips during november 2019 and april 2021 in an giang province for data collection by using some participatory tools i e historical analysis seasonal calendar in depth interviews and focus group discussion to discuss with various peoples at different levels about livelihood and ecosystem resilience of rice production in different models of water management thanks to the advantages of grounded theory approach a novel framework was developed demonstrating how the relationship between water reform policies or practices with its result resilience and return the so called 4r framework can be used for assessing various water management regimes within other contexts additionally we also interviewed researchers and scientists in the vmd and ho chi minh city who have good knowledge and experiences in the region to assess the resilience by different water management practices details of the process are described in the next sections 2 2 site selection and description an giang province was selected for this study because being situated within the vmd floodplains fig a 1 it has a diverse practice of various water management regimes including innovative water management that can be used as case studies for comparison according to gso 2020 an giang rice production in 2019 reached 3 9 million tons ranking at the second position among 63 provinces in vietnam placing it as one of the major food producers in the country data show that the planted rice areas in an giang continuously increased from 453 2 thousand ha in 000t581 2 thousand ha in 2010 and 632 4 thousand ha in 2020 table a 1 this result was achieved through investment in irrigation infrastructure to prevent floods which facilitated crop extensification and intensification however such investments occurred unevenly amongst districts in the province depending on the level of investment and water management regime two main dike systems exist in an giang the high dike or full dike system can prevent both early and late floods with higher water levels and is suitable for 3 rice crops per year referred to as winter spring ws summer autumn sa and autumn winter aw respectively the low dike or semi dike system could only protect more interior areas from the early floods and allow water to enter the fields during the late floods and therefore 2 rice crops per year ws and sa are dedicated these areas for this study we selected two districts an phu and phu tan each with different water management regimes and cropping patterns and explored how different innovative water management practices influenced the livelihood resilience of local residents an phu district has a total area of 226 km2 and a population of 148 5 thousand inhabitants which is equal to a population density of 656 people per km2 an phu represents low dike areas that are dominating by the two rice crops per year table a 1 shows that the third rice crop aw area in 2010 was only 0 9 thousand ha accounting for 3 of the total cultivated area by 2020 the aw area grew up to 5 5 thousand ha but it still accounted for a relatively low 16 of the total cultivated area in the district phu tan district covers an area of 313 km2 with 188 8 thousand inhabitants which is equal to a population density of 604 people per km2 phu tan represents the high dike areas where a system of dikes has been constructed since 2002 thanks to the joint australian and vietnamese government nvn water control project as a result total rice planted area in phu tan increased remarkably from 49 7 to 66 9 thousand ha between 2000 and 2010 before declining to 60 2 thousand ha in 2020 table a 1 the variation of total planted rice area was caused mainly by the change in aw crop due to recent changes in water management practice in short the two districts had more or less the same condition before 2000 since then phu tan was benefited from the nvn project which allows farmers to grow more crops due to an increased area of aw crop recently the aw crop in phu tan has decreased whereas the aw crop in an phu steadily increased these trends provide a good case study for comparison of different innovative water solutions for agricultural development and livelihood resilience 2 3 data collection both secondary and primary data were collected in an giang province between november 2019 and april 2021 the secondary data were gathered from various sources particularly from the department of natural resources and environment donre the department of agriculture and rural development dard the department of labors invalids and social affair dolisa the statistical office at provincial and district level and annual socio economic reports at communes such secondary data provide a general overview on socio economic and environmental situation including hydrology weather land use water management irrigation infrastructure agriculture aquaculture poverty population and pollution the primary data were collected through four fieldtrips by using some participatory rural appraisal pra tools such as timeline analysis seasonal calendar focus group discussion key informant interview in depth interview and observation at the sites fao 2011 a total of 88 participants were involved in the survey of which 73 persons were residents of an giang province and 15 persons were scientists from can tho and ho chi minh cities table a 2 2 4 data analysis collected information and data were analyzed using the grounded theory approach bitsch 2005 creswell 2013 leedy and ormrod 2015 according to leedy and ormrod 2015 there are three main steps in data analysis applied grounded theory which are summarized below open coding the data are divided into segments and then scrutinized for commonalities that reflect general categories in fact raw data in the form of field notes gathered from the survey were documented in ms word and broken into single word or phrases in vietnamese these pieces of information were used for coding based on the codes they are grouped into four categories namely reform result resilience and return after meaningful categories are identified the data are further examined for properties or sub categories that characterize each category for example the reform category consists of various information such as cropping pattern shift crop yield fluctuation flood regime change irrigation development dike investment sediment reduction etc those were organized into reform context reform process and reform content sub categories this process was done manually on ms excel sheet axial coding during the process of open coding one or few categories might emerge as being central to the investigated phenomenon in axial coding one of these categories is selected as a core category this core category serves as an axis around which certain other categories appear to revolve in some way in this study we did not use multivariate analysis to outline core categories instead the four identified categories were organized in cause effect relation making connections between categories to discover regularities variations and singularities in the data selected coding and theory development a single category is selected as the core concept in the phenomenon and a theory or new framework is developed based on this concept and its interrelationships with other categories in this case reform of water for rice development is selected as the starting point to assess resilience among different innovative water management practices the reform created different results that may have resulted in numerous resilience outcomes such outcomes provided copious lessons learned and policy implications that were identified as discussion themes for the next round therefore the analytical framework is structured logically from reform to result resilience and return categories quantitative data collected during the survey from local statistic offices and related departments are also employed to supplement and confirm the qualitative approach in addition through the grounded theory approach it was necessary to distinguish resilience by different levels because water reform in the research sites may bring positive outcomes for local communities but affect others at a larger scale in this study we consider the cross scale interaction of the complex delta system by assessing livelihood and ecosystem levels of resilience the assessment of ecosystem resilience allows a better understanding of the long term effects of innovative water management but it may be difficult to observe resilience at the household level therefore within this context livelihood resilience has been assessed through five livelihood capitals such as human natural physical financial and social according to the sustainable livelihood approach dfid 1999 uy et al 2011 ecosystem resilience is characterized by four dimensions of sustainable development namely social economic environmental and institutional wass et al 2011 tanner et al 2015 to get more scientific figures the livelihood resilience and ecosystem resilience for each water management scheme were assessed by expert s opinions fifteen scientists from local research institutes and universities who are experts on the field of rice production and irrigation development in the mekong delta were asked to quantify both resilience levels for example to assess livelihood resilience the research team went to meet respondents separately and asked them to score each livelihood capital for a particular water management practice from low 1 point to medium 2 points and high 3 points based on their expertise they were also asked the reason for scoring total scores of livelihood resilience are calculated as an average of all resilience dimensions according to the experts opinions the ecosystem resilience was also evaluated using the same approach application of such above steps the assessment of innovative water management framework is created as fig 2 the information and data are classified into four categories consisting of reform result resilience and return so called 4r framework each category contains sub categories to characterize the category s meanings for example the reform category has three sub categories as context process and content of water reform in the study site in this 4r framework water reform is a core concept but related to result resilience and return that will be presented and discussed in the next sections 3 results and discussions 3 1 reform as an innovative water management practice generally reform means to change something in a positive direction typically a social political economic or institutional practice reform in water sector is defined as an ongoing process in response to crises in relation to water quality and water availability grafton 2019 or water reform requires perseverance continuity and long term commitment from governments to ensure that water resources are managed sustainably to meet changing community needs australian government 2017 in this study reform refers to any changes soft or hard measures to make sure that water is managed more sustainably in response to risk and uncertainty context and to meet community needs for example construction of a canal or a dike to control flood hard adaptation or reduction of crops per year to deal with water flow fluctuation soft adaptation is considered as water reform or an innovative water management practice viewed in this perspective water reform in an giang has a long history since 1819 vinh te canal next to cambodian border had been dug for multi purposes as national security agricultural production and navigation however active reform in water sector was recently implemented particularly after the historical flood in 2000 but it varied place to place based on community needs and resources fig 3 summarizes the context process and content of water reform in phu tan district an giang province the reform process has a strong relationship to crop development since 1975 the cropping pattern has been evolving through four different innovative water management models model 1 a natural flood based practice for two crops per year 2c1y after country reunification in 1975 the government had accelerated the rice production to lift people from the poverty and ensure food security for local people however limited resources did not allow the district invest on big irrigation fig 3 depicts that total rice planted area in phu tan increased from 43 2 thousand ha in 1991 49 7 thousand ha in 2000 the increase of rice area was mainly due to farmers expanding the area of sa and aw crops in favorable lands that were at high elevations and or near canals the historical flood in 2000 dropped the rice planted area to 47 1 thousand ha one year after mostly by reduction of aw crop exposures to annual floods have placed the aw crop production at risk which are prone to very uncertain conditions such as extreme floods fig 4 high dike development was therefore accelerated to control flooding in the district which enabled farmers to shift into a new cropping model model 2 flood prevention for rice intensification with three crops per year 3c1y there were some investments for flood control in the vmd after the extreme flood in 2000 in an giang province the nvn water control project started in 2002 and was considered as an innovative water governance initiative to demonstrate the economic social and environmental benefits in the floodplains through a coordinated water and land management approach according to the key informant interview with dard in 2020 the project consists of a 100 km ring dike with 16 major sluice gates and 39 culverts along the ring dike covering an area of 30 836 ha of natural land of which 24 039 ha agricultural land located mainly in phu tan 88 and tan chau 12 districts the areas are divided into 24 compartments or sub regions each ranges from 300 to 2500 ha depending on canal and inner dike networks data collected at dard in 2020 this well designed system provides a flexible water management for crop production at each sub region the nvn scheme enables farmers to grow more crops as the aw crop is protected from floods consequently planted rice areas increased dramatically following the project completion in 2007 and reached a peak in 2010 with an area of 66 8 thousand ha in phu tan district fig 3 in 2010 the cultivated area in each crop ws sa or aw was more or less the same meaning that the level of rice intensification has increased and the 3c1y model or even a frequency of 7 crops over 2 years was popular this time after some years both the local authorities and farmers realize the disadvantages of intensive farming loss sediment water pollution land degradation wild fish reduction and pest and disease outbreak so they subsequently reduced the level of intensification and changed their strategy by adopting another model of water management model 3 flood control for lower intensification with three years eight crops 3y8c since 2010 there was a change in cropping system from the 3c1y to 3y8c as visualized in fig 3 the 3y8c model means that two consecutive years of doing triple crop pattern then only double crops ws and sa are cultivated in the third year also called 3 3 2 model the land keeps fallow during the flood season aw crop in the third year to get sediments and water to wash the fields it is noted that this flood discharge practice is not applied to the entire nvn area but rotated for each sub region as shown in fig 3 to ensure food production annually as results the aw crop area dropped down from 5000 to 6000 ha in phu tan district per year after 2010 although the lower intensive level agriculture model was applied the 3y8c is not really effective this is due to the water level in the flooding season being lower fig 4 during that period and amount of sediment also decreased due to the impact of hydropower dams in the upstream of the mekong river these factors caused lower rice yields and resulted in farmers applying more agro chemicals to compensate therefore there was a need for water management strategies to adapt to a new situation and cropping patterns in the district shifted yet again to another model model 4 flood control towards more resilience with two years five crops 2y5c the new water management practice for model of 2y5c has been applied since 2019 this model is characterized as follows in a particular sub region farmers applied double crops in the first year triple crops in the second year and so forth as illustrated in fig 3 by application of this new practice the aw crop area in phu tan district has declined about 10 000 ha compared to 2010 in an phu and some other districts the hard measures were also constructed after the nvn project the result was that the aw crop areas in an giang continued to increase up to the present day for example from 21 0 thousand ha in 2000 115 0 thousand ha in 2010 and 171 8 thousand ha in 2020 table a 1 and fig 5 in other words the water reform took place differently leading to different results and resilience outcomes that will be discussed in the next parts 3 2 results a growth in food production and livelihood capitals the water reform process has gone through many stages since 1975 in an giang province that have resulted in changing the food production system and livelihood capitals of local communities data collected from the an giang statistical office shows that rice planted areas increased 2 9 times from 217 6 thousand ha in 1975 637 2 thousand ha in 2020 while rice production grew with a higher level 8 0 times from 0 5 million tons to 4 0 million tons in the same period therefore rice yields increased continuously from 2 2 tons per ha in 1975 6 3 tons per ha in 2020 results also show that food development in general and rice in particular in an giang and the vmd increased rapidly after the government s renovation policy in 1986 shifting from central planning to market orientation binh et al 2021 however the growth in an giang was the most rapid amongst the vmd provinces especially after 2000 as a result of innovative irrigation practices that were implemented to control flooding consequently production of cereals per capita in an giang exceeded that of the vmd overall average for example 2085 kg per capita produced in an giang compared to only 1420 kg in all of the vmd in 2020 fig 5 besides rice development fishery production in an giang has also grown rapidly in recent years the province s fishery production has increased from 114 thousand tons in 1994 540 thousand tons in 2019 equivalent to an increase of 474 of fishery production in the past 25 years it is noted that the growth of fishery production is mainly due to the rapid increase in aquaculture while the wild catch decreased drastically fig 6 shows that the catch production in 1994 accounted for 72 4 of total fishery production but this share decreases substantially to only 3 0 in 2019 farmers and local authorities believe that the decrease in natural fishery production is mainly due to the increase in crop production causing loss of habitat for aquatic species in the flood season indeed there is a strong inverse correlation between catch production and the planted area of aw rice crop in an giang fig 6 similarly thieu and dung 2014 reported that there were five major drivers affecting natural fishery production in an giang including population growth destructive fishing tools dike development pesticide use and decline in mekong river discharge they also found that the income structure of the poor who relied on natural fish has changed towards a reduction of fishing income especially for those fishing inside the dike system in fact income from catch natural production declined from 62 to 28 of total income for insiders in the period of 2003 2012 whereas it declined from 65 to 46 for outsiders in the same period thieu and dung 2014 changes in crop and fishery production systems also change community livelihood capitals statistical results in table a 3 show that some financial capital indicators in an giang such as gross output per hectare of cultivated land monthly income as well as gdp per capita have continuously increased over the years the increase in financial resource promote the increase of other capitals such as human capital i e enrolment rate of general education number of doctor per 10 000 inhabitants or rate of malnutrition of children under 5 years old physical capital i e housing condition access to electricity clean potable water or adequate sanitary systems and social capital i e number of agricultural cooperatives or a decrease in multi dimensional poverty however natural resource especially fisheries catch production has continuously decreased over the years for example wild fish catch has decreased from 42 5 kg per capita in 1994 to 15 0 kg in 2014 and only 8 6 kg in 2019 table a 3 in short the water reform process has created different cropping patterns achieving several positive results such as ensuring food security and socio economic development in an giang province in the last 3 decades however whether these achievements are stable or resilient in the long term is another matter especially considering the large scale interaction of the floodplain and coastal areas of the delta in the context of climate change sea level rise and water flow changes from the upper mekong river this will be discussed under analysis of resilience in the following part 3 3 resilience distinguish between livelihood and ecosystem resilience resilience has become a focus of international development agendas and an important criterion for measuring the development potential of individuals communities or socio ecological systems that is increasingly applied in many studies regarding water related hazards agriculture fishery and rural livelihoods uy et al 2011 nyamwanza 2012 speranza et al 2014 unisdr 2004 tanner et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 gong et al 2020 everard and west 2021 poelma et al 2021 each of the above authors has their own resilience definition in this study resilience refers to the capacity of a system potentially exposed to floods to adapt by changing in order to reach and maintain an acceptable level of functioning and structure based on unisdr 2004 as mentioned it is necessary to distinguish resilience by different levels for example at household livelihood resilience and at a larger scale within the landscape ecosystem context which will be discussed below fig 7 3 3 1 livelihood resilience fig 7a presents the results of expert interviews on livelihood resilience of 4 different water management schemes for rice production in an giang based on five livelihood capitals the results show that the 2c1y model has the highest resilience average of 2 5 points with stdev of 0 501 followed by the models of 2y5c average of 2 3 points with stdev of 0 559 3y8c average of 2 1 points with stdev of 0 584 and 3c1y 1 9 points with stdev of 0 631 the 3c1y model is considered as the lowest resilience of which all five livelihood capitals have lowest results compared to the other models table a 4 shows that although the 3c1y model has the highest productivity 16 6 tons ha year and total revenue 96 1 million vnd ha year but the financial efficiency is the lowest only 0 57 due to high production costs especially high costs for fertilizers and pesticides the high level of fertilizer and pesticide application pollutes the environment reduces wild fish catch yields and adversely affects the health of people the score on human capital is therefore low in addition the intensive farming and mechanization in the 3c1y model also affects the livelihoods of the poor since they rely on aquatic species in the flood season for income or protein sources or engage in labor for manual rice harvesting these contribute to low social capital scores in the 3c1y model in contrast the 2c1y model has the highest financial efficiency 0 99 as well as the best fertilizer efficiency 1 kg of fertilizer for 16 7 kg of rice which results in the model being assessed as the most optimal in the livelihood resilience score the 3y8c and 2y5c models have intermediate values between 2c1y and 3c1y 3 3 2 ecosystem resilience similar to the resilience at the household level the ecosystem resilience is highest for the 2c1y system followed by the 2y5c and 3y8c the most intensive rice production the 3c1y has the lowest resilience scores according to the expert interviews fig 7b the 2c1y is the most extensive rice production before shifting to intensive rice production models and is considered as providing the highest social institutional and environmental benefits the innovation 2y5c that farmers switched to recently has lower environmental benefits compared to 2c1y however is reasonable in terms of institutional and social perspectives compared to 3c1y and 3y8c models for the 3c1y model all resilience dimensions are perceived lower than other production models of which the environmental component is the lowest the negative impacts of intensive rice production on the environment are well recognized in literature minh et al 2019 yokoyama et al 2015 it is necessary to highlight that while the economic resilience of 3c1y is the same as other production models the economic benefits at the ecosystem level are lower than other production models this indicates that the costs of intensive rice production may be higher at the community than at the household level and when taking these costs into account the economic resilience of intensive rice production was not promising as previously anticipated at the household level the 5c2y although having the same economic resilience as the 2c1y it has lower environmental resilience than the previous one it is understandable since the 2c1y model is considered as providing the highest ecosystem benefits to soils water and biodiversity chapman et al 2016 nguyen et al 2019 while experts express consensus on a high resilience regarding environmental capacity at the ecosystem level of the 2c1y model compared to the others especially the 3c1y model environmental parameters from different sources confirmed the situation table a 5 a study in 2019 shows that although the water quality index of aquatic life in the semi dike area 2c1y is higher than the full dike area 3c1y they were both categorized as poor in the dry season 5 40 and 3 70 respectively this parameter improves for both models during the wet season nevertheless it is still poor for the 3c1y 4 7 while upgraded to moderate quality for 2c1y 7 10 minh et al 2019 similarly the number of fish species found in rice fields in 2018 2019 in the semi dike is 1 7 times higher than in the full dike area quang et al 2019 this is consistent with the result from another study in 2010 with the average score per taxon of bmwp vietnam where 2c1y scores 3 13 fair level and 3c1y scores 2 44 poor level thuan et al 2010 the water quality for both models at the ecosystem scale has not improved after a decade in terms of average weight of sediment accumulated the 2c1y model receives 5 times more sediment weight than the 3c1y model 22 5 and 4 4 respectively consequently the amount of total nitrogen of sediment and the total phosphorus of sediment in the 2c1y model is higher than the 3c1y 9 6 and 4 5 times respectively similarly total potassium of sediment in the 2c1y model is higher than the 3c1y model by 2 8 times phung et al 2017 the 2c1y model increases the sediment supply for the soil and as a result reduces the amount of fertilizers used compared to the 3c1y model this is proven by the amount of chemical fertilizers used in the 2c1y model which is 2 2 times lower than the 3c1y model in addition the amount of pesticides and gasoline for irrigation in the 2c1y model is also lower than the 3c1y model which resulted in lower soil water and air pollution levels in the 2c1y model as well this translates to lower expenditures in fertilizer costs comparing an phu district considered as less intensive agriculture as it mostly implements the 2c1y model and phu tan district considered as more intensive agriculture implementing the 3c1y model quantitative data revealed that rice production in phu tan decreased sharply in an extreme flood event during 2011 and recovered slowly while rice production in an phu was relatively unaffected fig a2 this suggests that the degree of resilience of the intensive model is relatively lower than the other models in addition the more intensive model required greater water consumption in fact if water requirement in ws sa and aw are 8080 7520 and 6500 m3 ha crop respectively nhan et al 2007 then the 2c1y model in total would consume about 15 600 m3 ha year compared to 22 100 m3 ha year for the 3c1y 19 933 m3 ha year for the 3y8c and 18 850 m3 ha year for the 2y5c therefore the 2c1y practice facilitates more freshwater conservation which in turn is very beneficial for communities a long or closer to the coastal areas as they are affected by a lack of freshwater supply during the dry season which is exacerbated by hydropower development in upstream countries the resilience assessment at the community level demonstrates that resilience is higher with less intensive rice mostly due to an increase of environmental social and institutional aspects of resilience this implies that the shifts to less intensive crop as observed recently could rapidly increase the environmental and social resilience and to a lesser extent improve institutional and economic resilience these changes may have multiple dimensions and the impact on one resilience aspect may be compensated or compromised by others for example shifting to less intensive rice will improve production efficiency however but unfortunately will also reduce labor demand and thus less employment opportunities for example the 3c1y model requires 803 h ha per year while the 2c1y is about 323 h ha nhut 2008 more solutions are therefore needed to effect more optimal approaches in general there are some differences in terms of resilience at livelihood and ecosystem levels among four water management schemes for example in the 3c1y model the scores of livelihood resilience are higher than that for ecosystem resilience 1 9 points compared to 1 6 points the 3c1y model may bring higher incomes to rice farmers but damages the environment and causes social inequality at the ecosystem level and in the long term data from the household living standard survey in an giang clearly reveals that income gaps between the richest quintile and the poorest quintile increase from 7 0 times in 2008 8 4 times in 2018 anyhow both show the highest resilience in the model of 2c1y and declining by 2y5c 3y8c and 1y3c respectively hence there are many lessons learned for policy implication to expand effective water management model in the future considering not only at household level but also ecosystem level which will be discussed in the return part below 3 4 return discussing lessons learned and policy implication the return aspects of the 4r framework are presented by reflecting on some lessons learned and future policy implication for improving resilience the nvn water innovation system has shown some policy implication aspects that have both positives attributes and some limitations as discussed in the reform section the improved governance structure enhancing the role of participation and collaboration and facilitating local leadership are key achievements observed from the project in addition the farmers expressed feelings of reassurance in food security safety and stable cultivation all of which has proved to be significant advantages of the system these positive aspects for the nvn are included in both official legislation and standard procedures however this innovation in resilience has yet to be expanded to other areas in an giang province and in the mekong delta for example another commune in an phu district upstream of nvn project is covered by a high dike system but adequate water supply that meets requirements is rare rather groundwater extraction in abundant surface water areas land degradation water pollution and misuse of water resources are typical problems in these areas it has been observed that the key successful factor of the nvn project is the involvement of international donors such as ausaid in designing and supporting the implementation of the project tran et al 2020 next from the water innovation perspective wehn and montalvo 2018 wwap 2016 the nvn system has significantly contributed to water infrastructure development and water supply however the system fails to link with regional water management e g impacts of upstream and downstream water resources see fig 8 the system has a limited capacity to adapt to the changes of water flow from the upstream of the mekong delta water flushed out from the system may produce pollutants that can harm downstream ecosystem the benefits e g ecosystem services and the costs such as the sediment reduction biodiversity losses and land degradation of the system have not been assessed holistically contributions of ict based innovation 1 1 examples ict based innovations include improved forecasting systems for floods and drought smart sensors to reduce water consumption in households business and municipalities asset management demand management water reuse and energy saving could be the next steps for improving the nvn system improvement of sediment loss to the nvn areas is another measure in the red river delta of vietnam where almost all the downstream areas are equipped with high dike to protect the region from flooding and salinity intrusion a large amount of inorganic and organic fertilizers are applied to maintain soil fertility diversification of farming system together with the improvement of agronomic measures e g introduction of new varieties and irrigation and drainage systems have helped the delta maintain its functions under low sediment supply from the river morton 2020 tu et al 2019 other solutions such as reservoir management and forest conservation require basin scale changes that go beyond the household or community levels vinh et al 2014 the nvn as well as the vmd is controlled by both upstream river discharge and downstream tidal effects the tidal river management from bangladesh delta seijger et al 2019 adnan et al 2020 could be a reference for improving sediment management practice in the mekong delta given its innovative features designed for a congested river delta such as improvement for livelihoods and sustainability the nvn project is mostly focusing on water management and food security issues in the areas livelihood of local people is still rather limited as shown in the resilience section the project has impacted unequally to different farmer groups such as negatively impacting livelihoods of people whose livelihoods have been based on fishery activities thong and james 2017 this may also lead to the loss of traditional fishing culture baran et al 2007 as well as local biodiversity in addition the dominant rice based livelihood still does not significantly improve the living conditions and incomes of farmers tran et al 2021 the design of the nvn system has some limitation in diversifying cropping system in the areas which limits farmers in adopting new crops that would be more suited to market driven agricultural product lines thus the water management should be incorporated with agricultural transformation and diversification to promote and ensure the livelihood sustainability of local farmers tran and weger 2017 dung et al 2018 tran et al 2019 binh et al 2021 effective land use planning could be one of the key solutions to link water management with livelihood sustainability quan et al 2020 4 conclusions assessing improved resilience of agriculture development under high risk and uncertainty is very challenging in this study based on the grounded theory approach we presented a novel 4r framework reform result resilience and return for the resilience assessment of four dike based innovative water management schemes for rice crop production development over the three decades in an giang one of the upper floodplain provinces of the vietnamese mekong delta we have argued that a water management scheme decoupling with intensive rice production can strengthen the resilience of communities because this production and water management scheme requires less inputs brings more natural benefits and has less impacts to the ecosystems our findings have revealed that the more intensive crop patterns are also the less resilient systems regarding four rice models associated with four water management schemes the rice model of two crops in one year 2c1y is most optimal given its social economic and environmental sustainability while the intensive triple rice cropping pattern 3c1y is overall and in the long term more harmful and also undermines the benefits of floods other so called innovative water management schemes i e 8c3y and 5c2y have some improvements but they both seem only to be temporary measures our findings have implied a need to support agricultural transformation for example from rice intensification to less intensive or flood based farming systems to improve agricultural sustainability and resilience in addition this study assessed the resilience of farming systems and the associated communities based on the proposed criteria capitals the resilience of each farming system or community to specific stressors flooding change of upstream water or fluctuation of market drivers would be different further works could continue to explore this framework for other crops at different places and scales across the floodplains of the mekong delta and for specific climatic and non climatic stressors these will more clearly delineate their relationships in enabling delta wide sustainability strategies and engaging institutional dimensions of governance to assess

9438,soil carbon is a key component of ecosystem functions and is crucial to global climate conservation and crop productivity saline water irrigation can maintain crop yield inmost world regions of freshwater shortage however saline water irrigation may also induce soil salt accumulation which would result in the change of soil physical or chemical properties saline water irrigation s effect on soil organic carbon soc and soil inorganic carbon sic contents is of little concern in this study we irrigated soil with 1 g l 1 4 g l 1 and 8 g l 1 saline water in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system after 14 years of irrigation we sampled soils in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system and analyzed soil water soil salt soc and sic contents the results showed that compared with 1 g l 1 water irrigation 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation significantly increased soil water and salt contents moreover 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation significantly decreased soc and sic contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer p 0 05 and mainly decreased soc content in 1 mm aggregates and wheat derived soc content in bulk soil in comparison 4 g l 1 saline water had no significant effect on soil water soil salt soc and sic contents these results indicated that a high concentration of saline water irrigation is harmful for soil carbon sequestration while a low concentration of saline water did not affect soil carbon sequestration thus using no more than 4 g l 1 saline water irrigation for 14 years can maintain soil carbon storage in the water shortage areas keywords saline water irrigation soil water salt content soil inorganic carbon soil organic carbon soil aggregate 1 introduction soil is the largest carbon pool in the terrestrial system approximately thrice the amount of carbon in living plants and twice the amount of carbon in the atmosphere schlesinger 1990 thus it is relatively hard to accumulate carbon by plant residue while the soil carbon decomposition may lead to marked changes in atmospheric co2 based on the carbon peak and carbon neutrality it is beneficial to sequestrate more carbon in the soil other than in the atmosphere wang et al 2021 according to the molecular structure soil carbon can be classified into soil organic carbon soc and soil inorganic carbon sic which amounts are estimated to be 1550 pg and 950 pg respectively lal 2004 sic is often ignored for quantifying the carbon storage in tropical subtropical and even temperate regions due to its low content in soil wu et al 2009 however sic content is five times as high as soc content in arid regions eswaran et al 2000 and sic change may be higher than soc xu et al 2021 zamanian and kuzyakov 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider sic content when estimating carbon storage e g mostly in arid and semi arid areas the isotopic technique is a powerful tool for investigating the influence of c3 and c4 vegetation on soc dynamics especially in single c3 and single c4 vegetation planting areas e g winter wheat and summer maize rotation systems dong et al 2018 2020 wang et al 2015a there is an understanding that soc can be further divided into different fractions e g physical fractions or chemical fractions although soc dynamics can be further investigated blair et al 1995 six et al 2000 for example the different aggregate fractions aim to isolate actively from intermediate and passive soc pools von l√ºtzow et al 2007 and soc in macro aggregate 0 25 mm is often more labile than in micro aggregate 0 25 mm six et al 2000 moreover the origin of soc is plant photosynthesis products which drive decomposition and soc formation and play the role of controlling the pump in the carbon cycle paul 2016 thus soc can also be divided into c3 and c4 derived soc according to the plant photosynthesis pathways saiz et al 2015 wynn and bird 2007 the freshwater shortage is common in arid and semi arid regions where using saline water irrigation in the field is an alternative practice for crop production mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 su et al 2021 however continuous saline water irrigation may result in the accumulation of soil salt and constraining crop growth baath et al 2017 cao et al 2016 and the salt accumulation or crop growth restriction is related to the saline water concentration tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 wang et al 2016 moreover the irrigation water with high salinity could significantly reduce the soc content chen et al 2019 panta et al 2018 however some studies showed that saline water irrigation had little effect on soc content mahdy 2011 su et al 2021 and the mechanisms that saline water irrigation effect on soc content are not clear on the other hand saline water irrigation must have changed the soil salt composition dou et al 2011 li et al 2019 and it may also further affect the sic content artiola et al 2009 however saline water irrigation has been studied minimally in our study winter wheat and summer maize were irrigated by 1 g l 1 control s1 4 g l 1 s4 and 8 g l 1 s8 from 2006 with the same quantity and 14 years later we sampled soils and analyzed the chemical and physical properties the objectives of this study were 1 long term saline water irrigation effect on soc and its physical and isotope composition 2 long term saline water irrigation on sic contents and 3 the mechanisms behind the saline water irrigation effect on soil carbon content then our hypotheses were 1 long term saline water irrigation could enhance soil salt content and reduce soil aggregate stability while the organic carbon as the binding agents of aggregate may be decomposed and 2 long term saline water irrigation supplied numerous ions such as na and cl which should affect the sic content 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was conducted at the experimental station of institute of dryland farming hebei academy of agriculture and forestry science 37 44 n 115 47 e located in the northeast of north china plain the station s average altitude is 21 m belonging to temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 8 c mean annual precipitation of 500 mm mean annual evaporation of 1785 mm and mean annual sunshine time of 2509 h the soil is classified as desalting loamy soil zhang et al 2020 at the beginning of the field experiment 2006 the content of soc was 7 42 g kg 1 the content of alkaline hydrolyzable nitrogen was 65 5 mg kg 1 the content of available phosphorus was 17 6 mg kg 1 and the content of available potassium was 134 mg kg 1 the soil salt content bulk density and field water capacity of 0 100 cm soil layer was 0 66 g kg 1 1 44 g cm 3 and 28 respectively a field technique for finding field capacity involves irrigating a test plot until the soil profile is saturated to a depth of about one meter then the plot is covered to prevent evaporation the soil moisture is measured each 24 h until the changes are very small at which point the soil moisture content is the estimate of field capacity the depth of groundwater level in the area is around 5 m the long term saline water irrigation experiment began in 2006 which included three treatments local deep freshwater irrigation 1 g l 1 4 g l 1 and 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation named as s1 s4 and s8 respectively each treatment is set with three repeated plots with an area of 57 square meters saline water was prepared by mixing deep freshwater with sea salt mainly nacl table 1 shows the salt composition electrical conductivity ec and sodium adsorption ratio sar

were done as described by bao bao 2005 the cropping system of the site is winter wheat and summer maize rotation and the management measures are consistent with the local practice the annual irrigation amount depends on the rainfall which is maintained between 180 and 300 mm and the fertilization amount is 180 kg n ha 1 276 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 120 kg k2o ha 1 2 2 soil sampling and soil water content after the winter wheat harvest in june of 2020 soil samples of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil layers were collected sampling was conducted in all three plots of each treatment at 5 randomly selected sites within each plot by a soil auger 3 5 cm diameter and then the soil samples in the same plot were mixed after winter wheat harvest where all the treatments have the same irrigation amount soil water content was measured immediately after sampling e g in june 2020 by the oven dry method e g 20 30 g of fresh soil was weighed and dried to a stable weight at 105 c the remaining soil samples were air dried and stored for further analysis after manually removing visible matters e g plant roots soil fauna etc 2 3 soil ph and electrical conductivity ec ten grams of the sieved soil samples 2 mm were mixed with 50 ml of co2 free distilled water and the mixture has oscillated for 30 min the ph of the filtrate was determined with the fe28 precision ph meter mettler toledo switzerland and ec was determined with the fe38 conductivity meter mettler toledo switzerland 2 4 soil soluble salt content and its composition extracts solutions of soil samples were obtained by adding soil samples to co2 free deionized water at 1 5 ratio w v shaking at 160 rpm for 24 h centrifuging at 3500 rpm for 15 min and filtering through 0 45 ¬µm membrane for the measurement of water dissolved salt content xiao et al 2020 soil water dissolved salt concentrations were measured for example co3 2 and hco3 by double indicator titration method cl by silver nitrate agno3 titration method so4 2 by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta complexometric titration method ca2 and mg2 by edta titration method and na and k by flame photometry the detailed methods of ions concentration measurement were described by bao bao 2005 the total dissolved salt tds content is the sum of the eight ions concentrations 2 5 soil inorganic carbon sic content the sic content was measured by a carbonate analyzer ca 03 ousheng technology china one gram of caco3 powder was put into the reaction chamber and sufficient hcl at 1 1 was added into the chamber which was closed immediately followed by mixing of hcl and caco3 the pressure data were read after caco3 was totally depleted soil samples from the different concentration of saline water irrigation were analyzed according to the same method and finally calculating the caco3 content in the soil by the pressure data the sic was calculated after multiplying caco3 content by 0 12 dong et al 2019 2 6 soil water stable aggregate and the

to compare the mean treatment values at 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 saline water irrigation effect on soil water contents after wheat harvest in june 2020 soil water content was 6 02 w w at 0 20 cm soil layer by freshwater irrigation s1 and it gradually increased to 17 87 w w as the soil depth reached 100 cm fig 1 saline water irrigation with the soil water content of 8 g l 1 nacl s8 was significantly higher than both s1 and s4 at 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers p 0 01 while the s8 soil water content was only significantly higher than s1 at 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil layers p 0 05 meanwhile there was no significant difference between s1 and s4 soil water contents 3 2 saline water irrigation effect on soil ec ph and salt composition the soil electrical conductivities were 0 52 and 0 61 ms cm 1 at 0 20 cm soil layer in s1 and s4 treatments respectively fig 2 however the s8 treatment in ec was 2 27 ms cm 1 which was significantly higher than both s1 and s4 p 0 01 and these trends were the same at 20 40 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil layers at 40 60 cm soil layer the soil ec increased through rising saline water concentration and the three ec values significantly differed from each other p 0 01 fig 2 the soil ph value was between 8 01 and 8 34 although there were statistical differences the changes were relatively small table 2 soil salt was dominated by nacl which accounted for 50 2 53 5 and 71 9 in s1 s4 and s8 respectively saline water irrigation with 8 g l 1 nacl significantly increased soil na k mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 and no3 p 0 001 table 3 the soil total dissolved salt contents were 1 59 g kg 1 by s1 while s8 significantly enlarged it by 3 92 times table 3 3 3 saline water irrigation effect on sic content the content of sic was 7 48 g kg 1 at 0 20 cm soil layer by 1 g l 1 irrigation while it gradually increased to 14 62 g kg 1 at 60 80 cm fig 3 the s4 and s8 treatments reduced sic contents by 15 1 and 20 5 at 0 20 cm layer respectively and there was a significant difference between s1 and s8 p 0 05 however the sic content differences in the subsoil were not significant 3 4 soil aggregate associated organic carbon contents and isotopic characteristics with the increase of irrigation water concentration the proportion of soil aggregate 1 mm decreased and s8 significantly reduced the proportion of soil aggregate 1 mm by 64 8 p 0 05 table 4 there was no significant difference in the organic carbon concentration of soil aggregates within different sizes and thus s8 significantly decreased soc content by 63 8 in 1 mm aggregate compared with s1 moreover the soc concentration decreased with the reduction of aggregate particle size from 10 35 g kg 1 in 1 mm aggregates to 6 61 g kg 1 in 0 053 mm aggregates the aggregate associated organic carbon Œ¥13c values ranged from 21 57 to 20 65 and only 0 053 mm aggregate associated organic carbon Œ¥13c value in s8 was significantly higher than that in s1 p 0 01 the contents of soc under 1 g l 1 irrigation and 4 g l 1 solution were 7 80 and 8 28 g kg 1 respectively which could be further separated into 3 67 and 3 90 g kg 1 maize derived soc and 4 13 and 4 38 kg 1 wheat derived soc by soc sources maize or wheat derived soc concentration was 3 04 5 99 g kg 1 aggregate and different saline water irrigation did not affect maize or wheat derived soc concentration in each soil aggregate however considering the proportion of aggregate s8 significantly decreased maize and wheat derived soc amount in 1 mm soil aggregate by 63 3 and 64 3 p 0 05 respectively the highest concentration of saline water irrigation s8 significantly decreased wheat derived soc content while it did not affect maize derived soc content which resulted in bulk soil soc content in s8 being considerably lower than that in s4 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 saline water irrigation effect on soil water and salt content saline water irrigation can result in higher crop yields than rain fed soil and it is common in arid and semi arid areas pereira et al 2002 yuan et al 2019 however the direct result of saline water irrigation is soil salt accumulation due to the addition of salt ions which would further affect soil water movement and plant growth wan et al 2010 wang et al 2015b in our recent study saline water irrigation with 8 g l 1 nacl increased soil water content and soil salt content at all soil layers while s4 had no significant effect on soil water and salt contents except for the salt content in 40 60 cm depth figs 1 2 noticeably saline water contains salt ions which must enhance soil salt content as the concentration increases leone et al 2007 yuan et al 2019 even though s4 increased soil salt content and ec by 30 8 and 17 2 in the 0 20 cm layer respectively table 3 fig 2 there was no statistically significant difference it may own to the low saline water concentration wang et al 2015b many studies have suggested that saline water concentration could increase soil water content min et al 2016 su et al 2021 wang et al 2016 which was due to the reducing uptake of crops in saline conditions and resulting in less water evapotranspiration malash et al 2008 romero aranda et al 2001 on the other hand higher salt concentration may induce lower evaporation rates in soil due to the decrease in osmotic potential or the formation of a salt crust near the surface fujimaki et al 2006 4 2 saline water irrigation effect on sic the sic content in arid and semi arid is considerable and it has been becoming more important than previously thought zamanian and kuzyakov 2019 in the present study sic content was 5 95 7 48 g kg 1 at 0 20 cm soil layer very close to the soc content 6 65 8 28 g kg 1 and sic content increased as the soil depth improved fig 3 table 4 many factors can influence sic content for example soil type soil ph soil moisture and co2 partial pressure bai et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 however very few studies have focused on the sic content s saline water irrigation effect s8 significantly decreased sic content at 0 20 cm soil layer compared with s1 which was caused by the salt effect carbonate solubility is higher in nacl solution than in freshwater and the solubility increases as the nacl solution concentration increases facq et al 2016 singurindy et al 2004 4 3 saline water irrigation effect on soc saline water irrigation supplies numerous na and cl to the soil which would disperse the soil colloidal particles and decrease soil aggregate stability diaz et al 1994 wang et al 2022 according to the soil aggregate turnover theory new micro aggregates were formed after the organic agents decomposing within the macro aggregates six et al 2000 1998 in this study s8 significantly decreased 1 mm soil aggregate proportion from 16 28 to 5 38 compared with s1 table 4 previous studies have shown that saline water irrigation could decrease soc content chen et al 2019 wang et al 2022 however the reduction of soc fraction is not well investigated we separated soil aggregates according to the size and measured soc concentration in different soil aggregate sizes the results showed no difference in the aggregate associated organic carbon concentration in each aggregate table 4 s8 decreased 1 mm soil aggregate proportion which would consequently increase the ratio of smaller size of soil aggregates table 4 however s8 soc concentrations in 0 25 1 0 053 0 25 and 0 053 mm were lowest and thus s8 did not increase soc content in the 0 25 1 0 053 0 25 and 0 053 mm aggregates in another aspect soc in this study is comprised of wheat and maize derived soc wheat derived soc is higher than maize derived soc which is consistent with other studies dong et al 2018 2020 wang et al 2015a saline water irrigation decreased 1 mm aggregate proportion however it had no significant effect on the Œ¥13c value of soc in this aggregate size thus saline water irrigation decreased both wheat and maize derived soc contents in 1 mm soil aggregate furthermore s8 significant affected wheat derived soc content while it had no significant effect on maize derived soc content there are two reasons to explain this 1 wheat derived soc contributed more than maize derived soc in the bulk soil or the aggregates 2 s8 decreased wheat derived soc content by 0 72 0 97 g kg 1 accounting for 17 4 22 1 of wheat derived soc while it decreased maize derived soc content by 0 43 0 66 g kg 1 accounting for 11 7 16 9 of maize derived soc content in total the higher concentration of saline water irrigation for 14 years significantly decreased total soil carbon content by 2 68 g kg 1 compared with s1 p 0 05 accounting for 17 5 of total carbon content of the soil 5 conclusions irrigation with a high salt solution concentration 8 g l 1 can significantly increase soil water and salt contents in 0 100 cm soil layers however 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation can decrease sic content by increasing carbonate dissolution in the high salt solution meanwhile 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation can reduce the macro aggregate proportion and drop soc content and it mainly decreases wheat derived soc content other than maize derived soc content in total this study indicated that saline water irrigation with no more than 4 g l 1 salt solution had no significant effect on soil carbon content in the future more attention should be paid to the long term effects of different concentrations of salt water irrigation on soil carbon storage in different salt content soils combined with local rainfall leaching

9438,soil carbon is a key component of ecosystem functions and is crucial to global climate conservation and crop productivity saline water irrigation can maintain crop yield inmost world regions of freshwater shortage however saline water irrigation may also induce soil salt accumulation which would result in the change of soil physical or chemical properties saline water irrigation s effect on soil organic carbon soc and soil inorganic carbon sic contents is of little concern in this study we irrigated soil with 1 g l 1 4 g l 1 and 8 g l 1 saline water in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system after 14 years of irrigation we sampled soils in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system and analyzed soil water soil salt soc and sic contents the results showed that compared with 1 g l 1 water irrigation 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation significantly increased soil water and salt contents moreover 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation significantly decreased soc and sic contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer p 0 05 and mainly decreased soc content in 1 mm aggregates and wheat derived soc content in bulk soil in comparison 4 g l 1 saline water had no significant effect on soil water soil salt soc and sic contents these results indicated that a high concentration of saline water irrigation is harmful for soil carbon sequestration while a low concentration of saline water did not affect soil carbon sequestration thus using no more than 4 g l 1 saline water irrigation for 14 years can maintain soil carbon storage in the water shortage areas keywords saline water irrigation soil water salt content soil inorganic carbon soil organic carbon soil aggregate 1 introduction soil is the largest carbon pool in the terrestrial system approximately thrice the amount of carbon in living plants and twice the amount of carbon in the atmosphere schlesinger 1990 thus it is relatively hard to accumulate carbon by plant residue while the soil carbon decomposition may lead to marked changes in atmospheric co2 based on the carbon peak and carbon neutrality it is beneficial to sequestrate more carbon in the soil other than in the atmosphere wang et al 2021 according to the molecular structure soil carbon can be classified into soil organic carbon soc and soil inorganic carbon sic which amounts are estimated to be 1550 pg and 950 pg respectively lal 2004 sic is often ignored for quantifying the carbon storage in tropical subtropical and even temperate regions due to its low content in soil wu et al 2009 however sic content is five times as high as soc content in arid regions eswaran et al 2000 and sic change may be higher than soc xu et al 2021 zamanian and kuzyakov 2019 therefore it is necessary to consider sic content when estimating carbon storage e g mostly in arid and semi arid areas the isotopic technique is a powerful tool for investigating the influence of c3 and c4 vegetation on soc dynamics especially in single c3 and single c4 vegetation planting areas e g winter wheat and summer maize rotation systems dong et al 2018 2020 wang et al 2015a there is an understanding that soc can be further divided into different fractions e g physical fractions or chemical fractions although soc dynamics can be further investigated blair et al 1995 six et al 2000 for example the different aggregate fractions aim to isolate actively from intermediate and passive soc pools von l√ºtzow et al 2007 and soc in macro aggregate 0 25 mm is often more labile than in micro aggregate 0 25 mm six et al 2000 moreover the origin of soc is plant photosynthesis products which drive decomposition and soc formation and play the role of controlling the pump in the carbon cycle paul 2016 thus soc can also be divided into c3 and c4 derived soc according to the plant photosynthesis pathways saiz et al 2015 wynn and bird 2007 the freshwater shortage is common in arid and semi arid regions where using saline water irrigation in the field is an alternative practice for crop production mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 su et al 2021 however continuous saline water irrigation may result in the accumulation of soil salt and constraining crop growth baath et al 2017 cao et al 2016 and the salt accumulation or crop growth restriction is related to the saline water concentration tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 wang et al 2016 moreover the irrigation water with high salinity could significantly reduce the soc content chen et al 2019 panta et al 2018 however some studies showed that saline water irrigation had little effect on soc content mahdy 2011 su et al 2021 and the mechanisms that saline water irrigation effect on soc content are not clear on the other hand saline water irrigation must have changed the soil salt composition dou et al 2011 li et al 2019 and it may also further affect the sic content artiola et al 2009 however saline water irrigation has been studied minimally in our study winter wheat and summer maize were irrigated by 1 g l 1 control s1 4 g l 1 s4 and 8 g l 1 s8 from 2006 with the same quantity and 14 years later we sampled soils and analyzed the chemical and physical properties the objectives of this study were 1 long term saline water irrigation effect on soc and its physical and isotope composition 2 long term saline water irrigation on sic contents and 3 the mechanisms behind the saline water irrigation effect on soil carbon content then our hypotheses were 1 long term saline water irrigation could enhance soil salt content and reduce soil aggregate stability while the organic carbon as the binding agents of aggregate may be decomposed and 2 long term saline water irrigation supplied numerous ions such as na and cl which should affect the sic content 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was conducted at the experimental station of institute of dryland farming hebei academy of agriculture and forestry science 37 44 n 115 47 e located in the northeast of north china plain the station s average altitude is 21 m belonging to temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 8 c mean annual precipitation of 500 mm mean annual evaporation of 1785 mm and mean annual sunshine time of 2509 h the soil is classified as desalting loamy soil zhang et al 2020 at the beginning of the field experiment 2006 the content of soc was 7 42 g kg 1 the content of alkaline hydrolyzable nitrogen was 65 5 mg kg 1 the content of available phosphorus was 17 6 mg kg 1 and the content of available potassium was 134 mg kg 1 the soil salt content bulk density and field water capacity of 0 100 cm soil layer was 0 66 g kg 1 1 44 g cm 3 and 28 respectively a field technique for finding field capacity involves irrigating a test plot until the soil profile is saturated to a depth of about one meter then the plot is covered to prevent evaporation the soil moisture is measured each 24 h until the changes are very small at which point the soil moisture content is the estimate of field capacity the depth of groundwater level in the area is around 5 m the long term saline water irrigation experiment began in 2006 which included three treatments local deep freshwater irrigation 1 g l 1 4 g l 1 and 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation named as s1 s4 and s8 respectively each treatment is set with three repeated plots with

randomly selected sites within each plot by a soil auger 3 5 cm diameter and then the soil samples in the same plot were mixed after winter wheat harvest where all the treatments have the same irrigation amount soil water content was measured immediately after sampling e g in june 2020 by the oven dry method e g 20 30 g of fresh soil was weighed and dried to a stable weight at 105 c the remaining soil samples were air dried and stored for further analysis after manually removing visible matters e g plant roots soil fauna etc 2 3 soil ph and electrical conductivity ec ten grams of the sieved soil samples 2 mm were mixed with 50 ml of co2 free distilled water and the mixture has oscillated for 30 min the ph of the filtrate was determined with the fe28 precision ph meter mettler toledo switzerland and ec was determined with the fe38 conductivity meter mettler toledo switzerland 2 4 soil soluble salt content and its composition extracts solutions of soil samples were obtained by adding soil samples to co2 free deionized water at 1 5 ratio w v shaking at 160 rpm for 24 h centrifuging at 3500 rpm for 15 min and filtering through 0 45 ¬µm membrane for the measurement of water dissolved salt content xiao et al 2020 soil water dissolved salt concentrations were measured for example co3 2 and hco3 by double indicator titration method cl by silver nitrate agno3 titration method so4 2 by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta complexometric titration method ca2 and mg2 by edta titration method and na and k by flame photometry the detailed methods of ions concentration measurement were described by bao bao 2005 the total dissolved salt tds content is the sum of the eight ions concentrations 2 5 soil inorganic carbon sic content the sic content was measured by a carbonate analyzer ca 03 ousheng technology china one gram of caco3 powder was put into the reaction chamber and sufficient hcl at 1 1 was added into the chamber which was closed immediately followed by mixing of hcl and caco3 the pressure data were read after caco3 was totally depleted soil samples from the different concentration of saline water irrigation were analyzed according to the same method and finally calculating the caco3 content in the soil by the pressure data the sic was calculated after multiplying caco3 content by 0 12 dong et al 2019 2 6 soil water stable aggregate and the associated organic carbon and Œ¥13c 2 6 1 soil water stable aggregate distribution the wet sieving method was used to separate different sizes of soil water stable aggregates elliott 1986 an 80 00 g

soil in suspension liquid was regarded as aggregates smaller than 0 053 mm in diameter all separated subsamples were placed in an aluminum specimen box with known weight and left to stand for 24 h we then discarded the liquid supernatant and dried the subsamples at 60 c for 24 h after which the subsamples were weighed 2 6 2 soil aggregate associated organic carbon content the soil aggregate

reduction of soc fraction is not well investigated we separated soil aggregates according to the size and measured soc concentration in different soil aggregate sizes the results showed no difference in the aggregate associated organic carbon concentration in each aggregate table 4 s8 decreased 1 mm soil aggregate proportion which would consequently increase the ratio of smaller size of soil aggregates table 4 however s8 soc concentrations in 0 25 1 0 053 0 25 and 0 053 mm were lowest and thus s8 did not increase soc content in the 0 25 1 0 053 0 25 and 0 053 mm aggregates in another aspect soc in this study is comprised of wheat and maize derived soc wheat derived soc is higher than maize derived soc which is consistent with other studies dong et al 2018 2020 wang et al 2015a saline water irrigation decreased 1 mm aggregate proportion however it had no significant effect on the Œ¥13c value of soc in this aggregate size thus saline water irrigation decreased both wheat and maize derived soc contents in 1 mm soil aggregate furthermore s8 significant affected wheat derived soc content while it had no significant effect on maize derived soc content there are two reasons to explain this 1 wheat derived soc contributed more than maize derived soc in the bulk soil or the aggregates 2 s8 decreased wheat derived soc content by 0 72 0 97 g kg 1 accounting for 17 4 22 1 of wheat derived soc while it decreased maize derived soc content by 0 43 0 66 g kg 1 accounting for 11 7 16 9 of maize derived soc content in total the higher concentration of saline water irrigation for 14 years significantly decreased total soil carbon content by 2 68 g kg 1 compared with s1 p 0 05 accounting for 17 5 of total carbon content of the soil 5 conclusions irrigation with a high salt solution concentration 8 g l 1 can significantly increase soil water and salt contents in 0 100 cm soil layers however 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation can decrease sic content by increasing carbonate dissolution in the high salt solution meanwhile 8 g l 1 saline water irrigation can reduce the macro aggregate proportion and drop soc content and it mainly decreases wheat derived soc content other than maize derived soc content in total this study indicated that saline water irrigation with no more than 4 g l 1 salt solution had no significant effect on soil carbon content in the future more attention should be paid to the long term effects of different concentrations of salt water irrigation on soil carbon storage in different salt content soils combined with local rainfall leaching surface soil salt quantitative studies on how long continuous irrigation with different concentrations of salt water will affect soil carbon storage declaration of competing interest the authors

9439,the rapid population growth and economic development climate change and irregular rainfall will inevitably intensify the competition of water resources resulting in the reduction of agricultural irrigation water in recent years subsurface drip irrigation ssdi as an efficient water saving irrigation technology has been widely used in crop production but its effects on crop yield irrigation water productivity iwp and water productivity wp vary with field managements climatic conditions and soil properties here a global meta analysis of 984 comparisons from 109 publications was carried out to systematically and quantitatively analyze the responses of yield iwp and wp of crops vegetables and fruits to ssdi the results showed that ssdi significantly increased yield iwp and wp by 5 39 6 75 and 3 97 relative to surface drip irrigation sdi respectively the largest percentage increase in yield was observed in crops 6 42 followed by vegetables 5 29 and fruits 3 37 ssdi performed best when crops vegetables and fruits were planted in the open field under film mulching in arid regions 200 mm and in regions with mean annual temperature 12 besides the emitter spacing 25 cm emitter discharge rate of 2 5 3 5 l h 1 and buried depth of drip pipe 10 cm were beneficial to obtaining higher increases of yield iwp and wp in addition yield was significantly affected by fertilization rate and the maximum percentage increase in yield was obtained with 100 200 kg n ha 1 50 kg p ha 1 and 100 kg k ha 1 yield iwp and wp were also significantly affected by soil factors the percentage changes in yield and iwp in soils with higher bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 and in acid soils ph 7 were significantly higher than those in soils with lower bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 and in neural and alkaline soils ph 7 in conclusion ssdi can improve yield and wp but the application of ssdi should be site specific keywords subsurface drip irrigation yield water productivity meta analysis 1 introduction water shortage is a global problem it is estimated that the global population will be about 9 billion to 10 billion by 2050 and more water will be thus needed fao 2021 cheng et al 2021a the irrigated agriculture is the largest sector of consumptive water use intrigliolo et al 2013 wang et al 2021a how to use the water resources in a sustainable way to ensure food security is a major challenge for present and future generations therefore increasing water productivity through technologies that produce more foods by per drop water is essential for the sustainable agricultural development fao 2021 drip irrigation is recognized as a high efficient water saving irrigation technology around the world which has been widely used in arid and semi arid areas it can not only improve crop yield and quality but also increase the water and fertilizer productivity wang et al 2015 2018 2021b subsurface drip irrigation ssdi is an irrigation technology developed from the surface drip irrigation sdi it directly pours water and liquid fertilizer into the root zone for the growth of crops through the irrigation network system in the plough layer in recent years many researchers have studied the effects of ssdi on crop growth the results showed that ssdi effectively reduced deep seepage soil evaporation and weeds growth around the crop and further improved crop water productivity wp however the effects of ssdi on crop wp varied with field managements climatic conditions and soil properties badr et al 2010 douh et al 2013 wang et al 2017 √ßolak et al 2018 yao et al 2021 besides the impact of ssdi on yield was controversial among studies machado et al 2003 dogan et al 2008 hassanli et al 2010 al mansor et al 2015 √ßolak et al 2018 pisciotta et al 2018 soliman et al 2020 piri and naserin 2020 a systematic and quantitative analysis of the responses of yield and wp of various crops to ssdi on a global scale is missing meta analysis is a quantitative and comprehensive statistical method to study the test results with the same research purpose and systematically explain a group of complex trait factors that may affect the dependent variables to obtain general results jiang et al 2019 cheng et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 in recent years it has been well applied in agricultural studies for instance li et al 2018 quantified the influences of plastic and straw mulching on yield and wp of potato in china with meta analysis lu et al 2019 yu et al 2020 and cheng et al 2021b applied meta analysis to study the effects of deficit irrigation on yield and wp of tomato wheat and cotton relative to full irrigation in addition meta analysis was also used to analyze the impact of irrigation zheng et al 2019 drip fertigation li et al 2021a alternate partial root zone irrigation cheng et

yield quality wp and greenhouse gas emissions therefore a global meta analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of ssdi on the yield iwp and wp of crops vegetables and fruits compared to sdi and identify the optimal application conditions field managements climatic conditions and soil properties that increase yield iwp and wp under ssdi systems so as to further improve our understanding of the responses of crops to ssdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection google scholar https xueshu soogle top elsevier science direct https www sciencedirect com search china national knowledge

for wp and south america 0 2 for yield 0 for iwp and wp fig 2 the frequency distributions of effect sizes for yield iwp and wp were found to follow gaussian normal distributions indicating that the datasets were homogeneous fig 3 shan and yan 2013 3 2 agricultural species planting conditions and patterns generally ssdi significantly increased the yield iwp and wp of crops vegetables and fruits

largest percentage increase in yield was observed in crops 6 42 while the smallest percentage increase in yield occurred in fruits 3 37 fig 5a the largest percentage increases in iwp and wp were found in vegetables 7 20 and fruits 26 06 respectively however the difference in iwp among agricultural species was not significant fig 5b c ssdi also significantly increased yield and wp no matter crops vegetables and fruits were planted in the open field or greenhouse fig 5d and f but the difference in iwp between ssdi and sdi was not significant when the agricultural species were planted in the greenhouse because the 95 confidence internal overlapped zero fig 5e the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp 7 19 10 09 and 8 55 of crops vegetables and fruits planted in the open field were significantly larger than those in the greenhouse the overall mean of planting patterns was slightly lower than that of planting conditions but ssdi still had significantly positive effects in increasing yield iwp and wp with the percentage increases by 5 40 6 72 and 3 77 respectively fig 5g h and i when the agricultural species were planted under film mulching the percentage increases in yield and wp were significantly greater than those without film mulching as for iwp although a greater iwp was observed under film mulching there was no significant difference between the two planting patterns fig 5h 3 3 irrigation and fertilization factors 1 irrigation factors overall ssdi increased yield iwp and wp compared to sdi regardless of drip irrigation parameters fig 6 with the increase of emitter spacing the percentage increases in yield and iwp decreased when the emitter spacing was 45 cm the difference in iwp between ssdi and sdi was not significant fig 6b however when the emitter spacing was less than 25 cm there were notable percentage increases in yield 18 75 iwp 17 89 and wp 20 15 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp increased first and then decreased with the increase of emitter discharge rate fig 6d e and f and there were quadratic parabola relationships between the effect size of yield iwp and wp and emitter discharge rate fig 7d e and f when the emitter discharge rate was 2 5 3 5 l h 1 ssdi improved yield iwp and wp most 15 47 95 ci 13 05 17 94 20 47 95 ci 17 33 23 70 and 29 21 95 ci 24 83 33 75 respectively when the irrigation amount of ssdi was higher 100 or lower 100 than that of sdi there was no significant difference in yield and wp between the two irrigation methods fig 6g i when the irrigation amount was the same 100 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 5 45 95 ci 5 14 5 77 7 39 95 ci 6 73 8 04 and 4 41 95 ci 3 59 5 24 respectively fig 6g h and i the changes of buried depth group were opposite to emitter discharge group the percentage changes in yield decreased first and then increased with the increase of buried depth of drip pipe for yield and iwp the buried depth 10 cm produced the largest percentage increases 14 60 and 10 90 respectively fig 6j k and the buried depth of 20 30 cm showed the least increases 1 85 and 1 22 respectively however wp was increased most by ssdi when the buried depth was 20 30 cm and the difference in wp between the buried depth of 20 30 cm and 10 cm was not significant fig 6i a quadratic parabola relationship existed between the effect size lnr of yield iwp and wp and buried depth of drip pipe fig 7g h and i overall the percentage changes of overall mean in yield iwp and wp was 5 60 95 ci 5 26 5 95 6 00 95 ci 5 37 6 62 and 2 86 95 ci 2 09 3 64 fig 6j k and l respectively 2 fertilization factors compared with sdi ssdi significantly increased yield iwp and wp under different n fertilization rates with percentage increases of 8 22 6 92 and 2 00 across 308 268 and 113 comparisons respectively the maximum yield increase occurred when n fertilization rate was 100 200 kg ha 1 10 20 followed by 300 kg ha 1 7 81 200 300 kg ha 1 6 54 and 100 kg ha 1 3 55 moreover yield under the n fertilization rate of 100 200 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under the other three fertilization rates fig 8a the maximum percentage increase in iwp occurred when n fertilization rate was 300 kg ha 1 15 77 followed by 200 300 kg ha 1 15 10 100 200 kg ha 1 5 86 and 100 kg ha 1 3 47 fig 8b as for wp the maximum value occurred when n fertilization rate was 300 kg ha 1 14 53 followed by 200 300 kg ha 1 6 15 100 kg ha 1 2 40 and 100 200 kg ha 1 0 91 fig 8c unlike n fertilization rates the percentage changes of yield decreased with the increase of p and k fertilization rates fig 8d g however the changes of wp decreased first and then increased with the increase of p fertilization rate fig 8f as for iwp the percentage changes increased first and then decreased with the increase of p fertilization rate and increased with the increase of k fertilization rate fig 8e h when p fertilization rate was 50 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 14 25 13 30 and 9 48 respectively when p fertilization rate was 50 100 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 8 35 20 08 and 2 71 respectively when p fertilization rate was 100 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 5 52 5 10 and 5 09 respectively fig 8d e and f besides when the p fertilization rates were 50 100 kg ha 1 and 100 kg ha 1 the difference in wp between ssdi and sdi was not significant when the k fertilization rate was 100 kg ha 1 the yield was increased most by ssdi and the iwp and wp were increased least when the k fertilization interval was 100 200 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 11 40 10 00 and 7 02 respectively when the k fertilization rate was 200 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 8 95 14 38 and 12 81 respectively fig 8g h and i 3 4 soil factors overall ssdi had a positively effect on yield iwp and wp regardless of soil bulk densities the percentage increases were greater in soils with higher bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 7 44 for yield 6 73 for iwp and 10 50 for wp respectively when the soil bulk density was 1 4 g cm 3 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 3 07 1 29 and 2 10 respectively fig 9a b and c in both acidic and alkaline soils ssdi significantly increased yield and iwp compared with sdi fig 9d and e the percentage increases of yield and iwp in soils with ph 7 were 15 05 95 ci 12 37 17 79 and 26 89 95 ci 23 23 30 66 respectively which were significantly higher than those in soils with ph 7 10 51 95 ci 9 90 11 12 and 18 02 95 ci 16 59 19 47 fig 9d e however wp in soils with ph 7 was decreased by ssdi with a percentage changes of 33 90 95 ci 38 77 to 28 63 which was significantly lower than that in soils with ph 7 9 31 95 ci 7 40 11 25 fig 9f overall the mean effect size of ssdi on yield iwp and wp was increased by 10 74 95 ci 10 15 11 33 19 29 95 ci 17 96 20 64 and 6 58 95 ci 4 77 8 42 respectively fig 9d e and f in the soil texture group the overall mean of yield iwp and wp were 5 41 6 71 and 3 76 respectively the maximum percentage increase of yield occurred in fine soils fig 9g however the highest percentage changes in iwp and wp were obtained in medium soils fig 9g h and i when the soil texture was fine soil the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were 11 01 95 ci 10 06 11 97 3 13 95 ci 0 98 5 33 and 3 90 95 ci 1 86 5 98 respectively for the medium soil the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were 0 51 95 ci 0 03 1 00 9 68 95 ci 8 22 11 17 and 12 32 95 ci 10 35 14 32 respectively for the coarse soil the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were 7 31 95 ci 6 92 7 71 6 35 95 ci 5 64 7 06 and 1 65 95 ci 0 75 2 56 respectively fig 9g h and i 3 5 climate factors it can be seen from the overall mean ssdi significantly increased yield and wp compared with sdi in both the annual average precipitation and temperature groups fig 10a c d and f however in semi arid and semi humid regions there was no difference in iwp between the two irrigation methods due to the 95 confidence internal overlapped zero fig 10b generally the percentage changes of yield iwp and wp decreased first and then increased with the increase of annual average precipitation the maximum yield iwp and wp increase occurred in the humid region 8 86 8 63 and 30 66 respectively but the differences between humid and arid regions 6 17 8 00 and 24 92 respectively were not significant fig 10a b and c in semi arid regions the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were 5 42 95 ci 3 60 7 28 1 28 95 ci 3 68 to 1 19 and 7 84 95 ci 4 20 11 60 respectively in semi humid regions ssdi increased yield iwp and wp by 1 81 95 ci 1 12 2 50 0 03 95 ci 1 01 to 0 95 and 2 28 95 ci 1 36 3 21 respectively fig 10a b and c the percentage changes of yield and iwp were positively correlated to annual average temperature the percentage increases of yield and iwp in regions with annual average temperature 12 were 4 94 95 ci 3 46 6 44 and 4 18 95 ci 1 16 7 30 respectively which were significantly lower than those with annual average temperature 12 14 69 95 ci 11 50 17 97 and 10 41 95 ci 7 14 13 78 fig 10d e as for wp there was no significant difference between annual average temperature 12 15 80 95 ci 13 05 18 62 and 12 15 65 95 ci 12 18 19 22 fig 10f overall the mean effect sizes of ssdi on yield iwp and wp were increased by 6 84 95 ci 5 49 8 20 7 19 95 ci 4 96 9 47 and 15 74 95 ci 13 58 17 95 respectively fig 10d e and f 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural specie planting condition and pattern effects on yield iwp and wp compared with sdi ssdi significantly increased crops vegetables and fruits yield iwp and wp through the comparison of dataset from 109 publications ssdi and sdi show different locations and sizes of wetting body and water state liu and li 2009 liu et al 2021 compared with sdi ssdi maintained a relatively drier soil surface and a favorable water condition in the root zone so as to reduce the surface water losses and promote the growth of roots which improved the absorption and utilization of water and nutrients and further improved yield iwp and wp kong et al 2010 mart√≠nez and reca 2014 mali et al 2017 yang et al 2019 piri and naserin 2020 hamad et al 2021 besides agricultural species groups responded differently to ssdi the increase of fruit yield was smallest which was significantly lower than those of crops and vegetables this may be due to that fruit trees had deeper and wider root systems than vegetables and crops resulting in small differences in their responses to sdi and ssdi vegetables and crops are shallow rooted crops and are more sensitive to water changes jefferies and heilbronn 1991 liao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 compared with crops vegetables and fruits planted in the greenhouse the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were higher when they were planted in the open field the reason for this may be that the high temperature and humidity in the greenhouse weakened the difference between the two irrigation methods plastic film mulching can reduce soil water evaporation increase soil temperature and maintain higher soil moisture and further increase yield compared with non plastic film mulching fan et al 2014 wang et al 2020c yu et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 the percentage changes of crops vegetables and fruits yield and wp under film mulching were larger than those without film mulching 4 2 irrigation and fertilization factors effects on yield iwp and wp reasonable emitter spacing and discharge rate can effectively improve crop water productivity which are two important parameters of drip fertigation technology li 2006 ren et al 2017 li et al 2021b emitter spacing and discharge rate can affect crop growth yield and quality by affecting soil moisture uniformity and water infiltration process wang et al 2005 2010 2021d in this meta analysis with the increase of emitter spacing the percentage changes in yield and iwp decreased with the increase of emitter discharge rate the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp increased first and then decreased when the emitter spacing was less than 25 cm and emitter discharge rate was 2 5 3 5 l h 1 yield iwp and wp were increased more this may be because the width of wetting volume on both sides of the lateral was small when the emitter spacing was small and water mainly accumulated in the root zone el hafedh et al 2001 moreover previous studies have showed that there was a clear relationship between the shape of the wetting soil zone and the emitter discharge rate and the horizontal wetting area increased and the wetted soil depth decreased with the increase of emitter discharge rate khan et al 1996 beyond the root depth large emitter spacing too large or small discharge rate would result in a water loss besides when the irrigation amount of ssdi was higher 100 than that of sdi there was no significant difference in yield and wp between ssdi and sdi however when the irrigation amount was the same 100 ssdi significantly increased yield iwp and wp the reason for this difference may be that the sample size of 100 group was relatively small and only five studies showed that the irrigation amount of ssdi was higher than that of sdi among the 109 publications therefore the result needs to be further verified in the subsurface drip irrigation system the selection of drip pipe installation depth is the key patel and rajput 2007 li et al 2015 bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 vadar et al 2019 hamad et al 2021 irrigation depth determines the initial infiltration position of water and affects the range and content distribution of water in soils gu 2017 moreover different crops have different requirements for the depth of drip irrigation pipe under different soil property conditions some researchers have found that crop yields decreased as the buried depth of drip pipe increased marouelli and silva 2002 found the increase in the buried depth of drip pipe from 20 cm to 40 cm led to a 23 4 tomato yield reduction bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 also reported that green bean production was higher when drip pipes were located at 0 1 m than 0 2 m depth however patel and rajput 2009 showed that the onion yield and iwp increased first and then decreased as the drip pipe depth increased from 5 cm to 30 cm and the maximum onion yield was obtained at 10 cm depth mansour and gyuricza 2013 revealed that the potato yield increased with the increase of the buried depth of drip pipe from 15 cm to 30 cm yield and iwp were better improved when the drip pipe depth was 10 cm which meant that the drip irrigation pipe should be buried shallowly which was consistent with the finding of li et al 1996 when the buried depth of drip pipe was shallow the surface soil was wet and the moisture content was high however when the buried depth increased gradually the resistance of water to shallow layer also increased which gradually reduced the moisture content of surface soil when the buried depth exceeded a certain depth the moisture content of surface soil was low patel and rajput 2007 nutrients absorbed by crops mainly come from soil residues and additional fertilization generally within a certain range of fertilizer inputs crop yield increased with the increase of fertilizer applied but the yield decreased when the fertilization rate exceeded a certain threshold xing et al 2015 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 our study found the maximum yield increase occurred when n fertilization rate was 100 200 kg ha 1 the increase of yield decreased with the increase of p and k fertilization rates this may be due to that the advantage of ssdi was more obvious in the case of low fertilization rate and the yield of ssdi was significantly higher than that of sdi in the case of high fertilization rate the difference between the two irrigation methods was weakened due to the effect of soil fertility badr et al 2012 mali et al 2017 4 3 soil factors effects on yield iwp and wp soil bulk density had a direct effect on the infiltration of water and the infiltration capacity of soils decreased with the increase of soil bulk density li et al 2009 we found the increase of yield iwp and wp in soils with bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 was significantly higher than that for 1 4 g cm 3 this result could be explained by that soils with high soil bulk density were more compacted which inhibited the water from surface drip irrigation seeping into the root zone however ssdi could directly transport water to the root zone of crops which was more conducive to the absorption and utilization of water by roots and reduced soil evaporation the greater percentage increases in yield and iwp in soils with ph 7 can be attributed to that the alkaline soil increased ammonia volatilization resulting in a large amount of nitrogen loss carrijo et al 2017 du et al 2018 moreover alkaline soils usually have high salt content which has a negative impact on crop growth the maximum yield increase was obtained in fine soils followed by coarse soils and medium soils this was probably because the fine textured soils had higher clay content with poor soil aeration and the coarse soil owned higher sandy content with poor capacity of holding water and nutrients groffman and tiedje 1991 bollmann and conrad 2004 du et al 2018 cheng et al 2021b which was not conducive to surface drip irrigation and widen the gap between the two irrigation methods however the difference in yield between the two drip irrigation methods was small in medium soils on the contrary ssdi significantly increased wp compared with sdi in medium soils this may be due to the effective reduction of water consumption under ssdi in medium soils 4 4 climate factors effects on yield iwp and wp in this meta analysis we found that the increases of yield iwp and wp under ssdi in arid regions were higher than those in semi arid and semi humid regions the percentage increases in yield and iwp in regions with annual average temperature 12 were significantly greater than those with annual average temperature 12 the possible reason may be that the arid regions with annual average temperature 12 owned higher evaporation and ssdi effectively reduced the loss of surface water thereby providing more water for crop growth besides we also found the maximum yield iwp and wp increases under ssdi occurred in humid regions but the differences between humid and arid regions were not significant it may be related to that less rainfall occurred during the growing season despite of the high annual rainfall 4 5 limitations the responses of yield iwp and wp of crops vegetables and fruits under ssdi were evaluated in this meta analysis nevertheless other factors such as the frequency of drip irrigation and fertilization seasonal temperature and precipitation also had influences on the results future studies need to consider more factors affecting the application of ssdi the data of yield iwp and wp were not sufficient for the irrigation proportion group 100 and soil ph 7 so the results need to be further verified besides we only considered the responses of crops vegetables and fruits under ssdi in this meta analysis in recent 20 years but the alfalfa and other grasses and studies before 2001 were not considered 5 conclusions a global meta analysis of the literature was conducted to investigate the responses of yield irrigation water productivity and water productivity to subsurface drip irrigation compared to surface drip irrigation overall subsurface drip irrigation significantly increased the yields of crops vegetables and fruits irrigation water productivity and water productivity subsurface drip irrigation performed best when the emitter spacing was less than 25 cm the emitter discharge rate varied 2 5 3 5 l h 1 and the buried depth of drip pipe was less than 10 cm the improvement of yield was significantly affected by fertilization rate soil and climate factors the nitrogen rate of 100 200 kg ha 1 phosphorus rate 50 kg ha 1 potassium rate 100 kg ha 1 mean annual temperature 12 higher bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 and acidic soil ph 7 were more beneficial to the increase of yield under subsurface drip irrigation these results highlighted the potential of subsurface drip irrigation in improving yield and water productivity of crops vegetables and fruits however considering the high installation and maintenance costs as well as the blockage of emitters the application of subsurface drip irrigation should be comprehensively weighed on the basis of yield economic benefit environmental benefit and water productivity the rational application of subsurface drip irrigation is of great significance to the protection of water resources and the

9439,the rapid population growth and economic development climate change and irregular rainfall will inevitably intensify the competition of water resources resulting in the reduction of agricultural irrigation water in recent years subsurface drip irrigation ssdi as an efficient water saving irrigation technology has been widely used in crop production but its effects on crop yield irrigation water productivity iwp and water productivity wp vary with field managements climatic conditions and soil properties here a global meta analysis of 984 comparisons from 109 publications was carried out to systematically and quantitatively analyze the responses of yield iwp and wp of crops vegetables and fruits to ssdi the results showed that ssdi significantly increased yield iwp and wp by 5 39 6 75 and 3 97 relative to surface drip irrigation sdi respectively the largest percentage increase in yield was observed in crops 6 42 followed by vegetables 5 29 and fruits 3 37 ssdi performed best when crops vegetables and fruits were planted in the open field under film mulching in arid regions 200 mm and in regions with mean annual temperature 12 besides the emitter spacing 25 cm emitter discharge rate of 2 5 3 5 l h 1 and buried depth of drip pipe 10 cm were beneficial to obtaining higher increases of yield iwp and wp in addition yield was significantly affected by fertilization rate and the maximum percentage increase in yield was obtained with 100 200 kg n ha 1 50 kg p ha 1 and 100 kg k ha 1 yield iwp and wp were also significantly affected by soil factors the percentage changes in yield and iwp in soils with higher bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 and in acid soils ph 7 were significantly higher than those in soils with lower bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 and in neural and alkaline soils ph 7 in conclusion ssdi can improve yield and wp but the application of ssdi should be site specific keywords subsurface drip irrigation yield water productivity meta analysis 1 introduction water shortage is a global problem it is estimated that the global population will be about 9 billion to 10 billion by 2050 and more water will be thus needed fao 2021 cheng et al 2021a the irrigated agriculture is the largest sector of consumptive water use intrigliolo et al 2013 wang et al 2021a how to use the water resources in a sustainable way to ensure food security is a major challenge for present and future generations therefore increasing water productivity through technologies that produce more foods by per drop water is essential for the sustainable agricultural development fao 2021 drip irrigation is recognized as a high efficient water saving irrigation technology around the world which has been widely used in arid and semi arid areas it can not only improve crop yield and quality but also increase the water and fertilizer productivity wang et al 2015 2018 2021b subsurface drip irrigation ssdi is an irrigation technology developed from the surface drip irrigation sdi it directly pours water and liquid fertilizer into the root zone for the growth of crops through the irrigation network system in the plough layer in recent years many researchers have studied the effects of ssdi on crop growth the results showed that ssdi effectively reduced deep seepage soil evaporation and weeds growth around the crop and further improved crop water productivity wp however the effects of ssdi on crop wp varied with field managements climatic conditions and soil properties badr et al 2010 douh et al 2013 wang et al 2017 √ßolak et al 2018 yao et al 2021 besides the impact of ssdi on yield was controversial among studies machado et al 2003 dogan et al 2008 hassanli et al 2010 al mansor et al 2015 √ßolak et al 2018 pisciotta et al 2018 soliman et al 2020 piri and naserin

cheng et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 in recent years it has been well applied in agricultural studies for instance li et al 2018 quantified the influences of plastic and straw mulching on yield and wp of potato in china with meta analysis lu et al 2019 yu et al 2020 and cheng et al 2021b applied meta analysis to study the effects of deficit irrigation on yield and wp of tomato wheat and cotton relative to full irrigation in addition meta analysis was also used to analyze the impact of irrigation zheng et al 2019 drip fertigation li et al 2021a alternate partial root zone irrigation cheng et

yield quality wp and greenhouse gas emissions therefore a global meta analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of ssdi on the yield iwp and wp of crops vegetables and fruits compared to sdi and identify the optimal application conditions field managements climatic conditions and soil properties that increase yield iwp and wp under ssdi systems so as to further improve our understanding of the responses of crops to ssdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection google scholar https xueshu soogle top elsevier science direct https www sciencedirect com search china national knowledge

largest percentage increase in yield was observed in crops 6 42 while the smallest percentage increase in yield occurred in fruits 3 37 fig 5a the largest percentage increases in iwp and wp were found in vegetables 7 20 and fruits 26 06 respectively however the difference in iwp among agricultural species was not significant fig 5b c ssdi also significantly increased yield and wp no matter crops vegetables and fruits were planted in the open field or greenhouse fig 5d and f but the difference in iwp between ssdi and sdi was not significant when the agricultural species were planted in the greenhouse because the 95 confidence internal overlapped zero fig 5e the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp 7 19 10 09 and 8 55 of crops vegetables and fruits planted in the open field were significantly larger than those in the greenhouse the overall mean of planting patterns was slightly lower than that of planting conditions but ssdi still had significantly positive effects in increasing yield iwp and wp with the percentage increases by 5 40 6 72 and 3 77 respectively fig 5g h and i when the agricultural species were planted under film mulching the percentage increases in yield and wp were significantly greater than those without film mulching as for iwp although a greater iwp was observed under film mulching there was no significant difference between the two planting patterns fig 5h 3 3 irrigation and fertilization factors 1 irrigation factors overall ssdi increased yield iwp and wp compared to sdi regardless of drip irrigation parameters fig 6 with the increase of emitter spacing the percentage increases in yield and iwp decreased when the emitter spacing was 45 cm the difference in iwp between ssdi and sdi was not significant fig 6b however when the emitter spacing was less than 25 cm there were notable percentage increases in yield 18 75 iwp 17 89 and wp 20 15 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp increased first and then decreased with the increase of emitter discharge rate fig 6d e and f and there were quadratic parabola relationships between the effect size of yield iwp and wp and emitter discharge rate fig 7d e and f when the emitter discharge rate was 2 5 3 5 l h 1 ssdi improved yield iwp and wp most 15 47 95 ci 13 05 17 94 20 47 95 ci 17 33 23 70 and 29 21 95 ci 24 83 33 75 respectively when the irrigation amount of ssdi was higher 100 or lower 100 than that of sdi there was no significant difference in yield and wp between the two irrigation methods fig 6g i when the irrigation amount was the same 100 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 5 45 95 ci 5 14 5 77 7 39 95 ci 6 73 8 04 and 4 41 95 ci 3 59 5 24 respectively fig 6g h and i the changes of buried depth group were opposite to emitter discharge group the percentage changes in yield decreased first and then increased with the increase of buried depth of drip pipe for yield and iwp the buried depth 10 cm produced the largest percentage increases 14 60 and 10 90 respectively fig 6j k and the buried depth of 20 30 cm showed the least increases 1 85 and 1 22 respectively however wp was increased most by ssdi when the buried depth was 20 30 cm and the difference in wp between the buried depth of 20 30 cm and 10 cm was not significant fig 6i a quadratic parabola relationship existed between the effect size lnr of yield iwp and wp and buried depth of drip pipe fig 7g h and i overall the percentage changes of overall mean in yield iwp and wp was 5 60 95 ci 5 26 5 95 6 00 95 ci 5 37 6 62 and 2 86 95 ci 2 09 3 64 fig 6j k and l

moreover yield under the n fertilization rate of 100 200 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than under the other three fertilization rates fig 8a the maximum percentage increase in iwp occurred when n fertilization rate was 300 kg ha 1 15 77 followed by 200 300 kg ha 1 15 10 100 200 kg ha 1 5 86 and 100 kg ha 1 3 47 fig 8b as for wp the maximum value occurred when n fertilization rate was 300 kg ha 1 14 53 followed by 200 300 kg ha 1 6 15 100 kg ha 1 2 40 and 100 200 kg ha 1 0 91 fig 8c unlike n fertilization rates the percentage changes of yield decreased with the increase of p and k fertilization rates fig 8d g however the changes of wp decreased first and then increased with the increase of p fertilization rate fig 8f as for iwp the percentage changes increased first and then decreased with the increase of p fertilization rate and increased with the increase of k fertilization rate fig 8e h when p fertilization rate was 50 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 14 25 13 30 and 9 48 respectively when p fertilization rate was 50 100 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 8 35 20 08 and 2 71 respectively when p fertilization rate was 100

between ssdi and sdi was not significant when the k fertilization rate was 100 kg ha 1 the yield was increased most by ssdi and the iwp and wp were increased least when the k fertilization interval was 100 200 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 11 40 10 00 and 7 02 respectively when the k fertilization rate was 200 kg ha 1 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 8 95 14 38 and 12 81 respectively fig 8g h and i 3 4 soil factors overall ssdi had a positively effect on yield iwp and wp regardless of soil bulk densities the percentage increases were greater in soils with higher bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 7 44 for yield 6 73 for iwp and 10 50 for wp respectively when the soil bulk density was 1 4 g cm 3 the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp were 3 07 1 29 and 2 10 respectively fig 9a b and c in both acidic and alkaline soils ssdi significantly increased yield and iwp compared with sdi fig 9d and e the percentage increases of yield and iwp in soils with ph 7 were 15 05 95 ci 12 37 17 79 and 26 89 95 ci 23 23 30 66 respectively which were significantly higher than those in soils with ph 7 10 51 95 ci 9 90 11 12 and 18 02 95 ci 16 59 19 47 fig 9d e however wp in soils with ph 7 was decreased by ssdi with a percentage changes of 33 90 95 ci 38 77 to 28 63 which was significantly lower than that in soils with ph 7 9 31 95 ci 7 40 11 25 fig 9f overall the mean effect size of ssdi on yield iwp and wp was increased by 10 74 95 ci 10 15 11 33 19 29 95 ci 17 96 20 64 and 6 58 95 ci 4 77 8 42 respectively fig 9d e and f in the soil texture group the overall mean of yield iwp and wp were 5 41 6 71 and 3 76 respectively the maximum percentage increase of yield occurred in fine soils fig 9g however the highest percentage changes in iwp and wp were obtained in medium soils fig 9g h and i when the soil texture was fine soil the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were 11 01 95 ci 10 06 11 97 3 13 95 ci 0 98 5 33 and 3 90 95 ci 1 86 5 98 respectively for the medium soil the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were 0 51 95 ci 0 03 1 00 9 68 95 ci 8 22 11 17 and 12 32 95 ci 10 35 14 32 respectively for the coarse soil the percentage increases

increased yield and wp compared with sdi in both the annual average precipitation and temperature groups fig 10a c d and f however in semi arid and semi humid regions there was no difference in iwp between the two irrigation methods due to the 95 confidence internal overlapped zero fig 10b generally the percentage changes of yield iwp and wp decreased first and then increased with the increase of annual average precipitation the maximum yield iwp and wp increase occurred in the humid region 8 86 8 63 and 30 66 respectively but the differences between humid and arid regions 6 17 8 00 and 24 92 respectively were not significant fig 10a b and c in semi arid regions the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were 5 42 95 ci 3 60 7 28 1 28 95 ci 3 68 to 1 19 and 7 84 95 ci 4 20 11 60 respectively in semi humid regions ssdi increased yield iwp and wp by 1 81 95 ci 1 12 2 50 0 03 95 ci 1 01 to 0 95 and 2 28 95 ci 1 36 3 21 respectively fig 10a b and c the percentage changes of yield

30 respectively which were significantly lower than those with annual average temperature 12 14 69 95 ci 11 50 17 97 and 10 41 95 ci 7 14 13 78 fig 10d e as for wp there was no significant difference between annual average temperature 12 15 80 95 ci 13 05 18 62 and 12 15 65 95 ci 12 18 19 22 fig 10f overall the mean effect sizes of ssdi on yield iwp and wp were increased by 6 84 95 ci 5 49 8 20 7 19 95 ci 4 96 9 47 and 15 74 95 ci 13 58 17 95 respectively fig 10d e and f 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural specie planting condition and pattern effects on yield iwp and wp compared with sdi ssdi significantly increased crops vegetables and fruits yield iwp and wp through the comparison of dataset from 109 publications ssdi and sdi show different locations and sizes of wetting body and water state liu and li 2009 liu et al 2021 compared with sdi ssdi maintained a relatively drier soil surface and a favorable water condition in the root zone so as to reduce the surface water losses and promote the growth of roots which improved the absorption and utilization of water and nutrients and further improved yield iwp and wp kong et al 2010 mart√≠nez and reca 2014 mali et al 2017 yang et al 2019 piri and naserin 2020 hamad et al 2021 besides agricultural species groups responded differently to ssdi the increase of fruit yield was smallest which was significantly lower than those of crops and vegetables this may be due to that fruit trees had deeper and wider root systems than vegetables and crops resulting in small differences in their responses to sdi and ssdi vegetables and crops are shallow rooted crops and are more sensitive to water changes jefferies and heilbronn 1991 liao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 compared with crops vegetables and fruits planted in the greenhouse the percentage increases of yield iwp and wp were higher when they were planted in the open field the reason for this may be that the high temperature and humidity in the greenhouse weakened the difference between the two irrigation methods plastic film mulching can reduce soil water evaporation increase soil temperature and maintain higher soil moisture and further increase yield compared with non plastic film mulching fan et al 2014 wang et al 2020c yu et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 the percentage changes of crops vegetables and fruits yield and wp under film mulching were larger than those without film mulching 4 2 irrigation and fertilization factors effects on yield iwp and wp reasonable emitter spacing and discharge rate can effectively improve crop water productivity which are two important parameters of drip fertigation technology li 2006 ren et al 2017 li et al 2021b emitter spacing and discharge rate can affect crop growth yield and quality by affecting soil moisture uniformity and water infiltration process wang et al 2005 2010 2021d in this meta analysis with the increase of emitter spacing the percentage changes in yield and iwp decreased with the increase of emitter discharge rate the percentage changes in yield iwp and wp increased first and then decreased when the emitter spacing was less than 25 cm and emitter discharge rate was 2 5 3 5 l h 1 yield iwp and wp were increased more this may be because the width of wetting volume on both sides of the lateral was small when the emitter spacing was small and water mainly accumulated in the root zone el hafedh et al 2001 moreover previous studies have showed that there was a clear relationship between the shape of the wetting soil zone and the emitter discharge rate and the horizontal wetting area increased and the wetted soil depth decreased with the increase of emitter discharge rate khan et al 1996 beyond the root depth large emitter spacing too large or small discharge rate would result in a water loss besides when the irrigation amount of ssdi was higher 100 than that of sdi there was no significant difference in yield and wp between ssdi and sdi however when the irrigation amount was the same 100 ssdi significantly increased yield iwp and wp the reason for this difference may be that the sample size of 100 group was relatively small and only five studies showed that the irrigation amount of ssdi was higher than that of sdi among the 109 publications therefore the result needs to be further verified in the subsurface drip irrigation system the selection of drip pipe installation depth is the key patel and rajput 2007 li et al 2015 bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 vadar et al 2019 hamad et al 2021 irrigation depth determines the initial infiltration position of water and affects the range and content distribution of water in soils gu 2017 moreover different crops have different requirements for the depth of drip irrigation pipe under different soil property conditions some researchers have found that crop yields decreased as the buried depth of drip pipe increased marouelli and silva 2002 found the increase in the buried depth of drip pipe from 20 cm to 40 cm led to a 23 4 tomato yield reduction bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 also reported that green bean production was higher when drip pipes were located at 0 1 m than 0 2 m depth however patel and rajput 2009 showed that the onion yield and iwp increased first and then decreased as the drip pipe depth increased from 5 cm to 30 cm and the maximum onion yield was obtained at 10 cm depth mansour and gyuricza 2013 revealed that the potato yield increased with the increase of the buried depth of drip pipe from 15 cm to 30 cm yield and iwp were better improved when the drip pipe depth was 10 cm which meant that the drip irrigation pipe should be buried shallowly which was consistent with the finding of li et al 1996 when the buried depth of drip pipe was shallow the surface soil was wet and the moisture content was high however when the buried depth increased gradually the resistance of water to shallow layer also increased which gradually reduced the moisture content of surface soil when the buried depth exceeded a certain depth the moisture content of surface soil was low patel and rajput 2007 nutrients absorbed by crops mainly come from soil residues and additional fertilization generally within a certain range of fertilizer inputs crop yield increased with the increase of fertilizer applied but the yield decreased when the fertilization rate exceeded a certain threshold xing et al 2015 gu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 our study found the maximum yield increase occurred when n fertilization rate was 100 200 kg ha 1 the increase of yield decreased with the increase of p and k fertilization rates this may be due to that the advantage of ssdi was more obvious in the case of low fertilization rate and the yield of ssdi was significantly higher than that of sdi in the case of high fertilization rate the difference between the two irrigation methods was weakened due to the effect of soil fertility badr et al 2012 mali et al 2017 4 3 soil factors effects on yield iwp and wp soil bulk density had a direct effect on the infiltration of water and the infiltration capacity of soils decreased with the increase of soil bulk density li et al 2009 we found the increase of yield iwp and wp in soils with bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 was significantly higher than that for 1 4 g cm 3 this result could be explained by that soils with high soil bulk density were more compacted which inhibited the water from surface drip irrigation seeping into the root zone however ssdi could directly transport water to the root zone of crops which was more conducive to the absorption and utilization of water by roots and reduced soil evaporation the greater percentage increases in yield and iwp in soils with ph 7 can be attributed to that the alkaline soil increased ammonia volatilization resulting in a large amount of nitrogen loss carrijo et al 2017 du et al 2018 moreover alkaline soils usually have high salt content which has a negative impact on crop growth the maximum yield increase was obtained in fine soils followed by coarse soils and medium soils this was probably because the fine textured soils had higher clay content with poor soil aeration and the coarse soil owned higher sandy content with poor capacity of holding water and nutrients groffman and tiedje 1991 bollmann and conrad 2004 du et al 2018 cheng et al 2021b which was not conducive to surface drip irrigation and widen the gap between the two irrigation methods however the difference in yield between the two drip irrigation methods was small in medium soils on the contrary ssdi significantly increased wp compared with sdi in medium soils this may be due to the effective reduction of water consumption under ssdi in medium soils 4 4 climate factors effects on yield iwp and wp in this meta analysis we found that the increases of yield iwp and wp under ssdi in arid regions were higher than those in semi arid and semi humid regions the percentage increases in yield and iwp in regions with annual average temperature 12 were significantly greater than those with annual average temperature 12 the possible reason may be that the arid regions with annual average temperature 12 owned higher evaporation and ssdi effectively reduced the loss of surface water thereby providing more water for crop growth besides we also found the maximum yield iwp and wp increases under ssdi occurred in humid regions but the differences between humid and arid regions were not significant it may be related to that less rainfall occurred during the growing season despite of the high annual rainfall 4 5 limitations the responses of yield iwp and wp of crops vegetables and fruits under ssdi were evaluated in this meta analysis nevertheless other factors such as the frequency of drip irrigation and fertilization seasonal temperature and precipitation also had influences on the results future studies need to consider more factors affecting the application of ssdi the data of yield iwp and wp were not sufficient for the irrigation proportion group 100 and soil ph 7 so the results need to be further verified besides we only considered the responses of crops vegetables and fruits under ssdi in this meta analysis in recent 20 years but the alfalfa and other grasses and studies before 2001 were not considered 5 conclusions a global meta analysis of the literature was conducted to investigate the responses of yield irrigation water productivity and water productivity to subsurface drip irrigation compared to surface drip irrigation overall subsurface drip irrigation significantly increased the yields of crops vegetables and fruits irrigation water productivity and water productivity subsurface drip irrigation performed best when the emitter spacing was less than 25 cm the emitter discharge rate varied 2 5 3 5 l h 1 and the buried depth of drip pipe was less than 10 cm the improvement of yield was significantly affected by fertilization rate soil and climate factors the nitrogen rate of 100 200 kg ha 1 phosphorus rate 50 kg ha 1 potassium rate 100 kg ha 1 mean annual temperature 12 higher bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 and acidic soil ph 7 were more beneficial to the increase of yield under subsurface drip irrigation these results highlighted the potential of subsurface drip irrigation in improving yield and water productivity of crops vegetables and fruits however considering the high installation and maintenance costs as well as the blockage of emitters the application of subsurface drip irrigation should be comprehensively weighed on the basis of yield economic benefit environmental benefit and water productivity the rational application of subsurface drip irrigation is of great significance to the protection of water resources and the
