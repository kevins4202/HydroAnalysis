adsorbent adsorption photocatalytic oxidation chemical oxygen demand 1 introduction petroleum industry has widened its spectrum in the past few decades due to the continuous growth of market demand and applications however in the petroleum industry more than 20 000 m3 per day of wastewater is generated 1 petroleum is composed of various types of hydrocarbons hcs where some of the compounds also contain sulfur nitrogen oxygen and metal containing compounds 2 in the process of refining into consumables crude oil is processed through a series of treatments 3 during which some hcs are discharged into the waste stream with the rapid development of industrialization the demand for petroleum products is increasing so the waste generated in the oil refining process is increasingly becoming the focus of environmentalists 4 petroleum refinery wastewater is a major cause of soil and water pollution as it contains high amount of toxic substances which cause severe health hazards 5 recently various techniques like biodegradation pyrolysis 6 solvent extraction 7 ultrasonic treatment 8 photocatalytic oxidation 9 incineration and adsorption have been developed for the treatment of petroleum wastewater however most of these technologies are not commercially applicable due to high cost and complicated mechanical requirements 10 treatments of refinery wastewater by adsorption have received great attention in recent years due to its low cost easy operation and availability of a large variety of adsorbents 11 metalorganic frameworks mofs due to its crystalline form permanent porosity thermal and chemical stability topology and easily modifiable structure are also used for the treatment of industrial wastewater another adsorbent which is widely used for the reclamation of wastewater is activated carbon 12 mineral clays are natural aluminosilicates having high surface area low cost and high mass transfer rates 11 which are extensively used for the removal of various contaminants from wastewater generally aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds present in wastewater being hydrophobic in nature do not easily absorb on the hydrophilic surface of the natural clays 13 however natural clays can be made organophilic by treatment with cationic or anionic surfactants during which the inorganic ions are exchanged with organic cations or anions 14 the interlayer spacing of the clay increases thereby facilitating the insertion of organic molecules organophilic clays are reported to show high efficiency for the removal of organic compounds from wastewater 15 bentonite clay is commonly used for surfactant modification because it is naturally abundant has high good ion exchange capacity high surface area the presence of micro and mesopores as well as because of its enhanced swelling properties 16 17 sodium forms of bentonite clay are generally used for the synthesis of organophilic clays because of its hydrophilic nature the crystal plane expansion of bentonite can be easily detected by x ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy 17 both cationic and anionic surfactant modified bentonite has been used for the removal of various types of organic contaminants such as textile dyes pesticides and humic acid etc 18 19 various organic pollutants in wastewater from oil refineries are degraded by chemical and enhanced oxidation processes 20 in chemical oxidation organic pollutants are oxidized by an oxidizing agent to water and carbon dioxide or converted to non toxic oxidized substances such as inorganic salts the oxidation can be achieved by hypochlorite fenton s reagent ultrasonic irradiation ozone persulfates and permanganates which produce a large number of oh radicals which in turn perform the oxidation reaction 21 chemical oxidation processes are widely used for the treatment of oily wastewater mater et al 22 reported that fenton reagent can effectively decrease the concentrations of phenols pahs and btexs in soil contaminated by oily sludge at low ph i e ph 3 in recent years ultrasonic irradiation is also used in the oxidation treatment of oily wastewater by sonication of water intermediate radicals such as oh hydrogen h hydroperoxyl ho2 can be generated which under sonication break aromatic and aliphatic petroleum hcs having complex structure and high molecular weight into simple hcs having high bioavailability and solubility by ultrasonication a number of petroleum hcs can be degraded such as aromatic compounds aliphatic hcs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs various phenols and poly aromatic hcs 23 combined ultrasonic and fenton oxidation showed high efficiency for the treatment of petroleum sludge 24 in recent years various advanced oxidation treatment methods have been used for the treatment of oily wastewater such as photocatalytic oxidation supercritical water oxidation scwo and wet air oxidation wao etc 4 in supercritical water oxidation processes water is used as a reaction medium above its critical point 375 c 22 1 mpa where oil aromatics and gases make a homogeneous phase and the oxidation process is done very quickly by converting organic pollutants into carbon dioxide and water 25 up to 92 reduction in chemical oxidation demand cod value of oily sludge can be achieved within 10 min by scwo process 26 in the wao process oxygen is used as an oxidant under high pressure and temperature to transform toxic organic compounds into water and carbon dioxide jing et al reported that up to 88 4 reduction in cod value of oily sludge could be achieved in 9 min by wao process 27 another promising oxidation technique is heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation which works on the activation of photo conductor surfaces e g titanium dioxide by light uv or sun light on industrial scale the application of advance oxidation methods is not feasible due to high mechanical requirements and high equipment and process cost 28 in the present study the removal of hcs from petroleum refinery wastewater has been studied by adsorption coupled with photocatalytic oxidation over surfactant modified bentonite clay the organophilic bentonite clay was prepared by treatment of natural bentonite with cationic anionic and neutral surfactants while the hybrid material was prepared by treating the surfactant modified bentonite clay with tio2 the prepared materials were applied for the removal of organic pollutants from the model and real refinery wastewater using only adsorption and adsorption coupled with oxidation reaction and various reaction parameters such as temperature time ph and hydrocarbon concentration were optimized the organophilic bentonite and hybrid materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx analysis x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infra red ft ir spectroscopy 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all reagents and chemicals used in this study were of analytical

suspended solids and then analyzed for preliminary characterization i e ph total dissolved solids tds suspended solids ss and cod according to standard procedures for examination of water and wastewater 29 ph was measured by using milwaukee mi150 ph meter turbidity was measured by hanna h188703 01 turbidity meter tds was measured by hanna tds meter model h198301 2 3 preparation and characterization of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt ctab was impregnated on bentonite clay using a method reported in the literature 14 500 ml distilled water was taken in a beaker and 15 g of bentonite clay added to it slowly under constant stirring at 250 rpm the mixture was stirred to homogenized for 20 min on a magnetic stirrer after 20 min concentrated sodium carbonate na2co3 solution was added to the slurry and stirred further at 80 c the slurry was cooled to room temperature for 24 h 0 1 m aqueous solution of ctab was added to the slurry stirred for 30 min and allowed to stand for 24 h the organophilic bentonite clay was collected by filtration and washed with water and then dried at 65 c for 36 h the organophilic clay was then crushed and sieved through a 200 mesh sieve and stored in a glass bottle natural bentonite and bentonite clay modified with ctab was coded as nat bt and ctab bt respectively in order to remove the organic impurities the bentonite clay was first treated with h2o2 30 about 15 g of bentonite clay was taken in a beaker and 50 ml of h2o2 was added to it the mixture was ultrasonicated for 6 h at room temperature using a 20 khz sonicator operated at 66 w the clay was recovered by vacuum filtration washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h after drying the bentonite clay was crushed to a particle size 100 mesh tio2 was loaded on bentonite clay by the wet impregnation method reported by laysandra et al 31 in a typical procedure about 1 8 g of tio2 is dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water and 15 g of bentonite is added to it under constant stirring the mixture was further stirred under 100 c for 1 h the mixture was further irradiated in a microwave reactor for 10 min at 500 w the mixture was finally filtered and the solid product recovered was dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h 32 tio2 bt was further modified with ctab surfactant using the procedure described above for preperation of ctab bt the adsorbents synthesized in the laboratory including ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt were characterized by ftir agilent cary 630 xrd analyses of raw bentonite surfactant modified bentonite clay and tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent was carried out using x ray diffractometer xpert philips sem analysis was performed through sem hitachi s 4700 while edx analysis was carried out through an x ray source connected to the same sem 2 4 adsorption experiments adsorption of hcs from the model wastewater was carried out in batch mode about 20 ml of model wastewater was taken in an erlenmeyer flask added a known amount of ctab bt and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for a certain time the adsorbent was recovered by filtration and the concentration of hcs removed was analyzed through hplc the effect of temperature time and adsorbent dose on the adsorption of hcs was also studied under the optimized conditions the refinery wastewater was treated using the same procedure as follows for model wastewater the amount of hcs removed was analyzed by cod analysis 2 5 simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption experiments in order to investigate the removal of hydrocarbon pollutants from the model and refinery wastewater combined oxidation and adsorption processes i e simultaneous oxidation and adsorption experiments were carried out using hybrid adsorbents loaded with oxidation catalyst initial experiments were carried on the model wastewater under optimized conditions in typical simultaneous experiment about 500 ml of the model wastewater was charged into the photoreactor we previously used 33 as shown in fig 1 known amount of hybrid adsorbent tio2 ctab bt was added to the sample and photo irradiated under continuous stirring for a given duration of time the sample was then filtered and the concentration of model hcs decreased in the filtrate after treatment was determined by hplc analysis the effect of dose of hybrid adsorbent and time was further investigated in a series of experiments carried out under different conditions the refinery wastewater was treated similarly under optimum conditions and the concentration of hcs removed was determined by cod analysis the graphical presentation of the stepwise treatment process is displayed in fig 2 2 6 product analyses analysis of the model waste hcs was carried out on shimadzu lc20at hplc using a c18 column the analysis was performed at 254 nm with 10 min run time a mixture of acetonitrile and distilled water 60 40 was used as the mobile phase model waste hydrocarbon concentration was determined by comparing the peak area of samples with the peak area of the respective standard gcms thermo scientific dsq ii gc ms attached with tr sms capillary column 30 m 0 25 μm 0 25 mm i d was used for analysis of refinery wastewater before and after adsorption helium gas at flow rate 1 ml min was used as carrier gas identification of hcs was carried out by matching the peaks in the chromatogram with relip and mainlib libraries 2 7 kinetic thermodynamic and adsorption studied adsorption rate was investigated by applying the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models to the adsorption data different adsorption isotherm models including langmuir isotherm and freundlich adsorption isotherm were applied to the adsorption data in order to investigate the nature of adsorption the spontaneity thermal effect and feasibility of the adsorption system were studied by calculating different thermodynamic parameters such as the entropy change δs enthalpy change δh and free energy change δg 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical analysis of refinery wastewater initial characterization of the samples was carried out by determining various parameters including cod ss density turbidity electrical conductivity ec and ph according to the standard procedure of water and wastewater examination the results are shown in table 1 the data shows that although the density of the waste sample is close to 1 g cm3 the ph and cod values of the sample are high i e 9 2 and 970 mg l respectively according to environmental health safety guidelines 2009 the permissible limit for cod and ph for wastewater is 150 mg l and for ph limit is 6 9 respectively 29 the high turbidity of the sample indicates the presence of colloidal suspensions whereas high ec shows the presence of ions which is an indication of the high salts content likewise the values of tds and suspended solids are also higher than the allowed ranges this indicates that these parameters are out of the permissible range and the wastewater is not suitable for direct discharge into the environment 3 2 characterization ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt 3 2 1 ftir analysis the ftir spectrum of ctab fig 3 a shows the characteristic peaks corresponding to symmetric vibrations of ch in ch3 and ch2 groups at 2851 and 2920 cm 1 respectively while the peaks at 1469 and at 1372 cm 1 correspond to the asymmetric bending vibrations in ch of methyl and methylene groups 34 the ftir spectrum of ctab bt fig 3b shows the characteristic peaks of bentonite for oh groups at 3650 cm 1and sio at 1010 cm 1 whereas the peaks corresponding to the methyl and methylene ch of the cetyltrimethyl group are positioned at 2920 and 2835 cm 1 additionally the peak centered at 1475 shows nh bonds of the ammonium group 35 it can be concluded from these results that cetyltrimethylammonium cations are successfully incorporated on the surface of bentonite clay after its modification with ctab 36 the ftir spectrum of tio2 ctab bt is shown in fig 3c the spectrum shows the characteristic absorption bands of bentonite clay structure ctab surfactant and tio2 at their respective positions major absorption bands positioned at 3620 3343 1113 and 911 cm 1 corresponded to oh starching vibrations sio h stretching si o si stretching vibration and al oh vibration characteristics of bentonite clay 37 peaks corresponding to the methyl and methylene ch of the cetyltrimethylammonium group are positioned at 2920 and 2835 cm 1 whereas the peak centered at 1475 shows nh bonds of the ammonium group 35 strong absorption at 500 cm 1 may be assigned to tio bond vibrations in the tio2 lattice 38 these results show the presence of the configuration of tio2 ctab bt which confirms the successful preparation of the material 3 2 2 sem analysis the sem micrographs of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt are shown in fig 4 a and b it can be seen from the micrographs that ctab bt shows a different morphology from tio2 ctab bt the surface of ctab bt seems highly foliated layered and spongy numerous cracks and caves can also be observed on the surface the micrograph of tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent shows a rough surface and non uniform surface with distinct grains of tio2 widely dispersed on the surface this suggests the successful incorporation of tio2 particles on the surface of ctab bt 3 2 3 edx analysis the elemental composition of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt was analyzed by edx analysis the edx spectra of the samples are shown in fig s1 supplementary materials whereas the elemental composition as weight of elements is given in table 2 results indicated that the major elements present in the bt clay include si al o fe na mg k ca and s it has been reported that bentonite consists of a number of clay minerals out of which the montmorillonite is the most widespread having formula of mg ca o a12o3 5sio2 nh2o 39 the most abundant oxides in the natural bentonite include sio2 al2o3 fe2o3 whereas other oxides include cao na2o k2o tio2 etc additionally sulfur may also be present as sulfate or pyrite 15 the elemental profile of ctab bt agrees with the literature however the high amount of c in ctab bt confirms that it contains organic molecules in the form of surfactant anion the edx analysis of tio2 ctab bt shows that it contains high weight of c o al si na and ti which agree with the theoretical composition of the individual components of the bentonite clay ctab and tio2 3 2 4 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt are shown in fig 5 a and b indicating that the main peaks are located at 20 95 26 75 and 50 20 in 2θ confirming the presence of smectite 12 whereas the peaks at 2θ of 14 5 and 36 40 corresponds to quartz varying intensity peaks at 2θ of 14 43 29 10 40 92 44 50 59 96 and 65 06 indicates kaolinite and montmorillonite is shown by its characteristic peaks 17 major characteristic peaks of rutile phase tio2 peaks at 2θ of 27 36 and 55 whereas anatase phase tio2 is indicated by peaks at 2θ of 25 and 48 and both phases agree with standard cards i e jcpds 88 1175 and jcpds 84 1286 respectively 40 the xrd results confirm the structure of tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent bentonite crystal structure consists of an octahedral alumina sheet between two tetrahedral silica sheets having oxygen as the common atoms between the layers such three layered units are stacked one above the other having oxygen atoms between the layers the isomorphic replacement of al 3 for si 4 in the tetrahedral layer and mg 2 or other cations for al 3 in the octahedral layer produce a permanent negative charge in the layers which can be attributed to the exchange of various cations by the bentonite 41 the bentonite clay is hydrophilic in nature due to which it is not suitable for the adsorption of non polar organic molecules however the exchange of inorganic cations by organic cations such as surfactant molecules in the interlayer s of bentonite enhances its adsorption efficiency for organic compounds 35 therefore it may be suggested that cetyltrimethylammonium cations have replaced inorganic cations such as na and k in the bentonite interlayer and the long alkyl groups of organic cations can help to capture petroleum hydrocarbons 3 3 removal of model hcs by adsorption over ctab bt 3 3 1 effect of adsorption parameters the absorption of hcs from the model wastewater over ctab bt was investigated at different conditions of adsorbent dose temperature adsorption time in order to optimize the conditions for maximum removal of hcs using 100 ml of the hcs solution initially the adsorption experiments were carried out for 100 ml model wastewater at room temperature and 1 h adsorption time using different weights of ctab bt as adsorbent doses ranging from 100 to 1000 mg results are indicated in fig 6 which shows that the removal of all model aromatic hcs i e benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene increases with increasing adsorbent dose and the maximum adsorption of all hcs was attained by 800 mg of ctab bt and it decreased with further increase in the dose this suggests that the optimum amount of ctab bt required for maximum removal of hcs from model wastewater is 800 mg the increase in adsorbent dose provides more unsaturated sites on the surface of ctab bt which leads to increased adsorption of hcs 41 in case of higher adsorbent dosage the excess of adsorbents may aggregate which can limit the availability of the free surface for adsorption 42 although all model hcs showed nearly the same level of removal however the adsorption of naphthalene was lower than benzene and phenol whereas those of toluene were higher among all which may be due to the complexity of the structure the effect of temperature on the removal of hcs from the model wastewater was studied under different temperatures i e 30 35 40 45 and 50 c using 0 8 g of adsorbent for 100 ml of feed volume and a contact time of 1 h results are shown in fig 7 the data shows that the removal of all hcs in the model wastewater linearly increases with an increase in adsorption temperature from 25 to 40 c with further increase in temperature to 45 and 50 c the removal of hcs does not increase but remains constant at higher temperature hence the optimum temperature is 40 c generally increasing temperature may result in the swelling effect of the adsorbent structure due to which the bulky organic molecules may easily penetrate to the adsorption sites thereby increasing the adsorption of hcs 41 the effect of contact time on the hcs adsorption was studied at 15 min intervals in the range of 15 165 min the results shown in fig 8 show that the adsorption of hcs increases linearly with the increase of adsorption time and the maximum removal rate of hcs about 95 96 is achieved at a contact time of 120 min longer reaction time provides more effective collisions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules so the total adsorption capacity increases linearly with the increase in contact time beyond 120 min the surface of ctab bt is saturated with hcs hence no further increase in net removal is observed these results indicate that the optimum conditions for removal of hcs from model wastewater are 0 8 g 100 ml ctab bt to model wastewater feed ratio 40 c adsorption temperature and 120 min contact time under optimum conditions removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene was 96 4 95 5 95 4 and 94 9 respectively the hplc chromatogram of the model wastewater before and after adsorption is displayed in fig s2 supplementary data from which a marked decrease in the peak area corresponding to these hcs can be observed the 120 min adsorption time for highly efficient removal of these hcs is much shorter than those reported in the literature for similar hcs using ctac modified activated carbon and bentonite clay 43 thereby marking the current study superior and more feasible for practical applications 3 3 2 adsorption kinetic isotherms and thermodynamic evaluation adsorption mechanism of hcs over ctab bt was investigated by applying pseudo first order 44 and pseudo second order kinetic model 45 to the adsorption data fig s3 a d shows the pseudo first order kinetic plots for the adsorption of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene over ctab bt it can be observed that a linear plot is obtained for pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 of above 0 850 whereas in the case of pseudo second order kinetic fig s4 a d for all model hcs non linear plots are obtained from t qt vs time t with r2 is less than 0 477 table 3 these results confirm that the pseudo first order kinetic model shows a satisfactory correlation of hydrocarbon adsorption onto ctab bt langmuir isotherm equation 46 and freundlich adsorption isotherm models 47 were applied to investigate the nature of the hcs adsorption over ctab bt the calculated langmuir constants k1 and qm and freundlich constants n and kf as well as the coefficients of correlation r2 for both isotherms are given in table 4 whereas fig s5 a d and s6 a d shows the plots of langmuir and freundlich isotherms for hcs adsorption over ctab respectively the results reveal that the adsorption data better fit to langmuir adsorption isotherms indicating the heterogeneous multilayer adsorption of hcs in the interlayer galleries of the ctab bt the spontaneity thermal effect and feasibility of the adsorption system were determined from the variation of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant kd with temperature various thermodynamic factors such as the entropy change δs enthalpy change δh and free energy change δg were calculated the results given in table 5 show that the positive values of δh and δs indicate the endothermic properties of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene on ctab while the negative value of δg confirms the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process an increase in the δg value indicates that the degree of spontaneity also increases at higher temperatures 3 4 removal of hc s by simultaneous oxidation and adsorption using tio2 ctab bt in order to evaluate the effect of combined photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption on the removal of hcs from the model and refinery wastewater the model wastewater was photo irradiated in the photoreactor in the presence of tio2 ctab bt under different dosage and contact time initially the removal of model hc s i e benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene from model wastewater was investigated under uv irradiation at 30 c temperature ph 3 and 1 h reaction time using different weights of tio2 ctab bt ranging from 100 to 1200 mg per 500 ml of water sample the results are shown in fig 9 which shows that as the weight of tio2 ctab bt increases to 1000 mg the removal of model hc increases linearly however as the weight increases further no positive effects are observed statistical analysis revealed significant differences among pollutants dosage as well as their interactions table 6 among the hcs maximum removal of benzene 90 83 toluene 91 16 phenol 93 26 and naphthalene 89 20 was attained under 1000 mg tio2 ctab bt dosage table 7 since in these experiments tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent was used in which ctab bt not only acts as a support for tio2 photocatalyst but also function as an adsorbent therefore as the weight of tio2 ctab bt increases not only the adsorption sites increase but the weight of tio2 also increases which enhances the oxidation process removal of hcs from model wastewater was further studied under different contact times ranging from 10 to 80 min using 1100 mg tio2 ctab bt per 500 ml sample the results are shown in fig 10 which shows that the removal of hcs increases linearly with the increase of reaction time and reaches the maximum within 60 min in the reaction time of 30 min the removal rates of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene were about 62 7 59 2 52 and 53 respectively which increased to 94 1 92 6 93 2 and 91 8 in 60 min with further increase in the reaction time the decrease in the concentration of hcs remains constant the contribution of individual photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption in removal of hydrocarbon pollutants was investigated in model refinery wastewater results indicated in fig 11 revealed that incase of photocatalytic oxidation in the presence of tio2 the removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene was about 60 5 55 7 59 8 and 60 6 respectively in 60 min reaction time whereas in case of simple adsorption over ctab bt the removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene was about 47 5 46 9 47 2 and 46 6 respectively in 60 min on the other hand in simultaneous or combined photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption over tio2 ctab bt the removal of same hydrocarbons in 60 min was found to be 94 1 92 6 93 2 and 91 8 respectively this indicated the synergistic effect of combined photooxidation and adsorption process furthermore as described above in section 3 4 1 in case of simple adsorption over ctab bt about 94 of all model hydrocarbons are removed in 120 min at 40 c under 800 mg adsorbent dose likewise we have shown that near complete degradation of the model hydrocarbons through photocatalytic oxidation tio2 uv system required 90 min 33 however through simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption using tio2 ctab bt the model hcs are almost completely removed in just 60 min and at a temperature of 30 c this shows the clear advantage of simultaneous oxidation and adsorption process over simple photocatalytic oxidation and simple adsorption in which the hc s removal efficiency has been increased in a short contact time the same level of hc s removal which occurs in 90 and 120 min in case of photocatalytic oxidation using tio2 and adsorption ctab bt respectively it occurs merely in 60 min in case of simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption using tio2 ctab bt 3 4 1 process mechanism it is clear from the above results that the simultaneous oxidation and adsorption over tio2 ctab bt is more efficient in the removal of hcs than the simple oxidation and adsorption by tio2 and ctab bt respectively the mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation has been widely studied in literature 33 in which highly reactive species i e hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 are produced by photocatalyst from water molecules during excitation of electrons from valance band to conduction band in the presence uv radiations these radicals readily oxidize the hydrocarbons pollutants in the wastewater to co2 h2o and other oxidation products it may be suggested that during this process some hcs are completely oxidized while others are partially oxidized in the aqueous phase in the presence of tio2 in the case of partially oxidized compounds the adsorption efficiency over ctab bt increases the increased adsorption of oxygenated hcs may be explained based on the high binding affinity of the oxygenated functional groups on the ctab bt surface through electrostatic interaction 48 when using cationic surfactants to modify the surface of bentonite the cations of the surfactants bind to the anions on the clay surface through electrostatic interactions 49 50 a single layer of surfactant on the clay surface i e monolayer or hemimicelle is formed when the surfactant concentration c is less than the cation exchange capacity cec of the clay i e c cec in case of c cec bilayer or admicelle is formed 51 the adsorption capacity of the surfactant modified clays has been reported to be enhanced multifold than the original 52 the cationic surfactants with alkyl groups cationic group and counterions form a cationic layer on the clay surface by hydrophobic interaction and cation exchange it has been reported that the positive surface can be balanced by the negative counter ions which increases the affinity of cationic surfactant modified adsorbents for the adsorption of anionic hcs 53 54 in the process of photocatalytic oxidation partially oxidized functional groups are formed ionized to form oxyanions and interact with the cation surface of ctab bt through electrostatic interaction in the same manner as explained for the retention of oxyanions by the surfactant modified adsorbent 55 hydrophobic effects 56 electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding also play important roles in such cases and the π electrons of the aromatic hcs rings also interact with the ammonium center of the surfactant 57 58 leading to the adsorption of aromatic compounds multiple hydrogen bonding between the alkyl or aromatic groups and the c or n of the surfactants are been reported to involve in the adsorption of organic molecules over alkylammonium modified adsorbents 59 60 as mentioned in the previous section the adsorption of model hcs follows langmuir adsorption isotherm hence it may be suggested that the monolayer adsorption proceeds in the interlayer galleries of the ctab bt 3 5 treatment of oil refinery real wastewater under the optimal conditions the wastewater from the refinery was treated by adsorption in batch mode i e the temperature was 40 c the contact time was 120 min and 0 8 g of ctab bt was used for 100 ml of feed water the results are shown in table 8 indicating that the cod of the refinery wastewater is 970 mg l and the cod drops to about 77 mg l after being absorbed by ctab bt for 120 min therefore during the adsorption process it was observed that the cod of the refinery wastewater was reduced by approximately 92 the adsorption efficiency of the ctab bt can be attributed to the cationic nature of the surfactant since the cation exchange capacity of the bentonite clay is higher due to which more organic cations are incorporated into the bentonite the presence of alkyl groups on the surface of bentonite enhances its affinity for adsorption of organic compounds the high adsorption efficiency of ctab bt has also been reported for various other types of organic contaminants such as dyes humic acid pesticides etc 61 the gc ms chromatograms of the refinery wastewater samples before and after the adsorption treatment are shown in fig 12 a b and the details of the hcs in the refinery wastewater are shown in table 9 the gcms data shows that the refinery wastewater contained about 2 22 cyclic aliphatic hcs 25 35 aromatics and 3 3 oxygenated hcs the gc ms analysis of the treated refinery wastewater samples by ctab bt showed that none of the parent hcs in the original refinery wastewater samples were present in the treated sample the gcms spectra fig 12b show no visible peaks which means that complete adsorption of hcs on ctab bt occurs and the adsorbent can efficiently remove hcs from wastewater this also confirms our results with model wastewater oil refinery real wastewater was also treated by simultaneous oxidation and adsorption using 1100 mg tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent for 500 ml sample at 30 c temperature and 60 min treatment time the results are shown in table 8 in the simultaneous oxidation adsorption experiment the cod of refinery wastewater dropped from 970 to 58 2 mg l this process resulted in a total reduction of 94 in cod in the 60 min reaction time which is higher and faster than simple adsorption 92 08 reduction in cod in 120 min in our previous study the gc ms analysis of refinery wastewater oxidized by uv tio2 system showed that not all hydrocarbons were completely removed during the photocatalytic oxidation but some hydrocarbons were partially oxidized and this process led to 93 3 cod removal 33 in the current use of tio2 ctab bt tio2 oxidizes hydrocarbons under uv light during this period some hydrocarbons are completely degraded but the resilient are partially oxidized and ctab bt is effectively adsorbed this why the sole photocatalytic oxidation takes 90 min to attain 93 3 cod removal in the refinery wastewater and the only adsorption with ctab bt brings about 94 cod removal in 120 min to complete at 40 c temperature on the other hand in the case of simultaneous oxidation and adsorption of tio2 ctab bt about 94 of cod can be removed in only 60 min at ambient temperature the cod removed in the simultaneous oxidation and adsorption process using tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent is also higher than many reported studies table 10 although some researchers report higher cod removal the current process is considered superior in terms of cost effectiveness and operation at mild reaction conditions i e 60 min 30 c and adsorbent to feed ratio of 2 2 g l as well as the cod of the feed sample is 970 mg l 4 conclusions the removal of hcs from refinery wastewater was studied by adsorption using ctab modified bentonite clay ctab bt and by simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption using hybrid tio2 ctab bt the optimum conditions for adsorption of hcs over ctab bt are the adsorbent dose of 800 mg 100 ml wastewater 40 c temperature and 120 min reaction time under which the removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene reached to 96 4 95 5 95 4 and 94 9 respectively the adsorption process followed langmuir adsorption isotherm model and pseudo first order kinetics thermodynamic results indicate that the adsorption of hcs was endothermic and spontaneous in nature under optimized conditions adsorption of refinery wastewater caused 92 06 decrease in cod simultaneous oxidation and adsorption of model wastewater using tio2 ctab bt resulted in about 92 removal of model hcs at 30 c and ph 3 in 60 min and a dose of 1100 mg for 500 ml of sample this process in case of refinery wastewater caused about 94 decrease in cod from the above results the advantage of simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption over simple adsorption is clear

adsorbent adsorption photocatalytic oxidation chemical oxygen demand 1 introduction petroleum industry has widened its spectrum in the past few decades due to the continuous growth of market demand and applications however in the petroleum industry more than 20 000 m3 per day of wastewater is generated 1 petroleum is composed of various types of hydrocarbons hcs where some of the compounds also contain sulfur nitrogen oxygen and metal containing compounds 2 in the process of refining into consumables crude oil is processed through a series of treatments 3 during which some hcs are discharged into the waste stream with the rapid development of industrialization the demand for petroleum products is increasing so the waste generated in the oil refining process is increasingly becoming the focus of environmentalists 4 petroleum refinery wastewater is a major cause of soil and water pollution as it contains high amount of toxic substances which cause severe health hazards 5 recently various techniques like biodegradation pyrolysis 6 solvent extraction 7 ultrasonic treatment 8 photocatalytic oxidation 9 incineration and adsorption have been developed for the treatment of petroleum wastewater however most of these technologies are not commercially applicable due to high cost and complicated mechanical requirements 10 treatments of refinery wastewater by adsorption have received great attention in recent years due to its low cost easy operation and availability of a large variety of adsorbents 11 metalorganic frameworks mofs due to its crystalline form permanent porosity thermal and chemical stability topology and easily modifiable structure are also used for the treatment of industrial wastewater another adsorbent which is widely used for the reclamation of wastewater is activated carbon 12 mineral clays are natural aluminosilicates having high surface area low cost and high mass transfer rates 11 which are extensively used for the removal of various contaminants from wastewater generally aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds present in wastewater being hydrophobic in nature do not easily absorb on the hydrophilic surface of the natural clays 13 however natural clays can be made organophilic by treatment with cationic or anionic surfactants during which the inorganic ions are exchanged with organic cations or anions 14 the interlayer spacing of the clay increases thereby facilitating the insertion of organic molecules organophilic clays are reported to show high efficiency for the removal of organic compounds from wastewater 15 bentonite clay is commonly used for surfactant modification because it is naturally abundant has high good ion exchange capacity high surface area the presence of micro and mesopores as well as because of its enhanced swelling properties 16 17 sodium forms of bentonite clay are generally used for the synthesis of organophilic clays because of its hydrophilic nature the crystal plane expansion of bentonite can be easily detected by x ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy 17 both cationic and anionic surfactant modified bentonite has been used for the removal of various types of organic contaminants such as textile dyes pesticides and humic acid etc 18 19 various organic pollutants in wastewater from oil refineries are degraded by chemical and enhanced oxidation processes 20 in chemical oxidation organic pollutants are oxidized by an oxidizing agent to water and carbon dioxide or converted to non toxic oxidized substances such as inorganic salts the oxidation can be achieved by hypochlorite fenton s reagent ultrasonic irradiation ozone persulfates and permanganates which produce a large number of oh radicals which in turn perform the oxidation reaction 21 chemical oxidation processes are widely used for the treatment of oily wastewater mater et al 22 reported that fenton reagent can effectively decrease the concentrations of phenols pahs and btexs in soil contaminated by oily sludge at low ph i e ph 3 in recent years ultrasonic irradiation is also used in the oxidation treatment of oily wastewater by sonication of water intermediate radicals such as oh hydrogen h hydroperoxyl ho2 can be generated which under sonication break aromatic and aliphatic petroleum hcs having complex structure and high molecular weight into simple hcs having high bioavailability and solubility by ultrasonication a number of petroleum hcs can be degraded such as aromatic compounds aliphatic hcs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs various phenols and poly aromatic hcs 23 combined ultrasonic and fenton oxidation showed high efficiency for the treatment of petroleum sludge 24 in recent years various advanced oxidation treatment methods have been used for the treatment of oily wastewater such as photocatalytic oxidation supercritical water oxidation scwo and wet air oxidation wao etc 4 in supercritical water oxidation processes water is used as a reaction medium above its critical point 375 c 22 1 mpa where oil aromatics and gases make a homogeneous phase and the oxidation process is done very quickly by converting organic pollutants into carbon dioxide and water 25 up to 92 reduction in chemical oxidation demand cod value of oily sludge can be achieved within 10 min by scwo process 26 in the wao process oxygen is used as an oxidant under high pressure and temperature to transform toxic organic compounds into water and carbon dioxide jing et al reported that up to 88 4 reduction in cod value of oily sludge could be achieved in 9 min by wao process 27 another promising oxidation technique is heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation which works on the activation of photo conductor surfaces e g titanium dioxide by light uv or sun light on industrial scale the application of advance oxidation methods is not feasible due to high mechanical requirements and high equipment and process cost 28 in the present study the removal of hcs from petroleum refinery wastewater has been studied by adsorption coupled with photocatalytic oxidation over surfactant modified bentonite clay the organophilic bentonite clay was prepared by treatment of natural bentonite with cationic anionic and neutral surfactants while the hybrid material was prepared by treating the surfactant modified bentonite clay with tio2 the prepared materials were applied for the removal of organic pollutants from the model and real refinery wastewater using only adsorption and adsorption coupled with oxidation reaction and various reaction parameters such as temperature time ph and hydrocarbon concentration were optimized the organophilic bentonite and hybrid materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx analysis x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infra red ft ir spectroscopy 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all reagents and chemicals used in this study were of analytical

suspended solids and then analyzed for preliminary characterization i e ph total dissolved solids tds suspended solids ss and cod according to standard procedures for examination of water and wastewater 29 ph was measured by using milwaukee mi150 ph meter turbidity was measured by hanna h188703 01 turbidity meter tds was measured by hanna tds meter model h198301 2 3 preparation and characterization of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt ctab was impregnated on bentonite clay using a method reported in the literature 14 500 ml distilled water was taken in a beaker and 15 g of bentonite clay added to it slowly under constant stirring at 250 rpm the mixture was stirred to homogenized for 20 min on a magnetic stirrer after 20 min concentrated sodium carbonate na2co3 solution was added to the slurry and stirred further at 80 c the slurry was cooled to room temperature for 24 h 0 1 m aqueous solution of ctab was added to the slurry stirred for 30 min and allowed to stand for 24 h the organophilic bentonite clay was collected by filtration and washed with water and then dried at 65 c for 36 h the organophilic clay was then crushed and sieved through a 200 mesh sieve and stored in a glass bottle natural bentonite and bentonite clay modified with ctab was coded as nat bt and ctab bt respectively in order to remove the organic impurities the bentonite clay was first treated with h2o2 30 about 15 g of bentonite clay was taken in a beaker and 50 ml of h2o2 was added to it the mixture was ultrasonicated for 6 h at room temperature using a 20 khz sonicator operated at 66 w the clay was recovered by vacuum filtration washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h after drying the bentonite clay was crushed to a particle size 100 mesh tio2 was loaded on bentonite clay by the wet impregnation method reported by laysandra et al 31 in a typical procedure about 1 8 g of tio2 is dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water and 15 g of bentonite is added to it under constant stirring the mixture was further stirred under 100 c for 1 h the mixture was further irradiated in a microwave reactor for 10 min at 500 w the mixture was finally filtered and the solid product recovered was dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h 32 tio2 bt was further modified with ctab surfactant using the procedure described above for preperation of ctab bt the adsorbents synthesized in the laboratory including ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt were characterized by ftir agilent cary 630 xrd analyses of raw bentonite surfactant modified bentonite clay and tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent was carried out using x ray diffractometer xpert philips sem analysis was performed through sem hitachi s 4700 while edx analysis was carried out through an x ray source connected to the same sem 2 4 adsorption experiments adsorption of hcs from the model wastewater was carried out in batch mode about 20 ml of model wastewater was taken in an erlenmeyer flask added a known amount of ctab bt and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for a certain time the adsorbent was recovered by filtration and the concentration of hcs removed was analyzed through hplc the effect of temperature time and adsorbent dose on the adsorption of hcs was also studied under the optimized conditions the refinery wastewater was treated using the same procedure as follows for model wastewater the amount of hcs removed was analyzed by cod analysis 2 5 simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption experiments in order to investigate the removal of hydrocarbon pollutants from the model and refinery wastewater combined oxidation and adsorption processes i e simultaneous oxidation and adsorption experiments were carried out using hybrid adsorbents loaded with oxidation catalyst initial experiments were carried on the model wastewater under optimized conditions in typical simultaneous experiment about 500 ml of the model wastewater was charged into the photoreactor we previously used 33 as shown in fig 1 known amount of hybrid adsorbent tio2 ctab bt was added to the sample and photo irradiated under continuous stirring for a given duration of time the sample was then filtered and the concentration of model hcs decreased in the filtrate after treatment was determined by hplc analysis the effect of dose of hybrid adsorbent and time was further investigated in a series of experiments carried out under different conditions the refinery wastewater was treated similarly under optimum conditions and the concentration of hcs removed was determined by cod analysis the graphical presentation of the stepwise treatment process is displayed in fig 2 2 6 product analyses analysis of the model waste hcs was carried out on shimadzu lc20at hplc using a c18 column the analysis was performed at 254 nm with 10 min run time a mixture of acetonitrile and distilled water 60 40 was used as the mobile phase model waste hydrocarbon concentration was determined by comparing the peak area of samples with the peak area of the respective standard gcms thermo scientific dsq ii gc ms attached with tr sms capillary column 30 m 0 25 μm 0 25 mm i d was used for analysis of refinery wastewater before and after adsorption helium gas at flow rate 1 ml min was used as carrier gas identification of hcs was carried out by matching the peaks in the chromatogram with relip and mainlib libraries 2 7 kinetic thermodynamic and adsorption studied adsorption rate was investigated by applying the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models to the adsorption data different adsorption isotherm models including langmuir isotherm and freundlich adsorption isotherm were applied to the adsorption data in order to investigate the nature of adsorption the spontaneity thermal effect and feasibility of the adsorption system were studied by calculating different thermodynamic parameters such as the entropy change δs enthalpy change δh and free energy change δg 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical analysis of refinery wastewater initial characterization of the samples was carried out by determining various parameters including cod ss density turbidity electrical conductivity ec and ph according to the standard procedure of water and wastewater examination the results are shown in table 1 the data shows that although the density of the waste sample is close to 1 g cm3 the ph and cod values of the sample are high i e 9 2 and 970 mg l respectively according to environmental health safety guidelines 2009 the permissible limit for cod and ph for wastewater is 150 mg l and for ph limit is 6 9 respectively 29 the high turbidity of the sample indicates the presence of colloidal suspensions whereas high ec shows the presence of ions which is an indication of the high salts content likewise the values of tds and suspended solids are also higher than the allowed ranges this indicates that these parameters are out of the permissible range and the wastewater is not suitable for direct discharge into the environment 3 2 characterization ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt 3 2 1 ftir analysis the ftir spectrum of ctab fig 3 a shows the characteristic peaks corresponding to symmetric vibrations of ch in ch3 and ch2 groups at 2851 and 2920 cm 1 respectively while the peaks at 1469 and at 1372 cm 1 correspond to the asymmetric bending vibrations in ch of methyl and methylene groups 34 the ftir spectrum of ctab bt fig 3b shows the characteristic peaks of bentonite for oh groups at 3650 cm 1and sio at 1010 cm 1 whereas the peaks corresponding to the methyl and methylene ch of the cetyltrimethyl group are positioned at 2920 and 2835 cm 1 additionally the peak centered at 1475 shows nh bonds of the ammonium group 35 it can be concluded from these results that cetyltrimethylammonium cations are successfully incorporated on the surface of bentonite clay after its modification with ctab 36 the ftir spectrum of tio2 ctab bt is shown in fig 3c the spectrum shows the characteristic absorption bands of bentonite clay structure ctab surfactant and tio2 at their respective positions major absorption bands positioned at 3620 3343 1113 and 911 cm 1 corresponded to oh starching vibrations sio h stretching si o si stretching vibration and al oh vibration characteristics of bentonite clay 37 peaks corresponding to the methyl and methylene ch of the cetyltrimethylammonium group are positioned at 2920 and 2835 cm 1 whereas the peak centered at 1475 shows nh bonds of the ammonium group 35 strong absorption at 500 cm 1 may be assigned to tio bond vibrations in the tio2 lattice 38 these results show the presence of the configuration of tio2 ctab bt which confirms the successful preparation of the material 3 2 2 sem analysis the sem micrographs of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt are shown in fig 4 a and b it can be seen from the micrographs that ctab bt shows a different morphology from tio2 ctab bt the surface of ctab bt seems highly foliated layered and spongy numerous cracks and caves can also be observed on the surface the micrograph of tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent shows a rough surface and non uniform surface with distinct grains of tio2 widely dispersed on the surface this suggests the successful incorporation of tio2 particles on the surface of ctab bt 3 2 3 edx analysis the elemental composition of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt was analyzed by edx analysis the edx spectra of the samples are shown in fig s1 supplementary materials whereas the elemental composition as weight of elements is given in table 2 results indicated that the major elements present in the bt clay include si al o fe na mg k ca and s it has been reported that bentonite consists of a number of clay minerals out of which the montmorillonite is the most widespread having formula of mg ca o a12o3 5sio2 nh2o 39 the most abundant oxides in the natural bentonite include sio2 al2o3 fe2o3 whereas other oxides include cao na2o k2o tio2 etc additionally sulfur may also be present as sulfate or pyrite 15 the elemental profile of ctab bt agrees with the literature however the high amount of c in ctab bt confirms that it contains organic molecules in the form of surfactant anion the edx analysis of tio2 ctab bt shows that it contains high weight of c o al si na and ti which agree with the theoretical composition of the individual components of the bentonite clay ctab and tio2 3 2 4 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of ctab bt and tio2 ctab bt are shown in fig 5 a and b indicating that the main peaks are located at 20 95 26 75 and 50 20 in 2θ confirming the presence of smectite 12 whereas the peaks at 2θ of 14 5 and 36 40 corresponds to quartz varying intensity peaks at 2θ of 14 43 29 10 40 92 44 50 59 96 and 65 06 indicates kaolinite and montmorillonite is shown by its characteristic peaks 17 major characteristic peaks of rutile phase tio2 peaks at 2θ of 27 36 and 55 whereas anatase phase tio2 is indicated by peaks at 2θ of 25 and 48 and both phases agree with standard cards i e jcpds 88 1175 and jcpds 84 1286 respectively 40 the xrd results confirm the structure of tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent bentonite crystal structure consists of an octahedral alumina sheet between two tetrahedral silica sheets having oxygen as the common atoms between the layers such three layered units are stacked one above the other having oxygen atoms between the layers the isomorphic replacement of al 3 for si 4 in the tetrahedral layer and mg 2 or other cations for al 3 in the octahedral layer produce a permanent negative charge in the layers which can be attributed to the exchange of various cations by the bentonite 41 the bentonite clay is hydrophilic in nature due to which it is not suitable for the adsorption of non polar organic molecules however the exchange of inorganic cations by organic cations such as surfactant molecules in the interlayer s of bentonite enhances its adsorption efficiency for organic compounds 35 therefore it may be suggested that cetyltrimethylammonium cations have replaced inorganic cations such as na and k in the bentonite interlayer and the long alkyl groups of organic cations can help to capture petroleum hydrocarbons 3 3 removal of model hcs by adsorption over ctab bt 3 3 1 effect of adsorption parameters the absorption of hcs from the model wastewater over ctab bt was investigated at different conditions of adsorbent dose temperature adsorption time in order to optimize the conditions for maximum removal of hcs using 100 ml of the hcs solution initially the adsorption experiments were carried out for 100 ml model wastewater at room temperature and 1 h adsorption time using different weights of ctab bt as adsorbent doses ranging from 100 to 1000 mg results are indicated in fig 6 which shows that the removal of all model aromatic hcs i e benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene increases with increasing adsorbent dose and the maximum adsorption of all hcs was attained by 800 mg of ctab bt and it decreased with further increase in the dose this suggests that the optimum amount of ctab bt required for maximum removal of hcs from model wastewater is 800 mg the increase in adsorbent dose provides more unsaturated sites on the surface of ctab bt which leads to increased adsorption of hcs 41 in case of higher adsorbent dosage the excess of adsorbents may aggregate which can limit the availability of the free surface for adsorption 42 although all model hcs showed nearly the same level of removal however the adsorption of naphthalene was lower than benzene and phenol whereas those of toluene were higher among all which may be due to the complexity of the structure the effect of temperature on the removal of hcs from the model wastewater was studied under different temperatures i e 30 35 40 45 and 50 c using 0 8 g of adsorbent for 100 ml of feed volume and a contact time of 1 h results are shown in fig 7 the data shows that the removal of all hcs in the model wastewater linearly increases with an increase in adsorption temperature from 25 to 40 c with further increase in temperature to 45 and 50 c the removal of hcs does not increase but remains constant at higher temperature hence the optimum temperature is 40 c generally increasing temperature may result in the swelling effect of the adsorbent structure due to which the bulky organic molecules may easily penetrate to the adsorption sites thereby increasing the adsorption of hcs 41 the effect of contact time on the hcs adsorption was studied at 15 min intervals in the range of 15 165 min the results shown in fig 8 show that the adsorption of hcs increases linearly with the increase of adsorption time and the maximum removal rate of hcs about 95 96 is achieved at a contact time of 120 min longer reaction time provides more effective collisions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules so the total adsorption capacity increases linearly with the increase in contact time beyond 120 min the surface of ctab bt is saturated with hcs hence no further increase in net removal is observed these results indicate that the optimum conditions for removal of hcs from model wastewater are 0 8 g 100 ml ctab bt to model wastewater feed ratio 40 c adsorption temperature and 120 min contact time under optimum conditions removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene was 96 4 95 5 95 4 and 94 9 respectively the hplc chromatogram of the model wastewater before and after adsorption is displayed in fig s2 supplementary data from which a marked decrease in the peak area corresponding to these hcs can be observed the 120 min adsorption time for highly efficient removal of these hcs is much shorter than those reported in the literature for similar hcs using ctac modified activated carbon and bentonite clay 43 thereby marking the current study superior and more feasible for practical applications 3 3 2 adsorption kinetic isotherms and thermodynamic evaluation adsorption mechanism of hcs over ctab bt was investigated by applying pseudo first order 44 and pseudo second order kinetic model 45 to the adsorption data fig s3 a d shows the pseudo first order kinetic plots for the adsorption of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene over ctab bt it can be observed that a linear plot is obtained for pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 of above 0 850 whereas in the case of pseudo second order kinetic fig s4 a d for all model hcs non linear plots are obtained from t qt vs time t with r2 is less than 0 477 table 3 these results confirm that the pseudo first order kinetic model shows a satisfactory correlation of hydrocarbon adsorption onto ctab bt langmuir isotherm equation 46 and freundlich adsorption isotherm models 47 were applied to investigate the nature of the hcs adsorption over ctab bt the calculated langmuir constants k1 and qm and freundlich constants n and kf as well as the coefficients of correlation r2 for both isotherms are given in table 4 whereas fig s5 a d and s6 a d shows the plots of langmuir and freundlich isotherms for hcs adsorption over ctab respectively the results reveal that the adsorption data better fit to langmuir adsorption isotherms indicating the heterogeneous multilayer adsorption of hcs in the interlayer galleries of the ctab bt the spontaneity thermal effect and feasibility of the adsorption system were determined from the variation of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant kd with temperature various thermodynamic factors such as the entropy change δs enthalpy change δh and free energy change δg were calculated the results given in table 5 show that the positive values of δh and δs indicate the endothermic properties of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene on ctab while the negative value of δg confirms the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process an increase in the δg value indicates that the degree of spontaneity also increases at higher temperatures 3 4 removal of hc s by simultaneous oxidation and adsorption using tio2 ctab bt in order to evaluate the effect of combined photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption on the removal of hcs from the model and refinery wastewater the model wastewater was photo irradiated in the photoreactor in the presence of tio2 ctab bt under different dosage and contact time initially the removal of model hc s i e benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene from model wastewater was investigated under uv irradiation at 30 c temperature ph 3 and 1 h reaction time using different weights of tio2 ctab bt ranging from 100 to 1200 mg per 500 ml of water sample the results are shown in fig 9 which shows that as the weight of tio2 ctab bt increases to 1000 mg the removal of model hc increases linearly however as the weight increases further no positive effects are observed statistical analysis revealed significant differences among pollutants dosage as well as their interactions table 6 among the hcs maximum removal of benzene 90 83 toluene 91 16 phenol 93 26 and naphthalene 89 20 was attained under 1000 mg tio2 ctab bt dosage table 7 since in these experiments tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent was used in which ctab bt not only acts as a support for tio2 photocatalyst but also function as an adsorbent therefore as the weight of tio2 ctab bt increases not only the adsorption sites increase but the weight of tio2 also increases which enhances the oxidation process removal of hcs from model wastewater was further studied under different contact times ranging from 10 to 80 min using 1100 mg tio2 ctab bt per 500 ml sample the results are shown in fig 10 which shows that the removal of hcs increases linearly with the increase of reaction time and reaches the maximum within 60 min in the reaction time of 30 min the removal rates of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene were about 62 7 59 2 52 and 53 respectively which increased to 94 1 92 6 93 2 and 91 8 in 60 min with further increase in the reaction time the decrease in the concentration of hcs remains constant the contribution of individual photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption in removal of hydrocarbon pollutants was investigated in model refinery wastewater results indicated in fig 11 revealed that incase of photocatalytic oxidation in the presence of tio2 the removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene was about 60 5 55 7 59 8 and 60 6 respectively in 60 min reaction time whereas in case of simple adsorption over ctab bt the removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene was about 47 5 46 9 47 2 and 46 6 respectively in 60 min on the other hand in simultaneous or combined photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption over tio2 ctab bt the removal of same hydrocarbons in 60 min was found to be 94 1 92 6 93 2 and 91 8 respectively this indicated the synergistic effect of combined photooxidation and adsorption process furthermore as described above in section 3 4 1 in case of simple adsorption over ctab bt about 94 of all model hydrocarbons are removed in 120 min at 40 c under 800 mg adsorbent dose likewise we have shown that near complete degradation of the model hydrocarbons through photocatalytic oxidation tio2 uv system required 90 min 33 however through simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption using tio2 ctab bt the model hcs are almost completely removed in just 60 min and at a temperature of 30 c this shows the clear advantage of simultaneous oxidation and adsorption process over simple photocatalytic oxidation and simple adsorption in which the hc s removal efficiency has been increased in a short contact time the same level of hc s removal which occurs in 90 and 120 min in case of photocatalytic oxidation using tio2 and adsorption ctab bt respectively it occurs merely in 60 min in case of simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption using tio2 ctab bt 3 4 1 process mechanism it is clear from the above results that the simultaneous oxidation and adsorption over tio2 ctab bt is more efficient in the removal of hcs than the simple oxidation and adsorption by tio2 and ctab bt respectively the mechanism of photocatalytic oxidation has been widely studied in literature 33 in which highly reactive species i e hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 are produced by photocatalyst from water molecules during excitation of electrons from valance band to conduction band in the presence uv radiations these radicals readily oxidize the hydrocarbons pollutants in the wastewater to co2 h2o and other oxidation products it may be suggested that during this process some hcs are completely oxidized while others are partially oxidized in the aqueous phase in the presence of tio2 in the case of partially oxidized compounds the adsorption efficiency over ctab bt increases the increased adsorption of oxygenated hcs may be explained based on the high binding affinity of the oxygenated functional groups on the ctab bt surface through electrostatic interaction 48 when using cationic surfactants to modify the surface of bentonite the cations of the surfactants bind to the anions on the clay surface through electrostatic interactions 49 50 a single layer of surfactant on the clay surface i e monolayer or hemimicelle is formed when the surfactant concentration c is less than the cation exchange capacity cec of the clay i e c cec in case of c cec bilayer or admicelle is formed 51 the adsorption capacity of the surfactant modified clays has been reported to be enhanced multifold than the original 52 the cationic surfactants with alkyl groups cationic group and counterions form a cationic layer on the clay surface by hydrophobic interaction and cation exchange it has been reported that the positive surface can be balanced by the negative counter ions which increases the affinity of cationic surfactant modified adsorbents for the adsorption of anionic hcs 53 54 in the process of photocatalytic oxidation partially oxidized functional groups are formed ionized to form oxyanions and interact with the cation surface of ctab bt through electrostatic interaction in the same manner as explained for the retention of oxyanions by the surfactant modified adsorbent 55 hydrophobic effects 56 electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding also play important roles in such cases and the π electrons of the aromatic hcs rings also interact with the ammonium center of the surfactant 57 58 leading to the adsorption of aromatic compounds multiple hydrogen bonding between the alkyl or aromatic groups and the c or n of the surfactants are been reported to involve in the adsorption of organic molecules over alkylammonium modified adsorbents 59 60 as mentioned in the previous section the adsorption of model hcs follows langmuir adsorption isotherm hence it may be suggested that the monolayer adsorption proceeds in the interlayer galleries of the ctab bt 3 5 treatment of oil refinery real wastewater under the optimal conditions the wastewater from the refinery was treated by adsorption in batch mode i e the temperature was 40 c the contact time was 120 min and 0 8 g of ctab bt was used for 100 ml of feed water the results are shown in table 8 indicating that the cod of the refinery wastewater is 970 mg l and the cod drops to about 77 mg l after being absorbed by ctab bt for 120 min therefore during the adsorption process it was observed that the cod of the refinery wastewater was reduced by approximately 92 the adsorption efficiency of the ctab bt can be attributed to the cationic nature of the surfactant since the cation exchange capacity of the bentonite clay is higher due to which more organic cations are incorporated into the bentonite the presence of alkyl groups on the surface of bentonite enhances its affinity for adsorption of organic compounds the high adsorption efficiency of ctab bt has also been reported for various other types of organic contaminants such as dyes humic acid pesticides etc 61 the gc ms chromatograms of the refinery wastewater samples before and after the adsorption treatment are shown in fig 12 a b and the details of the hcs in the refinery wastewater are shown in table 9 the gcms data shows that the refinery wastewater contained about 2 22 cyclic aliphatic hcs 25 35 aromatics and 3 3 oxygenated hcs the gc ms analysis of the treated refinery wastewater samples by ctab bt showed that none of the parent hcs in the original refinery wastewater samples were present in the treated sample the gcms spectra fig 12b show no visible peaks which means that complete adsorption of hcs on ctab bt occurs and the adsorbent can efficiently remove hcs from wastewater this also confirms our results with model wastewater oil refinery real wastewater was also treated by simultaneous oxidation and adsorption using 1100 mg tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent for 500 ml sample at 30 c temperature and 60 min treatment time the results are shown in table 8 in the simultaneous oxidation adsorption experiment the cod of refinery wastewater dropped from 970 to 58 2 mg l this process resulted in a total reduction of 94 in cod in the 60 min reaction time which is higher and faster than simple adsorption 92 08 reduction in cod in 120 min in our previous study the gc ms analysis of refinery wastewater oxidized by uv tio2 system showed that not all hydrocarbons were completely removed during the photocatalytic oxidation but some hydrocarbons were partially oxidized and this process led to 93 3 cod removal 33 in the current use of tio2 ctab bt tio2 oxidizes hydrocarbons under uv light during this period some hydrocarbons are completely degraded but the resilient are partially oxidized and ctab bt is effectively adsorbed this why the sole photocatalytic oxidation takes 90 min to attain 93 3 cod removal in the refinery wastewater and the only adsorption with ctab bt brings about 94 cod removal in 120 min to complete at 40 c temperature on the other hand in the case of simultaneous oxidation and adsorption of tio2 ctab bt about 94 of cod can be removed in only 60 min at ambient temperature the cod removed in the simultaneous oxidation and adsorption process using tio2 ctab bt hybrid adsorbent is also higher than many reported studies table 10 although some researchers report higher cod removal the current process is considered superior in terms of cost effectiveness and operation at mild reaction conditions i e 60 min 30 c and adsorbent to feed ratio of 2 2 g l as well as the cod of the feed sample is 970 mg l 4 conclusions the removal of hcs from refinery wastewater was studied by adsorption using ctab modified bentonite clay ctab bt and by simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption using hybrid tio2 ctab bt the optimum conditions for adsorption of hcs over ctab bt are the adsorbent dose of 800 mg 100 ml wastewater 40 c temperature and 120 min reaction time under which the removal of benzene toluene phenol and naphthalene reached to 96 4 95 5 95 4 and 94 9 respectively the adsorption process followed langmuir adsorption isotherm model and pseudo first order kinetics thermodynamic results indicate that the adsorption of hcs was endothermic and spontaneous in nature under optimized conditions adsorption of refinery wastewater caused 92 06 decrease in cod simultaneous oxidation and adsorption of model wastewater using tio2 ctab bt resulted in about 92 removal of model hcs at 30 c and ph 3 in 60 min and a dose of 1100 mg for 500 ml of sample this process in case of refinery wastewater caused about 94 decrease in cod from the above results the advantage of simultaneous photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption over simple adsorption is clear these hybrid adsorbents developed in the current study which can be used for the treatment of wastewater generated at petroleum oil refineries and automobile service stations funding information the

13356,application of symbiotic system of filamentous algae and submerged plants in constructed wetlands is expected to further improve the sewage treatment performance unfortunately due to the complexity of their relationship researches on the combined purification of water quality by filamentous algae and submerged plants are still in the initial stage and relative results are quite different herein we chose spirogyra as the model filamentous algae to construct a symbiotic system of spirogyra ceratophyllum demersum on the basis of screening suitable submerged plants according to the monitoring of multiple physiological indicators of filamentous algae and submerged plants in the symbiotic system under the conditions of biomass of filamentous algae 3 5 4 g l nh3 n concentration 6 22 mg l tp concentration 0 66 mg l neutral or weakly alkaline ph value the inhibition effect between filamentous algae and submerged plants was minimal based on the optimization the removal rate of nh3 n and tp could reach 91 53 and 86 52 which were higher than systems consisted of several submerged plants or submerged plant and other species in addition under the dynamic water condition which was closer to the real environment the system operated in proper flow rate could still efficiently treat the pollutants moreover the improvement effect on do of sewage in system was better compared with that of the static water system the research results provided a new idea for further improving the treatment efficiency of constructed wetland and theoretical basis for the combined purification by submerged plants and algae in eutrophic water keywords filamentous algae submerged plants symbiotic system water quality purification physiological indicators 1 introduction as a remarkable ecological restoration technology constructed wetland has become an effective way to solve the eutrophication of water in china due to its high efficiency and environmentally friendly features 1 submerged plants are often selected in constructed wetlands 2 because their epidermal cells do not have hard cuticle benefiting from the highly developed aerenchyma submerged plants can efficiently absorb nutrients from the water and live well even without sufficient dissolved oxygen andrzej et al used the submerged plant elodea nuttallii to efficiently treat 25 wastewater the initial wastewater content in the mixture of wastewater and tap water the removal rates of tn and codmn reached 52 9 and 43 6 respectively 3 luo et al tested the effects of five kinds of aquatic plants on sewage treatment they found that the removal rates of nh3 n and tp in ceratophyllum demersum wetland were the highest which were 76 24 and 77 55 respectively 4 in order to improve the performance of the constructed wetland for wastewater treatment researchers enriched the biodiversity on the basis of single submerged plant systems constructing combination systems of multiple submerged plants or symbiotic systems of submerged plants and other species aiming at the problem of low treatment efficiency of constructed wetland in winter guo et al added submerged plant benthos system to the wetland compared with the traditional wetland without this system the tn removal rate reached 54 73 and the nh3 n removal efficiency increased by 29 51 thus strengthening the wetland performance in winter 5 xu et al constructed a combination system of submerged plants and microorganisms in which the root exudates and oxygen released by submerged plants helped to enhance enzyme activity and effectively remove pollutants especially the removal rates of tn and tp reached 65 27 and 79 10 respectively 6 xu et al also established a symbiotic system of submerged plants and phytoplankton by adjusting the influencing factors such as flow rate and water depth to improve the effluent quality realizing the goal of the removal rate of no3 n up to 65 and nh3 n up to 90 7 organisms directly affects the treatment effect of constructed wetlands so researchers devote themselves to selecting species with better enrichment performance among them the root specific surface area of filamentous algae can be up to thousands of cm2 g 1 which is much higher than that of herbaceous plants and grass plants below 20 cm2 g 1and 200 cm2 g 1 respectively it is indicated that the absorptive capacity of filamentous algae to pollutants is significantly higher than that of traditional constructed wetland plants moreover filamentous algae are also easy to be separated from water it is observed that filamentous algae are of great potential for nitrogen and phosphorus removal 8 at the same time filamentous algae can also provide a good living environment for bacteria epiphytic algae protozoa rotifers and micro crustaceans forming a complex food chain and a stable water quality 9 11 kim et al designed an algal bed with filamentous algae as the dominant organism to treat wastewater and the nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were 85 9 and 65 8 respectively 12 therefore it is expected to further improve the sewage treatment performance of constructed wetlands by the combining system of filamentous algae and submerged plants however when submerged plants and filamentous algae exist in the same system their interactions cannot be ignored studies have shown that the density of algae biomass are interdependent with the large plants submerged plants will affect the growth of algae which impacts the food chain energy flows 13 and excess filamentous algae will not only compete with submerged plant hindering the normal growth of submerged plant but also inhibit the photosynthesis of submerged plant by shading effects pizarro et al 14 found that the concentrations of nutrient in lakes were significantly positively correlated with the biomass of filamentous algae more content of nitrogen and phosphorus would significantly increase the biomass of filamentous algae leading to the decline of submerged plants in addition submerged plants can produce allelochemicals which also inhibits the growth of algae 15 however such interaction between submerged plants and algae is affected by abiotic environmental factors such as algae plants ratio ratio of filamentous algae and submerged plants nutrient salt and water velocity etc 16 18 therefore the regulation of system parameters becomes the key to reduce the inhibiting interactions between the two species maximizing the treatment efficiency of the symbiotic system unfortunately due to the complexity of their relationship researches on the combined purification of water quality by filamentous algae and submerged plants are still in the initial stage and relative results are quite different therefore in this study spirogyra is chosen as the model filamentous algae to screen the suitable submerged plant regulation of some key parameters including algae plants ratio nutrient concentration ph value flow rate was realized through monitoring the physiological indicators of submerged plant and spirogyra such as chlorophyll malondialdehyde enzyme activity then the optimal filamentous algae submerged plant symbiotic system was used for the wastewater purification the research results provided a new idea for further improving the treatment efficiency of constructed wetland and theoretical basis for the combined purification by submerged plants and algae in eutrophic water 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture conditions spirogyra was obtained from dongyuan pool of nanjing tech university holgland medium was used to culture in an illumination incubator with illumination intensity of 5500 lx and light to dark ratio of 16 8 the experimental water was divided into static experimental sewage and dynamic experimental sewage in order to avoid interference as far as possible the simulated sewage was prepared according to the inferior v water quality in the environmental quality standard for surface water gb3838 2002 the chemical oxygen demand was prepared with glucose ammonium chloride and sodium nitrate were used as nitrogen source potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used as phosphorus source main pollutants and concentration in the simulated sewage were listed as follows codmn 15 52 1 48 mg l tn 8 33 0 41 mg l nh3 n 4 36 0 19 mg l tp 0 84 0 05 mg l 2 2 experimental facility the diagram of static experimental device was shown in fig 1 the volume of the plastic bucket 37 cm 32 cm 28 cm was 25 l the bottom of the bucket was paved with 5 cm thick coarse sand and 2 cm gravel submerged plants were planted above fig 2 was the dynamic experimental device diagram the model device was divided into test area and water distribution area the test area was 0 4 m in length 0 15 m in width 0 06 m2 in area the total depth was 0 5 m and the water depth was 0 35 0 40 m the device was filled with matrix the water distribution area was 0 1 m in length and 0 15 m in width which was fixed with a submersible pump the outlet water tank was a row of openings with a diameter of 1 cm the outlet water hole was covered with a layer of silk screen nylon material which was cleaned regularly in the typical experiment the submersible pump in the water distribution area was used to drive the simulated sewage from the water distribution bucket into the inlet area of the test area so that the sewage flows into the test area evenly sewage circularly flowed into the water tank through gravity flow the device was illuminated with a halogen lamp light intensity 5500 lx and the ambient temperature was 25 1 c 2 3 effects of filamentous algae biomass on submerged plants several submerged plants ceratophyllum demersum myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans were selected to be tested in the symbiotic system the biomass of each filamentous algae was 100 g calculated after suction by filter paper and that of filamentous algae was controlled at 50 g 100 g and 200 g calculated after extruding water and suction by filter paper mean the algae plants ratios were 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 respectively at the same time a single submerged plant system was set as the control group 20 l of simulated sewage was added to each system the experiment lasted for 16 days and the sewage concentration remained unchanged the initial physiological indexes of the three submerged plants were tested which were listed in table 1 2 4 effects of filamentous algae biomass on symbiotic system 5 g l submerged plants and 2 5 g l 3 g l 3 5 g l 4 g l 4 5 g l 5 g l filamentous algae were used to constructed symbiotic system algae plants ratio was 1 2 3 5 7 10 4 5 9 10 1 1 respectively at the same time a single submerged plant system was set as the control group the prepared simulated sewage containing only nitrogen and phosphorus was added respectively 2 5 effects of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations on the symbiotic system during the laboratory static test a single submerged plant system was set as the control group simulated sewage with different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus table 2 were tested the experiment lasted for 16 days 2 6 effects of ph on symbiotic systems five groups a b c d e with different ph values of 5 10 0 05 6 11 0 03 7 19 0 08 8 17 0 06 and 9 11 0 04 were tested respectively at the same time a single submerged plant system was set as control group the experiment lasted for 16 days 2 7 measurement index and method at the beginning of each experiment a 500 ml conical flask was used to collect water samples at a fixed sampling point in the test area at 10 00 am for sampling the determination method of water quality indexes was strictly in accordance with the steps specified in the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis method fourth edition table s1 in supplementary material monitoring methods of physiological indexes were described in paragraph s1 in supplementary material 2 8 data analysis spss19 0 software was used for statistical analysis of the experimental data by one way analysis of variance anova when the results reached significance p 0 05 it was considered that there might be direct or indirect interaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of submerged plants when the regeneration of host plants and the predation of zooplankton cannot completely limit the increase of filamentous algae biomass they would have a negative impact on host submerged plants therefore it was necessary to select suitable submerged plants to minimize the influence in the construction of symbiotic system herein three typical submerged plants ceratophyllum demersum myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans were selected to construct a symbiotic system of algae plants with spirogyra since chlorophyll reflected photosynthesis 19 soluble protein reflected the adaptation status of metabolic pathway 20 malondialdehyde mda one of the final products of membrane lipid peroxidation was an important indicator of physiological stress 21 and antioxidant enzyme reflected the status of plants under ammonia stress 22 we chose chlorophyll soluble protein mda peroxidase activity pod and catalase activity cat as biological physiological indicators to illustrate the interactions between filamentous algae and submerged plants as shown in fig 3 in the symbiotic system of ceratophyllum demersum filamentous algae the chlorophyll fig 3a and mda fig 3c of ceratophyllum demersum in the control group and the experimental group algae plants ratio group 1 2 and 1 1 were basically higher than the initial state and the soluble protein fig 3b showed a trend of increase and then decline at the end of the experiment the four groups showed significant differences p 0 05 the chlorophyll and soluble protein increased the most in the control group reaching 60 47 and 46 28 respectively however in the group of 1 2 ratio the chlorophyll and soluble protein contents increased slightly reaching 47 54 and 16 03 respectively and with the increasing of ratio continually the chlorophyll and soluble protein in 2 1 ratio group both decreased indicating that the chlorophyll synthesis of filamentous algae was blocked the metabolism of the organism was also inhibited thus affecting the normal growth of ceratophyllum demersum as an indicator to measure the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation mda had little change in the control group and 1 2 ratio group both of which were about 1 0 mg g however the increase of ratio of 1 1 and 2 1 groups reached 91 01 and 222 64 respectively at the end of the experiment the algae plants ratio of 2 1 group was 2 39 times that of the control group the results indicated that the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation positively related with the filamentous algae biomass fig 3 d and e reflected the changes of pod and cat the data showed that the activities of pod and cat fluctuate significantly during the experimental period the pod activity in plants increased continuously in the first 8 days indicating that the in vivo scavenging mechanism was activated the ratio of 1 1 and 2 1 of algae plants increased significantly the enzyme activity of the four groups showed significant differences p 0 05 at the end of the experiment the increase of pod activity in the control group was only 1 39 while the increase of the ratio 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 groups was 44 62 84 70 and 106 20 respectively cat activity of control group and algae plants ratio 1 2 group was relatively stable while algae plants ratio 2 1 group fluctuated the activity reached the peak on the 8th day and decreased sharply in the later period cat activity increased by 131 71 at the end of the experiment which was 1 64 times that of the control group in addition the effects of filamentous algae biomass on the physiological indexes of myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans were determined by the same method as shown in fig s1 and s2 in supplementary material the similar results showed that the chlorophyll and soluble protein of myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans decreased under the influence of filamentous algae which was caused by protein degradation 23 or fracture caused by reactive oxygen poisoning 24 when plants were stressed by the external environment due to the increase of reactive oxygen species membrane lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids pufa in the biofilm would occur in cells which would eventually decompose to produce mda when the plants were under greater adverse effects mda content would accumulate more 25 in addition the activities of pod and cat in the three submerged plants fluctuated to a certain extent which indicated that filamentous algae had a certain stress on the growth of submerged plants and the response time of different plants was different on account of competition of nitrogen and phosphorus between filamentous algae and submerged plant competition as well as the weakening absorption of light by physical intertwining and allelopathic chemicals secreted by filamentous algae the degree of the in vivo membrane lipid peroxidation exacerbated in submerged plant cell therefore oxygen free radicals in the body produced which caused the response of antioxidant enzyme system data showed that the increase of filamentous algae biomass the growth of submerged plants was affected in different degrees according to the variation range of specific physiological indexes the effect on ceratophyllum demersum was relatively small therefore in this study ceratophyllum demersum was selected as a representative submerged plant to construct a model symbiotic system with filamentous algae 3 2 construction and optimization of symbiotic system 3 2 1 filamentous algae biomass the effects of filamentous algae biomass on ceratophyllum demersum were shown in fig 4 a c at the end of the experiment the contents of chlorophyll and soluble protein with 4 5 g l and 5 g l algae were significantly lower than those in control group and 2 5 4 g l algal groups p 0 05 this was because the competition for nutrients and light between plants and algae especially the absorption of inorganic carbon 26 as for mda 5 g l algal group had the most significant increase indicating the largest stress on the ceratophyllum demersum fig 4 d and e reflected the change of antioxidant enzyme activity of ceratophyllum demersum at the end of the experiment it was basically unchanged in pod activity of the 2 5 3 5 g l algal groups p 0 05 while a significant difference emerged in 4 5 g l algal groups on the other hand cat activity of the six experimental groups fluctuated obviously among which the 5 g l algal group was the highest data analysis showed that when the biomass of filamentous algae was controlled at 3 5 4 g l ceratophyllum demersum was not greatly affected which could be used as the optimal range of subsequent algae biomass 3 2 2 nutrition concentration the total chlorophyll content was used to characterize the biomass of filamentous algae as shown in fig s3 in supplementary material with increase of nutrient concentration the total chlorophyll content of filamentous algae significantly became higher in the condition of 8 27 mg l nh3 n and 0 82 mg l tp the total chlorophyll and its growth rate reached the highest phosphorus was the nutrients for algae growth high concentration of nutrients can promote the growth of filamentous algae 27 under the exposure of different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus the physiological indexes of ceratophyllum demersum in the symbiotic system also changed correspondingly according to fig s4 in supplementary material chlorophyll soluble protein and mda were significantly affected by nutrient concentration p 0 05 due to the increase of nutrient concentration the growth of excess filamentous algae had a negative impact on plants moreover studies had also shown that algae blooms can lead to the decrease of chlorophyll a content in plant leaves 28 with the increase of nutrient concentration the mda of ceratophyllum demersum gradually increased which verified that nutrient concentration had adverse effects on the growth of submerged plants combined with the similar analysis of pod and cat fig s5 in supplementary material 6 22 mg l nh3 n and 0 66 mg l tp were the optimal nutrients concentrations for the alga plant symbiotic system 3 2 3 ph value ph value was also a key parameter need to be regulated as shown in fig s6 in supplementary material overly acidic water had a strong stress on large filamentous algae with the increased of ph the growth state of filamentous algae became better algal color green kelp silk smooth when ph was 9 11 the chlorophyll of filamentous algae decreased indicating that higher ph was also unfavorable to filamentous algae similarly we investigated the change of physiological index of ceratophyllum demersum under different ph which were shown in fig s7 in supplementary material with the increase of ph the chlorophyll and soluble protein of ceratophyllum demersum presented a downward trend after a rising while mda showed a trend of obvious decline after a slow increase low ph water had obvious stress effect on submerged plants 29 when ph was 5 10 the stem and leaves of ceratophyllum demersum turn brown and gradually lose their original morphology the soluble protein showed the same change rule with chlorophyll at the same time mda in the acidic water was higher than that in the alkaline ones acidic conditions made the cell membrane of ceratophyllum demersum be damaged greatly the cell permeability was enhanced and the degree of in vivo membrane lipid peroxidation was increased therefore ceratophyllum demersum was suitable to live in neutral and weak alkaline water the effects of different ph values on the growth of ceratophyllum demersum were also reflected in the activities of antioxidant enzymes pod and cat and there were significant differences between the experimental groups p 0 05 as shown in fig s8 in supplementary material under the condition of low ph the pod and cat activity of submerged plant were high after adding filamentous algae the adverse effects on ceratophyllum demersum was enhanced which was due to the synergistic effect of low ph and filamentous algae 30 the activities of pod and cat were relatively stable under higher ph values however due to the alkaline ph value was conducive to the growth of filamentous algae the influence on ceratophyllum demersum was slightly enhanced compared with the neutral condition 3 3 sewage purification performance of symbiotic system 3 3 1 removal of nitrogen and phosphorus fig 5 showed the removal rates of nh3 n and tp by the symbiotic system under different filamentous algae biomass the removal rates of nh3 n and tp by the single submerged plant group were 51 16 and 39 57 respectively while those of the six symbiotic groups with filamentous algae were significantly increased p 0 05 the nh3 n removal rates of 3 5 g l and 5 0 g l groups were higher reaching 91 53 and 90 62 respectively the tp removal rates were also obviously increased p 0 05 and the 3 5 g l 4 g l and 5 g l algae groups were 85 24 86 52 and 86 20 respectively in general the optimal algal biomass 3 5 4 g l in the system significantly improved the pollutant removal rate then the treating performance of the symbiotic system was explored by configuring nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient wastewater with different initial concentrations table 2 as shown in fig 6 the removal rates of nitrogen and phosphorus of the experimental group were significantly higher than that of the control group differing from the single submerged plant group the removal rate of nitrogen and phosphorus in the symbiotic system increased continuously the higher nutrients concentration promoted the growth of algae resulting in the reduced photosynthesis of submerged plants thus weakening the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus in general the optimal symbiotic system presented a good performance for the wastewater treatment with nh3 n concentration about 6 22 mg l and tp concentration about 0 66 mg l a nh3 n concentration 2 20 0 04 mg l tp concentration 0 22 0 02 mg l b nh3 n concentration 4 31 0 16 mg l tp concentration 0 43 0 01 mg l c nh3 n concentration 6 22 0 08 mg l tp concentration 0 66 0 02 mg l d nh3 n concentration 8 27 0 20 mg l tp concentration 0 82 0 06 mg l 3 3 2 improvement of do and ph the change of do and ph in the symbiotic system under different filamentous algae biomass fig 7 showed that these two indicators of the control group were the lowest and do and ph in the symbiotic system improved with the increase of filamentous algae biomass photosynthesis of filamentous algae produced more oxygen which was conducive to the rise of do in the symbiotic system however with the continuous increase of filamentous algae biomass which would consume part of oxygen in the aerobic decomposition process of pollutants 31 resulting in the slow rise of do on the other hand according to the total reaction of photosynthesis of algae in water eq 1 1 6 co 2 6 h 2 o e photosynthesis c 6 h 12 o 6 6 o 2 it could be seen that photosynthesis converts co2 to organic matter however due to its electrical neutrality co2 was the only dissolved inorganic carbon that can passively diffuse into cell membranes most inorganic carbon existed in the form of hco 3 and co3 2 which were not easy to be used by plants the diffusion of co2 along the concentration gradient in water was slower than that in air the efficient photosynthesis of algae would lead to a rapid reduction of co2 which in turn caused the dissociation equilibrium to shift to the right thus resulting in the decomposition of hco 3 combining with the specific equations eq 2 and eq 3 2 2 h co 3 co 2 photosynthesis co 3 2 h 2 o 3 co 3 2 h 2 o h co 3 oh this process would improve the concentration of oh and lead to the increase of ph of water therefore ph was rapidly changed by the metabolism of filamentous algae 32 it can be seen from fig 8 that ph values had a significant influence on do in the system p 0 05 when the ph was 5 10 and 6 11 filamentous algae had a promotion effect on do in the water but all groups were less than 3 mg l when the ph was higher than 7 19 do in the system increased significantly indicating that the ph range of 7 19 9 11 was more suitable for the improvement of do in symbiotic system 3 4 effect of flow rate on symbiotic system under dynamic water conditions water flow would affect the growth of filamentous algae and submerged plants in the symbiotic system 33 because the increase of flow velocity may lead to tissue damage of submerged plants and the influence of the filamentous algae density thus the water purification performance of constructed wetland would be impacted 34 therefore it was necessary to consider the dynamic water conditions in the symbiotic system as shown in fig s9 in supplementary material with the increase of flow velocity the total chlorophyll of filamentous algae decreased gradually which indicated that the flow velocity had an impact on filamentous algae and there was a significant difference at different flow rates p 0 05 for submerged plants the effects of flow rates on its growth were shown in fig s10 in supplementary material the control groups all grew well at a low flow rate which was better than the static condition however when the flow velocity increased compared to that in the static condition the chlorophyll and soluble protein of ceratophyllum demersum were slightly decreased while the mda was increased water disturbance caused by low velocity flow can accelerate the exchange of o2 co2 in the water environment and the gases in the atmosphere promoting the supply of nutrients on the other hand water flushing could also to a certain extent reduce the boundary layer thickness around the plant leaves promoting the absorption of nutrition and dissolution of o2 35 at the same time cell destruction caused by turbulence would generate h2o2 in plant tissues resulting in the increase of mda however when filamentous algae was added to the system the water flow would produce pressure stress on filamentous algae which was similar to that on ceratophyllum demersum the increase of flow velocity would have a scouring effect on algae therefore filamentous algae would not cover the plants stably increasing the absorption of light for ceratophyllum demersum it could be seen that in the dynamic water condition the chlorophyll and soluble protein of the test group decreased less than that in the control group and the increase of mda content was also lower than that in the static water condition fig s11 in supplementary material showed that the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the body of ceratophyllum demersum decreased indicating low speed water flow did not cause stress to plants on the contrary it promoted the growth of plants with the increase of the flow rate the normal metabolism of plants was gradually affected and the activities of pod and cat in the body increased to remove the reactive oxygen species in the body such as superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh similar to many non biological stress reactions the mechanical stress and suspension pressure generated by water flow would cause the oxidative stress reaction of plants making cells produce reactive oxygen species and antioxidants 36 therefore based on the above analysis it was considered that the adverse effects on plants can be controlled in a small range when the flow velocity of the symbiotic system was controlled within 0 05 m s the removal of pollutants in sewage by the symbiotic system under the dynamic water conditions was shown in fig 9 with the increase of flow rate the removal rates all firstly increased and then decreased with significant differences p 0 05 when the flow rate increased to 0 05 m s the removal rate of pollutants reached the maximum 88 88 79 90 82 96 and 76 04 for nh3 n tn tp and codmn respectively however the removal rate of pollutants decreased when the flow rate further increased the flow velocity can affect the substances transportation control of corresponding mass transfer rate and proper flow rate would benefit the nitrification and denitrification of nitrogen as well as the adsorption and precipitation of phosphorus however high velocity flow would cause the tiny particles in the water disturbed which were difficult to be adsorbed by matrix plants and filamentous algae even scour off the biofilm on the other hand the removal rate of pollutants in the alga plant symbiotic system was higher than that in the control group under the dynamic water conditions the symbiotic system also had a significant effect on the do of the system p 0 05 fig 10 do fluctuated with the increase of flow rate part of the oxygen released by plants was directly come from the leaves and other came from the root system transferred from the stem 37 as a result when the under low velocity flowed the oxygen produced by photosynthesis stays around the stem and leaves as the flow velocity increased the improved oxygen flow increased the o2 concentration gradient inside and outside of the system accelerating the release of oxygen as well as the dissolution rate of oxygen into the water 4 conclusions in conclusion this study chose spirogyra as the model filamentous algae to construct a symbiotic system of spirogyra ceratophyllum demersum on the basis of screening suitable submerged plants which eventually was applied in sewage purification according to the monitoring of multiple physiological indicators of filamentous algae and submerged plants in the symbiotic system under the conditions of biomass of

13356,application of symbiotic system of filamentous algae and submerged plants in constructed wetlands is expected to further improve the sewage treatment performance unfortunately due to the complexity of their relationship researches on the combined purification of water quality by filamentous algae and submerged plants are still in the initial stage and relative results are quite different herein we chose spirogyra as the model filamentous algae to construct a symbiotic system of spirogyra ceratophyllum demersum on the basis of screening suitable submerged plants according to the monitoring of multiple physiological indicators of filamentous algae and submerged plants in the symbiotic system under the conditions of biomass of filamentous algae 3 5 4 g l nh3 n concentration 6 22 mg l tp concentration 0 66 mg l neutral or weakly alkaline ph value the inhibition effect between filamentous algae and submerged plants was minimal based on the optimization the removal rate of nh3 n and tp could reach 91 53 and 86 52 which were higher than systems consisted of several submerged plants or submerged plant and other species in addition under the dynamic water condition which was closer to the real environment the system operated in proper flow rate could still efficiently treat the pollutants moreover the improvement effect on do of sewage in system was better compared with that of the static water system the research results provided a new idea for further improving the treatment efficiency of constructed wetland and theoretical basis for the combined purification by submerged plants and algae in eutrophic water keywords filamentous algae submerged plants symbiotic system water quality purification physiological indicators 1 introduction as a remarkable ecological restoration technology constructed wetland has become an effective way to solve the eutrophication of water in china due to its high efficiency and environmentally friendly features 1 submerged plants are often selected in constructed wetlands 2 because their epidermal cells do not have hard cuticle benefiting from the highly developed aerenchyma submerged plants can efficiently absorb nutrients from the water and live well even without sufficient dissolved oxygen andrzej et al used the submerged plant elodea nuttallii to efficiently treat 25 wastewater the initial wastewater content in the mixture of wastewater and tap water the removal rates of tn and codmn reached 52 9 and 43 6 respectively 3 luo et al tested the effects of five kinds of aquatic plants on sewage treatment they found that the removal rates of nh3 n and tp in ceratophyllum demersum wetland were the highest which were 76 24 and 77 55 respectively 4 in order to improve the performance of the constructed wetland for wastewater treatment researchers enriched the biodiversity on the basis of single submerged plant systems constructing combination systems of multiple submerged plants or symbiotic systems of submerged plants and other species aiming at the problem of low treatment efficiency of constructed wetland in winter guo et al added submerged plant benthos system to the wetland compared with the traditional wetland without this system the tn removal rate reached 54 73 and the nh3 n removal efficiency increased by 29 51 thus strengthening the wetland performance in winter 5 xu et al constructed a combination system of submerged plants and microorganisms in which the root exudates and oxygen released by submerged plants helped to enhance enzyme activity and effectively remove pollutants especially the removal rates of tn and tp reached 65 27 and 79 10 respectively 6 xu et al also established a symbiotic system of submerged plants and phytoplankton by adjusting the influencing factors such as flow rate and water depth to improve the effluent quality realizing the goal of the removal rate of no3 n up to 65 and nh3 n up to 90 7 organisms directly affects the treatment effect of constructed wetlands so researchers devote themselves to selecting species with better enrichment performance among them the root specific surface area of filamentous algae can be up to thousands of cm2 g 1 which is much higher than that of herbaceous plants and grass plants below 20 cm2 g 1and 200 cm2 g 1 respectively it is indicated that the absorptive capacity of filamentous algae to pollutants is significantly higher than that of traditional constructed wetland plants moreover filamentous algae are also easy to be separated from water it is observed that filamentous algae are of great potential for nitrogen and phosphorus removal 8 at the same time filamentous algae can also provide a good living environment for bacteria epiphytic algae protozoa rotifers and micro crustaceans forming a complex food chain and a stable water quality 9 11 kim et al designed an algal bed with filamentous algae as the dominant organism to treat wastewater and the nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were 85 9 and 65 8 respectively 12 therefore it is expected to further improve the sewage treatment performance of constructed wetlands by the combining system of filamentous algae and submerged plants however when submerged plants and filamentous algae exist in the same system their interactions cannot be ignored studies have shown that the density of algae biomass are interdependent with the large plants submerged plants will affect the growth of algae which impacts the food chain energy flows 13 and excess filamentous algae will not only compete with submerged plant hindering the normal growth of submerged plant but also inhibit the photosynthesis of submerged plant by shading effects pizarro et al 14 found that the concentrations of nutrient in lakes were significantly positively correlated with the biomass of filamentous algae more content of nitrogen and phosphorus would significantly increase the biomass of filamentous algae leading to the decline of submerged plants in addition submerged plants can produce allelochemicals which also inhibits the growth of algae 15 however such interaction between submerged plants and algae is affected by abiotic environmental factors such as algae plants ratio ratio of filamentous algae and submerged plants nutrient salt and water velocity etc 16 18 therefore the regulation of system parameters becomes the key to reduce the inhibiting interactions between the two species maximizing the treatment efficiency of the symbiotic system unfortunately due to the complexity of their relationship researches on the combined purification of water quality by filamentous algae and submerged plants are still in the initial stage and relative results are quite different therefore in this study spirogyra is chosen as the model filamentous algae to screen the suitable submerged plant regulation of some key parameters including algae plants ratio nutrient concentration ph value flow rate was realized through monitoring the physiological indicators of submerged plant and spirogyra such as chlorophyll malondialdehyde enzyme activity then the optimal filamentous algae submerged plant symbiotic system was used for the wastewater purification the research results provided a new idea for further improving the treatment efficiency of constructed wetland and theoretical basis for the combined purification by submerged plants and algae in eutrophic water 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture conditions spirogyra was obtained from dongyuan pool of nanjing tech university holgland medium was used to culture in an illumination incubator with illumination intensity of 5500 lx and light to dark ratio of 16 8 the experimental water was divided into static experimental sewage and dynamic experimental sewage in order to avoid interference as far as possible the simulated sewage was prepared according to the inferior v water quality in the environmental quality standard for surface water gb3838 2002 the chemical oxygen demand was prepared with glucose ammonium chloride and sodium nitrate were used as nitrogen source potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used as phosphorus source main pollutants and concentration in the simulated sewage were listed as follows codmn 15 52 1 48 mg l tn 8 33 0 41 mg l nh3 n 4 36 0 19 mg l tp 0 84 0 05 mg l 2 2 experimental facility the diagram of static experimental device was shown in fig 1 the volume of the plastic bucket 37 cm 32 cm 28 cm was 25 l the bottom of the bucket was paved with 5 cm thick coarse sand and 2 cm gravel submerged plants were planted above fig 2 was the dynamic experimental device diagram the model device was divided into test area and water distribution area the test area was 0 4 m in length 0 15 m in width 0 06 m2 in area the total depth was 0 5 m and the water depth was 0 35 0 40 m the device was filled with matrix the water distribution area was 0 1 m in length and 0 15 m in width which was fixed with a submersible pump the outlet water tank was a row of openings with a diameter of 1 cm the outlet water hole was covered with a layer of silk screen nylon material which was cleaned regularly in the typical experiment the submersible pump in the water distribution area was used to drive the simulated sewage from the water distribution bucket into the inlet area of the test area so that the sewage flows into the test area evenly sewage circularly flowed into the water tank through gravity flow the device was illuminated with a halogen lamp light intensity 5500 lx and the ambient temperature was 25 1 c 2 3 effects of filamentous algae biomass on submerged plants several submerged plants ceratophyllum demersum myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans were selected to be tested in the symbiotic system the biomass of each filamentous algae was 100 g calculated after suction by filter paper and that of filamentous algae was controlled at 50 g 100 g and 200 g calculated after extruding water and suction by filter paper mean the algae plants ratios were 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 respectively at the same time a single submerged plant system was set as the control group 20 l of simulated sewage was added to each system the experiment lasted for 16 days and the sewage concentration remained unchanged the initial physiological indexes of the three submerged plants were tested which were listed in table 1 2 4 effects of filamentous algae biomass on symbiotic system 5 g l submerged plants and 2 5 g l 3 g l 3 5 g l 4 g l 4 5 g l 5 g l filamentous algae were used to constructed symbiotic system algae plants ratio was 1 2 3 5 7 10 4 5 9 10 1 1 respectively at the same time a single submerged plant system was set as the control group the prepared simulated sewage containing only nitrogen and phosphorus was added respectively 2 5 effects of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations on the symbiotic system during the laboratory static test a single submerged plant system was set as the control group simulated sewage with different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus table 2 were tested the experiment lasted for 16 days 2 6 effects of ph on symbiotic systems five groups a b c d e with different ph values of 5 10 0 05 6 11 0 03 7 19 0 08 8 17 0 06 and 9 11 0 04 were tested respectively at the same time a single submerged plant system was set as control group the experiment lasted for 16 days 2 7 measurement index and method at the beginning of each experiment a 500 ml conical flask was used to collect water samples at a fixed sampling point in the test area at 10 00 am for sampling the determination method of water quality indexes was strictly in accordance with the steps specified in the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis method fourth edition table s1 in supplementary material monitoring methods of physiological indexes were described in paragraph s1 in supplementary material 2 8 data analysis spss19 0 software was used for statistical analysis of the experimental data by one way analysis of variance anova when the results reached significance p 0 05 it was considered that there might be direct or indirect interaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of submerged plants when the regeneration of host plants and the predation of zooplankton cannot completely limit the increase of filamentous algae biomass they would have a negative impact on host submerged plants therefore it was necessary to select suitable submerged plants to minimize the influence in the construction of symbiotic system herein three typical submerged plants ceratophyllum demersum myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans were selected to construct a symbiotic system of algae plants with spirogyra since chlorophyll reflected photosynthesis 19 soluble protein reflected the adaptation status of metabolic pathway 20 malondialdehyde mda one of the final products of membrane lipid peroxidation was an important indicator of physiological stress 21 and antioxidant enzyme reflected the status of plants under ammonia stress 22 we chose chlorophyll soluble protein mda peroxidase activity pod and catalase activity cat as biological physiological indicators to illustrate the interactions between filamentous algae and submerged plants as shown in fig 3 in the symbiotic system of ceratophyllum demersum filamentous algae the chlorophyll fig 3a and mda fig 3c of ceratophyllum demersum in the control group and the experimental group algae plants ratio group 1 2 and 1 1 were basically higher than the initial state and the soluble protein fig 3b showed a trend of increase and then decline at the end of the experiment the four groups showed significant differences p 0 05 the chlorophyll and soluble protein increased the most in the control group reaching 60 47 and 46 28 respectively however in the group of 1 2 ratio the chlorophyll and soluble protein contents increased slightly reaching 47 54 and 16 03 respectively and with the increasing of ratio continually the chlorophyll and soluble protein in 2 1 ratio group both decreased indicating that the chlorophyll synthesis of filamentous algae was blocked the metabolism of the organism was also inhibited thus affecting the normal growth of ceratophyllum demersum as an indicator to measure the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation mda had little change in the control group and 1 2 ratio group both of which were about 1 0 mg g however the increase of ratio of 1 1 and 2 1 groups reached 91 01 and 222 64 respectively at the end of the experiment the algae plants ratio of 2 1 group was 2 39 times that of the control group the results indicated that the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation positively related with the filamentous algae biomass fig 3 d and e reflected the changes of pod and cat the data showed that the activities of pod and cat fluctuate significantly during the experimental period the pod activity in plants increased continuously in the first 8 days indicating that the in vivo scavenging mechanism was activated the ratio of 1 1 and 2 1 of algae plants increased significantly the enzyme activity of the four groups showed significant differences p 0 05 at the end of the experiment the increase of pod activity in the control group was only 1 39 while the increase of the ratio 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 groups was 44 62 84 70 and 106 20 respectively cat activity of control group and algae plants ratio 1 2 group was relatively stable while algae plants ratio 2 1 group fluctuated the activity reached the peak on the 8th day and decreased sharply in the later period cat activity increased by 131 71 at the end of the experiment which was 1 64 times that of the control group in addition the effects of filamentous algae biomass on the physiological indexes of myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans were determined by the same method as shown in fig s1 and s2 in supplementary material the similar results showed that the chlorophyll and soluble protein of myriophyllum verticillatum and vallisneria natans decreased under the influence of filamentous algae which was caused by protein degradation 23 or fracture caused by reactive oxygen poisoning 24 when plants were stressed by the external environment due to the increase of reactive oxygen species membrane lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids pufa in the biofilm would occur in cells which would eventually decompose to produce mda when the plants were under greater adverse effects mda content would accumulate more 25 in addition the activities of pod and cat in the three submerged plants fluctuated to a certain extent which indicated that filamentous algae had a certain stress on the growth of submerged plants and the response time of different plants was different on account of competition of nitrogen and phosphorus between filamentous algae and submerged plant competition as well as the weakening absorption of light by physical intertwining and allelopathic chemicals secreted by filamentous algae the degree of the in vivo membrane lipid peroxidation exacerbated in submerged plant cell therefore oxygen free radicals in the body produced which caused the response of antioxidant enzyme system data showed that the increase of filamentous algae biomass the growth of submerged plants was affected in different degrees according to the variation range of specific physiological indexes the effect on ceratophyllum demersum was relatively small therefore in this study ceratophyllum demersum was selected as a representative submerged plant to construct a model symbiotic system with filamentous algae 3 2 construction and optimization of symbiotic system 3 2 1 filamentous algae biomass the effects of filamentous algae biomass on ceratophyllum demersum were shown in fig 4 a c at the end of the experiment the contents of chlorophyll and soluble protein with 4 5 g l and 5 g l algae were significantly lower than those in control group and 2 5 4 g l algal groups p 0 05 this was because the competition for nutrients and light between plants and algae especially the absorption of inorganic carbon 26 as for mda 5 g l algal group had the most significant increase indicating the largest stress on the ceratophyllum demersum fig 4 d and e reflected the change of antioxidant enzyme activity of ceratophyllum demersum at the end of the experiment it was basically unchanged in pod activity of the 2 5 3 5 g l algal groups p 0 05 while a significant difference emerged in 4 5 g l algal groups on the other hand cat activity of the six experimental groups fluctuated obviously among which the 5 g l algal group was the highest data analysis showed that when the biomass of filamentous algae was controlled at 3 5 4 g l ceratophyllum demersum was not greatly affected which could be used as the optimal range of subsequent algae biomass 3 2 2 nutrition concentration the total chlorophyll content was used to characterize the biomass of filamentous algae as shown in fig s3 in supplementary material with increase of nutrient concentration the total chlorophyll content of filamentous algae significantly became higher in the condition of 8 27 mg l nh3 n and 0 82 mg l tp the total chlorophyll and its growth rate reached the highest phosphorus was the nutrients for algae growth high concentration of nutrients can promote the growth of filamentous algae 27 under the exposure of different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus the physiological indexes of ceratophyllum demersum in the symbiotic system also changed correspondingly according to fig s4 in supplementary material chlorophyll soluble protein and mda were significantly affected by nutrient concentration p 0 05 due to the increase of nutrient concentration the growth of excess filamentous algae had a negative impact on plants moreover studies had also shown that algae blooms can lead to the decrease of chlorophyll a content in plant leaves 28 with the increase of nutrient concentration the mda of ceratophyllum demersum gradually increased which verified that nutrient concentration had adverse effects on the growth of submerged plants combined with the similar analysis of pod and cat fig s5 in supplementary material 6 22 mg l nh3 n and 0 66 mg l tp were the optimal nutrients concentrations for the alga plant symbiotic system 3 2 3 ph value ph value was also a key parameter need to be regulated as shown in fig s6 in supplementary material overly acidic water had a strong stress on large filamentous algae with the increased of ph the growth state of filamentous algae became better algal color green kelp silk smooth when ph was 9 11 the chlorophyll of filamentous algae decreased indicating that higher ph was also unfavorable to filamentous algae similarly we investigated the change of physiological index of ceratophyllum demersum under different ph which were shown in fig s7 in supplementary material with the increase of ph the chlorophyll and soluble protein of ceratophyllum demersum presented a downward trend after a rising while mda showed a trend of obvious decline after a slow increase low ph water had obvious stress effect on submerged plants 29 when ph was 5 10 the stem and leaves of ceratophyllum demersum turn brown and gradually lose their original morphology the soluble protein showed the same change rule with chlorophyll at the same time mda in the acidic water was higher than that in the alkaline ones acidic conditions made the cell membrane of ceratophyllum demersum be damaged greatly the cell permeability was enhanced and the degree of in vivo membrane lipid peroxidation was increased therefore ceratophyllum demersum was suitable to live in neutral and weak alkaline water the effects of different ph values on the growth of ceratophyllum demersum were also reflected in the activities of antioxidant enzymes pod and cat and there were significant differences between the experimental groups p 0 05 as shown in fig s8 in supplementary material under the condition of low ph the pod and cat activity of submerged plant were high after adding filamentous algae the adverse effects on ceratophyllum demersum was enhanced which was due to the synergistic effect of low ph and filamentous algae 30 the activities of pod and cat were relatively stable under higher ph values however due to the alkaline ph value was conducive to the growth of filamentous algae the influence on ceratophyllum demersum was slightly enhanced compared with the neutral condition 3 3 sewage purification performance of symbiotic system 3 3 1 removal of nitrogen and phosphorus fig 5 showed the removal rates of nh3 n and tp by the symbiotic system under different filamentous algae biomass the removal rates of nh3 n and tp by the single submerged plant group were 51 16 and 39 57 respectively while those of the six symbiotic groups with filamentous algae were significantly increased p 0 05 the nh3 n removal rates of 3 5 g l and 5 0 g l groups were higher reaching 91 53 and 90 62 respectively the tp removal rates were also obviously increased p 0 05 and the 3 5 g l 4 g l and 5 g l algae groups were 85 24 86 52 and 86 20 respectively in general the optimal algal biomass 3 5 4 g l in the system significantly improved the pollutant removal rate then the treating performance of the symbiotic system was explored by configuring nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient wastewater with different initial concentrations table 2 as shown in fig 6 the removal rates of nitrogen and phosphorus of the experimental group were significantly higher than that of the control group differing from the single submerged plant group the removal rate of nitrogen and phosphorus in the symbiotic system increased continuously the higher nutrients concentration promoted the growth of algae resulting in the reduced photosynthesis of submerged plants thus weakening the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus in general the optimal symbiotic system presented a good performance for the wastewater treatment with nh3 n concentration about 6 22 mg l and tp concentration about 0 66 mg l a nh3 n concentration 2 20 0 04 mg l tp concentration 0 22 0 02 mg l b nh3 n concentration 4 31 0 16 mg l tp concentration 0 43 0 01 mg l c nh3 n concentration 6 22 0 08 mg l tp concentration 0 66 0 02 mg l d nh3 n concentration 8 27 0 20 mg l tp concentration 0 82 0 06 mg l 3 3 2 improvement of do and ph the change of do and ph in the symbiotic system under different filamentous algae biomass fig 7 showed that these two indicators of the control group were the lowest and do and ph in the symbiotic system improved with the increase of filamentous algae biomass photosynthesis of filamentous algae produced more oxygen which was conducive to the rise of do in the symbiotic system however with the continuous increase of filamentous algae biomass which would consume part of oxygen in the aerobic decomposition process of pollutants 31 resulting in the slow rise of do on the other hand according to the total reaction of photosynthesis of algae in water eq 1 1 6 co 2 6 h 2 o e photosynthesis c 6 h 12 o 6 6 o 2 it could be seen that photosynthesis converts co2 to organic matter however due to its electrical neutrality co2 was the only dissolved inorganic carbon that can passively diffuse into cell membranes most inorganic carbon existed in the form of hco 3 and co3 2 which were not easy to be used by plants the diffusion of co2 along the concentration gradient in water was slower than that in air the efficient photosynthesis of algae would lead to a rapid reduction of co2 which in turn caused the dissociation equilibrium to shift to the right thus resulting in the decomposition of hco 3 combining with the specific equations eq 2 and eq 3 2 2 h co 3 co 2 photosynthesis co 3 2 h 2 o 3 co 3 2 h 2 o h co 3 oh this process would improve the concentration of oh and lead to the increase of ph of water therefore ph was rapidly changed by the metabolism of filamentous algae 32 it can be seen from fig 8 that ph values had a significant influence on do in the system p 0 05 when the ph was 5 10 and 6 11 filamentous algae had a promotion effect on do in the water but all groups were less than 3 mg l when the ph was higher than 7 19 do in the system increased significantly indicating that the ph range of 7 19 9 11 was more suitable for the improvement of do in symbiotic system 3 4 effect of flow rate on symbiotic system under dynamic water conditions water flow would affect the growth of filamentous algae and submerged plants in the symbiotic system 33 because the increase of flow velocity may lead to tissue damage of submerged plants and the influence of the filamentous algae density thus the water purification performance of constructed wetland would be impacted 34 therefore it was necessary to consider the dynamic water conditions in the symbiotic system as shown in fig s9 in supplementary material with the increase of flow velocity the total chlorophyll of filamentous algae decreased gradually which indicated that the flow velocity had an impact on filamentous algae and there was a significant difference at different flow rates p 0 05 for submerged plants the effects of flow rates on its growth were shown in fig s10 in supplementary material the control groups all grew well at a low flow rate which was better than the static condition however when the flow velocity increased compared to that in the static condition the chlorophyll and soluble protein of ceratophyllum demersum were slightly decreased while the mda was increased water disturbance caused by low velocity flow can accelerate the exchange of o2 co2 in the water environment and the gases in the atmosphere promoting the supply of nutrients on the other hand water flushing could also to a certain extent reduce the boundary layer thickness around the plant leaves promoting the absorption of nutrition and dissolution of o2 35 at the same time cell destruction caused by turbulence would generate h2o2 in plant tissues resulting in the increase of mda however when filamentous algae was added to the system the water flow would produce pressure stress on filamentous algae which was similar to that on ceratophyllum demersum the increase of flow velocity would have a scouring effect on algae therefore filamentous algae would not cover the plants stably increasing the absorption of light for ceratophyllum demersum it could be seen that in the dynamic water condition the chlorophyll and soluble protein of the test group decreased less than that in the control group and the increase of mda content was also lower than that in the static water condition fig s11 in supplementary material showed that the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the body of ceratophyllum demersum decreased indicating low speed water flow did not cause stress to plants on the contrary it promoted the growth of plants with the increase of the flow rate the normal metabolism of plants was gradually affected and the activities of pod and cat in the body increased to remove the reactive oxygen species in the body such as superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh similar to many non biological stress reactions the mechanical stress and suspension pressure generated by water flow would cause the oxidative stress reaction of plants making cells produce reactive oxygen species and antioxidants 36 therefore based on the above analysis it was considered that the adverse effects on plants can be controlled in a small range when the flow velocity of the symbiotic system was controlled within 0 05 m s the removal of pollutants in sewage by the symbiotic system under the dynamic water conditions was shown in fig 9 with the increase of flow rate the removal rates all firstly increased and then decreased with significant differences p 0 05 when the flow rate increased to 0 05 m s the removal rate of pollutants reached the maximum 88 88 79 90 82 96 and 76 04 for nh3 n tn tp and codmn respectively however the removal rate of pollutants decreased when the flow rate further increased the flow velocity can affect the substances transportation control of corresponding mass transfer rate and proper flow rate would benefit the nitrification and denitrification of nitrogen as well as the adsorption and precipitation of phosphorus however high velocity flow would cause the tiny particles in the water disturbed which were difficult to be adsorbed by matrix plants and filamentous algae even scour off the biofilm on the other hand the removal rate of pollutants in the alga plant symbiotic system was higher than that in the control group under the dynamic water conditions the symbiotic system also had a significant effect on the do of the system p 0 05 fig 10 do fluctuated with the increase of flow rate part of the oxygen released by plants was directly come from the leaves and other came from the root system transferred from the stem 37 as a result when the under low velocity flowed the oxygen produced by photosynthesis stays around the stem and leaves as the flow velocity increased the improved oxygen flow increased the o2 concentration gradient inside and outside of the system accelerating the release of oxygen as well as the dissolution rate of oxygen into the water 4 conclusions in conclusion this study chose spirogyra as the model filamentous algae to construct a symbiotic system of spirogyra ceratophyllum demersum on the basis of screening suitable submerged plants which eventually was applied in sewage purification according to the monitoring of multiple physiological indicators of filamentous algae and submerged plants in the symbiotic system under the conditions of biomass of filamentous algae 3 5 4 g l nh3 n concentration 6 22 mg l tp concentration 0 66 mg l neutral or weakly alkaline ph value the biological status and original water quality of the symbiotic system were optimal the inhibition effect between filamentous algae and submerged plants was minimal then the optimal system performed a good removal to the sewage of nh3 n concentration 4 17 4 55 mg l tp concentration 0 79 0 89 mg l codmn concentration 14 04 17 00 mg l and tn concentration 7 92 8 74 mg l the removal rate of nh3 n and tp could reach 91 53 and 86 52 which were higher than systems consisted of several submerged plants or submerged plant and other species in addition under the dynamic water condition which was closer to the real environment when the flow rate was 0 05 m s the system could still efficiently treat the pollutants moreover the improvement effect on do of sewage in system was better compared with that of the static water system declaration of competing interest

13357,the highly efficient biochar based catalysts from agricultural biomass wastes receive tremendous interest in the wastewater restoration field because of lower cost and environmental friendliness herein the abundant agricultural waste loofah sponge is used as the precursor to prepare eco friendly carbonized loofah sponge encapsulating iron phosphide nanoparticles cls ip by a facile pyrolysis strategy the as synthesized cls ip not only exhibited excellent catalytic activity for acid red 1 removal via activating peroxymonosulfate pms which achieved 94 4 removal in 24 min but also removed other common pollutants including phenolic compounds sulfonamides and dyes besides the iron ions leaching 0 03 0 19 ppm was obviously lower than 2 00 ppm according to european standard even after reuse surprisingly the used cls ip catalyst could be effectively regenerated after the oxalic acid immersion treatment in addition the cls ip still exhibited remarkable catalytic activity even after five months of storage four types of reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 were generated during the reaction and the superoxide radical made a dominant contribution this work provided an avenue for developing low cost biochar based catalysts in environmental remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords loofah sponge porous carbon iron phosphide nanoparticles peroxymonosulfate heterogeneous catalyst 1 introduction recently advanced oxidation processes aops have been extensively used to remove various refractory and toxic pollutants due to high efficiency environmental friendliness and cost effectiveness 1 among them aops based on pms are considered to be a relatively effective and promising technology for pollutants removal 2 in this system pms molecules are decomposed into sulfate radicals so4 with high oxidation potential which directly affects the removal of pollutants 3 the aops based on so4 have been extensively used in the environmental catalysis field which is benefited from the high oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v broad ph adaptation range 2 0 9 0 and long half time 30 40 μs of so4 4 7 presently so4 are mainly generated through pms activation by some strategies such as heat 8 radiation 9 uv irradiation 10 ultrasound and transition metals fe co cu mn 11 14 among these strategies iron based catalyst has been considered as a relatively economical and effective transition metal for pms activation due to the non toxicity and without external energy input 15 compared with homogeneous iron based catalysts heterogeneous iron based catalysts have triggered worldwide attention because they can alleviate secondary pollution 16 correspondingly the disadvantage of heterogeneous iron based catalysts is mainly low catalytic performance which would limit its practical application in recent years carbon based supports such as carbon nanotube and graphene have been extensively employed to support iron doped catalysts because of their good electrical conductivity high resistance in acid base media favorable biocompatibility and large surface area 17 18 li et al successfully prepared fe doped g c3n4 graphene in muff furnace which could activate pms to remove trimethoprim under visible light irradiation 19 gu et al reported that the nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi pda functionalized graphene catalyst reacted with pms could efficiently eliminate 92 0 trichloroethylene 20 however the expensive price potential ecological and environmental threats present in the above carbon based carriers 21 it is imperative to develop a nonhazardous carbon based carrier using low cost and widespread carbon materials recently waste biomass as low cost carbon precursors to prepare the functional catalysts to remove pollutants has been widely investigated li et al manufactured porous biochar loaded iron nanoparticles by multiple high temperature annealing and the catalyst using myosoton aquaticum as carbon precursors 22 li et al used the maize straw as a carbon precursor to successfully synthesize biochar supported nzvi through two times of pyrolysis which could activate pms to remove 99 0 trichloroethylene in 20 min 23 although the above reported catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity they couldn t be efficiently reused and had complex preparation processes thus restricting the practical application therefore more efforts were needed to exploit a novel iron doped biocarbon catalyst with a relatively simple preparation process and excellent catalytic performance as a natural biomass material the loofah sponge is mainly composed of cellulose 66 6 hemicelluloses 17 4 and xylogen 15 4 24 25 it not only contains relatively high carbon content but also has a distinct structure which includes many micron scale hollow multichannel and makes it become a promising raw material for preparing porous carbon 26 moreover the loofah sponges contain a variety of functional groups such as cooh and oh which can chelate with the empty orbital of transition metals ions 27 based on the above considerations the loofah sponge can be utilized as a promising carrier precursor for dispersing and stabilizing transition metal however it is regrettable that there is currently no relevant report on the loofah sponge based transition metal catalysts to activate pms for pollutant degradation ar1 one of the most common dyes is poisonous and carcinogenic to humans and livestock and widely existed as a stubborn pollutant in industrial wastewater 28 29 in this work the catalytic ability was evaluated by the removal of ar1 in aqueous solution we prepared a carbonized loofah sponge encapsulating iron phosphide nanoparticles cls ip by using a loofah sponge as the feedstock of biochar three different cls ip composites pyrolysis at different temperatures of 700 c 800 c and 900 c respectively could be easily prepared by a facile pyrolysis strategy particularly we found that the used cls ip catalyst could basically recover its catalytic activities after oxalic acid treatment besides a viable mechanism for cls ip to activate pms was hypothetically proposed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr technique and quenching tests furthermore the influence of process parameters on the catalytic performance of the cls ip was investigated this research provided new insight into the development of high quality economical and environmentally friendly catalysts for environmental remediation 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials the model dye pollutant of ar1 was obtained from aladdin industrial co ltd which could be used without further purification and the characteristics of ar1 were presented in table s1 the loofah sponge was used as the precursor of biochar which was obtained in mengcheng anhui province iron nitrate nonahydrate feno3 9h2o and phytic acid c6h18o24p6 ar 50 were bought from aladdin industrial co ltd methanol meoh tert butyl alcohol tba p benzoquinone bq l histidine ascorbic acid aa c6h8o6 and potassium peroxymonosulfate 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 ar were bought from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china 5 5 dimethylpyrroline oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp were provided by tokyo chemical industry co ltd all the rest agentia used in the experiment were supplied by mike chemical instrument co ltd hangzhou china 2 2 catalysts preparation the loofah sponge was chopped into 2 cm 2 cm cubes and immersed in 0 5 m naoh for half an hour with ultrasonic to remove some inorganic impurities then washed three times with deionized water subsequently the 60 ml solution containing 4 g fe no3 3 9h20 and 3 725 g phytic acid ultrasonically lasted for 30 min and then put into a beaker to mix with the loofah sponge and then the samples were sonicated for 30 min and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h then these samples were pyrolyzed at 700 c 800 c 900 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere heating rate was 3 c min it was denoted as cls ip 700 cls ip 800 and cls ip 900 respectively for comparison the pa c 900 and c 900 were made from phytic acid with the loofah sponge and the pure loofah sponge at 900 c respectively according to the above same procedures 2 3 characterization of the catalysts xrd bruker d8 discover was used to investigate the crystal structure of the catalysts the catalyst morphology was characterized by a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 and transmission electron microscope tem jeol jem 2100f x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha was used to investigate the valence state and surface composition of the catalyst and the binding energy of all spectra was corrected at 284 8 ev of c 1 s peak fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet nexus 470 was employed to determine the surface functional groups the raman spectra were recorded using a raman spectroscopy renishaw invia with the laser wave length at 514 nm the brunauer emmett and teller bet methods were chosen to verify the textural properties of the catalysts by n2 adsorption desorption data the uv vis spectrum was measured by a uv 2007 spectrometer to obtain the absorption spectra 2 4 experimental procedure and analysis unless otherwise illustrated the catalytic process was initiated by adding the prepared catalyst with the final concentration of 0 5 g l into a 20 ml solution containing pms 0 5 g l and pollutants dyes 50 mg l antibiotics 75 mg l the removal experiments were performed in a 100 ml conical flask using the shaking bath during certain intervals 0 5 ml reaction solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size cellulose filters then transferred to the cuvette or chromatographic sample bottle to detect residue concentration by a uv vis spectrophotometer and the high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a c18 column 250 4 6 nm respectively in the hplc analysis the mobile phase was composed of water and methyl alcohol at a volume ratio of 70 30 epr spectrometer bruker ems plus was used to confirm the active radicals briefly temp and dmpo were designated as the spin trapping agents to demonstrate the presence of so4 oh 1o2 and o2 the computational formula of apparent rate constant k obs was provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the xrd patterns were investigated to verify the crystal structure of the cls ip prepared at different pyrolytic temperatures as depicted in fig 1 a primarily the peaks at 2θ of 13 5 20 4 20 8 28 8 and 29 6 were attributed to the fe2p4o12 jcpds pdf 76 0223 meanwhile the peaks of fe2p2o7 were located at 2θ of 29 7 34 1 35 3 35 8 and 36 4 jcpds pdf 72 1516 30 31 it was obvious that fe2p4o12 and fe2p2o7 were simultaneously found in the cls ip pyrolyzed at 700 c cls ip 700 while the fe2p4o12 signals weakened but the fe2p2o7 signals gradually strengthened at 800 c surprisingly with a further increase of the temperature to 900 c the fe2p4o12 crystalline phase disappeared and the typical fep phase 2θ 30 9 32 7 35 5 37 2 47 0 55 3 56 1 and 79 1 jcpds pdf 78 1443 formed in the cls ip 900 images 32 these results indicated that the ferric phytate complex was pyrolyzed to form fe2p4o12 and fe2p2o7 at low temperature but the fe2p4o12 was transformed to fe2p2o7 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature then reduced to fep by the reductive components formed in the biomass pyrolysis process such as amorphous carbon 33 34 the changes of the derived carbon structures in the cls ip were investigated by raman spectra proverbially the raman spectroscopy of the cls ip exhibited characteristic d 1350 cm 1 and g 1580 cm 1 peaks in fig 1 b the d peaks corresponded to the defect sites or disordered carbons while the g bands were associated with the graphitization degree of the carbon materials 35 definitely with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature ig id value obviously increased from 0 951 to 1 054 revealing that the graphitization degree of cls ip was effectively improved at high pyrolysis temperature 36 the ft ir spectra of the cls ip were shown in fig s1 it was obvious that the characteristic peak at 579 cm 1 corresponded to feo stretching vibrations 37 38 and the o p o stretching vibrations occurring at 1050 cm 1 indicating the phosphorus doping in the carbonized loofah sponge was successful 39 the morphology and microstructure of the cls ip were investigated by sem and tem as shown in fig 2 a there were extensive pores randomly dispersed on the surface of c 900 which is obtained by the pyrolysis of the pure loofah sponge contrastively it could be found that some nanoparticles were observed on the surface of the cls ip 900 in fig 2 b which might conform to fep and fe2p2o7 according to the xrd pattern moreover tem images showed that the cls ip 900 basically comprised disordered carbon layers and iron nanoparticles two lattice spacings of 0 250 and 0 273 nm were revealed in the high resolution tem hrtem images which were consistent with the 020 lattice plane of fe2p2o7 and 011 lattice plane of fep respectively 40 41 the above information indicated that the carbonizing loofah sponge loaded with iron phosphide nanoparticles had been successfully prepared by a facile pyrolysis strategy besides the element mapping and eds of the cls ip 900 clearly illustrated the homogeneous distribution of c p o and fe species the textural properties were one of the crucial factors influencing catalytic performance hence n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was involved in studying the porosity of the cls ip fig s2 the bet surface area of c 900 1342 7 m2 g was obviously higher than the cls ip 900 566 1 m2 g cls ip 800 121 8 m2 g and cls ip 700 55 7 m2 g which probably related to the fact that fe2p2o7 and fep nanoparticles could occupy the adsorption sites on the biochar and the higher pyrolysis temperature would improve porosity development 42 meanwhile the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the cls ip 900 cls ip 800 and cls ip 700 could be classified to type i isotherm based on the iupac nomenclature revealing the presence of typical microporous structure 3 2 catalytic performance in this work the catalytic ability of the cls ip was evaluated by the removal of ar1 a common and hazardous dye as the target pollutant as displayed in fig 3 a the sole pms could inconsiderably change the ar1 concentration in solution and 38 2 removal rate of ar1 occurred with adding the cls ip 900 alone encouragingly the intensity of the uv vis absorption peak at 514 nm decreased obviously and the ar1 removal rate significantly enhanced to 94 4 in the cls ip 900 pms system revealing the remarkable catalytic activity of the cls ip 900 moreover the apparent rate constant k obs was generally employed to quantify the catalytic performance of various catalysts as exhibited in fig 3 c the value of k obs was 0 1257 min 1 in the cls ip 900 pms system which was about 36 6 times better than that in the sole pms system 0 00343 min 1 and even 7 5 times better than that in the c 900 pms system 0 01680 min 1 demonstrating that the doping of iron phosphide in carbonized loofah sponge could significantly improve its catalytic activity to comprehensively compare three catalysts prepared at different temperatures the catalytic performances and the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate were presented in fig s3 and fig 3 d respectively it was clear that the cls ip pyrolyzed at 900 c exhibited the best catalytic performance among the above catalysts in summary the cls ip 900 was most suitable as the experimental object and was chosen to investigate the effect of the removal mechanism and reaction factors to further evaluate the removal rate of the cls ip 900 pms system on other contaminants a variety of conventional dyes removal experiments were also conducted including reactive red m 3bf 3bf methyl orange mo methylene blue mb reactive blue 19 rb19 acid orange 7 ao7 and rhodamine b rhb notably these conventional dyes could be removed in the cls ip pms system and the removal rate could reach more than 85 in 24 min proving that the cls ip 900 possessed remarkable catalytic activity against the majority of conventional dyes surprisingly the cls ip 900 pms system also exhibited eminent catalytic efficiency in the removal of phenolic pollutants and sulfa pollutants the corresponding removal rate and k obs of the aforesaid pollutants were present in fig 4 c moreover table 1 briefly compared the removal effects of sulfadiazine sdz and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp on different heterogeneous catalysts 43 48 it revealed that the cls ip 900 could achieve better catalytic performance even if the pollutant concentration was relatively high and the amount of catalyst was comparatively low 3 3 reusability and stability of the cls ip taking the cost effectiveness into consideration the reusability of the catalyst was a significant property for the application hence the reuse performance of the cls ip 900 was evaluated as shown in fig s4 after the removal experiment the catalyst was recycled 5 times and the removal rate of ar1 decreased significantly from 95 75 to 70 41 indicating that the removal rate decreased obviously after five cycles therefore it is necessary to find an easy and high efficiency way to restore the catalytic activity of the used catalyst for practical application traditional methods for regeneration such as ethanol cleaning thermal treatment or ultrasonication were unsuitable for the operation or the regeneration effect was not satisfactory fig s5 hence oxalic acid was selected as a regenerant to recover the activity of catalyst due to its inexpensive price environmental friendliness and suited reducibility as displayed in fig s6 the oxalic acid pms system had little effect on the removal of ar1 surprisingly the removal rate of the cls ip 900 recovered to 95 32 after oxalic acid treatment the recovery of the catalytic performance might be attributed to the increase of the fe ii in the catalyst to identify the speculate the xps spectra of the used cls ip before and after oxalic acid treatment were measured as in fig 4 xps spectra of fe 2p core level were resolved into four peaks at 709 6 712 3 ev for fe 2p3 2 and 724 4 728 2 ev for fe 2p1 2 for fe 2p3 2 the peaks at 709 6 ev and 712 3 ev corresponded to fe ii and fe iii respectively according to peak intensity the proportion of fe ii remarkably increased from 22 17 to 47 22 after oxalic acid treatment while the proportion of fe iii decreased from 77 83 to 52 78 fig 4 c d which was consistent with the above speculate and the overflow of iron ion spillover in the table s2 compared with the fresh catalyst the activity of the cls ip was almost unchanged after five months of storage fig s7 demonstrating its excellent long term stability 3 4 effects of factors on ar1 removal the influence of temperature on ar1 removal was displayed from 15 c to 55 c in fig 5 a obviously the ar1 removal rate increased from 81 96 to 97 23 within 16 min and the k obs increased from 0 114 min 1 to 0 252 min 1 with increasing reaction temperature some researches show that high temperature could speed up the activation of pms and generate more radicals thereby increasing the frequency of collisions between pollutants and radicals and further enhancing the reaction activity meanwhile the activation energy ea of the cls ip 900 was determined to be 17 06 kj mol by the arrhenius equation which is lower than most of the reported transition metal catalysts table s5 in this work a suppositional reaction mechanism dominated by o2 was proposed during the ar1 removal process meanwhile according to literature reports the temperature had little effect on the activity of o2 which might lead to a low activation energy of cls ip 900 pms system 49 moreover the low ea value was beneficial to reduce the energy supply of the catalytic system and was conducive to the practical applications of sewage treatment 50 initial ph was generally considered as a crucial factor to influence the catalytic ability the ar1 removal rate remained over 93 9 when the initial ph increased from 3 to 11 and corresponding k obs were calculated to be 0 274 0 217 0 209 0 156 and 0 106 min 1 respectively indicating that the cls ip 900 possessed superior ph tolerance it was obvious that the acidic condition stimulated the catalytic activity which probably related to the fact that acidic ph promoted the dissolution of fe ii in cls ip and accelerated the generation of the free radical moreover the iron spillage under the different initial ph conditions were determined by icp oes analysis table s2 and the spillage were tested to be 0 16 0 13 0 09 0 05 and 0 03 ppm in different initial ph values respectively which were much lower than the eu standards 2 0 ppm overall the superior ph tolerance and low spillage of the iron in the cls ip 900 under broad ph conditions suggest its promising potential for wastewater treatment moreover the ar1 removal with increasing the cls ip 900 dosage was shown in fig 5 c the removal rate significantly increased from 67 2 to 94 8 when the dosage of the cls ip 900 increased from 0 1 g l to 0 5 g l while the ar1 removal almost remained unchanged from 0 5 g l to 2 0 g l it could be considered that more catalyst dosage leads to more catalytic active sites which promote the generation of active radicals and benefit pollutants degradation however the further increase of catalyst dosage produced excessive active radicals and led to a self scavenging reaction which inhibited a further increase in the removal rate similarly the ar1 removal showed an upward trend when the pms dosage increased from 0 1 mm to 0 5 mm fig 5 d besides the removal rate remained almost unchanged when the pms dosage further increased to more than 1 mm further taking catalytic rate and economic benefits into consideration 0 5 mm pms and 0 5 g l cls ip 900 were preferred as the fixed oxidant concentration and catalyst dosage in this experiment 3 5 effects of inorganic anions as we all know a variety of anions species were ubiquitous in practical wastewater taking it into consideration the impact of several familiar anions ions cl no3 h2po4 so4 2 hco3 co3 2 on the ar1 removal was evaluated and the influence of k obs values and the removal rate of ar1 of the above anions species were showed in fig 6 obviously the k obs for removing ar1 decreased from 0 126 to 0 090 and 0 063 min 1 in the presence of 10 mm cl and no3 respectively while the removal rates were barely inhibited in 24 min unexpectedly the removal rate significantly decreased to 64 32 after adding 10 mm so4 2 which could be attributed to the fact that excessive so4 2 decreased the so4 so4 2 oxidative redox potential orp thereby slowing down the generation of so4 and inhibiting the catalytic activity of the cls ip 900 19 obviously the k obs and ar1 removal rate remarkably decreased as the co3 2 hco3 and h2po4 concentration increased this was probably because co3 2 and hco3 could react with ros to generate less oxidative co3 and hco3 which suppressed the removal rate 51 moreover h2po4 could react with fe3 to form complexes feh2po4 2 which could mask and passivate the active site of the catalyst 52 more detailed information was shown in fig s8 3 6 possible active radical in the pms catalytic system ros takes charge of the pollutants elimination 53 hence the epr analysis and radical quenching tests were involved to identify whether ros was contributed to the cls ip pms system 54 as literature reported methanol meoh and tertiary butyl alcohol tba were respectively introduced to evidence the existence of so4 and oh because of their disparate reaction rates with so4 and oh 55 56 moreover p benzoquinone p bq and l histidine were usually chosen as the high efficient scavengers for o2 and 1o2 respectively the ar1 removal rate in the cls ip 900 pms system decreased from 94 4 to 77 6 when the tba concentration was 500 mm as the fig 7 a revealing that oh probably produced and took part in the catalytic reaction while the scavenger was converted to the same concentration of meoh the catalytic activity was obviously inhibited and the ar1 removal rate dropped to 60 2 it was obvious that so4 was also involved in the catalytic process furthermore when 5 mm p bq or l histidine participated in the cls ip pms system the removal rate was obviously suppressive and calculated to be 23 1 and 63 4 within 24 min respectively revealing that o2 and 1o2 existed in the cls ip pms system simultaneously and the o2 might play a crucial role in the cls ip pms system this conclusion was consistent with the results of the concentration gradient quenching test in fig s9 in order to ulteriorly demonstrate the presence of the above ros in the reaction system epr measurements were used to verify the existence of four types of ros involved during the catalytic process as exhibited in fig 7 b the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were obviously detected revealing that oh and so4 coexisted in the reaction process as shown in fig 7 c the temp cls ip 900 pms system could obtain special triplet signals with the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 which was attributed to the characteristic peak pattern of temp 1o2 adducts indicating that 1o2 successfully was involved in the solution meanwhile the existence of o2 was demonstrated by the typical sextet signal characteristic of dmpo o2 adducts as shown in fig 7 d in summary so4 oh o2 and 1o2 all worked in the cls ip pms system for ar1 removal and o2 played the most prominent roles 3 7 proposed catalytic mechanism to further analyze the mechanisms of the cls ip 900 removing ar1 xps characterizations were also performed on the fresh and used catalyst as shown in fig 6 b c the fe 2p spectra of cls ip 900 could be separated into two components at 709 6 and 712 3 ev which corresponded with the fe ii and fe iii of fe 2p3 2 respectively according to the peak area the content of fe iii in the catalyst increased from 49 0 to 77 7 and the content of fe ii decreased 51 6 to 22 3 after the reaction indicating that the fe ii fe iii redox conjugate pair participated in the pms activation process pms accepted an electron from fe ii and then the oo bond in pms was broken to form so4 and oh which could oxidate pollutants eq 1 through the epr and quenching test it was proved that the cls ip 900 pms system contained some o2 the reduction potential of o2 o2 was more negative than that of fe iii fe ii indicating that reduction of fe iii by o2 was thermodynamically feasible eq 2 57 to further detect the formation mechanism of o2 the xps spectra of the fresh and used cls ip 900 on the c 1 s region were shown in fig 8 a b in the cls ip 900 the characteristic peaks at 285 6 ev and 287 6 ev corresponded to the co and co respectively compared with fresh cls ip 900 the ratio of the co functional group decreased from 35 3 to 22 7 and the ratio of the co functional group increased from 25 1 to 39 4 after the reaction which demonstrated the co functional group took part in the ar1 removal first pms reacted with h2o to produce h2o2 eq 3 subsequently c o could react with h2o2 to generate c o and ho2 and then the ho2 transformed into o2 eqs 4 and 5 moreover the produced o2 could combine with h and oh to form 1o2 eqs 6 and 7 with the help of pms the recovery of co could be achieved in the acidic condition which constructed the redox conversion between c o and c o eq 8 49 combining with the above analysis a reasonable mechanism of pms activation by the cls ip is proposed and shown in fig s10 1 fe 2 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 4 2 oh so 4 2 2 fe 3 o 2 fe 2 o 2 3 hso 5 h 2 o hso 4 h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 c o c o ho 2 h 5 ho 2 o 2 h 6 o 2 oh o 1 2 oh 7 o 2 2 h o 1 2 h 2 o 2 8 c o hso 5 h c o so 4 h 2 o 4 conclusions in summary an effective strategy was designed to manufacture carbonized loofah sponge encapsulating iron phosphide nanoparticles cls ip through respectively using agricultural waste loofah sponge and natural origin phytic acid as carbon precursor and phosphorus precursor particularly the catalytic activity of the used cls ip could be effectively regenerate after oxalic acid impregnation treatment and the cls ip exhibited remarkable long term stability with almost no loss of activity after 5 months moreover quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance epr proved that oh so4 o2 and 1o2 existed in the removal of ar1 of which o2 played the dominant role this study provided a promising strategy to prepare excellent and environmental friendly

13357,the highly efficient biochar based catalysts from agricultural biomass wastes receive tremendous interest in the wastewater restoration field because of lower cost and environmental friendliness herein the abundant agricultural waste loofah sponge is used as the precursor to prepare eco friendly carbonized loofah sponge encapsulating iron phosphide nanoparticles cls ip by a facile pyrolysis strategy the as synthesized cls ip not only exhibited excellent catalytic activity for acid red 1 removal via activating peroxymonosulfate pms which achieved 94 4 removal in 24 min but also removed other common pollutants including phenolic compounds sulfonamides and dyes besides the iron ions leaching 0 03 0 19 ppm was obviously lower than 2 00 ppm according to european standard even after reuse surprisingly the used cls ip catalyst could be effectively regenerated after the oxalic acid immersion treatment in addition the cls ip still exhibited remarkable catalytic activity even after five months of storage four types of reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 were generated during the reaction and the superoxide radical made a dominant contribution this work provided an avenue for developing low cost biochar based catalysts in environmental remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords loofah sponge porous carbon iron phosphide nanoparticles peroxymonosulfate heterogeneous catalyst 1 introduction recently advanced oxidation processes aops have been extensively used to remove various refractory and toxic pollutants due to high efficiency environmental friendliness and cost effectiveness 1 among them aops based on pms are considered to be a relatively effective and promising technology for pollutants removal 2 in this system pms molecules are decomposed into sulfate radicals so4 with high oxidation potential which directly affects the removal of pollutants 3 the aops based on so4 have been extensively used in the environmental catalysis field which is benefited from the high oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v broad ph adaptation range 2 0 9 0 and long half time 30 40 μs of so4 4 7 presently so4 are mainly generated through pms activation by some strategies such as heat 8 radiation 9 uv irradiation 10 ultrasound and transition metals fe co cu mn 11 14 among these strategies iron based catalyst has been considered as a relatively economical and effective transition metal for pms activation due to the non toxicity and without external energy input 15 compared with homogeneous iron based catalysts heterogeneous iron based catalysts have triggered worldwide attention because they can alleviate secondary pollution 16 correspondingly the disadvantage of heterogeneous iron based catalysts is mainly low catalytic performance which would limit its practical application in recent years carbon based supports such as carbon nanotube and graphene have been extensively employed to support iron doped catalysts because of their good electrical conductivity high resistance in acid base media favorable biocompatibility and large surface area 17 18 li et al successfully prepared fe doped g c3n4 graphene in muff furnace which could activate pms to remove trimethoprim under visible light irradiation 19 gu et al reported that the nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi pda functionalized graphene catalyst reacted with pms could efficiently eliminate 92 0 trichloroethylene 20 however the expensive price potential ecological and environmental threats present in the above carbon based carriers 21 it is imperative to develop a nonhazardous carbon based carrier using low cost and widespread carbon materials recently waste biomass as low cost carbon precursors to prepare the functional catalysts to remove pollutants has been widely investigated li et al manufactured porous biochar loaded iron nanoparticles by multiple high temperature annealing and the catalyst using myosoton aquaticum as carbon precursors 22 li et al used the maize straw as a carbon precursor to successfully synthesize biochar supported nzvi through two times of pyrolysis which could activate pms to remove 99 0 trichloroethylene in 20 min 23 although the above reported catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity they couldn t be efficiently reused and had complex preparation processes thus restricting the practical application therefore more efforts were needed to exploit a novel iron doped biocarbon catalyst with a relatively simple preparation process and excellent catalytic performance as a natural biomass material the loofah sponge is mainly composed of cellulose 66 6 hemicelluloses 17 4 and xylogen 15 4 24 25 it not only contains relatively high carbon content but also has a distinct structure which includes many micron scale hollow multichannel and makes it become a promising raw material for preparing porous carbon 26 moreover the loofah sponges contain a variety of functional groups such as cooh and oh which can chelate with the empty orbital of transition metals ions 27 based on the above considerations the loofah sponge can be utilized as a promising carrier precursor for dispersing and stabilizing transition metal however it is regrettable that there is currently no relevant report on the loofah sponge based transition metal catalysts to activate pms for pollutant degradation ar1 one of the most common dyes is poisonous and carcinogenic to humans and livestock and widely existed as a stubborn pollutant in industrial wastewater 28 29 in this work the catalytic ability was evaluated by the removal of ar1 in aqueous solution we prepared a carbonized loofah sponge encapsulating iron phosphide nanoparticles cls ip by using a loofah sponge as the feedstock of biochar three different cls ip composites pyrolysis at different temperatures of 700 c 800 c and 900 c respectively could be easily prepared by a facile pyrolysis strategy particularly we found that the used cls ip catalyst could basically recover its catalytic activities after oxalic acid treatment besides a viable mechanism for cls ip to activate pms was hypothetically proposed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr technique and quenching tests furthermore the influence of process parameters on the catalytic performance of the cls ip was investigated this research provided new insight into the development of high quality economical and environmentally friendly catalysts for environmental remediation 2 experimental section 2 1

were supplied by mike chemical instrument co ltd hangzhou china 2 2 catalysts preparation the loofah sponge was chopped into 2 cm 2 cm cubes and immersed in 0 5 m naoh for half an hour with ultrasonic to remove some inorganic impurities then washed three times with deionized water subsequently the 60 ml solution containing 4 g fe no3 3 9h20 and 3 725 g phytic acid ultrasonically lasted for 30 min and then put into a beaker to mix with the loofah sponge and then the samples were sonicated for 30 min and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h then these samples were pyrolyzed at 700 c 800 c 900 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere heating rate was 3 c min it was denoted as cls ip 700 cls ip 800 and cls ip 900 respectively for comparison the pa c 900 and c 900 were made from phytic acid with the loofah sponge and the pure loofah sponge at 900 c respectively according to the above same procedures 2 3 characterization of the catalysts xrd bruker d8 discover was used to investigate the crystal structure of the catalysts the catalyst morphology was characterized by a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 and transmission electron microscope tem jeol jem 2100f x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha was used to investigate the valence state and surface composition of the catalyst and the binding energy of all spectra was corrected at 284 8 ev of c 1 s peak fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet nexus 470 was employed to determine the surface functional groups the raman spectra were recorded using a raman spectroscopy renishaw invia with the laser wave length at 514 nm the brunauer emmett and teller bet methods were chosen to verify the textural properties of the catalysts by n2 adsorption desorption data the uv vis spectrum was measured by a uv 2007 spectrometer to obtain the absorption spectra 2 4 experimental procedure and analysis unless otherwise illustrated the catalytic process was initiated by adding the prepared catalyst with the final concentration of 0 5 g l into a 20 ml solution containing pms 0 5 g l and pollutants dyes 50 mg l antibiotics 75 mg l the removal experiments were performed in a 100 ml conical flask using the shaking bath during certain intervals 0 5 ml reaction solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size cellulose filters then transferred to the cuvette or chromatographic sample bottle to detect residue concentration by a uv vis spectrophotometer and the high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a c18 column 250 4 6 nm respectively in the hplc analysis the mobile phase was composed of water and methyl alcohol at a volume ratio of 70 30 epr spectrometer bruker ems plus was used to confirm the active radicals briefly temp and dmpo were designated as the spin trapping agents to demonstrate the presence of so4 oh 1o2 and o2 the computational formula of apparent rate constant k obs was provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the xrd patterns were investigated to verify the crystal structure of the cls ip prepared at different pyrolytic temperatures as depicted in fig 1 a primarily the peaks at 2θ of 13 5 20 4 20 8 28 8 and 29 6 were attributed to the fe2p4o12 jcpds pdf 76 0223 meanwhile the peaks of fe2p2o7 were located at 2θ of 29 7 34 1 35 3 35 8 and 36 4 jcpds pdf 72 1516 30 31 it was obvious that fe2p4o12 and fe2p2o7 were simultaneously found in the cls ip pyrolyzed at 700 c cls ip 700 while the fe2p4o12 signals weakened but the fe2p2o7 signals gradually strengthened at 800 c surprisingly with a further increase of the temperature to 900 c the fe2p4o12 crystalline phase disappeared and the typical fep phase 2θ 30 9 32 7 35 5 37 2 47 0 55 3 56 1 and 79 1 jcpds pdf 78 1443 formed in the cls ip 900 images 32 these results indicated that the ferric phytate complex was pyrolyzed to form fe2p4o12 and fe2p2o7 at low temperature but the fe2p4o12 was transformed to fe2p2o7 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature then reduced to fep by the reductive components formed in the biomass pyrolysis process such as amorphous carbon 33 34 the changes of the derived carbon structures in the cls ip were investigated by raman spectra proverbially the raman spectroscopy of the cls ip exhibited characteristic d 1350 cm 1 and g 1580 cm 1 peaks in fig 1 b the d peaks corresponded to the defect sites or disordered carbons while the g bands were associated with the graphitization degree of the carbon materials 35 definitely with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature ig id value obviously increased from 0 951 to 1 054 revealing that the graphitization degree of cls ip was effectively improved at high pyrolysis temperature 36 the ft ir spectra of the cls ip were shown in fig s1 it was obvious that the characteristic peak at 579 cm 1 corresponded to feo stretching vibrations 37 38 and the o p o stretching vibrations occurring at 1050 cm 1 indicating the phosphorus doping in the carbonized loofah sponge was successful 39 the morphology and microstructure of the cls ip were investigated by sem and tem as shown in fig 2 a there were extensive pores randomly dispersed on the surface of c 900 which is obtained by the pyrolysis of the pure loofah sponge contrastively it could be found that some nanoparticles were observed on the surface of the cls ip 900 in fig 2 b which might conform to fep and fe2p2o7 according to the xrd pattern moreover tem images showed that the cls ip 900 basically comprised disordered carbon layers and iron nanoparticles two lattice spacings of 0 250 and 0 273 nm were revealed in the high resolution tem hrtem images which were consistent with the 020 lattice plane of fe2p2o7 and 011 lattice plane of fep respectively 40 41 the above information indicated that the carbonizing loofah sponge loaded with iron phosphide nanoparticles had been successfully prepared by a facile pyrolysis strategy besides the element mapping and eds of the cls ip 900 clearly illustrated the homogeneous distribution of c p o and fe species the textural properties were one of the crucial factors influencing catalytic performance hence n2 adsorption desorption isotherm was involved in studying the porosity of the cls ip fig s2 the bet surface area of c 900 1342 7 m2 g was obviously higher than the cls ip 900 566 1 m2 g cls ip 800 121 8 m2 g and cls ip 700 55 7 m2 g which probably related to the fact that fe2p2o7 and fep nanoparticles could occupy the adsorption sites on the biochar and the higher pyrolysis temperature would improve porosity development 42 meanwhile the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the cls ip 900 cls ip 800 and cls ip 700 could be classified to type i isotherm based on the iupac nomenclature revealing the presence of typical microporous structure 3 2 catalytic performance in this work the catalytic ability of the cls ip was evaluated by the removal of ar1 a common and hazardous dye as the target pollutant as displayed in fig 3 a the sole pms could inconsiderably change the ar1 concentration in solution and 38 2 removal rate of ar1 occurred with adding the cls ip 900 alone encouragingly the intensity of the uv vis absorption peak at 514 nm decreased obviously and the ar1 removal rate significantly enhanced to 94 4 in the cls ip 900 pms system revealing the remarkable catalytic activity of the cls ip 900 moreover the apparent rate constant k obs was generally employed to quantify the catalytic performance of various catalysts as exhibited in fig 3 c the value of k obs was 0 1257 min 1 in the cls ip 900 pms system which was about 36 6 times better than that in the sole pms system 0 00343 min 1 and even 7 5 times better than that in the c 900 pms system 0 01680 min 1 demonstrating that the doping of iron phosphide in carbonized loofah sponge could significantly improve its catalytic activity to comprehensively compare three catalysts prepared at different temperatures the catalytic performances and the chemical oxygen demand cod removal rate were presented in fig s3 and fig 3 d respectively it was clear that the cls ip pyrolyzed at 900 c exhibited the best catalytic performance among the above catalysts in summary the cls ip 900 was most suitable as the experimental object and was chosen to investigate the effect of the removal mechanism and reaction factors to further evaluate the removal rate of the cls ip 900 pms system on other contaminants a variety of conventional dyes removal experiments were also conducted including reactive red m 3bf 3bf methyl orange mo methylene blue mb reactive blue 19 rb19 acid orange 7 ao7 and rhodamine b rhb notably these conventional dyes could be removed in the cls ip pms system and the removal rate could reach more than 85 in 24 min proving that the cls ip 900 possessed remarkable catalytic activity against the majority of conventional dyes surprisingly the cls ip 900 pms system also exhibited eminent catalytic efficiency in the removal of phenolic pollutants and sulfa pollutants the corresponding removal rate and k obs of the aforesaid pollutants were present in fig 4 c moreover table 1 briefly compared the removal effects of sulfadiazine sdz and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp on different heterogeneous catalysts 43 48 it revealed that the cls ip 900 could achieve better catalytic performance even if the pollutant concentration was relatively high and the amount of catalyst was comparatively low 3 3 reusability and stability of the cls ip taking the cost effectiveness into consideration the reusability of the catalyst was a significant property for the application hence the reuse performance of the cls ip 900 was evaluated as shown in fig s4 after the removal experiment the catalyst was recycled 5 times and the removal rate of ar1 decreased significantly from 95 75 to 70 41 indicating that the removal rate decreased obviously after five cycles therefore it is necessary to find an easy and high efficiency way to restore the catalytic activity of the used catalyst for practical application traditional methods for regeneration such as ethanol cleaning thermal treatment or ultrasonication were unsuitable for the operation or the regeneration effect was not satisfactory fig s5 hence oxalic acid was selected as a regenerant to recover the activity of catalyst due to its inexpensive price environmental friendliness and suited reducibility as displayed in fig s6 the oxalic acid pms system had little effect on the removal of ar1 surprisingly the removal rate of the cls ip 900 recovered to 95 32 after oxalic acid treatment the recovery of the catalytic performance might be attributed to the increase of the fe ii in the catalyst to identify the speculate the xps spectra of the used cls ip before and after oxalic acid treatment were measured as in fig 4 xps spectra of fe 2p core level were resolved into four peaks at 709 6 712 3 ev for fe 2p3 2 and 724 4 728 2 ev for fe 2p1 2 for fe 2p3 2 the peaks at 709 6 ev and 712 3 ev corresponded to fe ii and fe iii respectively according to peak intensity the proportion of fe ii remarkably increased from 22 17 to 47 22 after oxalic acid treatment while the proportion of fe iii decreased from 77 83 to 52 78 fig 4 c d which was consistent with the above speculate and the overflow of iron ion spillover in the table s2 compared with the fresh catalyst the activity of the cls ip was almost unchanged after five months of storage fig s7 demonstrating its excellent long term stability 3 4 effects of factors on ar1 removal the influence of temperature on ar1 removal was displayed from 15 c to 55 c in fig 5 a obviously the ar1 removal rate increased from 81 96 to 97 23 within 16 min and the k obs increased from 0 114 min 1 to 0 252 min 1 with increasing reaction temperature some researches show that high temperature could speed up the activation of pms and generate more radicals thereby increasing the frequency of collisions between pollutants and radicals and further enhancing the reaction activity meanwhile the activation energy ea of the cls ip 900 was determined to be 17 06 kj mol by the arrhenius equation which is lower than most of the reported transition metal catalysts table s5 in this work a suppositional reaction mechanism dominated by o2 was proposed during the ar1 removal process meanwhile according to literature reports the temperature had little effect on the activity of o2 which might lead to a low activation energy of cls ip 900 pms system 49 moreover the low ea value was beneficial to reduce the energy supply of the catalytic system and was conducive to the practical applications of sewage treatment 50 initial ph was generally considered as a crucial factor to influence the catalytic ability the ar1 removal rate remained over 93 9 when the initial ph increased from 3 to 11 and corresponding k obs were calculated to be 0 274 0 217 0 209 0 156 and 0 106 min 1 respectively indicating that the cls ip 900 possessed superior ph tolerance it was obvious that the acidic condition stimulated the catalytic activity which probably related to the fact that acidic ph promoted the dissolution of fe ii in cls ip and accelerated the generation of the free radical moreover the iron spillage under the different initial ph conditions were determined by icp oes analysis table s2 and the spillage were tested to be 0 16 0 13 0 09 0 05 and 0 03 ppm in different initial ph values respectively which were much lower than the eu standards 2 0 ppm overall the superior ph tolerance and low spillage of the iron in the cls ip 900 under broad ph conditions suggest its promising potential for wastewater treatment moreover the ar1 removal with increasing the cls ip 900 dosage was shown in fig 5 c the removal rate significantly increased from 67 2 to 94 8 when the dosage of the cls ip 900 increased from 0 1 g l to 0 5 g l while the ar1 removal almost remained unchanged from 0 5 g l to 2 0 g l it could be considered that more catalyst dosage leads to more catalytic active sites which promote the generation of active radicals and benefit pollutants degradation however the further increase of catalyst dosage produced excessive active radicals and led to a self scavenging reaction which inhibited a further increase in the removal rate similarly the ar1 removal showed an upward trend when the pms dosage increased from 0 1 mm to 0 5 mm fig 5 d besides the removal rate remained almost unchanged when the pms dosage further increased to more than 1 mm further taking catalytic rate and economic benefits into consideration 0 5 mm pms and 0 5 g l cls ip 900 were preferred as the fixed oxidant concentration and catalyst dosage in this experiment 3 5 effects of inorganic anions as we all know a variety of anions species were ubiquitous in practical wastewater taking it into consideration the impact of several familiar anions ions cl no3 h2po4 so4 2 hco3 co3 2 on the ar1 removal was evaluated and the influence of k obs values and the removal rate of ar1 of the above anions species were showed in fig 6 obviously the k obs for removing ar1 decreased from 0 126 to 0 090 and 0 063 min 1 in the presence of 10 mm cl and no3 respectively while the removal rates were barely inhibited in 24 min unexpectedly the removal rate significantly decreased to 64 32 after adding 10 mm so4 2 which could be attributed to the fact that excessive so4 2 decreased the so4 so4 2 oxidative redox potential orp thereby slowing down the generation of so4 and inhibiting the catalytic activity of the cls ip 900 19 obviously the k obs and ar1 removal rate remarkably decreased as the co3 2 hco3 and h2po4 concentration increased this was probably because co3 2 and hco3 could react with ros to generate less oxidative co3 and hco3 which suppressed the removal rate 51 moreover h2po4 could react with fe3 to form complexes feh2po4 2 which could mask and passivate the active site of the catalyst 52 more detailed information was shown in fig s8 3 6 possible active radical in the pms catalytic system ros takes charge of the pollutants elimination 53 hence the epr analysis and radical quenching tests were involved to identify whether ros was contributed to the cls ip pms system 54 as literature reported methanol meoh and tertiary butyl alcohol tba were respectively introduced to evidence the existence of so4 and oh because of their disparate reaction rates with so4 and oh 55 56 moreover p benzoquinone p bq and l histidine were usually chosen as the high efficient scavengers for o2 and 1o2 respectively the ar1 removal rate in the cls ip 900 pms system decreased from 94 4 to 77 6 when the tba concentration was 500 mm as the fig 7 a revealing that oh probably produced and took part in the catalytic reaction while the scavenger was converted to the same concentration of meoh the catalytic activity was obviously inhibited and the ar1 removal rate dropped to 60 2 it was obvious that so4 was also involved in the catalytic process furthermore when 5 mm p bq or l histidine participated in the cls ip pms system the removal rate was obviously suppressive and calculated to be 23 1 and 63 4 within 24 min respectively revealing that o2 and 1o2 existed in the cls ip pms system simultaneously and the o2 might play a crucial role in the cls ip pms system this conclusion was consistent with the results of the concentration gradient quenching test in fig s9 in order to ulteriorly demonstrate the presence of the above ros in the reaction system epr measurements were used to verify the existence of four types of ros involved during the catalytic process as exhibited in fig 7 b the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were obviously detected revealing that oh and so4 coexisted in the reaction process as shown in fig 7 c the temp cls ip 900 pms system could obtain special triplet signals with the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 which was attributed to the characteristic peak pattern of temp 1o2 adducts indicating that 1o2 successfully was involved in the solution meanwhile the existence of o2 was demonstrated by the typical sextet signal characteristic of dmpo o2 adducts as shown in fig 7 d in summary so4 oh o2 and 1o2 all worked in the cls ip pms system for ar1 removal and o2 played the most prominent roles 3 7 proposed catalytic mechanism to further analyze the mechanisms of the cls ip 900 removing ar1 xps characterizations were also performed on the fresh and used catalyst as shown in fig 6 b c the fe 2p spectra of cls ip 900 could be separated into two components at 709 6 and 712 3 ev which corresponded with the fe ii and fe iii of fe 2p3 2 respectively according to the peak area the content of fe iii in the catalyst increased from 49 0 to 77 7 and the content of fe ii decreased 51 6 to 22 3 after the reaction indicating that the fe ii fe iii redox conjugate pair participated in the pms activation process pms accepted an electron from fe ii and then the oo bond in pms was broken to form so4 and oh which could oxidate pollutants eq 1 through the epr and quenching test it was proved that the cls ip 900 pms system contained some o2 the reduction potential of o2 o2 was more negative than that of fe iii fe ii indicating that reduction of fe iii by o2 was thermodynamically feasible eq 2 57 to further detect the formation mechanism of o2 the xps spectra of the fresh and used cls ip 900 on the c 1 s region were shown in fig 8 a b in the cls ip 900 the characteristic peaks at 285 6 ev and 287 6 ev corresponded to the co and co respectively compared with fresh cls ip 900 the ratio of the co functional group decreased from 35 3 to 22 7 and the ratio of the co functional group increased from 25 1 to 39 4 after the reaction which demonstrated the co functional group took part in the ar1 removal first pms reacted with h2o to produce h2o2 eq 3 subsequently c o could react with h2o2 to generate c o and ho2 and then the ho2 transformed into o2 eqs 4 and 5 moreover the produced o2 could combine with h and oh to form 1o2 eqs 6 and 7 with the help of pms the recovery of co could be achieved in the acidic condition which constructed the redox conversion between c o and c o eq 8 49 combining with the above analysis a reasonable mechanism of pms activation by the cls ip is proposed and shown in fig s10 1 fe 2 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 4 2 oh so 4 2 2 fe 3 o 2 fe 2 o 2 3 hso 5 h 2 o hso 4 h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 c o c o ho 2 h 5 ho 2 o 2 h 6 o 2 oh o 1 2 oh 7 o 2 2 h o 1 2 h 2 o 2 8 c o

agricultural waste loofah sponge and natural origin phytic acid as carbon precursor and phosphorus precursor particularly the catalytic activity of the used cls ip could be effectively regenerate after oxalic acid impregnation treatment and the cls ip exhibited remarkable long term stability with almost no loss of activity after 5 months moreover quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance epr proved that oh so4 o2 and 1o2 existed in the removal of ar1 of which o2 played the dominant role this study provided a promising strategy to prepare excellent and environmental friendly

macau department of civil and environmental engineering faculty of science and technology university of macau taipa macau department of civil and environmental engineering faculty of science and technology corresponding author sodium chloride halite scale precipitation has become a serious operational threat to many industries although water dilution is the primary halite treatment method water availability and water quality can be a significant challenge chemical inhibition as an alternative management approach can supplement water dilution providing the needed halite scaling control the most commonly adopted experimental methods to assess halite threat and to evaluate halite inhibitor performance are the static jar test methods however there are limited studies to systematically evaluate the accuracy and quality of these jar test based methods in this study temperature driven jar test method one and brine mixing associated jar test method two methods were adopted for evaluation these two methods were compared in terms of method accuracy and quality to assess halite threat it shows that method one is more applicable for halite scaling studies with a lower target saturation level method two is more suitable for scenarios with a higher saturation level and or demanding a greater accuracy the study can be very beneficial to halite scale management and halite scale inhibitor selection this can result in a considerable reduction in freshwater demand and the amount of produced water to be generated afterwards the significance of this achievement is not only in operational cost saving but also in water resource preservation and water sustainability graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations esd electronic supporting data available di water

electron microscopy ssp scalesoftpitzer keywords halite mineral scale scale inhibitor jar test water preservation 1 introduction sodium chloride halite salt is perhaps the most ubiquitous mineral in nature seawater typically contains 3 nacl where in formation brine the nacl content can be anywhere from 5 and up to nacl solubility of over 20 1 different from many carbonate and sulfate based minerals halite has an exceedingly higher solubility in water therefore halite has long been regarded as an unconventional or exotic mineral scale in industry especially in petroleum industry that suffers profoundly from scale associated threats and financial loss 2 3 mineral scale is the crystalline inorganic solid precipitated from the aqueous phase 4 9 the most commonly observed scales in industry are carbonates and sulfates whenever there is a change in production system condition and or a fluid mixing event these common scales have the potential to precipitate and deposit onto the surface of production systems 10 11 scales can form inside reservoir pipelines and processing facilities resulting in a significant operational risk and deferred productions 11 12 halite scaling issue is a major concern in offshore and shale productions in the past two decades 3 13 due to geologic reasons the reservoir water in shale field typically contains a very high content of nacl during the shale production process enormous water evaporation can take place as a result of hydraulic fracturing treatment 13 14 another factor contributing to halite supersaturation is the decrease of production system temperature from reservoir to surface these two factors can result in halite supersaturation in the produced brine water and subsequent precipitation of halite solids since halite has a high water solubility a slight supersaturation can produce a massive amount of halite solid precipitates deposited halite solid can significantly reduce production tubing throughput and in extreme cases can completely block the production tubing 3 in addition halite deposition can take place in the reservoir pore space leading to formation damage 15 the primary treatment method for halite scale is water dilution wherein a large volume of fresh water or water with a low salinity is injected into the production system at the location upstream of halite damage as elaborated in the previous studies obtaining a large amount of low salinity water can be challenging due to water availability regulations or logistical issues 16 each extra barrel of fresh water injected along with the produced water has to be treated at some places this treatment can cost dollars per barrel of produced brine 17 another challenge associated water dilution is the formation of carbonate and sulfate mineral scales during commingling of formation water with injection water thus a considerable effort is normally required to pre treat the source water to remove ionic species before water injection which can be costly and time consuming an alternative halite control strategy relies on chemical inhibition chemical inhibitors are a group of specialty chemicals designed to kinetically postpone scale formation so that scale particles will not deposit inside the reservoir or on the surface of critical production facilities 4 9 the functioning mechanisms of scale inhibitors can include cation sequestration nucleation inhibition crystal distortion or threshold inhibition 17 compared with the inhibitors commonly adopted to control carbonate and sulfate scales halite inhibitors are typically applied at a much higher dose rate a key aspect in halite scale study is to experimentally determine halite precipitation induction time and to evaluate inhibitory effectiveness of halite inhibitors nucleation theory states that an energy barrier needs to be overcome so that the initial crystals can form larger settable particles via particle aggregation 18 induction time t0 is the time duration from the time point when supersaturation is achieved to the time point when scale formation can be detected visually or instrumentally 19 due to its functionality scale inhibitor can prolong t0 by delaying scale formation kinetics the extent of t0 extension is sizable depending on supersaturation inhibitor type and dosage currently there are several reported experimental methods to measure halite scale t0 in the absence and presence of inhibitors the most commonly adopted approach is the temperature driven jar test method 20 in this method a nacl solution inside a static jar is heated to form an undersaturated brine solution at a higher temperature this brine solution will be subsequently cooled to the target temperature during the cooling process the tested brine will become supersaturated with respect to halite and halite deposition will take place inhibitor effectiveness can be quantified by measuring t0 in the presence of inhibitors of different types and concentrations this method is fast and easy to carry out ideal for field testing however the drawback of this method is that only a small saturation level can be established by this method limited by brine boiling point and nacl solubility moreover due to the coupled effect of temperature and time it is technically difficult to identify accurately the onset of t0 a modified version of the temperature driven method is to achieve superstation by evaporating water from saturated nacl brine however this method also suffers from a limited saturation level another method to evaluate halite scale is brine mixing associated jar test method 21 this method involves mixing a saturated or nearly saturated nacl brine with another highly concentrated chloride brine such as cacl2 or mgcl2 in a static jar upon mixing these two brines the mixture brine will become supersaturated with nacl the advantage of this method over the previous one is that a much higher supersaturation level can be obtained via brine mixing additionally the brine mixing method eliminates the impact of coupled effect of temperature and time another important aspect in halite scaling study is to predict halite scale precipitation via computational modeling scale threat can be evaluated quantitatively by calculating the saturation ratio sr or saturation index si of the mineral scale of concern 2 s i t p lo g 10 s r t p lo g 10 iap k sp lo g 10 a n a a c l k sp where srt p and sit p are defined as the saturation ratio and saturation index respectively at a given pressure and temperature iap denotes ion activity product a na and a cl represent the activities of sodium and chloride ions respectively ksp is the solubility product of mineral solid at the given condition the brine solution is regarded as supersaturated with nacl if the calculated halite sr is larger than 1 or si higher than zero thermodynamically sr or si is the driving force for scale nucleus formation and subsequent scale solid precipitation one of the most challenging tasks in computing halite si is to correctly calculate the activity coefficients of na and cl species in complicated brines versus t and p the challenge associated with computing na and cl activities is exacerbated by the high aqueous solubility of nacl the impact of other divalent species and the temperature impact on nacl solubility therefore a robust computational model is required to accurately handle the complex calculations involved in halite scale predictions the most widely adopted approach in understanding the ionic species behavior in brine solution is the pitzer theory 22 pitzer equations can accurately calculate the impact of various physiochemical factors such as brine compositions pressure and temperature on ion activity coefficient in saline environment in this study the two commonly adopted jar test based methods have been experimentally evaluated in a careful and systematic manner the selected jar test methods are temperature driven method and brine mixing method jar test methods are chosen in this study in that these methods are both fast and easy to carry out ideal for assessing field halite threat and inhibitor effectiveness the focus of this study is to examine the accuracy and quality of each method the impact of divalent ion on method accuracy has been discussed surface characterization was carried out to evaluate the morphologies of the formed halite scale particles furthermore both methods were adopted to evaluate inhibitory effectiveness of halite inhibitors of different concentrations and compositions t0 in the absence and presence of halite inhibitors was determined experimentally from a computational standpoint halite si and brine chemistry were calculated using scalesoftpitzer software version ssp22020 hereinafter abbreviated as ssp a software package based upon pitzer theory 23 24 experimentally obtained halite precipitation results were compared against the software predictions this study systematically evaluates the accuracy of the two common jar test methods the objective is to correctly and accurately evaluate halite scale threat and to identify the most appropriate halite inhibitor with a simple experimental setup in a rapid and accurate manner correct understanding of halite threat can significantly facilitate halite scale management and eliminate the severe consequence of halite blockage selection of a proper halite inhibitor can result in a considerable reduction in freshwater demand and the amount of produced water to be generated afterwards the significance of this achievement is not only in operational cost saving but also in water resource preservation and water sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium chloride nacl solid and calcium chloride cacl2 solid solid were reagent grade and purchased from fisher scientific potassium ferrocyanide fe cn 6 4 hereafter abbreviated as fcn was purchased from sigma aldrich and used as halite scale inhibitor other tested halite scale inhibitors are commercially available provided by various chemical vendor companies deionized water di water was prepared by reverse osmosis followed by a four stage ion exchange water purification process including a cation anion column two ion exchange column and an organics removal column barnstead internationals 2 2 method one temperature driven jar test method similar to a previously reported study 3 in this method brine solution supersaturation with respect to nacl is achieved by gradually cooling a pre heated solution from 95 c to a lower temperature when the system temperature is 95 c the tested brine solution is undersaturated with respect to halite si 0 reduction in system temperature will result in solution supersaturation due to reduction in nacl solubility to begin with at an ambient condition 1 atm and 25 c nacl solid with a mass of 6 422 g and a volume of di water together with a teflon coated magnetic stir bar were added into a 20 ml glass vial to prepare an inhibitor free nacl solution brine 1a in another experiment 6 422 g nacl solid di water and a volume of inhibitor aqueous solution were all added into another 20 ml glass vial to prepare a nacl inhibitor mixture solution brine 1b in both experiments the concentration of nacl in the mixture solution is set at 6 32 m molality in both cases the total amount of water is 17 398 g including water from di water and water from inhibitor solution next a 5 00 m nacl solution without inhibitor brine 1c was prepared in a 20 ml glass vial at an ambient condition the glass vial containing brine 1c was involved in this study to measure solution temperature fig 1 a the temperature of brine 1a and 1b is assumed to be the same as brine 1c during the course of the experiment subsequently the glass vials containing brine 1a 1b and 1c were placed into an oil bath with the system temperature carefully monitored and controlled these three glass vials were heated to 95 c with constant stirring to dissolve nacl solid after statically heating the vials in an oil bath at 95 c for 20 min all three vials were subsequently transferred to another oil bath with an identical setup at a lower temperature of either 37 c or 50 c fig 1b during the brine solution cooling process halite formation kinetics together with solution temperature profile were simultaneously monitored t0 herein is defined as the time duration from the onset of solution cooling to the time when solid precipitates can be visually observed in brine 1a or 1b 2 3 method two brine mixing jar test method in this method halite supersaturation was achieved by mixing a saturated halite solution a salt solution with a high chloride concentration and a halite inhibitor solution without brine solution cooling as illustrated in fig 2 the experimental setup includes a water bath to maintain the system temperature between 25 c and 90 c a stainless steel coil tubing and a stainless steel column packed with pure nacl solid together with two glass tubes were inter connected and placed inside the water bath one glass tube was used as a waste tube and the other one as the testing tube for running experiments brine solution was loaded from a glass bottle into the coil tubing by a peristaltic pump biotech p 500 pharmacia a gastight syringe was employed to inject solution into the testing tube submerged inside the water bath to begin the temperature of the water bath was set to the target temperature to maintain a fixed temperature for all the apparatus inside the water bath next an inhibitor free 6 11 m nacl solution brine 2a was prepared in a glass bottle and loaded into the pre heated coil tubing followed by the nacl column the nacl column was employed to subject the flowing brine solution saturated with nacl at the set temperature the first 15 ml brine coming out from the nacl column was discarded into the waste tube subsequently 20 ml of saturated nacl solution was delivered into the testing tube a 3 way valve was employed to switch the flow path of the the effluent solution from nacl column between the waste tube and the test tube the testing tube contains a teflon coated stir bar and a known volume of an inhibitor brine solution inside the gastight syringe is a highly concentrated chloride salt solution with a composition of 6 70 m cacl2 i e 13 4 m cl brine 2b upon completion of brine 2a loading into the testing tube a volume of brine 2b was gradually injected into the testing tube under constant stirring to achieve halite supersaturation in method two brine mixing associated halite solid precipitation was detected by a green laser of 532 nm similar to previous halite studies 25 26 the detection method of scale precipitate using green laser is detailed in section s1 of the electronic supporting data esd t0 is defined as the time duration from the completion of brine 2b injection to time point when the measured laser signal starts to reduce due to halite formation the compositions of the synthetic brines adopted in this study are listed in section s2 of the esd 2 4 halite inhibitor screening studies both methods were adopted to evaluate halite inhibition effectiveness of two polymeric halite inhibitors furthermore method two was utilized to screen the effectiveness of various inhibitors in a rapid manner in these studies the concentrations of scale inhibitors are reported as the product concentrations as for fcn the reported concentration is the active fcn concentration 2 5 analytical methods concentrations of cationic species were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 4300 perkin elmer details of icp oes measurement is shown in section s3 of the esd solid surface morphologies were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy sem fei quanta 400 hillsboro oregon the sem instrument was equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edxs for elemental analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature driven jar test method method one the experimental details of each figure from fig 3 to fig 6 are summarized in section s4 of the esd laboratory investigations was carried out following method one approach to understand the accuracy and quality of this commonly adopted method in addition due to its simplicity method one was utilized to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of the selected software package for halite scale predictions note that the unit of nacl salt aqueous concentration in this study is molality which is mole of nacl per kilogram of water molality is the unit of ionic species adopted in thermodynamic calculations 23 according to method one the test brine solutions were cooled by oil bathing from 95 c to either 37 c or 50 c as shown in fig 3a it took 30 min to cool down the test solutions from ca 77 c to reach 37 c correspondingly the calculated halite si increased from 0 028 undersaturated to 0 025 supersaturated si value reached zero saturation at 55 3 c in the blank test using brine 1a halite scale formed at approximately 4 5 min and 56 7 c corresponding to a calculated halite si of 0 002 the fact that the difference between the calculated halite si of 0 002 and the true si at saturation i e zero is exceedingly small suggests that ssp software is capable of handling the brine chemistry calculations involving a significant nacl content more than 6 m the measured si difference of 0 002 can be attributed to the inaccuracy of the temperature measurement since temperature was indirectly measured in this method therefore it can be confirmed that ssp software is suitable to perform brine chemistry and si calculations involved in halite precipitation subsequently method one was utilized to evaluate halite inhibitors using oil bath at 37 c two polymer based halite inhibitors poly 1 and poly 2 were tested for their halite scale controlling effectiveness from 1 to 1000 mg l 1 table 1 shows that both polymeric inhibitors demonstrate similar halite inhibition effectiveness for instance poly 1 inhibitor at 100 mg l 1 can extend the t0 to 16 5 min when the temperature was ca 40 2 c corresponding to a halite si of ca 0 021 poly 1 inhibitor at the same dose can extend t0 to about 15 min for both inhibitors the increase in inhibitor concentration leads to an increase in t0 this suggests that this method is able to evaluate inhibitor effectiveness as for 50 c experiments fig 3b it took about 40 min to cool down the test solutions from ca 80 c to 50 c correspondingly the calculated halite si increased from 0 03 undersaturated to 0 008 supersaturated si value reached zero at 55 2 c in the blank test halite scale formed at ca 16 min and 52 2 c which corresponds to a calculated halite si of 0 004 again the calculated si based on experimental observation is very close to the true saturation si indicative of the reconciliation between modeling calculation and experimental observation compared with the 37 c experiment both the temperature reduction rate and halite si increase rate become slower suggesting halite formation kinetics will be reduced as well as presented in table 1 at 50 c condition poly 1 and poly 2 inhibitors show a similar halite inhibition effectiveness by extending t0 from 16 min in the blank test to over 50 min method one adopts a temperature driven approach to generate halite precipitation this method can study halite formation kinetics and screen different halite inhibitors with a simple experimental setup in a straightforward manner thus this method is the most commonly adopted approach in laboratory studies on halite scale however this method has obvious limitations firstly this method can only establish a relatively small halite si value which is limited by brine boiling point and nacl solubility secondly both system temperature and corresponding halite si values are constantly changing during cooling making it difficult to accurately identify the onset of the induction time 3 2 brine mixing associated precipitation test method in view of the drawbacks of method one method two was adopted to address the limitations of the temperature driven method as shown in fig 2 halite supersaturation in the testing tube solution was generated by adding brine 2b into the testing tube brine 2b contains a high concentration of cacl2 previous studies suggest that the presence of divalent cations can considerably impact the effectiveness of halite scale inhibitors 3 27 the quality of method two has been examined by a number of halite scale precipitation experiments at different conditions as shown in fig 4 a four sets of halite precipitation experiments were conducted following the approach of method two at varying aqueous calcium concentration or ca2 from 0 to 1 1 m at an ambient temperature of 25 c letter s and n stand for the testing results of scale formation and no scale formation respectively method two adopts a green laser detector to identify the onset of halite precipitation which enhances the experimental accuracy compared with visual observation the reported halite si values were calculated based upon brine chemistry data fig 4a shows that halite precipitation experimental results match well with the model calculation prediction experimental results indicate that halite scale formed when the calculated halite si is slightly above zero and no halite precipitation occurred when si is slightly below zero the experimental error with respect to halite formation is within 0 0005 si unit when ca2 is lower than 0 8 m in other words when ca2 0 8 m if si is above 0 0005 the experimental result is always s and if si is lower than 0 0005 the experimental result is always n satisfactory experimental and modeling results can be obtained even when ca2 is up to 1 05 m ca 37 000 mg l 1 when ca2 is 1 05 m halite formation experimental error is within 0 0008 si unit as discussed above the accuracy of method one is ca 0 002 si for the 37 c experiment and 0 004 si for the 50 c experiment in the absence of ca2 species for both cases a comparison of results following method one and method two indicates that method two is more accurate than the temperature driven based method one with a considerably reduced experimental error the key differences between method two and method one are the experimental approaches in achieving halite supersaturation and scale precipitation detection method furthermore by comparing experimental results following method two with brine chemistry calculations ssp can accurately predict halite solubility and scaling risks to the accuracy of within 0 0005 to 0 0008 si unit with up to 1 m ca2 from an analytical standpoint si uncertainty caused by method two approach is lower than that introduced by operational error in analyzing field brine compositions detailed calculation shown in section s5 of the esd similar to the halite scaling study at 25 c precipitation experiments were conducted at higher temperatures of 50 70 and 90 c following method two approach fig 4b presents the si values when no halite precipitation could be observed by the green laser at different experimental scenarios the corresponding sr values were also given fig 4b suggest that both ca2 and temperature can impact halite deposition and experimental accuracy of method two and ca2 seems to be more influential than temperature generally at a lower ca2 of ca 0 12 m method two accuracy can be as high as 0 002 si at 70 c and 90 c method two accuracy is within 0 005 si when ca2 is between 0 5 m and 1 0 m obviously the increase in ca2 can impact halite scaling calculations compromising the method accuracy especially at a very high ca2 of beyond 1 m this can be attributed to the impact of ca2 species on the ionic activity coefficient 22 24 subsequent to the precipitation experiments the formed halite scale solid was extracted from the aqueous solution for instrumental analysis on morphology and crystal composition fig 4c shows that in the presence of ca2 of 0 82 m and halite si of 0 005 at 25 c the formed halite scale is of cubic crystal morphology which is characteristic of halite mineral in addition edxs study indicates that there was no ca element detected in the halite solid precipitate fig 4d these instrumental analyses suggests that brine mixing associated halite precipitation is generally a result of homogeneous nucleation process although there were sufficient foreign species ca2 in this case no ca2 was involved into the crystal structure of nacl nuclei 28 3 3 screening of halite scale inhibitors by adopting method two method two was adopted to evaluate the halite inhibition effectiveness of a number of polymer based halite inhibitors together with fcn the functional groups of these polymeric inhibitors include phosphonate acrylate aspartate sulfonate etc as shown in table 2 fcn was included in the tested inhibitor list since fcn is a commonly used halite inhibitor 17 moreover it is a common practice in halite inhibitor evaluation to compare the performance of the tested inhibitors against that of fcn 3 29 in order to expedite the halite precipitation process laboratory testing of these halite inhibitors were conducted at a mildly supersaturated experimental condition with a halite si of 0 006 at 25 c it can be calculated that the amount of nacl salt that would be precipitated out of the brine solution is ca 2183 mg l 1 which is equivalent to approximately 76 pound solid per 100 barrel of produced water the concentration of tested polymeric inhibitors is set at 100 mg l 1 as product concentration and the concentration of fcn is 20 mg l 1 as the active species concentration table 3 presents the experimentally measured t0 in the presence and absence of halite inhibitors in the absence of inhibitors t0 for the blank test is determined to be only 1 7 min the presence of halite inhibitor can extend t0 to a sizable duration depending on the types of inhibitors particularly the five carboxylate sulfonate copolymer inhibitors i e cs 1 to cs 5 demonstrated the best inhibition effectiveness among all polymeric inhibitors tested by extending t0 to as long as over 1000 min in addition fcn also shows a very desirable inhibition effectiveness at the testing condition clearly the developed method two is capable of screening different types of halite inhibitors in a convenient and rapid manner after identifying the top performers among all tested polymeric inhibitors these five carboxylate sulfonate copolymer inhibitors cs 1 to cs 5 were selected for further evaluation at harsher experimental conditions with a higher si value a higher ca2 and an elevated temperature as shown in fig 5 a halite precipitation can be inhibited for over 80 000 s in the presence of 100 mg l 1 cs 5 inhibitor at a halite si of 0 006 and 25 c the constant straight line of laser signal intensity in fig 5a suggests of no halite precipitation however when the system temperature was increased to 70 c with a higher halite si of 0 014 fig 5b halite scale started to precipitate as early as 2000 s 33 min although the inhibitor concentration has been considerably increased to 1700 mg l 1 this result indicates that cs 5 inhibitor one of the best polymeric inhibitors tested according to table 3 is less effective in inhibiting halite scale at the testing experimental condition method two is able to evaluate inhibitor performance at different experimental conditions as for the other four cs inhibitors laboratory evaluation following method two suggests that they cannot inhibit halite scale at the harsher experimental condition furthermore these four cs inhibitors appeared to form metal scale precipitate possibly due to ca2 incompatibility therefore it is necessary to synthesize novel halite inhibitors to control halite scale at elevated si conditions to cope with the operational needs 3 4 evaluation of synergistic effect in halite inhibition using method two in field operations it is not uncommon to adopt the approach of applying multiple inhibitors to take advantage of inhibitory synergistic effect the synergistic effect of scale inhibitors refers to the phenomenon that a combination of different inhibitors may demonstrate an improved inhibitory performance compared to an individual inhibitor 17 in a recent study it was reported that a synergy of inhibiting halite scale can be observed by applying fcn inhibitor in the presence of pb2 3 with the hydrocarbon productions into deeper reservoir and or harsher environment such as shale operations the experienced halite si values and divalent metal concentrations can be considerably greater than those in the aforementioned experimental conditions other than system temperature reduction significant water evaporation can markedly exacerbate halite formation and subsequent precipitation for example it has been reported that over 20 of water samples from a number of production wells in the bakken field are calculated with halite si values up to 0 2 and one sample with a halite si of over 0 4 16 to combat halite scaling problems with elevated halite si values in this study efforts have been made to investigate the synergistic inhibition effect by applying multiple scale inhibitors simultaneously at an elevated halite si the synergistic effect of applying multiple scale inhibitors have been reported and discussed in the previous studies 27 30 such synergistic effect is believed due to the interactions among the added inhibitors and the incumbent chemicals after adding another scale inhibitor s these inhibitors in the aqueous phase can form an inhibitor complex another reason for the synergistic effect of combining multiple scale inhibitors is the modification of chemical structure of inhibitors 3 17 in this study method two was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined halite inhibitors as elaborated before method one can only establish a relatively small halite si value in this study synergetic inhibition effect was evaluated at a halite si of 0 09 sr 1 23 with a brine composition of 0 6 m ca2 353 800 mg l 1 tds at an experimental temperature of 70 c although fcn is a common halite inhibitor there are limited studies on the synergistic effect of fcn and other inhibitors particularly polymeric halite inhibitors since cs 5 inhibitor demonstrated a desirable performance when tested individually table 3 synergistic inhibition effect was evaluated by combining fcn and cs 5 inhibitor as shown in fig 6 a halite scale precipitation took place immediately after the onset of the experiment in the absence of halite inhibitor this is evidenced by the rapid decline of the measured laser intensity for the blank test as for the results of testing fcn 20 mg l 1 or cs 5 inhibitor 130 mg l 1 individually it shows that halite scale precipitation still occurred shortly after the onset of the experiment evidenced by the reduction of the laser light intensity however compared with the blank test result both inhibitors showed obvious inhibitory effect especially within the first 2000 s comparatively speaking fcn 20 mg l 1 demonstrated an enhanced inhibition effect relative to cs 5 130 mg l 1 at the time point of 1000 s the light intensity was higher for the test with fcn considering the fcn concentration was only 15 of cs 5 concentration this suggests that fcn might be a more effective halite inhibitor than the polymer based cs 5 at the testing condition moreover it should be noted that the cs 5 inhibitor concentration shown in fig 5b was more than ten times higher than that in fig 6a and halite si in fig 5b si 0 14 was much lower than that in fig 6a si 0 09 thus halite precipitation was effectively inhibited with a relatively unchanged laser intensity for the first 2000 s in fig 5b a clear synergistic effect can be evidenced in fig 6a when fcn of 20 mg l 1 and cs 5 of 130 mg l 1 were both present at the testing condition it shows that the measured laser intensity level stayed relatively stable for a period of over 8000 s such a synergistic effect can also be evidenced by visual observation of the laser light scattering in the testing tube due to the tyndall effect incoming laser light can be scattered by the formed colloidal scale particles little or no scale formation can allow the laser light passing through the aqueous solution with insignificant light scattering as shown in fig 6b only the condition of applying both inhibitors can result in a minimum light scattering strong light scattering can be observed in the other three scenarios especially for the blank test further studies are required to obtain mechanistic understanding of the synergistic effect of fcn with carboxylate sulfonate polymeric inhibitors in halite inhibition based on the aforementioned discussions on evaluating both method one and method two to assess halite scale threat and halite inhibitor performance it is thus suggested that method one is the preferred approach when the target halite si is low lower than 0 02 si unit and an accuracy of 0 002 si is accepted it is suggested to adopt method two if the target halite si is high higher than 0 02 si unit and or a high accuracy of 0 0005 si is required as a future work the laboratory halite inhibitor performance testing results from this study will be compared against halite inhibitor field trial results to evaluate the applicability of the laboratory methods for field halite control in practical applications 4 conclusions in this study both temperature driven jar test method method one and brine mixing associated jar test method method two were experimentally evaluated for their accuracy and quality in assessing halite threat and halite inhibitor performance although method one can evaluate halite scale threat with a simple setup and the accuracy of this method is reasonably well 0 002 si this method can only establish a relatively small halite si value lower than 0 02 si and it is difficult to measure induction time accurately due to coupled effect of temperature and time method two can overcome these limitations since halite supersaturation is not driven by temperature reduction method two can accommodate a wider range of halite si with a higher accuracy 0 0005 si the software package of ssp is proven to be able to satisfactorily handle the complicated halite related brine chemistry calculations at various experimental conditions additional experimental observations suggest that solution calcium concentration can have a considerable impact on halite precipitation and the accuracy of this method laboratory inhibitor screening studies suggest that it remains a challenge to effectively inhibit halite precipitation at an elevated halite si synergistic effect in halite precipitation control was reported by applying both fcn and a carboxylate sulfonate polymeric inhibitor at an elevated halite si condition the recommendation from this study is that method one is more suitable for scenarios with a lower target halite si with a lower accuracy demand method two is more applicable for scenarios with a higher target halite si and or a higher accuracy demand this study can facilitate assessment of halite scale threat and identification of appropriate halite inhibitors this can result in a considerable reduction in freshwater demand and the amount of produced water to be generated afterwards the significance of this achievement is not only in operational cost saving but also in water resource preservation and water sustainability

technology corresponding author sodium chloride halite scale precipitation has become a serious operational threat to many industries although water dilution is the primary halite treatment method water availability and water quality can be a significant challenge chemical inhibition as an alternative management approach can supplement water dilution providing the needed halite scaling control the most commonly adopted experimental methods to assess halite threat and to evaluate halite inhibitor performance are the static jar test methods however there are limited studies to systematically evaluate the accuracy and quality of these jar test based methods in this study temperature driven jar test method one and brine mixing associated jar test method two methods were adopted for evaluation these two methods were compared in terms of method accuracy and quality to assess halite threat it shows that method one is more applicable for halite scaling studies with a lower target saturation level method two is more suitable for scenarios with a higher saturation level and or demanding a greater accuracy the study can be very beneficial to halite scale management and halite scale inhibitor selection this can result in a considerable reduction in freshwater demand and the amount of produced water to be generated afterwards the significance of this achievement is not only

electron microscopy ssp scalesoftpitzer keywords halite mineral scale scale inhibitor jar test water preservation 1 introduction sodium chloride halite salt is perhaps the most ubiquitous mineral in nature seawater typically contains 3 nacl where in formation brine the nacl content can be anywhere from 5 and up to nacl solubility of over 20 1 different from many carbonate and sulfate based minerals halite has an exceedingly higher solubility in water therefore halite has long been regarded as an unconventional or exotic mineral scale in industry especially in petroleum industry that suffers profoundly from scale associated threats and financial loss 2 3 mineral scale is the crystalline inorganic solid precipitated from the aqueous phase 4 9 the most commonly observed scales in industry are carbonates and sulfates whenever there is a change in production system condition and or a fluid mixing event these common scales have the potential to precipitate and deposit onto the surface of production systems 10 11 scales can form inside reservoir pipelines and processing facilities resulting in a significant operational risk and deferred productions 11 12 halite scaling issue is a major concern in offshore and shale productions in the past two decades 3 13 due to geologic reasons the reservoir water in shale field typically contains a very high content of nacl during the shale production process enormous water evaporation can take place as a result of hydraulic fracturing treatment 13 14 another factor contributing to halite supersaturation is the decrease of production system temperature from reservoir to surface these two factors can result in halite supersaturation in the produced brine water and subsequent precipitation of halite solids since halite has a high water solubility a slight supersaturation can produce a massive amount of halite solid precipitates deposited halite solid can significantly reduce production tubing throughput and in extreme cases can completely block the production tubing 3 in addition halite deposition can take place in the reservoir pore space leading to formation damage 15 the primary treatment method for halite scale is water dilution wherein a large volume of fresh water or water with a low salinity is injected into the production system at the location upstream of halite damage as elaborated in the previous studies obtaining a large amount of low salinity water can be challenging due to water availability regulations or logistical issues 16 each extra barrel of fresh water injected along with the produced water has to be treated at some places this treatment can cost dollars per barrel of produced brine 17 another challenge associated water dilution is the formation of carbonate and sulfate mineral scales during commingling of formation water with injection water thus a considerable effort is normally required to pre treat the source water to remove ionic species before water injection which can be costly and time consuming an alternative halite control strategy relies on chemical inhibition chemical inhibitors are a group of specialty chemicals designed to kinetically postpone scale formation so that scale particles will not deposit inside the reservoir or on the surface of critical production facilities 4 9 the functioning mechanisms of scale inhibitors can include cation sequestration nucleation inhibition crystal distortion or threshold inhibition 17 compared with the inhibitors commonly adopted to control carbonate and sulfate scales halite inhibitors are typically applied at a much higher dose rate a key aspect in halite scale study is to experimentally determine halite precipitation induction time and to evaluate inhibitory effectiveness of halite inhibitors nucleation theory states that an energy barrier needs to be overcome so that the initial crystals can form larger settable particles via particle aggregation 18 induction time t0 is the time duration from the time point when supersaturation is achieved to the time point when scale formation can be detected visually or instrumentally 19 due to its functionality scale inhibitor can prolong t0 by delaying scale formation kinetics the extent of t0 extension is sizable depending on supersaturation inhibitor type and dosage currently there are several reported experimental methods to measure halite scale t0 in the absence and presence of inhibitors the most commonly adopted approach is the temperature driven jar test method 20 in this method a nacl solution inside a static jar is heated to form an undersaturated brine solution at a higher temperature this brine solution will be subsequently cooled to the target temperature during the cooling process the tested brine will become supersaturated with respect to halite and halite deposition will take place inhibitor effectiveness can be quantified by measuring t0 in the presence of inhibitors of different types and concentrations this method is fast and easy to carry out ideal for field testing however the drawback of this method is that only a small saturation level can be established by this method limited by brine boiling point and nacl solubility moreover due to the coupled effect of temperature and time it is technically difficult to identify accurately the onset of t0 a modified version of the temperature driven method is to achieve superstation by evaporating water from saturated nacl brine however this method also suffers from a limited saturation level another method to evaluate halite scale is brine mixing associated jar test method 21 this method involves mixing a saturated or nearly saturated nacl brine with another highly concentrated chloride brine such as cacl2 or mgcl2 in a static jar upon mixing these two brines the mixture brine will become supersaturated with nacl the advantage of this method over the previous one is that a much higher supersaturation level can be obtained via brine mixing additionally the brine mixing method eliminates the impact of coupled effect of temperature and time another important aspect in halite scaling study is to predict halite scale precipitation via computational modeling scale threat can be evaluated quantitatively by calculating the saturation ratio sr or saturation index si of the mineral scale of concern 2 s i t p lo g 10 s r t p lo g 10 iap k sp lo g 10 a n a a c l k sp where srt p and sit p are defined as the saturation ratio and saturation index respectively at a given pressure and temperature iap denotes ion activity product a na and a cl represent the activities of sodium and chloride ions respectively ksp is the solubility product of mineral solid at the given condition the brine solution is regarded as supersaturated with nacl if the calculated halite sr is larger than 1 or si higher than zero thermodynamically sr or si is the driving force for scale nucleus formation and subsequent scale solid precipitation one of the most challenging tasks in computing halite si is to correctly calculate the activity coefficients of na and cl species in complicated brines versus t and p the challenge associated with computing na and cl activities is exacerbated by the high aqueous solubility of nacl the impact of other divalent species and the temperature impact on nacl solubility therefore a robust computational model is required to accurately handle the complex calculations involved in halite scale predictions the most widely adopted approach in understanding the ionic species behavior in brine solution is the pitzer theory 22 pitzer equations can accurately calculate the impact of various physiochemical factors such as brine compositions pressure and temperature on ion activity coefficient in saline environment in this study the two commonly adopted jar test based methods have been experimentally evaluated in a careful and systematic manner the selected jar test methods are temperature driven method and brine mixing method jar test methods are chosen in this study in that these methods are both fast and easy to carry out ideal for assessing field halite threat and inhibitor effectiveness the focus of this study is to examine the accuracy and quality of each method the impact of divalent ion on method accuracy has been discussed surface characterization was carried out to evaluate the morphologies of the formed halite scale particles furthermore both methods were adopted to evaluate inhibitory effectiveness of halite inhibitors of different concentrations and compositions t0 in the absence and presence of halite inhibitors was determined experimentally from a computational standpoint halite si and brine chemistry were calculated using scalesoftpitzer software version ssp22020 hereinafter abbreviated as ssp a software package based upon pitzer theory 23 24 experimentally obtained halite precipitation results were compared against the software predictions this study systematically evaluates the accuracy of the two common jar test methods the objective is to correctly and accurately evaluate halite scale threat and to identify the most appropriate halite inhibitor with a simple experimental setup in a rapid and accurate manner correct understanding of halite threat can significantly facilitate halite scale management and eliminate the severe consequence of halite blockage selection of a proper halite inhibitor can result in a considerable reduction in freshwater demand and the amount of produced water to be generated afterwards the significance of this achievement is not only in operational cost saving but also in water resource preservation and water sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium

method one temperature driven jar test method similar to a previously reported study 3 in this method brine solution supersaturation with respect to nacl is achieved by gradually cooling a pre heated solution from 95 c to a lower temperature when the system temperature is 95 c the tested brine solution is undersaturated with respect to halite si 0 reduction in system temperature will result in solution supersaturation due to reduction in nacl solubility to begin with at an ambient condition 1 atm and 25 c nacl solid with a mass of 6 422 g and a volume of di water together with a teflon coated magnetic stir bar were added into a 20 ml glass vial to prepare an inhibitor free nacl solution brine 1a in another experiment 6 422 g nacl solid di water and a volume of inhibitor aqueous solution were all added into another 20 ml glass vial to prepare a nacl inhibitor mixture solution brine 1b in both experiments the concentration of nacl in the mixture solution is set at 6 32 m molality in both cases the total amount of water is 17 398 g including water from di water and water from inhibitor solution next a 5 00 m nacl solution without inhibitor brine 1c was prepared in a 20 ml glass vial at an ambient condition the glass vial containing brine 1c was involved in this study to measure solution temperature fig 1 a the temperature of brine 1a and 1b is assumed to be the same as brine 1c during the course of the experiment subsequently the glass vials containing brine 1a 1b and 1c were placed into an oil bath with the system temperature carefully monitored and controlled these three glass vials were heated to 95 c with constant stirring to dissolve nacl solid after statically heating the vials in an oil bath at 95 c for 20 min all three vials were subsequently transferred to another oil bath with an identical setup at a lower temperature of either 37 c or 50 c fig 1b during the brine solution cooling process halite formation kinetics together with solution temperature profile were simultaneously monitored t0 herein is defined as the time duration from the onset of solution cooling to the time when solid precipitates can be visually observed in brine 1a or 1b 2 3 method two brine mixing jar test method in this method halite supersaturation was achieved by mixing a saturated halite solution a salt solution with a high chloride concentration and a halite inhibitor solution without brine solution cooling as illustrated in fig 2 the experimental setup includes a water bath to maintain the system temperature between 25 c and 90 c a stainless steel coil tubing and a stainless steel column packed with pure nacl solid together with two glass tubes were inter connected and placed inside the water bath one glass tube was used as a waste tube and the other one as the testing tube for running experiments brine solution was loaded from a glass bottle into the coil tubing by a peristaltic pump biotech p 500 pharmacia a gastight syringe was employed to inject solution into the testing tube submerged inside the water bath to begin the temperature of the water bath was set to the target temperature to maintain a fixed temperature for all the apparatus inside the water bath next an inhibitor free 6 11 m nacl solution brine 2a was prepared in a glass bottle and loaded into the pre heated coil tubing followed by the nacl column the nacl column was employed to subject the flowing brine solution saturated with nacl at the set temperature the first 15 ml brine coming out from the nacl column was discarded into the waste tube subsequently 20 ml of saturated nacl solution was delivered into the testing tube a 3 way valve was employed to switch the flow path of the the effluent solution from nacl column between the waste tube and the test tube the testing tube contains a teflon coated stir bar and a known volume of an inhibitor brine solution inside the gastight syringe is a highly concentrated chloride salt solution with a composition of 6 70 m cacl2 i e 13 4 m cl brine 2b upon completion of brine 2a loading into the testing tube a volume of brine 2b was gradually injected into the testing tube under constant stirring to achieve halite supersaturation in method two brine mixing associated halite solid precipitation was detected by a green laser of 532 nm similar to previous halite studies 25 26 the detection method of scale precipitate using green laser is detailed in section s1 of the electronic supporting data esd t0 is defined as the time duration from the completion of brine 2b injection to time point when the measured laser signal starts to reduce due to halite formation the compositions of the synthetic brines adopted in this study are listed in section s2 of the esd 2 4 halite inhibitor screening studies both methods were adopted to evaluate halite inhibition effectiveness of two polymeric halite inhibitors furthermore method two was utilized to screen the effectiveness of various inhibitors in a rapid manner in these studies the concentrations of scale inhibitors are reported as the product concentrations as for fcn the reported concentration is the active fcn concentration 2 5 analytical methods concentrations of cationic species were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 4300 perkin elmer details of icp oes measurement is shown in section s3 of the esd solid surface morphologies were characterized by scanning electronic microscopy sem fei quanta 400 hillsboro oregon the sem instrument was equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edxs for elemental analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature driven jar test method method one the experimental details of each figure from fig 3 to fig 6 are summarized in section s4 of the esd laboratory investigations was carried out following method one approach to understand the accuracy and quality of this commonly adopted method in addition due to its simplicity method one was utilized to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of the selected software package for halite scale predictions note that the unit of nacl salt aqueous concentration in this study is molality which is mole of nacl per kilogram of water molality is the unit of ionic species adopted in thermodynamic calculations 23 according to method one the test brine solutions were cooled by oil bathing from 95 c to either 37 c or 50 c as shown in fig 3a it took 30 min to cool down the test solutions from ca 77 c to reach 37 c correspondingly the calculated halite si increased from 0 028 undersaturated to 0 025 supersaturated si value reached zero saturation at 55 3 c in the blank test using brine 1a halite scale formed at approximately 4 5 min and 56 7 c corresponding to a calculated halite si of 0 002 the fact that the difference between the calculated halite si of 0 002 and the true si at saturation i e zero is exceedingly small suggests that ssp software is capable of handling the brine chemistry calculations involving a significant nacl content more than 6 m the measured si difference of 0 002 can be attributed to the inaccuracy of the temperature measurement since temperature was indirectly measured in this method therefore it can be confirmed that ssp software is suitable to perform brine chemistry and si calculations involved in halite precipitation subsequently method one was utilized to evaluate halite inhibitors using oil bath at 37 c two polymer based halite inhibitors poly 1 and poly 2 were tested for their halite scale controlling effectiveness from 1 to 1000 mg l 1 table 1 shows that both polymeric inhibitors demonstrate similar halite inhibition effectiveness for instance poly 1 inhibitor at 100 mg l 1 can extend the t0 to 16 5 min when the temperature was ca 40 2 c corresponding to a halite si of ca 0 021 poly 1 inhibitor at the same dose can extend t0 to about 15 min for both inhibitors the increase in inhibitor concentration leads to an increase in t0 this suggests that this method is able to evaluate inhibitor effectiveness as for 50 c experiments fig 3b it took about 40 min to cool down the test solutions from ca 80 c to 50 c correspondingly the calculated halite si increased from 0 03 undersaturated to 0 008 supersaturated si value reached zero at 55 2 c in the blank test halite scale formed at ca 16 min and 52 2 c which corresponds to a calculated halite si of 0 004 again the calculated si based on experimental observation is very close to the true saturation si indicative of the reconciliation between modeling calculation and experimental observation compared with the 37 c experiment both the temperature reduction rate and halite si increase rate become slower suggesting halite formation kinetics will be reduced as well as presented in table 1 at 50 c condition poly 1 and poly 2 inhibitors show a similar halite inhibition effectiveness by extending t0 from 16 min in the blank test to over 50 min method one adopts a temperature driven approach to generate halite precipitation this method can study halite formation kinetics and screen different halite inhibitors with a simple experimental setup in a straightforward manner thus this method is the most commonly adopted approach in laboratory studies on halite scale however this method has obvious limitations firstly this method can only establish a relatively small halite si value which is limited by brine boiling point and nacl solubility secondly both system temperature and corresponding halite si values are constantly changing during cooling making it difficult to accurately identify the onset of the induction time 3 2 brine mixing associated precipitation test method in view of the drawbacks of method one method two was adopted to address the limitations of the temperature driven method as shown in fig 2 halite supersaturation in the testing tube solution was generated by adding brine 2b into the testing tube brine 2b contains a high concentration of cacl2 previous studies suggest that the presence of divalent cations can considerably impact the effectiveness of halite scale inhibitors 3 27 the quality of method two has been examined by a number of halite scale precipitation experiments at different conditions as shown in fig 4 a four sets of halite precipitation experiments were conducted following the approach of method two at varying aqueous calcium concentration or ca2 from 0 to 1 1 m at an ambient temperature of 25 c letter s and n stand for the testing results of scale formation and no scale formation respectively method two adopts a green laser detector to identify the onset of halite precipitation which enhances the experimental accuracy compared with visual observation the reported halite si values were calculated based upon brine chemistry data fig 4a shows that halite precipitation experimental results match well with the model calculation prediction experimental results indicate that halite scale formed when the calculated halite si is slightly above zero and no halite precipitation occurred when si is slightly below zero the experimental error with respect to halite formation is within 0 0005 si unit when ca2 is lower than 0 8 m in other words when ca2 0 8 m if si is above 0 0005 the experimental result is always s and if si is lower than 0 0005 the experimental result is always n satisfactory experimental and modeling results can be obtained even when ca2 is up to 1 05 m ca 37 000 mg l 1 when ca2 is 1 05 m halite formation experimental error is within 0 0008 si unit as discussed above the accuracy of method one is ca 0 002 si for the 37 c experiment and 0 004 si for the 50 c experiment in the absence of ca2 species for both cases a comparison of results following method one and method two indicates that method two is more accurate than the temperature driven based method one with a considerably reduced experimental error the key differences between method two and method one are the experimental approaches in achieving halite supersaturation and scale precipitation detection method furthermore by comparing experimental results following method two with brine chemistry calculations ssp can accurately predict halite solubility and scaling risks to the accuracy of within 0 0005 to 0 0008 si unit with up to 1 m ca2 from an analytical standpoint si uncertainty caused by method two approach is lower than that introduced by operational error in analyzing field brine compositions detailed calculation shown in section s5 of the esd similar to the halite scaling study at 25 c precipitation experiments were conducted at higher temperatures of 50 70 and 90 c following method two approach fig 4b presents the si values when no halite precipitation could be observed by the green laser at different experimental scenarios the corresponding sr values were also given fig 4b suggest that both ca2 and temperature can impact halite deposition and experimental accuracy of method two and ca2 seems to be more influential than temperature generally at a lower ca2 of ca 0 12 m method two accuracy can be as high as 0 002 si at 70 c and 90 c method two accuracy is within 0 005 si when ca2 is between 0 5 m and 1 0 m obviously the increase in ca2 can impact halite scaling calculations compromising the method accuracy especially at a very high ca2 of beyond 1 m this can be attributed to the impact of ca2 species on the ionic activity coefficient 22 24 subsequent to the precipitation experiments the formed halite scale solid was extracted from the aqueous solution for instrumental analysis on morphology and crystal composition fig 4c shows that in the presence of ca2 of 0 82 m and halite si of 0 005 at 25 c the formed halite scale is of cubic crystal morphology which is characteristic of halite mineral in addition edxs study indicates that there was no ca element detected in the halite solid precipitate fig 4d these instrumental analyses suggests that brine mixing associated halite precipitation is generally a result of homogeneous nucleation process although there were sufficient foreign species ca2 in this case no ca2 was involved into the crystal structure of nacl nuclei 28 3 3 screening of halite scale inhibitors by adopting method two method two was adopted to evaluate the halite inhibition effectiveness of a number of polymer based halite inhibitors together with fcn the functional groups of these polymeric inhibitors include phosphonate acrylate aspartate sulfonate etc as shown in table 2 fcn was included in the tested inhibitor list since fcn is a commonly used halite inhibitor 17 moreover it is a common practice in halite inhibitor evaluation to compare the performance of the tested inhibitors against that of fcn 3 29 in order to expedite the halite precipitation process laboratory testing of these halite inhibitors were conducted at a mildly supersaturated experimental condition with a halite si of 0 006 at 25 c it can be calculated that the amount of nacl salt that would be precipitated out of the brine solution is ca 2183 mg l 1 which is equivalent to approximately 76 pound solid per 100 barrel of produced water the concentration of tested polymeric inhibitors is set at 100 mg l 1 as product concentration and the concentration of fcn is 20 mg l 1 as the active species concentration table 3 presents the experimentally measured t0 in the presence and absence of halite inhibitors in the absence of inhibitors t0 for the blank test is determined to be only 1 7 min the presence of halite inhibitor can extend t0 to a sizable duration depending on the types of inhibitors particularly the five carboxylate sulfonate copolymer inhibitors i e cs 1 to cs 5 demonstrated the best inhibition effectiveness among all polymeric inhibitors tested by extending t0 to as long as over 1000 min in addition fcn also shows a very desirable inhibition effectiveness at the testing condition clearly the developed method two is capable of screening different types of halite inhibitors in a convenient and rapid manner after identifying the top performers among all tested polymeric inhibitors these five carboxylate sulfonate copolymer inhibitors cs 1 to cs 5 were selected for further evaluation at harsher experimental conditions with a higher si value a higher ca2 and an elevated temperature as shown in fig 5 a halite precipitation can be inhibited for over 80 000 s in the presence of 100 mg l 1 cs 5 inhibitor at a halite si of 0 006 and 25 c the constant straight line of laser signal intensity in fig 5a suggests of no halite precipitation however when the system temperature was increased to 70 c with a higher halite si of 0 014 fig 5b halite scale started to precipitate as early as 2000 s 33 min although the inhibitor concentration has been considerably increased to 1700 mg l 1 this result indicates that cs 5 inhibitor one of the best polymeric inhibitors tested according to table 3 is less effective in inhibiting halite scale at the testing experimental condition method two is able to evaluate inhibitor performance at different experimental conditions as for the other four cs inhibitors laboratory evaluation following method two suggests that they cannot inhibit halite scale at the harsher experimental condition furthermore these four cs inhibitors appeared to form metal scale precipitate possibly due to ca2 incompatibility therefore it is necessary to synthesize novel halite inhibitors to control halite scale at elevated si conditions to cope with the operational needs 3 4 evaluation of synergistic effect in halite inhibition using method two in field operations it is not uncommon to adopt the approach of applying multiple inhibitors to take advantage of inhibitory synergistic effect the synergistic effect of scale inhibitors refers to the phenomenon that a combination of different inhibitors may demonstrate an improved inhibitory performance compared to an individual inhibitor 17 in a recent study it was reported that a synergy of inhibiting halite scale can be observed by applying fcn inhibitor in the presence of pb2 3 with the hydrocarbon productions into deeper reservoir and or harsher environment such as shale operations the experienced halite si values and divalent metal concentrations can be considerably greater than those in the aforementioned experimental conditions other than system temperature reduction significant water evaporation can markedly exacerbate halite formation and subsequent precipitation for example it has been reported that over 20 of water samples from a number of production wells in the bakken field are calculated with halite si values up to 0 2 and one sample with a halite si of over 0 4 16 to combat halite scaling problems with elevated halite si values in this study efforts have been made to investigate the synergistic inhibition effect by applying multiple scale inhibitors simultaneously at an elevated halite si the synergistic effect of applying multiple scale inhibitors have been reported and discussed in the previous studies 27 30 such synergistic effect is believed due to the interactions among the added inhibitors and the incumbent chemicals after adding another scale inhibitor s these inhibitors in the aqueous phase can form an inhibitor complex another reason for the synergistic effect of combining multiple scale inhibitors is the modification of chemical structure of inhibitors 3 17 in this study method two was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined halite inhibitors as elaborated before method one can only establish a relatively small halite si value in this study synergetic inhibition effect was evaluated at a halite si of 0 09 sr 1 23 with a brine composition of 0 6 m ca2 353 800 mg l 1 tds at an experimental temperature of 70 c although fcn is a common halite inhibitor there are limited studies on the synergistic effect of fcn and other inhibitors particularly polymeric halite inhibitors since cs 5 inhibitor demonstrated a desirable performance when tested individually table 3 synergistic inhibition effect was evaluated by combining fcn and cs 5 inhibitor as shown in fig 6 a halite scale precipitation took place immediately after the onset of the experiment in the absence of halite inhibitor this is evidenced by the rapid decline of the measured laser intensity for the blank test as for the results of testing fcn 20 mg l 1 or cs 5 inhibitor 130 mg l 1 individually it shows that halite scale precipitation still occurred shortly after the onset of the experiment evidenced by the reduction of the laser light intensity however compared with the blank test result both inhibitors showed obvious inhibitory effect especially within the first 2000 s comparatively speaking fcn 20 mg l 1 demonstrated an enhanced inhibition effect relative to cs 5 130 mg l 1 at the time point of 1000 s the light intensity was higher for the test with fcn considering the fcn concentration was only 15 of cs 5 concentration this suggests that fcn might be a more effective halite inhibitor than the polymer based cs 5 at the testing condition moreover it should be noted that the cs 5 inhibitor concentration shown in fig 5b was more than ten times higher than that in fig 6a and halite si in fig 5b si 0 14 was much lower than that in fig 6a si 0 09 thus halite precipitation was effectively inhibited with a relatively unchanged laser intensity for the first 2000 s in fig 5b a clear synergistic effect can be evidenced in fig 6a when fcn of 20 mg l 1 and cs 5 of 130 mg l 1 were both present at the testing condition it shows that the measured laser intensity level stayed relatively stable for a period of over 8000 s such a synergistic effect can also be evidenced by visual observation of the laser light scattering in the testing tube due to the tyndall effect incoming laser light can be scattered by the formed colloidal scale particles little or no scale formation can allow the laser light passing through the aqueous solution with insignificant light scattering as shown in fig 6b only the condition of applying both inhibitors can result in a minimum light scattering strong light scattering can be observed in the other three scenarios especially for the blank test further studies are required to obtain mechanistic understanding of the synergistic effect of fcn with carboxylate sulfonate polymeric inhibitors in halite inhibition based on the aforementioned discussions on evaluating both method one and method two to assess halite scale threat and halite inhibitor performance it is thus suggested that method one is the preferred approach when the target halite si is low lower than 0 02 si unit and an accuracy of 0 002 si is accepted it is suggested to adopt method two if the target halite si is high higher than 0 02 si unit and or a high accuracy of 0 0005 si is required as a future work the laboratory halite inhibitor performance testing results from this study will be compared against halite inhibitor field trial results to evaluate the applicability of the laboratory methods for field halite control in practical applications 4 conclusions in this study both temperature driven jar test method method one and brine mixing associated jar test method method two were experimentally evaluated for their accuracy and quality in assessing halite threat and halite inhibitor performance although method one can evaluate halite scale threat with a simple setup and the accuracy of this method is reasonably well 0 002 si this method can only establish a relatively small halite si value lower than 0 02 si and it is difficult to measure induction time accurately due to coupled effect of temperature and time method two can overcome these limitations since halite supersaturation is not driven by temperature reduction method two can accommodate a wider range of halite si with a higher accuracy 0 0005 si the software package of ssp is proven to be able to satisfactorily handle the complicated halite related brine chemistry calculations at various experimental conditions additional experimental observations suggest that solution calcium concentration can have a considerable impact on halite precipitation and the accuracy of this method laboratory inhibitor screening studies suggest that it remains a challenge to effectively inhibit halite precipitation at an elevated halite si synergistic effect in halite precipitation control was reported by applying both fcn and a carboxylate sulfonate polymeric inhibitor at an elevated halite si condition the recommendation from this study is that method one is more suitable for scenarios with a lower target halite si with a lower accuracy demand method two is more applicable for scenarios with a higher target halite si and or a higher accuracy demand this study can facilitate assessment of halite scale threat and identification of appropriate halite inhibitors this can result in a considerable reduction in freshwater demand and the amount of produced water to be generated afterwards the significance of this achievement is not only in operational cost saving but also in water resource preservation and water sustainability

13359,for comprehensive insights into the effects of disinfection strategy on antibiotic resistance genes args in pipe wall biofilm to ensure the biosafety of domestic hot water system dhws this study investigated the occurrence removal and interactions of args as well as their potential hosts the shifts in biofilm community composition and microbial functions level three were observed under different disinfection strategies a total of 40 arg subtypes within seven antibiotic types were predicted the total gene counts ranged from 6 10 104 to 2 31 105 and decreased after the chlorine chlorine dioxide silver ions ag ultraviolet uv and ag uv disinfection the args in samples under different disinfection strategies were divided into four groups and the removal and enrichment of the same args in each group were almost consistent the complex interactions among args were weakened and altered by disinfection edges decreased from 237 to 178 with yebq and marc as the hub args but positive correlations were still dominant moreover 36 nonpathogenic bacteria including high blastocatella mid ornatilinea and low abundant genera bdellovibrio as well as 18 potential pathogens vibrio and bacillus were identified as the potential hosts harboring args overall this study provides some new insights into the occurrence of args and their fate under eight disinfection strategies which is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding and control of args in dhws graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords domestic hot water system disinfection antibiotic resistance genes removal and enrichment potential hosts 1 introduction the emergence dissemination and accumulation of antibiotic resistant genes args in environment due to the overuse or misuse antibiotics have become a global major issue 1 2 as emerging genotype pollutants args may potentially cause serious public health problems and have raised an increasing attention 3 args can spread antibiotic resistance in microbial communities through horizontal gene transfer hgt particularly in phases that have high bacterial cell density such as biofilm 4 biofilm is ubiquitous in aquatic environments with complex microbial communities capable of performing multiple functions it may act as a sink for args 5 and the args in biofilm have been widely investigated in various media and environments such as microplastic 6 activated sludge 7 freshwater 8 and even drinking water distribution system dwds 9 generally domestic hot water system dhws utilized drinking water as influent with the characteristics of long hydraulic retention time and low disinfectant residue which provide favorable conditions for the formation of pipe wall biofilm however to the best of our knowledge there are few studies reported the occurrence of args in pipe wall biofilm of dhws moreover existing studies mainly focused on several major args of specific antibiotics using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr 7 10 11 lacking a holistic recognition of the args in different habitats relatively speaking functional prediction can provide a more comprehensive analysis of args which is helpful for us to fully understand their occurrence in dhws this method has also been used in previous studies and confirmed to have good consistency with the results of metagenomic sequencing 12 14 disinfection is an effective way to inactivate bacteria and control biofilm contamination which may affect the removal and enrichment of args in recent years increasing studies have documented the effects of disinfection strategies on args such as chlorine chlorine dioxide ultraviolet uv and their combinations chlorine as a widely used disinfectant has been reported to elevate the total relative abundance of args in opportunistic bacteria 15 while other study showed that chlorination is a promising approach to effectively remove the args in wastewater 16 uv disinfection could increase the total arg abundances 17 and a larger dose of uv was required to damage args than to inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 18 19 combining uv irradiation with advanced oxidative processes such as uv chlorine uv hydrogen peroxide and uv ozone may enhance the removal of args 20 21 notably the above mentioned studies are all aimed at args in aquatic environment to date the fates of args in biofilm after disinfection are largely unknown especially in dhws and how the disinfection strategies affect the correlations of args is still poorly understood therefore it is necessary to perform systematic research that unravels the comprehensive profile of args under multiple disinfection strategies the sensitivity of microbes to disinfectants varies greatly leading to remarkable shift of community structure which was considered to be the key factor driving the changes of arg profiles 22 it has been proved that the increase of chlorine resistant bacteria led to the enrichment of args such as pseudomonas and acidovorax 23 and the study of su et al also obtained similar results 24 suggesting that there was a close association between the pseudomonas and dissemination of args biofilm microbial community was an aggregation of a large number of species including both potential pathogens and nonpathogenic bacteria many studies reported that potential pathogens can easily capture args to form superbugs 25 26 while it was not clear whether the nonpathogenic bacteria could become the potential hosts of args especially for low abundant taxa that were usually overlooked in research network analysis is a common method to explore the associations among entities 27 28 the co occurrence pattern between args and bacteria was helpful to speculate the potential host of args 29 and had been widely applied in many environments 29 30 which is also applicable to dhws in the present study the args in biofilm of dhws were comprehensively predicted and the fate of args under eight disinfection strategies were systematically investigated the main objectives were to 1 reveal the shifts in biofilm community and microbial function among different samples 2 investigate the occurrence of args in pipe wall biofilm 3 explore the removal and enrichment of args under eight disinfection strategies 4 elucidate the alteration of interactions among args before and after disinfection 5 identify the potential hosts of args based on the above results the research significance of this study and future scope were elaborated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design in the present study biofilm annular reactor bar was applied as the model pipeline of dhws and a total of eight bars were set up in parallel for biofilm cultivation the heated laboratory tap water 45 c was used as the influent of bars and the main water quality parameters are list in table s1 there were 18 coupons made of polypropylene random ppr in each bar and all reactors were operated continuously for three months to make the coupons form stable biofilm 31 32 then 12 coupons were taken out from each of the eight bars and put into the corresponding eight beakers for the biofilm static disinfection experiment the detailed parameters of eight disinfection strategies including chlorine cl2 chlorine dioxide clo2 silver ions ag thermal shock ts uv cl2 uv ag ts and ag uv are shown in table 1 which were determined based on previous publications 33 34 and standards for drinking water quality 35 during the disinfection process in addition to ts and ag ts 60 c the water temperature of other disinfection strategies was kept at 45 c the disinfection time was 150 min which was sufficient for the inactivation efficiency of total bacteria escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria in biofilm to reach a steady state 36 2 2 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing in this study 16 coupons two coupons for each bar were taken from bars as control samples before the experiment and two coupons were collected for each disinfection strategy as disinfected samples after the experiment the biofilm on each coupon was scraped by cotton swabs and prepared a bacterial suspension by ultrasonication and homogenization then the parallel biofilm suspensions were mixed and the same volume was taken out for each treatment method and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane millipore usa in total triplicate control samples and eight disinfected samples namely cl2 clo2 ag ts uv cl2 uv ag ts and ag uv were applied for dna extraction the quality and purity of the extracted dna were assessed by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis and dna detection kit qubit3 0 bioresearch china respectively high throughput sequencing was used to explore the composition of biofilm bacterial communities the 341f and 805r primers were used to amplify the v3 v4 regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene 37 then the sequencing of purified pcr products was performed on the illumina miseq sequencing platform at sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china after removing the barcodes primers short sequences singletons and chimera the effective sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by setting a 3 distance limit and the taxonomic classification for each otu sequence was conducted using silva database http www arb silva de referring to previous literatures 38 39 the biofilm bacterial communities were divided into three categories at the genus level in terms of relative abundance including high abundant taxa hat 1 mid abundant taxa mat 0 1 1 and low abundant taxa lat 0 1 the potential pathogenic bacteria were selected based on the virulence factor database vfdb http www mgc ac cn vfs for further analysis 2 3 microbial functions and args analysis phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the microbial functions and args of biofilm 40 a table of functional gene counts known as kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos could be obtained from the output of picrust and the args were selected by comparison with kos published in a previous literature 12 to investigate the shifts of args under eight disinfection strategies ko numbers summarized in the table 12 covered genes confer resistance to eight classes of antibiotics including aminoglycoside beta lactam fca fluoroquinolone quinolone florfenicol chloramphenicol and amphenicol mlsb macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b sulfa tetracycline vancomycin and other efflux in total seven classes of args were predicted in the present study except for sulfa args and the gene counts corresponding to kos could be regarded as the abundance of args moreover the weighted nearest sequenced taxon index nsti scores were calculated to assess the accuracy of the prediction principal component analysis pca combined with permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was utilized to investigate the differences of microbial functions and args among different samples heatmap was created to visualize the distribution of args from the perspective of gene abundance the fold changes of args relative abundance before and after disinfection were calculated to reveal their removal and enrichment 2 4 network analysis network analysis was applied to investigate the interactions among args and explore the potential hosts of args three control samples and eight disinfected samples were used to construct the arg network before and after disinfection the bacteria hosts were classified into two categories nonpathogenic genera including high mid and low abundant taxa and potential pathogens the correlation matrix was constructed by calculating the spearman s rank correlation coefficients srccs using ibm spss statistics 25 if the srcc 0 6 or 0 6 and p values 0 05 the correlation between two items was considered to be statistically significant and cytoscape version 3 6 0 was used to visualize all the robust correlations moreover the unique node level topological feature of degree was calculated in the network the size of each node was proportional to the degree the connection numbers of each arg with others solid and dash lines represented positive and negative correlations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 shifts in biofilm microbial community composition in the present study 78 class 115 order and 267 family were identified among the nine biofilm samples and the top 10 of them are shown in fig 1 at the class level bacilli belonging to firmicutes was the dominant class accounting for 1 53 47 54 of total sequences in each sample and its relative abundance increased obviously after uv cl2 uv and ag uv disinfection indicating that most species of bacilli were resistant to uv this phenomenon may be explained by the thick cell wall and spore forming ability of firmicutes which enhance their resistance to harsh environmental conditions 41 alphaproteobacteria 2 74 37 47 gammaproteobacteria 2 68 33 64 betaproteobacteria 2 80 10 99 and deltaproteobacteria 0 14 6 42 were the four class belonging to proteobacteria reflecting the dominant position of proteobacteria in the microbial community 42 among them the proportion of alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria decreased after disinfection except for ts and ag ts whereas the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased slightly in all disinfected samples compared with control 6 23 the proportion of planctomycetia increased only after ag disinfection 16 48 deinococci a class of deinococcus thermus was highly resistant to thermal environments and was often detected in hot springs and dhws 43 44 its relative abundance decreased from 18 63 in control to 0 03 10 39 in all disinfected samples which suggested that the species of deinococci may be highly sensitive to disinfection acidobacteria gp4 0 03 9 68 spartobacteria 0 01 6 96 and sphingobacteriia 0 12 3 72 belong to acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and bacteroidetes respectively compared to the control their relative abundance decreased in most disinfected samples and only increased in a few samples such as acidobacteria gp4 in ag and uv spartobacteria and sphingobacteriia in ts at the order level the top 10 were composed of the primary or unique orders of the six dominant class for example bacillales 0 61 42 72 was the major order of bacilli rhizobiales 1 18 13 71 sphingomonadales 0 27 11 96 and rhodospirillales 0 10 6 57 were the three main orders of alphaproteobacteria while planctomycetales 0 14 16 48 and thermales 0 03 18 63 were the unique orders corresponding to the class of planctomycetia and deinococci respectively therefore their dynamics in relative abundance before and after disinfection were almost consistent with the class level at the family level in terms of relative abundance bacillaceae increased after uv and ag uv disinfection while bacillales incertae sedis xii increased after cl2 uv disinfection both of them belong to bacillales and together explained the raised proportion of bacillales in uv cl2 uv and ag uv samples planctomycetaceae thermaceae rhodocyclaceae and enterobacteriaceae were the only families belong to planctomycetales thermales rhodocyclales and enterobacteriales so they accounted for the same proportion with the corresponding orders sphingomonadaceae 0 25 11 95 and bradyrhizobiaceae 0 04 10 54 were important family of sphingomonadales and rhizobiales respectively and exhibited similar variation with them additionally the proportions of streptococcaceae 0 90 4 26 and gemmatimonadaceae 0 08 5 12 among samples were lower than 10 and increased slightly after uv and ag uv disinfection compared with control moreover the microbial community composition was further classified into three categories at the genus level the high mid and low abundant genera as well as potential pathogens are shown in tables s2 s5 and their responses to different disinfection methods had been analyzed in our previous study 36 these results demonstrated that the shifts in biofilm community composition among samples were different and thermales was sensitive to all the eight disinfection strategies applied in this study 3 2 microbial functions analysis picrust was used to infer the biofilm microbial potential functions in dhws as shown in fig 2a the weighted nsti of each sample ranged from 0 09 to 0 15 with an average of 0 12 lower than 0 17 indicating that the predicted results were accurate and could provide some important insights into the microbial functions 40 at the top level of pathway modules the predicted functions displayed similar distribution among samples fig s1 so their average proportions were shown in fig 2b metabolism was the predominant functional category accounting for 50 08 of total counts genetic information processing 16 75 and environmental information processing 13 01 were also the important functional categories as for cellular processes human diseases and organismal systems their proportions were all less than 4 the insignificant shifts in microbial function among samples may be attributed to the functional redundancy of the complex microbial community 45 additionally 14 80 of microbial functions were unclassified which suggested that there may be some new functions that need further investigation the similarity in microbial functions at subcategory level three was further assessed by pca pc1 and pc2 explained 57 83 and 28 30 of the variance in microbial functions among samples respectively fig 2c control ts and ag ts samples were clustered into group i indicating that although ts and ag ts disinfection changed the biofilm community composition they had limited impact on microbial functions in contrast other disinfection strategies altered the microbial function obviously ag uv ag uv and cl2 uv were clustered into group ii while cl2 and clo2 were in separate groups and located far from other samples it should be note that the dissimilarity of the four groups was not significant permanova p 0 05 moreover four functional subcategories related to antibiotic metabolism were identified including drug metabolism tetracycline biosynthesis biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics and beta lactam resistance fig 2d compared with control most disinfection methods cl2 clo2 ag uv ag uv and cl2 uv impaired the functions mentioned above which was not conducive to the metabolism of antibiotics and the enhancement of beta lactam resistance but helps to reduce the biosynthesis of tetracycline and vancomycin while ts and ag ts disinfection slightly increased the counts of these functions in general the microbial functions at top level showed similar distributions among samples but their subcategories were obviously affected by different disinfection strategies 3 3 overview and distribution of args under eight disinfection strategies the gene counts of args varied in different samples fig 3a ranging from 6 10 104 to 2 31 105 indicating the influence of disinfection strategies on the abundance of args compared with the control most disinfection methods including cl2 clo2 ag uv and ag uv reduced the arg counts whereas ts cl2 uv and ag ts increased the total abundance of args as reported in our previous study the diversity of microbial community decreased after clo2 disinfection while increased after ts and ag ts disinfection 36 which is a possible reason for the difference in the effect of three disinfection methods on arg abundance cl2 and clo2 have strong oxidizing property and can inactivate a variety of genera in the biofilm community 36 among which may contain the potential hosts of args leading to the decrease of the arg counts on the contrary the elevated level of total arg abundances in drinking water was observed after chlorine disinfection 46 which suggested that the enrichment of chlorine resistant bacteria hosts and mobile genetic elements mges is an important reason for the increase in the total arg abundances after chlorination the conflict results may be interpreted by the different water quality original arg contamination level disinfectant concentration and detection method the predicted args in different samples potentially confer resistance to major classes of antibiotics mainly beta lactam 1 24 104 5 31 104 followed by mlsb 6 89 103 3 24 104 fca 7 17 103 3 19 104 tetracycline 1 33 103 5 42 103 vancomycin 1 21 103 2 74 103 and aminoglycoside 7 04 102 2 48 103 beta lactam was an antibiotic with important antibacterial activity by inhibiting the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls 47 and it was often detected in drinking water 48 which may explain the high abundance of beta lactam args in biofilm of dhws additionally there were 3 10 104 1 19 105 of args conferring resistance to the other antibiotics the richness of args was not obviously affected by disinfection which ranged from 36 to 40 in each sample fig s2a this phenomenon may be attributed to the partial but not complete removal of args by the disinfection strategies used in this study these args represented three major resistance mechanisms with similar proportion in different samples including efflux pump antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection and their average proportions were 56 09 27 84 and 16 07 respectively fig s2b efflux pump has also been reported as the most important resistance mechanism in activated sludge samples of wwtps 12 which supports our results to a certain extent moreover the differences of args in samples were investigated by pca as shown in fig 3b pc1 and pc2 explained 56 19 and 26 01 of the variance in args structure respectively the control and ag samples were grouped together i indicating that ag disinfection had little influence on the structure of args which may be due to the low concentration of ag 0 05 mg l used for disinfection uv and ag uv samples were clustered into the second group ii cl2 clo2 ts and ag ts were clustered into the third group iii while cl2 uv sample located far away from the others as the fourth group alone iv however the statistical difference between the groups was not significant permanova p 0 05 these results demonstrated that the structure of args was reshaped to a certain extent after disinfection which is likely to be driven by the change of bacterial community during disinfection 49 the distribution of args under eight disinfection strategies was investigated and a total of 40 arg subtypes were obtained in all samples fig 2 there were four arg subtypes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside with aacc2 aade and aada1 predominant in all samples while aacc1 was not abundant aminoglycoside as an antibiotic with high water solubility was broadly applied in animal husbandry in china 50 which provides selective pressure for the generation of aminoglycoside args for beta lactam args ampc was the most primary arg subtype in this study and it was also frequently detected in drinking water 51 the abundance of ampc decreased obviously after cl2 and clo2 disinfection suggesting its strong sensitivity to chlorination the abundance of pena and cfxa was almost equivalent while pbp2x had low gene count among the five arg subtypes for fca catb3 and emrb qaca were more abundant than the other arg subtypes yidy mdtl basr and qepa and the abundance of all fca args increased after cl2 uv disinfection the ermk mdta mefa and mphb were the main mlsb arg subtypes in all samples and other genes had relatively low abundance such as erea and ermb the teta tetg teth tetj and tetl tetk were the dominant arg subtypes conferring resistance to tetracycline tetracycline args were widely detected in various environmental media due to the universality of tetracycline application 52 only two arg subtypes for vancomycin were obtained and vanyb was more abundant than vrar in different samples for some other antibiotics 17 arg subtypes were detected and the abundance of marr putitive multidrug qach tc mate slc47a norm mdtk dinf bcr tcab and marc were obviously higher than other arg subtypes on the whole the abundance and structure of args in biofilms were affected by disinfection strategies while the dominant arg subtypes were similar in different samples 3 4 removal and enrichment of args under eight disinfection strategies the fold change values of arg subtypes were further calculated and visualized by heatmap to reveal the removal and enrichment of args under eight disinfection strategies as shown in fig 4 the clustering of different disinfection methods was consistent with the grouping results of pca fig 3b a previous research demonstrated that the args were not randomly distributed and they were likely to be shaped by the selective pressure of disinfectants and oligotrophic environment 23 in the present study the removal of emrb qaca ermk pena ampc mdta putitive multidrug and tc mate slc47a norm mdtk dinf 0 57 0 94 fold and the enrichment of aada1 pbp2x catb3 catb8 ycee mdtg mefa vanyb and ermb 1 42 10 39 fold were occurred after cl2 and clo2 disinfection chlorine with the concentration of 0 05 0 2 mg l was more likely to damage than inactivate bacterial cells 53 under suitable conditions the damaged cells could be repaired and recovered and serve as receptors for transferable args thus increasing the opportunity for the hgt of args between other bacterial cells 53 it was reported that the removal of args rose slowly when adding chlorine from 5 mg l to 20 mg l and increased dramatically from the dosage of 20 mg l to 25 mg l 54 a greater chlorine concentration was necessary to achieve higher removal efficiency for all the args 54 in this study the concentration used for cl2 disinfection was only 3 mg l which was not enough to remove all the args the enrichment of ermb after clo2 disinfection was also observed in the aqueous phase and this phenomenon was explained as multi drug efflux pump mediated co resistance and plasmid over replication 15 compared with the control aade erea tetl tetk yitg ymfd yfmo meci and norb norc were partially or completely removed 0 0 89 fold by cl2 clo2 ts and ag ts disinfection while qepa acrr yebq yidy mdtl basr marb and vrar were enriched 1 15 53 51 fold by them ag uv and ag uv also exhibited similar effects on the removal such as ermk cfxa bcr tcab and marc and enrichment such as aade erea ebra ebrb tetl tetk yitg ymfd yfmo and blt of most arg subtypes uv inactivates bacteria by interacting with dna without damaging the cellular envelope and the remarkably enhancement in relative abundances of many arg types after uv disinfection has also been reported in a previous study 10 supporting our results the variation of args in cl2 uv sample was different with other disinfection strategies which explained why cl2 uv as a separate group in fig 3b notably qach mphb and teta tetg teth tetj were removed in almost all the samples the abundances of args carried by various potential hosts varied drastically along with the potential host abundances 23 55 so a possible explanation for this phenomenon was that the potential hosts of these arg subtypes were sensitive to most disinfection methods overall disinfection strategies affected the removal and enrichment of args to a certain extent and each arg subtype responded differently to various disinfection methods 3 5 interactions between args after understanding the occurrence removal and enrichment of args how the interaction of args is still a question worth exploring therefore the correlation based network analysis was utilized to investigate the underlying interactions among args before and after disinfection for control samples fig 5a the args were divided into four groups and the nodes in each group had the same number of connections with others that is degree group i presented the most complicated interactions with 18 nodes and 156 edges in the network the network of group ii 10 nodes and 45 edges and iii 9 nodes and 33 edges were relatively simple while there were only three arg subtypes aacc1 ebra and ebrb in group iv the intricate interactions among args were helpful for them to resist environmental pressures so more attentions should be paid to the arg subtypes in group i in total 237 edges of significant and strong correlations were identified among 40 arg subtypes and 145 edges exhibited the positive correlations on the one hand many arg subtypes from the same arg type intra type tend to co occur such as aacc2 and aada1 of aminoglycoside yidy mdtl and basr of fca cfxa and pena of beta lactam the same arg host 55 the direct antibiotic selection pressure 56 and the same arg resistance mechanism 57 may generally lead to the evident co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes on the other hand the positive correlations were observed between arg subtypes of different args inter type such as aacc2 of aminoglycoside and tetl tetk of tetracycline catb3 of fca and ermb of mlsb these results demonstrated that the co occurrence patterns were evident within or across args which were supported by previous studies 12 58 additionally there were 92 edges showed negative correlations in the network for example yidy mdtl was negatively correlated with erea blt and yitg ymfd yfmo which suggested that co exclusion patterns also existed among arg subtypes in comparison the edges between arg subtypes decreased from 237 to 178 after disinfection fig 5b indicating that disinfection weakened the interactions among args to some extent nevertheless the co occurrence patterns were still dominant among args with 110 positive correlations in the network notably all the 40 arg subtypes changed from four separate groups to an interconnected network with yebq and marc as the hub args which can be regard as indicators to predict the corresponding co occurring args 51 meanwhile the relationships between args changed after disinfection for instance the correlation of some arg subtypes changed from irrelevant in control to relevant in disinfection samples including positive aada1 and emrb qaca and negative putitive multidrug and qach correlations while the relationship of other arg subtypes changed from relevant in control to irrelevant after disinfection such as ermb and vanyb tetl tetk and marc pena and catb8 the variations of args were generally believed to be closely related to the shift of bacterial community composition 59 60 it is reasonable to speculate that the alteration of interactions among args may be attributed to the removal of disinfectant sensitive bacteria and the enrichment of disinfectant resistant bacteria carrying multiple args in summary there were complex interactions among args and disinfection weakened and changed their relationships to a certain extent 3 6 potential hosts harboring args the study of arg potential hosts is of great significance for the transmission and control of args in addition to the potential pathogens other nonpathogenic bacteria should also be given enough attention in present study the correlations among arg subtypes nonpathogenic bacteria top 20 genera of high mid and low abundant taxa respectively and potential pathogens were further investigated to explore the possible hosts harboring args as shown in fig 6a there were 57 nodes 21 arg subtypes and 36 nonpathogenic bacteria and 157 edges in the network the tetl tetk ebra ebrb meci and yitg ymfd yfmo were top five arg subtypes in terms of degree node level topological feature which had complex correlations with nonpathogenic genera a total of 36 bacteria including 11 high 13 mid and 12 low abundant genera were identified to have significant positive correlations with args indicating that they may be the potential hosts of args for high abundant taxa blastocatella was positively correlated with args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside aade mlsb erea tetracycline tetl tetk and other efflux marr norb norc yitg ymfd yfmo ebra ebrb and meci oceanobacillus and bosea were co occurred with seven and six arg subtypes respectively ornatilinea paenibacillus and thiobacter of mid abundant taxa had positive correlations with many args aade erea tetl tetk ebra and ebrb low abundant genera such as bdellovibrio thioalkalispira mesorhizobium and flavitalea were also positively correlated with nine six five and five arg subtypes respectively these results demonstrated that although the mid and low abundant genera accounted for a low proportion in the microbial community they may also carry multiple args moreover rare taxa were important contributors to α diversity of microbial communities 61 and may become dominant under favorable conditions 62 which should be given extensive attention in the future research potential pathogens not only posed risks to human health but also easily captured args to form superbugs 25 there were 46 nodes and 61 edges in the arg potential pathogen network fig 5b and 18 potential pathogens were identified as the possible hosts which were positively related with 28 arg subtypes vibrio and bacillus had positive correlations with diverse args such as aade erea and tetl tetk which were the subtypes of aminoglycoside mlsb and tetracycline args respectively bacillus was a genus that can survive under stressful conditions due to the ability to produce a large number of endospores 63 which may provide an advantage for it to become a potential host of multiple args staphylococcus and pseudomonas were mainly co occurred with args conferring resistance to fca yidy mdt basr and qepa and other efflux acrr yebq and marb pseudomonas was identified as the prevalent chlorine resistant microbiota in water 15 and each specie within pseudomonas was known to encode resistance nodulation cell division rnd transportation system 64 it has been reported that pseudomonas often carries multiple args and may be one of the most important genera for promoting the proliferation and dissemination of args 24 which partially supports the results obtained in this study while burkholderia was positively related with args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside aada1 and beta lactam pbp2x in addition there were many other potential pathogens that may carry args such as corynebacterium clostridium xlva enterococcus and acinetobacter it is worth noting that clostridium xlva and acinetobacter were identified as the potential host of ermb vanyb and ycee mdtg and their relative abundance increased after multiple disinfection in our previous study 36 which supports our hypothesis in section 3 3 that the enrichment of ermb vanyb and ycee mdtg may be attributed to the resistance of their potential hosts to most disinfection methods taken together 36 nonpathogenic bacteria and 18 potential pathogens were identified to be the potential hosts possibly harboring args in this study and some genera with low relative abundance that may carry args should be given more attention meanwhile it should be noted that such co occurrence pattern shown by network analysis needs to be verified by other precise methods in future research 3 7 research significance and future scope the occurrence of args and their fate under eight disinfection strategies investigated in this study contribute to our comprehensive understanding of args in dhws and provide some ideas for future research although the args were identified by functional prediction rather than quantitative analysis detailed research significances are as follows 1 a total of 40 arg subtypes were predicted and they potentially confer resistance to seven classes of antibiotics mainly beta lactam followed by mlsb fca tetracycline vancomycin and aminoglycoside so more attentions should be paid to the occurrence and distribution of these antibiotics in dhws moreover some dominant args such as ampc pena cfxa and emrb qaca need further precision analysis by qpcr and ht qpcr 2 the eight disinfection strategies adopted in this study could be applied in the real dhws by means of adding disinfectant online cl2 clo2 and ag increasing heat exchanger temperature ts installing pipeline type uv disinfection equipment uv and combining them cl2 uv ag ts and ag uv among these disinfection methods clo2 presented the best removal performance on the total abundance of different arg types meanwhile arg subtypes responded differently to the eight disinfection strategies so the corresponding results provide a basis for the reasonable selection of disinfection methods single or combined disinfection to achieve effective control of specific args in dhws the complex interactions between args still existed after disinfection although they were weakened compared to before disinfection which required the optimization of existing disinfection methods 3 in total 36 nonpathogenic bacteria and 18 potential pathogens were identified to be the potential hosts possibly harboring args they may promote the transmission of args and bring obstacles to the effective control of args notably some genera with relatively low abundance that are easily overlooked may also carry args such as bdellovibrio and thioalkalispira accurately identifying the arg hosts constructing the correlations between the dynamics of arg hosts and occurrence of args and developing new strategies for removal of args are still worthy of further exploration in the future 4 conclusions the biofilm community composition and microbial function at subcategory were altered by the eight disinfection strategies applied in this study in total 40 arg subtypes within seven antibiotic types were predicted in the pipe wall biofilm of dhws and most disinfection methods including cl2 clo2 ag uv and ag uv reduced the total abundances of args the args in different samples were clustered into four groups and the removal and enrichment of the same args in each group were almost consistent disinfection weakened the complex interactions of args to a certain extent while the co occurrence patterns were still dominant among args there were 36 nonpathogenic bacteria including high mid and low abundant genera and 18 potential pathogens identified as the potential hosts for multiple args some genera with low relative abundance may also carry args and should be given more attention in the future overall this study helps to form a comprehensive understanding of args in dhws and proposes some possible research directions in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13359,for comprehensive insights into the effects of disinfection strategy on antibiotic resistance genes args in pipe wall biofilm to ensure the biosafety of domestic hot water system dhws this study investigated the occurrence removal and interactions of args as well as their potential hosts the shifts in biofilm community composition and microbial functions level three were observed under different disinfection strategies a total of 40 arg subtypes within seven antibiotic types were predicted the total gene counts ranged from 6 10 104 to 2 31 105 and decreased after the chlorine chlorine dioxide silver ions ag ultraviolet uv and ag uv disinfection the args in samples under different disinfection strategies were divided into four groups and the removal and enrichment of the same args in each group were almost consistent the complex interactions among args were weakened and altered by disinfection edges decreased from 237 to 178 with yebq and marc as the hub args but positive correlations were still dominant moreover 36 nonpathogenic bacteria including high blastocatella mid ornatilinea and low abundant genera bdellovibrio as well as 18 potential pathogens vibrio and bacillus were identified as the potential hosts harboring args overall this study provides some new insights into the occurrence of args and their fate under eight disinfection strategies which is of great significance for a comprehensive understanding and control of args in dhws graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords domestic hot water system disinfection antibiotic resistance genes removal and enrichment potential hosts 1 introduction the emergence dissemination and accumulation of antibiotic resistant genes args in environment due to the overuse or misuse antibiotics have become a global major issue 1 2 as emerging genotype pollutants args may potentially cause serious public health problems and have raised an increasing attention 3 args can spread antibiotic resistance in microbial communities through horizontal gene transfer hgt particularly in phases that have high bacterial cell density such as biofilm 4 biofilm is ubiquitous in aquatic environments with complex microbial communities capable of performing multiple functions it may act as a sink for args 5 and the args in biofilm have been widely investigated in various media and environments such as microplastic 6 activated sludge 7 freshwater 8 and even drinking water distribution system dwds 9 generally domestic hot water system dhws utilized drinking water as influent with the characteristics of long hydraulic retention time and low disinfectant residue which provide favorable conditions for the formation of pipe wall biofilm however to the best of our knowledge there are few studies reported the occurrence of args in pipe wall biofilm of dhws moreover existing studies mainly focused on several major args of specific antibiotics using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr 7 10 11 lacking a holistic recognition of the args in different habitats relatively speaking functional prediction can provide a more comprehensive analysis of args which is helpful for us to fully understand their occurrence in dhws this method has also been used in previous studies and confirmed to have good consistency with the results of metagenomic sequencing 12 14 disinfection is an effective way to inactivate bacteria and control biofilm contamination which may affect the removal and enrichment of args in recent years increasing studies have documented the effects of disinfection strategies on args such as chlorine chlorine dioxide ultraviolet uv and their combinations chlorine as a widely used disinfectant has been reported to elevate the total relative abundance of args in opportunistic bacteria 15 while other study showed that chlorination is a promising approach to effectively remove the args in wastewater 16 uv disinfection could increase the total arg abundances 17 and a larger dose of uv was required to damage args than to inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 18 19 combining uv irradiation with advanced oxidative processes such as uv chlorine uv hydrogen peroxide and uv ozone may enhance the removal of args 20 21 notably the above mentioned studies are all aimed at args in aquatic environment to date the fates of args in biofilm after disinfection are largely unknown especially in dhws and how the disinfection strategies affect the correlations of args is still poorly understood therefore it is necessary to perform systematic research that unravels the comprehensive profile of args under multiple disinfection strategies the sensitivity of microbes to disinfectants varies greatly leading to remarkable shift of community structure which was considered to be the key factor driving the changes of arg profiles 22 it has been proved that the increase of chlorine resistant bacteria led to the enrichment of args such as pseudomonas and acidovorax 23 and the study of su et al also obtained similar results 24 suggesting that there was a close association between the pseudomonas and dissemination of args biofilm microbial community was an aggregation of a large number of species including both potential pathogens and nonpathogenic bacteria many studies reported that potential pathogens can easily capture args to form superbugs 25 26 while it was not clear whether the nonpathogenic bacteria could become the potential hosts of args especially for low abundant taxa that were usually overlooked in research network analysis is a common method to explore the associations among entities 27 28 the co occurrence pattern between args and bacteria was helpful to speculate the potential host of args 29 and had been widely applied in many environments 29 30 which is also applicable to dhws in the present study the args in biofilm of dhws were comprehensively predicted and the fate of args under eight disinfection strategies were systematically investigated the main objectives were to 1 reveal the shifts in biofilm community and microbial function among different samples 2 investigate the occurrence of args in pipe wall biofilm 3 explore the removal and enrichment of args under eight disinfection strategies 4 elucidate the alteration of interactions among args before and after disinfection 5 identify the potential hosts of args based on the above results the research significance of this study and future scope were elaborated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design in the present study biofilm annular reactor bar was applied as the model pipeline of dhws and a total of eight bars were set up in parallel for biofilm cultivation the heated laboratory tap water 45 c was used as the influent of bars and the main water quality parameters are list in table s1 there were 18 coupons made of polypropylene random ppr in each bar and all reactors were operated continuously for three months to make the coupons form stable biofilm 31 32 then 12 coupons were taken out from each of the eight bars and put into the corresponding eight beakers for the biofilm static disinfection experiment the detailed parameters of eight disinfection strategies including chlorine cl2 chlorine dioxide clo2 silver ions ag thermal shock ts uv cl2 uv ag ts and ag uv are shown in table 1 which were determined based on previous publications 33 34 and standards for drinking water quality 35 during the disinfection process in addition to ts and ag ts 60 c the water temperature of other disinfection strategies was kept at 45 c the disinfection time was 150 min which was sufficient for the inactivation efficiency of total bacteria escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria in biofilm to reach a steady state 36 2 2 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing in this study 16 coupons two coupons for each bar were taken from bars as control samples before the experiment and two coupons were collected for each disinfection strategy as disinfected samples after the experiment the biofilm on each coupon was scraped by cotton swabs and prepared a bacterial suspension by ultrasonication and homogenization then the parallel biofilm suspensions were mixed and the same volume was taken out for each treatment method and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane millipore usa in total triplicate control samples and eight disinfected samples namely cl2 clo2 ag ts uv cl2 uv ag ts and ag uv were applied for dna extraction the quality and purity of the extracted dna were assessed by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis and dna detection kit qubit3 0 bioresearch china respectively high throughput sequencing was used to explore the composition of biofilm bacterial communities the 341f and 805r primers were used to amplify the v3 v4 regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene 37 then the sequencing of purified pcr products was performed on the illumina miseq sequencing platform at sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china after removing the barcodes primers short sequences singletons and chimera the effective sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by setting a 3 distance limit and the taxonomic classification for each otu sequence was conducted using silva database http www arb silva de referring to previous literatures 38 39 the biofilm bacterial communities were divided into three categories at the genus level in terms of relative abundance including high abundant taxa hat 1 mid abundant taxa mat 0 1 1 and low abundant taxa lat 0 1 the potential pathogenic bacteria were selected based on the virulence factor database vfdb http www mgc ac cn vfs for further analysis 2 3 microbial functions and args analysis phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to predict the microbial functions and args of biofilm 40 a table of functional gene counts known as kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos could be obtained from the output of picrust and the args were selected by comparison with kos published in a previous literature 12 to investigate the shifts of args under eight disinfection strategies ko numbers summarized in the table 12 covered genes confer resistance to eight classes of antibiotics including aminoglycoside beta lactam fca fluoroquinolone quinolone florfenicol chloramphenicol and amphenicol mlsb macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b sulfa tetracycline vancomycin and other efflux in total seven classes of args were predicted in the present study except for sulfa args and the gene counts corresponding to kos could be regarded as the abundance of args moreover the weighted nearest sequenced taxon index nsti scores were calculated to assess the accuracy of the prediction principal component analysis pca combined with permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was utilized to investigate the differences of microbial functions and args among different samples heatmap was created to visualize the distribution of args from the perspective of gene abundance the fold changes of args relative abundance before and after disinfection were calculated to reveal their removal and enrichment 2 4 network analysis network analysis was applied to investigate the interactions among args and explore the potential hosts of args three control samples and eight disinfected samples were used to construct the arg network before and after disinfection the bacteria hosts were classified into two categories nonpathogenic genera including high mid and low abundant taxa and potential pathogens the correlation matrix was constructed by calculating the spearman s rank correlation coefficients srccs using ibm spss statistics 25 if the srcc 0 6 or 0 6 and p values 0 05 the correlation between two items was considered to be statistically significant and cytoscape version 3 6 0 was used to visualize all the robust correlations moreover the unique node level topological feature of degree was calculated in the network the size of each node was proportional to the degree the connection numbers of each arg with others solid and dash lines represented positive and negative correlations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 shifts in biofilm microbial community composition in the present study 78 class 115 order and 267 family were identified among the nine biofilm samples and the top 10 of them are shown in fig 1 at the class level bacilli belonging to firmicutes was the dominant class accounting for 1 53 47 54 of total sequences in each sample and its relative abundance increased obviously after uv cl2 uv and ag uv disinfection indicating that most species of bacilli were resistant to uv this phenomenon may be explained by the thick cell wall and spore forming ability of firmicutes which enhance their resistance to harsh environmental conditions 41 alphaproteobacteria 2 74 37 47 gammaproteobacteria 2 68 33 64 betaproteobacteria 2 80 10 99 and deltaproteobacteria 0 14 6 42 were the four class belonging to proteobacteria reflecting the dominant position of proteobacteria in the microbial community 42 among them the proportion of alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria decreased after disinfection except for ts and ag ts whereas the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased slightly in all disinfected samples compared with control 6 23 the proportion of planctomycetia increased only after ag disinfection 16 48 deinococci a class of deinococcus thermus was highly resistant to thermal environments and was often detected in hot springs and dhws 43 44 its relative abundance decreased from 18 63 in control to 0 03 10 39 in all disinfected samples which suggested that the species of deinococci may be highly sensitive to disinfection acidobacteria gp4 0 03 9 68 spartobacteria 0 01 6 96 and sphingobacteriia 0 12 3 72 belong to acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and bacteroidetes respectively compared to the control their relative abundance decreased in most disinfected samples and only increased in a few samples such as acidobacteria gp4 in ag and uv spartobacteria and sphingobacteriia in ts at the order level the top 10 were composed of the primary or unique orders of the six dominant class for example bacillales 0 61 42 72 was the major order of bacilli rhizobiales 1 18 13 71 sphingomonadales 0 27 11 96 and rhodospirillales 0 10 6 57 were the three main orders of alphaproteobacteria while planctomycetales 0 14 16 48 and thermales 0 03 18 63 were the unique orders corresponding to the class of planctomycetia and deinococci respectively therefore their dynamics in relative abundance before and after disinfection were almost consistent with the class level at the family level in terms of relative abundance bacillaceae increased after uv and ag uv disinfection while bacillales incertae sedis xii increased after cl2 uv disinfection both of them belong to bacillales and together explained the raised proportion of bacillales in uv cl2 uv and ag uv samples planctomycetaceae thermaceae rhodocyclaceae and enterobacteriaceae were the only families belong to planctomycetales thermales rhodocyclales and enterobacteriales so they accounted for the same proportion with the corresponding orders sphingomonadaceae 0 25 11 95 and bradyrhizobiaceae 0 04 10 54 were important family of sphingomonadales and rhizobiales respectively and exhibited similar variation with them additionally the proportions of streptococcaceae 0 90 4 26 and gemmatimonadaceae 0 08 5 12 among samples were lower than 10 and increased slightly after uv and ag uv disinfection compared with control moreover the microbial community composition was further classified into three categories at the genus level the high mid and low abundant genera as well as potential pathogens are shown in tables s2 s5 and their responses to different disinfection methods had been analyzed in our previous study 36 these results demonstrated that the shifts in biofilm community composition among samples were different and thermales was sensitive to all the eight disinfection strategies applied in this study 3 2 microbial functions analysis picrust was used to infer the biofilm microbial potential functions in dhws as shown in fig 2a the weighted nsti of each sample ranged from 0 09 to 0 15 with an average of 0 12 lower than 0 17 indicating that the predicted results were accurate and could provide some important insights into the microbial functions 40 at the top level of pathway modules the predicted functions displayed similar distribution among samples fig s1 so their average proportions were shown in fig 2b metabolism was the predominant functional category accounting for 50 08 of total counts genetic information processing 16 75 and environmental information processing 13 01 were also the important functional categories as for cellular processes human diseases and organismal systems their proportions were all less than 4 the insignificant shifts in microbial function among samples may be attributed to the functional redundancy of the complex microbial community 45 additionally 14 80 of microbial functions were unclassified which suggested that there may be some new functions that need further investigation the similarity in microbial functions at subcategory level three was further assessed by pca pc1 and pc2 explained 57 83 and 28 30 of the variance in microbial functions among samples respectively fig 2c control ts and ag ts samples were clustered into group i indicating that although ts and ag ts disinfection changed the biofilm community composition they had limited impact on microbial functions in contrast other disinfection strategies altered the microbial function obviously ag uv ag uv and cl2 uv were clustered into group ii while cl2 and clo2 were in separate groups and located far from other samples it should be note that the dissimilarity of the four groups was not significant permanova p 0 05 moreover four functional subcategories related to antibiotic metabolism were identified including drug metabolism tetracycline biosynthesis biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics and beta lactam resistance fig 2d compared with control most disinfection methods cl2 clo2 ag uv ag uv and cl2 uv impaired the functions mentioned above which was not conducive to the metabolism of antibiotics and the enhancement of beta lactam resistance but helps to reduce the biosynthesis of tetracycline and vancomycin while ts and ag ts disinfection slightly increased the counts of these functions in general the microbial functions at top level showed similar distributions among samples but their subcategories were obviously affected by different disinfection strategies 3 3 overview and distribution of args under eight disinfection strategies the gene counts of args varied in different samples fig 3a ranging from 6 10 104 to 2 31 105 indicating the influence of disinfection strategies on the abundance of args compared with the control most disinfection methods including cl2 clo2 ag uv and ag uv reduced the arg counts whereas ts cl2 uv and ag ts increased the total abundance of args as reported in our previous study the diversity of microbial community decreased after clo2 disinfection while increased after ts and ag ts disinfection 36 which is a possible reason for the difference in the effect of three disinfection methods on arg abundance cl2 and clo2 have strong oxidizing property and can inactivate a variety of genera in the biofilm community 36 among which may contain the potential hosts of args leading to the decrease of the arg counts on the contrary the elevated level of total arg abundances in drinking water was observed after chlorine disinfection 46 which suggested that the enrichment of chlorine resistant bacteria hosts and mobile genetic elements mges is an important reason for the increase in the total arg abundances after chlorination the conflict results may be interpreted by the different water quality original arg contamination level disinfectant concentration and detection method the predicted args in different samples potentially confer resistance to major classes of antibiotics mainly beta lactam 1 24 104 5 31 104 followed by mlsb 6 89 103 3 24 104 fca 7 17 103 3 19 104 tetracycline 1 33 103 5 42 103 vancomycin 1 21 103 2 74 103 and aminoglycoside 7 04 102 2 48 103 beta lactam was an antibiotic with important antibacterial activity by inhibiting the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls 47 and it was often detected in drinking water 48 which may explain the high abundance of beta lactam args in biofilm of dhws additionally there were 3 10 104 1 19 105 of args conferring resistance to the other antibiotics the richness of args was not obviously affected by disinfection which ranged from 36 to 40 in each sample fig s2a this phenomenon may be attributed to the partial but not complete removal of args by the disinfection strategies used in this study these args represented three major resistance mechanisms with similar proportion in different samples including efflux pump antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection and their average proportions were 56 09 27 84 and 16 07 respectively fig s2b efflux pump has also been reported as the most important resistance mechanism in activated sludge samples of wwtps 12 which supports our results to a certain extent moreover the differences of args in samples were investigated by pca as shown in fig 3b pc1 and pc2 explained 56 19 and 26 01 of the variance in args structure respectively the control and ag samples were grouped together i indicating that ag disinfection had little influence on the structure of args which may be due to the low concentration of ag 0 05 mg l used for disinfection uv and ag uv samples were clustered into the second group ii cl2 clo2 ts and ag ts were clustered into the third group iii while cl2 uv sample located far away from the others as the fourth group alone iv however the statistical difference between the groups was not significant permanova p 0 05 these results demonstrated that the structure of args was reshaped to a certain extent after disinfection which is likely to be driven by the change of bacterial community during disinfection 49 the distribution of args under eight disinfection strategies was investigated and a total of 40 arg subtypes were obtained in all samples fig 2 there were four arg subtypes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside with aacc2 aade and aada1 predominant in all samples while aacc1 was not abundant aminoglycoside as an antibiotic with high water solubility was broadly applied in animal husbandry in china 50 which provides selective pressure for the generation of aminoglycoside args for beta lactam args ampc was the most primary arg subtype in this study and it was also frequently detected in drinking water 51 the abundance of ampc decreased obviously after cl2 and clo2 disinfection suggesting its strong sensitivity to chlorination the abundance of pena and cfxa was almost equivalent while pbp2x had low gene count among the five arg subtypes for fca catb3 and emrb qaca were more abundant than the other arg subtypes yidy mdtl basr and qepa and the abundance of all fca args increased after cl2 uv disinfection the ermk mdta mefa and mphb were the main mlsb arg subtypes in all samples and other genes had relatively low abundance such as erea and ermb the teta tetg teth tetj and tetl tetk were the dominant arg subtypes conferring resistance to tetracycline tetracycline args were widely detected in various environmental media due to the universality of tetracycline application 52 only two arg subtypes for vancomycin were obtained and vanyb was more abundant than vrar in different samples for some other antibiotics 17 arg subtypes were detected and the abundance of marr putitive multidrug qach tc mate slc47a norm mdtk dinf bcr tcab and marc were obviously higher than other arg subtypes on the whole the abundance and structure of args in biofilms were affected by disinfection strategies while the dominant arg subtypes were similar in different samples 3 4 removal and enrichment of args under eight disinfection strategies the fold change values of arg subtypes were further calculated and visualized by heatmap to reveal the removal and enrichment of args under eight disinfection strategies as shown in fig 4 the clustering of different disinfection methods was consistent with the grouping results of pca fig 3b a previous research demonstrated that the args were not randomly distributed and they were likely to be shaped by the selective pressure of disinfectants and oligotrophic environment 23 in the present study the removal of emrb qaca ermk pena ampc mdta putitive multidrug and tc mate slc47a norm mdtk dinf 0 57 0 94 fold and the enrichment of aada1 pbp2x catb3 catb8 ycee mdtg mefa vanyb and ermb 1 42 10 39 fold were occurred after cl2 and clo2 disinfection chlorine with the concentration of 0 05 0 2 mg l was more likely to damage than inactivate bacterial cells 53 under suitable conditions the damaged cells could be repaired and recovered and serve as receptors for transferable args thus increasing the opportunity for the hgt of args between other bacterial cells 53 it was reported that the removal of args rose slowly when adding chlorine from 5 mg l to 20 mg l and increased dramatically from the dosage of 20 mg l to 25 mg l 54 a greater chlorine concentration was necessary to achieve higher removal efficiency for all the args 54 in this study the concentration used for cl2 disinfection was only 3 mg l which was not enough to remove all the args the enrichment of ermb after clo2 disinfection was also observed in the aqueous phase and this phenomenon was explained as multi drug efflux pump mediated co resistance and plasmid over replication 15 compared with the control aade erea tetl tetk yitg ymfd yfmo meci and norb norc were partially or completely removed 0 0 89 fold by cl2 clo2 ts and ag ts disinfection while qepa acrr yebq yidy mdtl basr marb and vrar were enriched 1 15 53 51 fold by them ag uv and ag uv also exhibited similar effects on the removal such as ermk cfxa bcr tcab and marc and enrichment such as aade erea ebra ebrb tetl tetk yitg ymfd yfmo and blt of most arg subtypes uv inactivates bacteria by interacting with dna without damaging the cellular envelope and the remarkably enhancement in relative abundances of many arg types after uv disinfection has also been reported in a previous study 10 supporting our results the variation of args in cl2 uv sample was different with other disinfection strategies which explained why cl2 uv as a separate group in fig 3b notably qach mphb and teta tetg teth tetj were removed in almost all the samples the abundances of args carried by various potential hosts varied drastically along with the potential host abundances 23 55 so a possible explanation for this phenomenon was that the potential hosts of these arg subtypes were sensitive to most disinfection methods overall disinfection strategies affected the removal and enrichment of args to a certain extent and each arg subtype responded differently to various disinfection methods 3 5 interactions between args after understanding the occurrence removal and enrichment of args how the interaction of args is still a question worth exploring therefore the correlation based network analysis was utilized to investigate the underlying interactions among args before and after disinfection for control samples fig 5a the args were divided into four groups and the nodes in each group had the same number of connections with others that is degree group i presented the most complicated interactions with 18 nodes and 156 edges in the network the network of group ii 10 nodes and 45 edges and iii 9 nodes and 33 edges were relatively simple while there were only three arg subtypes aacc1 ebra and ebrb in group iv the intricate interactions among args were helpful for them to resist environmental pressures so more attentions should be paid to the arg subtypes in group i in total 237 edges of significant and strong correlations were identified among 40 arg subtypes and 145 edges exhibited the positive correlations on the one hand many arg subtypes from the same arg type intra type tend to co occur such as aacc2 and aada1 of aminoglycoside yidy mdtl and basr of fca cfxa and pena of beta lactam the same arg host 55 the direct antibiotic selection pressure 56 and the same arg resistance mechanism 57 may generally lead to the evident co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes on the other hand the positive correlations were observed between arg subtypes of different args inter type such as aacc2 of aminoglycoside and tetl tetk of tetracycline catb3 of fca and ermb of mlsb these results demonstrated that the co occurrence patterns were evident within or across args which were supported by previous studies 12 58 additionally there were 92 edges showed negative correlations in the network for example yidy mdtl was negatively correlated with erea blt and yitg ymfd yfmo which suggested that co exclusion patterns also existed among arg subtypes in comparison the edges between arg subtypes decreased from 237 to 178 after disinfection fig 5b indicating that disinfection weakened the interactions among args to some extent nevertheless the co occurrence patterns were still dominant among args with 110 positive correlations in the network notably all the 40 arg subtypes changed from four separate groups to an interconnected network with yebq and marc as the hub args which can be regard as indicators to predict the corresponding co occurring args 51 meanwhile the relationships between args changed after disinfection for instance the correlation of some arg subtypes changed from irrelevant in control to relevant in disinfection samples including positive aada1 and emrb qaca and negative putitive multidrug and qach correlations while the relationship of other arg subtypes changed from relevant in control to irrelevant after disinfection such as ermb and vanyb tetl tetk and marc pena and catb8 the variations of args were generally believed to be closely related to the shift of bacterial community composition 59 60 it is reasonable to speculate that the alteration of interactions among args may be attributed to the removal of disinfectant sensitive bacteria and the enrichment of disinfectant resistant bacteria carrying multiple args in summary there were complex interactions among args and disinfection weakened and changed their relationships to a certain extent 3 6 potential hosts harboring args the study of arg potential hosts is of great significance for the transmission and control of args in addition to the potential pathogens other nonpathogenic bacteria should also be given enough attention in present study the correlations among arg subtypes nonpathogenic bacteria top 20 genera of high mid and low abundant taxa respectively and potential pathogens were further investigated to explore the possible hosts harboring args as shown in fig 6a there were 57 nodes 21 arg subtypes and 36 nonpathogenic bacteria and 157 edges in the network the tetl tetk ebra ebrb meci and yitg ymfd yfmo were top five arg subtypes in terms of degree node level topological feature which had complex correlations with nonpathogenic genera a total of 36 bacteria including 11 high 13 mid and 12 low abundant genera were identified to have significant positive correlations with args indicating that they may be the potential hosts of args for high abundant taxa blastocatella was positively correlated with args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside aade mlsb erea tetracycline tetl tetk and other efflux marr norb norc yitg ymfd yfmo ebra ebrb and meci oceanobacillus and bosea were co occurred with seven and six arg subtypes respectively ornatilinea paenibacillus and thiobacter of mid abundant taxa had positive correlations with many args aade erea tetl tetk ebra and ebrb low abundant genera such as bdellovibrio thioalkalispira mesorhizobium and flavitalea were also positively correlated with nine six five and five arg subtypes respectively these results demonstrated that although the mid and low abundant genera accounted for a low proportion in the microbial community they may also carry multiple args moreover rare taxa were important contributors to α diversity of microbial communities 61 and may become dominant under favorable conditions 62 which should be given extensive attention in the future research potential pathogens not only posed risks to human health but also easily captured args to form superbugs 25 there were 46 nodes and 61 edges in the arg potential pathogen network fig 5b and 18 potential pathogens were identified as the possible hosts which were positively related with 28 arg subtypes vibrio and bacillus had positive correlations with diverse args such as aade erea and tetl tetk which were the subtypes of aminoglycoside mlsb and tetracycline args respectively bacillus was a genus that can survive under stressful conditions due to the ability to produce a large number of endospores 63 which may provide an advantage for it to become a potential host of multiple args staphylococcus and pseudomonas were mainly co occurred with args conferring resistance to fca yidy mdt basr and qepa and other efflux acrr yebq and marb pseudomonas was identified as the prevalent chlorine resistant microbiota in water 15 and each specie within pseudomonas was known to encode resistance nodulation cell division rnd transportation system 64 it has been reported that pseudomonas often carries multiple args and may be one of the most important genera for promoting the proliferation and dissemination of args 24 which partially supports the results obtained in this study while burkholderia was positively related with args conferring resistance to aminoglycoside aada1 and beta lactam pbp2x in addition there were many other potential pathogens that may carry args such as corynebacterium clostridium xlva enterococcus and acinetobacter it is worth noting that clostridium xlva and acinetobacter were identified as the potential host of ermb vanyb and ycee mdtg and their relative abundance increased after multiple disinfection in our previous study 36 which supports our hypothesis in section 3 3 that the enrichment of ermb vanyb and ycee mdtg may be attributed to the resistance of their potential hosts to most disinfection methods taken together 36 nonpathogenic bacteria and 18 potential pathogens were identified to be the potential hosts possibly harboring args in this study and some genera with low relative abundance that may carry args should be given more attention meanwhile it should be noted that such co occurrence pattern shown by network analysis needs to be verified by other precise methods in future research 3 7 research significance and future scope the occurrence of args and their fate under eight disinfection strategies investigated in this study contribute to our comprehensive understanding of args in dhws and provide some ideas for future research although the args were identified by functional prediction rather than quantitative analysis detailed research significances are as follows 1 a total of 40 arg subtypes were predicted and they potentially confer resistance to seven classes of antibiotics mainly beta lactam followed by mlsb fca tetracycline vancomycin and aminoglycoside so more attentions should be paid to the occurrence and distribution of these antibiotics in dhws moreover some dominant args such as ampc pena cfxa and emrb qaca need further precision analysis by qpcr and ht qpcr 2 the eight disinfection strategies adopted in this study could be applied in the real dhws by means of adding disinfectant online cl2 clo2 and ag increasing heat exchanger temperature ts installing pipeline type uv disinfection equipment uv and combining them cl2 uv ag ts and ag uv among these disinfection methods clo2 presented the best removal performance on the total abundance of different arg types meanwhile arg subtypes responded differently to the eight disinfection strategies so the corresponding results provide a basis for the reasonable selection of disinfection methods single or combined disinfection to achieve effective control of specific args in dhws the complex interactions between args still existed after disinfection although they were weakened compared to before disinfection which required the optimization of existing disinfection methods 3 in total 36 nonpathogenic bacteria and 18 potential pathogens were identified to be the potential hosts possibly harboring args they may promote the transmission of args and bring obstacles to the effective control of args notably some genera with relatively low abundance that are easily overlooked may also carry args such as bdellovibrio and thioalkalispira accurately identifying the arg hosts constructing the correlations between the dynamics of arg hosts and occurrence of args and developing new strategies for removal of args are still worthy of further exploration in the future 4 conclusions the biofilm community composition and microbial function at subcategory were altered by the eight disinfection strategies applied in this study in total 40 arg subtypes within seven antibiotic types were predicted in the pipe wall biofilm of dhws and most disinfection methods including cl2 clo2 ag uv and ag uv reduced the total abundances of args the args in different samples were clustered into four groups and the removal and enrichment of the same args in each group were almost consistent disinfection weakened the complex interactions of args to a certain extent while the co occurrence patterns were still dominant among args there were 36 nonpathogenic bacteria including high mid and low abundant genera and 18 potential pathogens identified as the potential hosts for multiple args some genera with low relative abundance may also carry args and should be given more attention in the future overall this study helps to form a comprehensive understanding of args in dhws and proposes some possible research directions in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare
