6515,pump and treat p t is a widely adopted technology for groundwater containment remediation over the past decades we have recognized that mapping aquifer heterogeneity especially the low hydraulic conductivity k zones has become an urgent need in remediation efforts meanwhile many studies have proved that hydraulic tomography ht utilizing groundwater responses from a series of cross hole pumping tests is a viable technology for detailing hydraulic heterogeneity high and low k zones of aquifers at a p t field site operation of pumping and injection wells often vary creating changes in flow fields analogous to those in ht surveys therefore collecting groundwater monitoring data and analyzing them is tantamount to a cost effective large scale ht survey during p t operations to demonstrate this idea water level data was collected at 41 wells for one year at the u s air force plant 44 afp44 p t site in tucson arizona where the pumping and injection rates of the p t system were changed many times during the year this dataset was analyzed with a geostatistical inverse model to estimate the hydraulic property distribution which can reasonably predict the pressure responses of the site under different conditions moreover we showed that large scale geological information built based on 245 borehole logs at the site could improve the model calibration performance through a two step calibration procedure additionally we used synthetic experiments to verify that the use of a larger variety of p t configurations can yield non redundant ht information and enhance site characterization overall we demonstrated that the proper scheduling of pumping and injection operations at a p t site and collecting corresponding groundwater responses are equivalent to conducting a large scale ht survey with minimal additional costs keywords hydraulic tomography inverse modeling heterogeneity pump and treat operation geological borehole log 1 introduction pump and treat p t has been widely adopted as a viable technique for containment cleanup of deep i e 50 ft below ground surface and widespread groundwater contamination hoffman 1993 as well as controlling off site migration of a contaminant plume this technique employs an array of pumping wells to extract the contaminated water for treatment the treated water is either re injected into the subsurface or is discharged to local public water networks over the past decades experience indicates that the effectiveness of p t projects has been compromised by many physical and chemical factors voudrias 2001 for instance the breakthrough of contaminant concentrations at many p t sites including the u s air force plant 44 hereinafter denoted as afp44 zhang and brusseau 1999 often exhibit tailing and rebound tailing refers to the progressively slower rate of contaminant extraction during p t operation and the concentration at extraction wells remains above cleanup standards after a long period of p t operation moreover at many cleaned up sites once the extraction is terminated concentrations rebound to high levels for this reason many p t sites in the united states although operated for more than fifteen years are now undergoing re evaluation epa 2007 2000 urs 2014 2013a and some are even in the process of considering a technical impracticability waiver option malcolm pirnie 2002 the national research council 2013 2004 further concluded that the goal of complete restoration of contaminated groundwater at a substantial number of sites is unlikely achievable for many decades although various chemical and physical factors e g rate limited desorption slow dissolution of the immiscible liquid saturation zhang and brusseau 1999 may contribute to the ineffectiveness of p t the difficulty in characterizing the site specific hydrogeology has been considered as the major reason for example considering aquifer heterogeneity in the numerical simulations lee et al 2000 showed that low conductivity zones trap significant mass of pollutants and later release them into the groundwater system using experiments and a mathematical model voudrias 2001 demonstrated that p t is prohibitively expensive for groundwater remediation in a heterogeneous aquifer if the design of p t operations ignore heterogeneity similarly gungor demirci and aksoy 2011 employed stochastic analysis to investigate the influences of contrast and layering and stratification of hydraulic conductivity k on p t remediation period they concluded that the distributions of low and high k zones can significantly impact the time to compliance they also showed that using a large number of extraction wells with small rates is more effective than using a few wells with large rates enormous efforts have also been devoted to developing strategies to minimize the cost of the operation of p t at remediation sites chang et al 2007 huang and mayer 1997 e g kuo et al 1992 sharief et al 2012 these studies also emphasized the importance of site specific heterogeneity in particular mckinney and lin 1996 reported that aquifer heterogeneity dictates the design of pumping locations and rates huang and mayer 1997 suggested that pumping wells should be located along the centerline of the contaminant plumes and high k zones cohen et al 1994 stressed that p t operations need to monitor and evaluate groundwater flow direction well capture zones and contaminant migration which also are controlled by heterogeneity a smart p t in which a detailed characterization of the geology hydrology and chemistry is considered was suggested by hoffman 1993 while many aquifer characterization methods are available hydraulic tomography ht is a recently developed technology for mapping detailed aquifer heterogeneity xiang et al 2009 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 it fuses hydraulic responses from multiple aquifer tests this technique has been proven to be robust through numerous numerical mao et al 2013 zha et al 2015 2014 laboratory illman et al 2012 2015 sharmeen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 and field studies berg and illman 2011 hochstetler et al 2015 illman et al 2009 straface et al 2007 wang et al 2016 zha et al 2016 in particular kuhlman et al 2008 showed that an ht survey is an effective strategy for incorporating data from potentially disparate aquifer tests into a basin wide aquifer property estimate nevertheless the cost of conducting an ht survey is usually high due to well installation and operation of cross hole pumping tests however illman et al 2012 articulated that the cost of conducting an ht survey was comparable to the detailed characterization of heterogeneity using a large number of core samples at remediation sites many pumping and injection and monitoring wells have already been installed pumping injection flow rates are recorded and groundwater levels are often monitored thus it is logical to take advantage of the vast amount of existing facilities and datasets to characterize the aquifers and aquitards at p t sites regrettably these ideas are rarely exploited except in the pioneering work by tiedeman et al 2010 in which the hydraulic signals induced by the temporary shutdown of individual pumping wells of the p t system were interpreted using an inverse model nevertheless the equivalence between intermittent shutdown and resumption of different p t wells and its application to ht analysis is rarely recognized in effect the effectiveness of ht rests upon the new information about heterogeneity engrained in observed groundwater levels from the change in flow fields induced by pumping at different locations intermittent shutdown and resumption of different pumping and injection wells at a p t site alters the large scale flow fields at the site thus exploiting the aquifer responses during p t operations is identical to a large scale ht survey at the site thus a proper analysis of these groundwater responses could yield more detailed information about the heterogeneity at a p t site than model calibration without considering the changes in flow fields for this reason we promote a paradigm shift of aquifer characterization strategies towards using existing facilities and data during p t to improve the site characterization as advocated in yeh and lee 2007 it is time to change the way we collect and analyze data for aquifer characterization in addition to groundwater level data p t sites usually have abundant borehole log data which can provide stratigraphic information on subsurface structure while borehole data provide a qualitative description of soil texture rather than quantitative values of hydraulic properties using the general framework of incorporating geological information into ht as proposed in zha et al 2017b we believe that these qualitative data can further enhance the ht result in particular inclusion of geological data in ht has shown to significantly improve ht results through both sandbox zhao et al 2016 luo et al 2017 and field studies zhao and illman 2017 2018 however the number of classifications is also crucial when geological information serves as prior information without consideration of zones or facies may ignore some important large scale structure information while a large number of them may fail to accurately convert the indirect geological information to direct hydraulic values due to high dimensional parameter space issue zhang et al 2016 the optimal number of zones used in the prior model for ht investigation at p t sites needs further investigation following the thoughts discussed above the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using datasets from p t operation as ht to enhance site characterization for this purpose with the project support mok et al 2017 by the environmental security technology certification program estcp groundwater responses were collected at the afp44 p t site in tucson az over a year where many pumping and extraction wells were shut down and restarted intermittently for maintenance and other reasons in addition geological borehole log data from 245 boreholes at the site were acquired with these datasets the study intends to demonstrate that the head responses induced by the changes in pumping and injection rates at the afp44 site contain valuable information about both aquifer and aquitard heterogeneity proper analysis of the datasets using a highly parameterized geostatistical inverse model with the aid of the available geological information from the boreholes could yield high resolution maps of hydraulic parameters such as k and specific storage ss of the field site the paper is organized as follows the data of afp44 site used in this study including site information observation wells pumping and injection activities and geological information are presented in section 2 section 3 briefly presents the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle for analyzing the data sets section 4 details the setup for inverse modeling of the field data the use of prior geological information the results of the investigation for the field data and their validations experiments using a synthetic aquifer are presented in section 5 to emphasize the need to consider additional head datasets which carry non redundant information about the heterogeneity and can be acquired by changing the flow field using existing well facilities conclusions of the study are then summarized in section 6 2 site and dataset description 2 1 site information the afp44 site is a superfund site in tucson az designated by the u s environmental protection agency the site is located at the southernmost portion of the tucson international airport fig 1 the afp44 site has a history of trichloroethylene tce and 1 4 dioxane contamination in both the saturated and unsaturated zones the regional aquifer p t system has been in operation since 1987 and the total pumping rate has been maintained at 9000 m3 d a brief history of the afp44 site and a chronology of events can be found on the arizona department of environmental quality adeq s website https azdeq gov superfund site us air force plant 44 throughout more than thirty years of site s history numerous site investigations have been conducted by the usgs hanson and benedict 1994 houser et al 2004 program et al 2009 and various consultants aecom 2012 2011 e g 2010 urs 2014 2013b 2013a resulting in a large number of wells being installed these previous investigations have generally suggested that the regional groundwater flow direction is to the northwest as shown in fig 1 where the dashed rectangle is the domain of this study a schematic illustration of the geology and well screen intervals at the site are displayed in fig 2 generally speaking a confining unit separates the local upper zone uz aquifer and the regional lower zone lz aquifer brusseau et al 2013 matthieu et al 2014 with the latter supplying municipal water to the city of tucson the uz and the lz aquifers have been considered to have a negligible hydraulic connection the uz aquifer where most contaminants reside were subdivided into an upper unit uzuu and a lower unit uzlu by a thin aquitard pinching out to the northwest of afp44 however the location of the pinch out the lateral extent of the aquitard and hydraulic exchange between uzuu and uzlu are largely uncertain 2 2 observation wells and monitoring activity from june 20 2014 to july 13 2015 we installed 41 pressure transducers in an array of selected monitoring wells at afp44 the water levels at the wells were continuously recorded at two minute intervals these groundwater levels were also verified by a water level sounder at selected time and locations fig 1 shows a map of the extraction recharge and observation yellow circles green circles and black dots labeled by e r and m respectively well locations relevant to this study 2 3 pumping and injection events examination of pumping and injection records indicated three main types of events contributing to head changes 1 system shutdown and resumption 2 changes in pumping or injection operations and 3 fluctuation of flow rates see fig 3 the site did not have any storage facility for treated groundwater so that the total injection rate equals the total pumping rate plus leakage loss the site management only had control of on off of injection wells the injection system was gravitationally driven and had no flow rate controls as a result more conductive injection wells tend to have higher rates table 1 listed the average pumping and injection rates for the pumping and injection wells during the monitoring period it was found that wells r9 r2 r8 r5 and r4 are responsible for approximately 80 of the total injection rate in contrast the pumping rates among the extraction wells except wells e2 and e6 are relatively even our record indicated that several system shutdowns took place during the monitoring period the longest one occurred on june 12th 2015 or t 360 days on the time axis of fig 3 and lasted for approximately two weeks it also showed several events of shutdown and recovery of some individual wells for example e 13 reduced its pumping from 1600 m3 d to 500 m3 d on july 15th 2014 t 40 days also the site operation had adopted a new injection strategy on august 15th 2014 t 75 days such that r11 r18 and r20 were turned off while r3 r4 and r5 were turned on finally e1 the pumping well located at the center of the site was turned off until july 7th 2015 t 390 days when the pumping resumed on june 30th 2015 t 380 days 2 4 observations of head change 2 4 1 long term behavior the relative hydraulic head fluctuations of the 31 wells during the monitoring period june 2014 to july 2015 are plotted in fig 13 as black lines they revealed significant differences at different wells indicative of the complex geological heterogeneity at the site some monitoring wells were noticeably influenced by pumping wells for instance the wells m108 m110 m119 m121 m122 and m67 exhibited large head increases due to system shutdown these wells except m67 are close to pumping wells e 1 e 2 and the screen intervals of these wells are below the pinch out aquitard fig 2 on the other hand wells such as r3m r4m r5m and r11m which served as recharge and monitoring wells and the monitoring well m6 close to recharge wells were very responsive to injection rate changes in addition we notice that a large number of monitoring wells did not respond to the rate changes of pumping or injection these wells are either completed in shallow wells with short screen intervals e g p2 p3 p4 p6 p7 p10 s33 b1 and b3 in the uzuu or deep wells el4m and m12b in the lower zone notice that although these shallow and deep wells did not respond to the variation in pumping and injection they exhibited a long term increasing trend in the head this trend may be related to regional groundwater flow 2 4 2 short term head change behavior we have also investigated the head changes over a short time period 10 days of the observation wells the head changes at most wells exhibited almost identical patterns for all the system shutdown resume events not shown such a similarity indicated that these head responses over the multiple system shutdown resume events likely do not carry new information about heterogeneity head changes head at t 10 d after the event minus the head at the beginning of the event at some observation wells which carry non redundant information for the ht inversion are shown in fig 4 a d and they are discussed below according to four different p t events event 1 on april 6th 2015 the entire system was shut down the hydraulic heads at recharge wells r3m r4m r5m etc declined significantly fig 4a heads at monitoring wells m81 m6 m107 showed mild decreases indicative of greater influences by recharge than by pumping since they were close to the recharge wells on the other hand m108 m121 m110 m119 m122 and m67 indicated significant rises of the head during the shutdown suggesting that they were well connected to or close to the pumping wells m105 m104 m102 m100 m96 m97 m98 m93 m94 and m95 showed moderate increases of heads on the other hand some observation wells like b1 b3 r11m m69 s33 m73 m76 m120 m12b e3m el4m m107 m109 p2 p7 and p10 were insensitive to the shutdown event 2 on july 16th 2014 the pumping rate of e 13 decreased from 1600 m3 d to 500 m3 d and the pumping rates of e 4 and e 8 increased slightly these changes led to notable raises of heads in some wells fig 4b such as m105 m101 m104 m102 and r3m descending order in terms of responses other wells e g m118 m77 and m81 had moderate increases about 0 3 m some wells e g m119 r4 and r5 had small increases or even decreases in the head it is interesting to point out that although m119 and some wells had large responses during the system shutdown they were not sensitive to the rate change at e 13 well in other words head change record of event 2 clearly revealed hydraulic connectivity information between e 13 and observation wells event 3 on november 24th 2014 e23 was turned off and the pumping rates of e1 e13 were increased slightly and the recharge rates at all the recharge wells were reduced moderately according to fig 4c m122 and r11m were apparently connected to well e23 this observation is different from that in the events related to e13 event 2 meaning that this event can provide new information about the hydraulic connections between wells event 4 on may 20th 2015 e 6 was shut down and e 24 was turned on albeit the head changes at the observation wells see fig 4d were small ranging from 0 4 to 0 2 m they still can be used to infer the relative impacts of the event for instance m12a which is close to e24 was influenced by the restart of e24 and had a significant decrease of head in comparison with those of other wells 2 5 detailed 3 d geological map to obtain a complete list of borehole logs we have synthesized and reconciled information from several key data sources earth tech 2007 hydrogeologic 2012 montgomery associates 2015 fig 5 a shows the location and profile of the 245 geological boreholes notice that some of them are out of the model domain or completely in the vadose zone each borehole log contains the borehole name locations elevation of the ground the depth of the screen intervals and the corresponding unified soil classification system uscs codes these codes were simplified into 12 classifications zhang and brusseau 1999 and we assigned each of the 12 classifications a k value according to the chart in fig 13 of the work by pradel and raad 1993 the k values between boreholes and other locations were interpolated using kriging to construct a 3 d geological k field fig 5b with the same dimensions of the numerical model to be discussed in section 3 2 3 ht analysis method with the collected data during the four events simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle xiang et al 2009 combined with a 3 d transient groundwater flow finite element model vsaft3 srivastava and yeh 1992 were used to estimate the k and ss fields of the afp44 site in the following we briefly describe the simsle algorithm see also fig 6 for a flowchart of simsle and the model setups for the inversions of both field data and simulated data based on a synthetic aquifer 3 1 simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle the simsle algorithm is succeeded from successive linear estimator sle developed by yeh et al 1996 with the improvement that it simultaneously considers all events during an ht survey so that the resolution can be maximized in general sle or simsle is a successive bayesian linear estimator that optimizes the element wise hydraulic parameters k and ss conditioned on the observed drawdown time curves different from other inverse approaches sle conceptualizes the aquifer property e g k as a highly parameterized random field described by a prior geostatistical model sle estimates the conditional expectation of the parameter y e g n 1 element wise lnk with observed pressure responses d e g m 1 head change during the p t operation at the observation wells during an ht survey a kriging like stochastic linear estimator is used to include the observed information in which the nonlinear relationship between y and d is handled by a successive iteration scheme 1 y c r 1 y c r ω r t d d r where y c is the conditional expectation of y and d r is the simulated heads at the observation locations and times obtained from the forward model i e vsaft3 in this study using the parameters obtained at iteration r y r is given by the prior mean value the weighting coefficient matrix ω m n is calculated as 2 ε dd r ω r ε dy r where ε dd is the conditional auto covariance of observation data ε dy is the conditional cross covariance between parameter y and data d the levenberg marquardt algorithm pujol 2007 is used to stabilize the solution by expanding the diagonal elements of ε dd the covariances involved in eq 2 is given by the first order numerical approximation yeh and liu 2000 3 ε dd r j d r ε yy r j d r t ε dy r j d r ε yy r where j d m n is the sensitivity matrix of model predicted observation d with respect to the change of estimated parameters y at iteration r j d is obtained by adjoint state method pujol 2007 since it is computationally efficient in geostatistical inversion ε yy n n is the auto covariance of parameter y which is constructed by a geostatistical prior model with a description of mean variance correlation scales at r 0 and subsequently updated for r 0 via 4 ε yy r 1 ε yy r ω r t ε dy r the iteration process will be terminated if some conditions are met e g reaching the maximum iteration number of the mismatch between the simulated and observed head is small than a user specified value in summary simsle starts from some prior geostatistical information about the k and ss parameters mean y r 0 variance and correlation scales for constructing ε yy r 0 and then it assimilates the hydraulic head information in d gradually by iteratively updating the conditional mean y c as well as covariance functions a series of forward simulations relating d r and y r require calling vsaft3 3 2 setup of the numerical model the setup of the numerical analysis for vsaft3 including initial conditions boundary conditions and prior information for geostatistical inversion are described below a 4000 m 3000 m horizontal domain see fig 1 of the field site was discretized into 50 m 50 m elements because of the focus of the study was the saturated zone of the field site we ignored the vadose zone in this model and only a saturated zone of a total thickness of 85 m from the depth of the groundwater table 35 m to a depth of 120 m see fig 2 was considered this vertical saturated zone was discretized into 20 layers with variable grid sizes as a result the total element number of the entire simulation domain became 96 000 and the total node number was 103 761 notice that this grid was designed according to the spatial distribution of the well locations fig 1 vertical well screens fig 2 and the complexity of the geological structure fig 5 as such the simulated results would closely replicate the field situation while the computational resources and storage requirement for inverse modeling was affordable the initial condition was assumed hydrostatic prior to the beginning of the four events based on the regional flow pattern constant head boundary conditions were assigned to boundaries at y 0 and 3000 m while the left right top and bottom boundaries were treated as no flux boundaries since we used the head change with respect to the initial condition prior to each event as the observation in the inverse model the uncertainty in the initial condition and the value of the two constant head boundary conditions should not affect the ht estimates albeit the choice of no flux or constant head boundary could affect the inversion results but the effects on the inversion estimates would be limited to a narrow region along the boundary only and could be visually detected zha et al 2014 in order to use simsle the prior spatial statistics of the unknown lnk and lnss need to be specified according to zhang and brusseau 1999 the geometric mean of k was 3 m d and the mean ss was 1 5 10 4 m 1 the variance of lnk was set to be 1 0 and the variance of lnss is 0 5 although the variance values were uncertain they mainly affected the uncertainty estimation and had minor impacts on the parameter distributions the spatial correlation was assumed to be described by an exponential covariance function with correlation scales of 500 m 500 m and 3 m in x y and z directions for both lnk and lnss correlation scales represent the average size of the heterogeneity in three dimensions which were obtained from the variogram analysis of the borehole logs section 2 5 while these estimates were imprecise their effects on the ht estimate were overridden by the large number of hydraulic data from the ht survey which already carry information of the detailed site specific heterogeneity yeh and liu 2000 4 ht analysis of the field data several approaches were used to evaluate the results of the ht inversions first the calibration performance in ht simulated head change versus the observed data was used as a criterion that is a proper prior mean model leads to a small calibration error next we used two validation methods to further demonstrate the robustness of the ht estimates 1 the 3 d k tomogram from ht inversion with the uniform mean was visually compared with the 3 d geological model 2 the estimated k and ss values were used as input to predict the head changes in the observation wells during the period not used in the ht inversion 4 1 ht inversions based on different prior means to demonstrate the feasibility exploiting the field data collected from the p t as ht survey to characterize the aquifers we used the data sets from the selected four events to conduct ht inversions with different prior mean hydraulic parameter values based on geological information fig 6 and table 2 we first used uniform mean parameter values then we used kriged mean k values while keeping ss values uniform owing to difficulties in relating ss with geological borehole data lastly we executed ht inversion with mean values from a calibrated zonation model as the prior information the last inversion approach involved two steps at the first step a 3 d lithological or zonation model was obtained using a k means clustering approach elsheikh et al 2013 to create several zones based on the kriged k field fig 5b different numbers of zones nc were considered since the zones were defined based on the kriged field the zone pattern maintained the general spatial structure of the site geology afterward simsle adjusted the k and ss values for each zone to yield simulated heads that best matched the observed head data of the four events resultant k and ss values were the effective k and ss values of each zone which produced an unbiased general behavior ht head data this cluster approach in essence is a zonation approach during the second step the estimated parameter values of the zones were employed as an initial guess to recalibrate the model using simsle with a highly parameterized conceptual model previous studies suggest that the sequential estimation of k illman et al 2008 and the simultaneous estimation of k and ss zha et al 2017b in a highly parameterized model is very sensitive to the initial parameter values some inappropriate prior mean values may lead to spurious estimates since a zonation model is very easy to calibrate the zonal k and ss values serving as prior information may improve the ht estimates especially at locations where wells are sparse zhao and illman 2017 2018 1 results based on uniform means starting from uniform mean k and ss table 2 simsle yielded a low k zone in the southeast region x axis is to the north a thin low k zone in the middle of the aquifer 50 80 m pinching out in the north and west directions and a top low k zone see fig 7 a notice that vertical and horizontal axes are not to scale these results were consistent with the geological survey however the estimated ss pattern fig 7b was difficult to be related to geology at this site although illman et al 2009 showed that the estimated k and ss for a fractured geologic medium have a strong negative correlation for further comparison a scatterplot for lnk from ht versus that from geology is presented in fig 8 the index l1 1 116 indicated the magnitude of the average difference between geological and ht lnk the scatters in fig 8 suggested that lnk from ht using this approach had larger spatial variability than that of geology the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 0768 indicating that the heterogeneity mapped with ht explained little of the geological structure which is not surprising since the estimated k based on geological model at this kilometer scale site also contained large uncertainty the usefulness of geological information at a small scale site have been reported in zhao and illman 2017 2018 while it would be interesting to examine whether geological information at afp44 is helpful to ht similarly the head scatterplot fig 9 a simulated heads from the calibrated model vs the observed heads showed large scattering the mean absolute error l1 mean squared error l2 linear fitting formula as well as the red fitting line and the r2 value are also presented 2 results using kriged mean when a kriged k field based on geological borehole information and a uniform ss were used in the ht inversion the estimated k and ss values were similar to those from ht with uniform means not shown the estimated k also showed stratification and low k zones in the southeast region the detailed tomograms exhibited some differences especially in the northeast region where there are few observation wells the calibration performance was slightly better l2 0 038 than that using the uniform means 3 results using calibrated zonal mean values different from the highly parameterized conceptual model discussed above the zonation model with predefined geometry and layer locations assumed each layer to have uniform lnk and lnss values using the zonation model ht was applied to calibrate the values of the parameters for each layer for the two zone model nc 2 we obtained two effective lnk 0 54 and 0 02 m d see fig 10 a and two effective lnss values 1 2 10 4 and 9 1 10 4 1 m not shown since they were effective parameters for only two zones over the entire domain the best the calibration can do was to yield an unbiased but loose matches with the observed heads as reflected by a relatively large fitting error simulated head l2 value 2 4 m2 as the number of zones increased to 12 nc 12 see fig 10b for zones and lnk values the l2 value decreased to 1 2 m2 but the simulated heads still deviated from the observed heads noticeably the significant deviation was likely due to the predetermined zone geometries that were not adjusted during the calibration process such fixed zones led to unreasonable parameter estimates similar behavior was observed by zhao and illman 2017 2018 in their ht analyses of multiple pumping tests at a field site consisting of glaciofluvial sediments next we used the estimated parameter fields k and ss from the zonation approach i e fig 10 as prior mean values to calibrate a highly parameterized conceptual model i e without specifying the layer geometry apparently a highly parameterized model had more degrees of freedom than the zonation model to adjust the parameters so that the observed head data were better matched fig 11 the calibration performance l2 values of the inversion using different number of clusters as prior information is illustrated in fig 12 notice that the l2 decreased rapidly when the prior information based on nc 2 was used in comparison to that based on nc 1 afterward the prior information from increasing numbers of zones did not lead to significant decreases in l2 or improvement of the calibration this is possibly due to the fact that the prior information based on nc 2 had captured the large scale binary high k and low k information in part this is also due to the fact that all heads were depth averaged values over large screen intervals which smoothen out the pressure responses from detailed heterogeneity we also found that more accurate mean values of lnk and lnss improved the calibration result since the l2 of ht results with one calibrated zone was better than that with a guessed uniform mean black diamond in fig 12 this is likely attributed to the fact that the two step calibration approach provided more accurate mean ss compared to a guessed one in summary calibration of the p t data using a zonation model solely based on clustering of the geological model will lead to the loss of some important information about aquifer heterogeneity instead interpreting ht data based on a highly parameterized geostatistical model is most appropriate although a geological clustering model cannot fully interpret ht data the calibrated geological clustering model can be used as a prior mean for ht inversion and improve the results we therefore advocate calibrating a geological model as the first step and then using the calibrated result as the prior information of ht analysis may be the preferred procedure for ht inversion since it can improve the result outside the well field where the wells are sparse and preserve the connectivity of both high and low k zones 4 2 validation of ht results based on field data the estimated parameter fields by ht were further evaluated by their ability to predict independent datasets which were not used in the inversion since only four short term events were selected for model calibration the rest of the events from june 2014 to july 2015 were treated as independent events for the validation purpose due to similarity in validation results based on estimates from different calibration approaches only the validation of ht estimates based on uniform prior mean is presented here here we present two validation cases the first case as shown in fig 13 compared the predicted head changes red solid lines versus the true ones black solid lines induced by a short term event in jan 8 2015 which was not included in the ht inversion in general the predicted results captured the correct trend increase or decrease and the magnitude of the head changes moreover the two dashed lines in each subplot indicated the upper and lower bounds of the predicted head changes by adding or subtracting one standard deviation of the mean prediction the standard deviation of prediction was calculated using the sensitivity matrix and the residual covariance of the parameters based on a first order approximation the detailed formula can be found in wöhling et al 2016 zha et al 2017a it was found that the discrepancies between the prediction and the observation results were of the order of one standard deviation of prediction indicating a proper accounting of uncertainties in the field case the second result fig 14 presents the prediction of the long term head fluctuation starting from june 20th 2014 through july 13 2015 overall the prediction using the estimated parameters using uniform mean as prior information captured the short term head changes a temporal scale of 10 days induced by pumping and injection however the observed long term trend in some wells such as el4m m12b were not reproduced the long term head changes a temporal scale of 100 days may be caused by regional flow which was not considered in the conceptual model also unknown errors uncertainty in the pumping injection records as well as initial and boundary conditions could be the reasons 5 synthetic experiments in addition to the analysis of the afp44 field data groundwater variations of a synthetic aquifer in response to several shut down and resume events of a p t setup identical to that of affp44 were created the groundwater variations which carried non redundant information about the heterogeneity of the synthetic aquifer were used to demonstrate the benefits of additional events on the parameter estimation such a synthetic aquifer was necessary to simulate groundwater level responses of new events which were not available at the afp44 field site in addition the true parameter values of the synthetic aquifer were known exactly and the simulated groundwater responses were free of any error the improvements due to additional events thus can be unequivocally assured 5 1 synthetic ht investigation setups the numerical setup for the synthetic aquifer was the same as that for the field case with a uniform prior mean except that the observed head variations were simulated by the forward modeling using synthetic true heterogeneous parameter fields generated by a random field generator gutjahr 1989 these parameter fields had the same spatial statistics as that in the field data two scenarios were considered scenario 1 used the same four events to stress the aquifer as used in the field case scenario 2 considered additional six events which represented the shutdown of individual recharge well r2 r8 and r11 as event 5 6 and 7 respectively and extraction well e1 e7 and e13 as event 8 9 and 10 respectively in order to maintain the total pumping or extraction rate the changes in the rates were evenly distributed to the remaining pumping or injection wells 5 2 results of the synthetic investigation to demonstrate the usefulness of non redundant events for site characterization the statistical metrics l1 l2 r2 slope and intercept of the estimated lnk and lnss compared to their true values are listed in table 3 generally the results showed that k estimates were better than ss estimates i e r2 0 4557 of lnk versus r2 0 1079 of lnss for four events this corroborates the results by previous investigations wu et al 2005 which attributes to the fact that the ss is only sensitive to the early stage of a pumping test and early time data are often infested with noise including numerical errors most importantly these results indicate that more events lead to improvement of the inversion e g r2 0 4557 of lnk for four events versus r2 0 5667 for ten events this is consistent with the findings by yeh and liu 2000 and the explanation by zha et al 2015 about the non redundant information about the heterogeneity carried by the data from a hydraulic tomographic survey therefore the logic behind exploiting p t operations as a cost effective way to characterize the aquifer is further substantiated that is the characterization of a site can be improved with the collection of additional non redundant information using the same well facilities by alternating pumping and injection locations to alter the flow fields 6 summary conclusions and future work in this study we analyzed the one year hydraulic head responses collected at the afp44 site from 2014 to 2015 induced by the variations of pumping and injection rates due to shut down and resume events these variations of groundwater levels exhibited different patterns reflecting heterogeneous nature of the aquifer at this site we selected four events which likely carried non redundant information about aquifer heterogeneity through careful examination of p t rate records and the corresponding head changes these datasets were then analyzed using the geostatistical inverse code simsle to derive the spatial distribution of k and ss values these estimated fields corroborated well with the 3 d geological model to further improve these estimates several schemes for deriving prior mean k values while ss was treated to be constant for simsle were examined and their impacts on the estimates were studied in addition to the analysis of the field data we conducted two synthetic experiments one with four shutdown and resume events and the other ten events the two experiments had the same modeling setups as those of the field analysis except that the true hydraulic parameters and groundwater responses of the synthetic site were simulated and known exactly these two experiments were designed to demonstrate the usefulness of changing pumping and injection strategy for characterizing the aquifer based on the results of the study we reach the following conclusions 1 it is possible to characterize the hydraulic property heterogeneity at p t sites over several kilometers utilizing existing pumping injection and observation well network as large scale ht surveys 2 geological information used as prior information can improve the ht results compared to inversion using a uniform prior mean the inversion with kriged mean or pre calibrated zonal mean lead to better calibration performance and the inversed patterns are more geologically reasonable for afp44 sites pre calibrated zonal mean with approximately five zones resulted in the best calibration results 3 the results of the synthetic experiments confirmed that more events included in ht can improve the resolution of the estimates when the four events were increased to ten in ht inversion the r2 for lnk increased from 0 4557 to 0 5667 and that for lnss increased from 0 1079 to 0 3896 we emphasize the fact that no additional operational costs are required to create more events nevertheless changes in p t operational strategy often requires approval from site operators and regulators in practice a close collaboration between site management and regulators as well as a great appreciation among different stakeholders on how the different events can lead to useful hydrogeologic information are needed so that p t operations can be designed to be more effective than current practices with hundreds of p t sites across the u s the proposed method provides a cost effective way for contaminated site characterization using existing infrastructure and minimal disruption to normal site operation the pumping injection and head monitoring records at pump and treat sites provide a wealth of information on site hydrogeology that has largely been untapped many of these sites are under performance assessment for closure or transition a systematic review of the p t monitoring records is essential to guide such decision while using these records for ht will yield detailed hydraulic parameter distributions that can be used as evidence to support site management decisions future work at afp44 can include joint inversion of head data and other information such as detailed flowrate profiles li et al 2008 tso et al 2016 zha et al 2014 and geophysical

6515,pump and treat p t is a widely adopted technology for groundwater containment remediation over the past decades we have recognized that mapping aquifer heterogeneity especially the low hydraulic conductivity k zones has become an urgent need in remediation efforts meanwhile many studies have proved that hydraulic tomography ht utilizing groundwater responses from a series of cross hole pumping tests is a viable technology for detailing hydraulic heterogeneity high and low k zones of aquifers at a p t field site operation of pumping and injection wells often vary creating changes in flow fields analogous to those in ht surveys therefore collecting groundwater monitoring data and analyzing them is tantamount to a cost effective large scale ht survey during p t operations to demonstrate this idea water level data was collected at 41 wells for one year at the u s air force plant 44 afp44 p t site in tucson arizona where the pumping and injection rates of the p t system were changed many times during the year this dataset was analyzed with a geostatistical inverse model to estimate the hydraulic property distribution which can reasonably predict the pressure responses of the site under different conditions moreover we showed that large scale geological information built based on 245 borehole logs at the site could improve the model calibration performance through a two step calibration procedure additionally we used synthetic experiments to verify that the use of a larger variety of p t configurations can yield non redundant ht information and enhance site characterization overall we demonstrated that the proper scheduling of pumping and injection operations at a p t site and collecting corresponding groundwater responses are equivalent to conducting a large scale ht survey with minimal additional costs keywords hydraulic tomography inverse modeling heterogeneity pump and treat operation geological borehole log 1 introduction pump and treat p t has been widely adopted as a viable technique for containment cleanup of deep i e 50 ft below ground surface and widespread groundwater contamination hoffman 1993 as well as controlling off site migration of a contaminant plume this technique employs an array of pumping wells to extract the contaminated water for treatment the treated water is either re injected into the subsurface or is discharged to local public water networks over the past decades experience indicates that the effectiveness of p t projects has been compromised by many physical and chemical factors voudrias 2001 for instance the breakthrough of contaminant concentrations at many p t sites including the u s air force plant 44 hereinafter denoted as afp44 zhang and brusseau 1999 often exhibit tailing and rebound tailing refers to the progressively slower rate of contaminant extraction during p t operation and the concentration at extraction wells remains above cleanup standards after a long period of p t operation moreover at many cleaned up sites once the extraction is terminated concentrations rebound to high levels for this reason many p t sites in the united states although operated for more than fifteen years are now undergoing re evaluation epa 2007 2000 urs 2014 2013a and some are even in the process of considering a technical impracticability waiver option malcolm pirnie 2002 the national research council 2013 2004 further concluded that the goal of complete restoration of contaminated groundwater at a substantial number of sites is unlikely achievable for many decades although various chemical and physical factors e g rate limited desorption slow dissolution of the immiscible liquid saturation zhang and brusseau 1999 may contribute to the ineffectiveness of p t the difficulty in characterizing the site specific hydrogeology has been considered as the major reason for example considering aquifer heterogeneity in the numerical simulations lee et al 2000 showed that low conductivity zones trap significant mass of pollutants and later release them into the groundwater system using experiments and a mathematical model voudrias 2001 demonstrated that p t is prohibitively expensive for groundwater remediation in a heterogeneous aquifer if the design of p t operations ignore heterogeneity similarly gungor demirci and aksoy 2011 employed stochastic analysis to investigate the influences of contrast and layering and stratification of hydraulic conductivity k on p t remediation period they concluded that the distributions of low and high k zones can significantly impact the time to compliance they also showed that using a large number of extraction wells with small rates is more effective than using a few wells with large rates enormous efforts have also been devoted to developing strategies to minimize the cost of the operation of p t at remediation sites chang et al 2007 huang and mayer 1997 e g kuo et al 1992 sharief et al 2012 these studies also emphasized the importance of site specific heterogeneity in particular mckinney and lin 1996 reported that aquifer heterogeneity dictates the design of pumping locations and rates huang and mayer 1997 suggested that pumping wells should be located along the centerline of the contaminant plumes and high k zones cohen et al 1994 stressed that p t operations need to monitor and evaluate groundwater flow direction well capture zones and contaminant migration which also are controlled by heterogeneity a smart p t in which a detailed characterization of the geology hydrology and chemistry is considered was suggested by hoffman 1993 while many aquifer characterization methods are available hydraulic tomography ht is a recently developed technology for mapping detailed aquifer heterogeneity xiang et al 2009 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 it fuses hydraulic responses from multiple aquifer tests this technique has been proven to be robust through numerous numerical mao et al 2013 zha et al 2015 2014 laboratory illman et al 2012 2015 sharmeen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 and field studies berg and illman 2011 hochstetler et al 2015 illman et al 2009 straface et al 2007 wang et al 2016 zha et al 2016 in particular kuhlman et al 2008 showed that an ht survey is an effective strategy for incorporating data from potentially disparate aquifer tests into a basin wide aquifer property estimate nevertheless the cost of conducting an ht survey is usually high due to well installation and operation of cross hole pumping tests however illman et al 2012 articulated that the cost of conducting an ht survey was comparable to the detailed characterization of heterogeneity using a large number of core samples at remediation sites many pumping and injection and monitoring wells have already been installed pumping injection flow rates are recorded and groundwater levels are often monitored thus it is logical to take advantage of the vast amount of existing facilities and datasets to characterize the aquifers and aquitards at p t sites regrettably these ideas are rarely exploited except in the pioneering work by tiedeman et al 2010 in which the hydraulic signals induced by the temporary shutdown of individual pumping wells of the p t system were interpreted using an inverse model nevertheless the equivalence between intermittent shutdown and resumption of different p t wells and its application to ht analysis is rarely recognized in effect the effectiveness of ht rests upon the new information about heterogeneity engrained in observed groundwater levels from the change in flow fields induced by pumping at different locations intermittent shutdown and resumption of different pumping and injection wells at a p t site alters the large scale flow fields at the site thus exploiting the aquifer responses during p t operations is identical to a large scale ht survey at the site thus a proper analysis of these groundwater responses could yield more detailed information about the heterogeneity at a p t site than model calibration without considering the changes in flow fields for this reason we promote a paradigm shift of aquifer characterization strategies towards using existing facilities and data during p t to improve the site characterization as advocated in yeh and lee 2007 it is time to change the way we collect and analyze data for aquifer characterization in addition to groundwater level data p t sites usually have abundant borehole log data which can provide stratigraphic information on subsurface structure while borehole data provide a qualitative description of soil texture rather than quantitative values of hydraulic properties using the general framework of incorporating geological information into ht as proposed in zha et al 2017b we believe that these qualitative data can further enhance the ht result in particular inclusion of geological data in ht has shown to significantly improve ht results through both sandbox zhao et al 2016 luo et al 2017 and field studies zhao and illman 2017 2018 however the number of classifications is also crucial when geological information serves as prior information without consideration of zones or facies may ignore some important large scale structure information while a large number of them may fail to accurately convert the indirect geological information to direct hydraulic values due to high dimensional parameter space issue zhang et al 2016 the optimal number of zones used in the prior model for ht investigation at p t sites needs further investigation following the thoughts discussed above the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using datasets from p t operation as ht to enhance site characterization for this purpose with the project support mok et al 2017 by the environmental security technology certification program estcp groundwater responses were collected at the afp44 p t site in tucson az over a year where many pumping and extraction wells were shut down and restarted intermittently for maintenance and other reasons in addition geological borehole log data from 245 boreholes at the site were acquired with these datasets the study intends to demonstrate that the head responses induced by the changes in pumping and injection rates at the afp44 site contain valuable information about both aquifer and aquitard heterogeneity proper analysis of the datasets using a highly parameterized geostatistical inverse model with the aid of the available geological information from the boreholes could yield high resolution maps of hydraulic parameters such as k and specific storage ss of the field site the paper is organized as follows the data of afp44 site used in this study including site information observation wells pumping and injection activities and geological information are presented in section 2 section 3 briefly presents the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle for analyzing the data sets section 4 details the setup for inverse modeling of the field data the use of prior geological information the results of the investigation for the field data and their validations experiments using a synthetic aquifer are presented in section 5 to emphasize the need to consider additional head datasets which carry non redundant information about the heterogeneity and can be acquired by changing the flow field using existing well facilities conclusions of the study are then summarized in section 6 2 site and dataset description 2 1 site information the afp44 site is a superfund site in tucson az designated by the u s environmental protection agency the site is located at the southernmost portion of the tucson international airport fig 1 the afp44 site has a history of trichloroethylene tce and 1 4 dioxane contamination in both the saturated and unsaturated zones the regional aquifer p t system has been in operation since 1987 and the total pumping rate has been maintained at 9000 m3 d a brief history of the afp44 site and a chronology of events can be found on the arizona department of environmental quality adeq s website https azdeq gov superfund site us air force plant 44 throughout more than thirty years of site s history numerous site investigations have been conducted by the usgs hanson and benedict 1994 houser et al 2004 program et al 2009 and various consultants aecom 2012 2011 e g 2010 urs 2014 2013b 2013a resulting in a large number of wells being installed these previous investigations have generally suggested that the regional groundwater flow direction is to the northwest as shown in fig 1 where the dashed rectangle is the domain of this study a schematic illustration of the geology and well screen intervals at the site are displayed in fig 2 generally speaking a confining unit separates the local upper zone uz aquifer and the regional lower zone lz aquifer brusseau et al 2013 matthieu et al 2014 with the latter supplying municipal water to the city of tucson the uz and the lz aquifers have been considered to have a negligible hydraulic connection the uz aquifer where most contaminants reside were subdivided into an upper unit uzuu and a lower unit uzlu by a thin aquitard pinching out to the northwest of afp44 however the location of the pinch out the lateral extent of the aquitard and hydraulic exchange between uzuu and uzlu are largely uncertain 2 2 observation wells and monitoring activity from june 20 2014 to july 13 2015 we installed 41 pressure transducers in an array of selected monitoring wells at afp44 the water levels at the wells were continuously recorded at two minute intervals these groundwater levels were also verified by a water level sounder at selected time and locations fig 1 shows a map of the extraction recharge and observation yellow circles green circles and black dots labeled by e r and m respectively well locations relevant to this study 2 3 pumping and injection events examination of pumping and injection records indicated three main types of events contributing to head changes 1 system shutdown and resumption 2 changes in pumping or injection operations and 3 fluctuation of flow rates see fig 3 the site did not have any storage facility for treated groundwater so that the total injection rate equals the total pumping rate plus leakage loss the site management only had control of on off of injection wells the injection system was gravitationally driven and had no flow rate controls as a result more conductive injection wells tend to have higher rates table 1 listed the average pumping and injection rates for the pumping and injection wells during the monitoring period it was found that wells r9 r2 r8 r5 and r4 are responsible for approximately 80 of the total injection rate in contrast the pumping rates among the extraction wells except wells e2 and e6 are relatively even our record indicated that several system shutdowns took place during the monitoring period the longest one occurred on june 12th 2015 or t 360 days on the time axis of fig 3 and lasted for approximately two weeks it also showed several events of shutdown and recovery of some individual wells for example e 13 reduced its pumping from 1600 m3 d to 500 m3 d on july 15th 2014 t 40 days also the site operation had adopted a new injection strategy on august 15th 2014 t 75 days such that r11 r18 and r20 were turned off while r3 r4 and r5 were turned on finally e1 the pumping well located at the center of the site was turned off until july 7th 2015 t 390 days when the pumping resumed on june 30th 2015 t 380 days 2 4 observations of head change 2 4 1 long term behavior the relative hydraulic head fluctuations of the 31 wells during the monitoring period june 2014 to july 2015 are plotted in fig 13 as black lines they revealed significant differences at different wells indicative of the complex geological heterogeneity at the site some monitoring wells were noticeably influenced by pumping wells for instance the wells m108 m110 m119 m121 m122 and m67 exhibited large head increases due to system shutdown these wells except m67 are close to pumping wells e 1 e 2 and the screen intervals of these wells are below the pinch out aquitard fig 2 on the other hand wells such as r3m r4m r5m and r11m which served as recharge and monitoring wells and the monitoring well m6 close to recharge wells were very responsive to injection rate changes in addition we notice that a large number of monitoring wells did not respond to the rate changes of pumping or injection these wells are either completed in shallow wells with short screen intervals e g p2 p3 p4 p6 p7 p10 s33 b1 and b3 in the uzuu or deep wells el4m and m12b in the lower zone notice that although these shallow and deep wells did not respond to the variation in pumping and injection they exhibited a long term increasing trend in the head this trend may be related to regional groundwater flow 2 4 2 short term head change behavior we have also investigated the head changes over a short time period 10 days of the observation wells the head changes at most wells exhibited almost identical patterns for all the system shutdown resume events not shown such a similarity indicated that these head responses over the multiple system shutdown resume events likely do not carry new information about heterogeneity head changes head at t 10 d after the event minus the head at the beginning of the event at some observation wells which carry non redundant information for the ht inversion are shown in fig 4 a d and they are discussed below according to four different p t events event 1 on april 6th 2015 the entire system was shut down the hydraulic heads at recharge wells r3m r4m r5m etc declined significantly fig 4a heads at monitoring wells m81 m6 m107 showed mild decreases indicative of greater influences by recharge than by pumping since they were close to the recharge wells on the other hand m108 m121 m110 m119 m122 and m67 indicated significant rises of the head during the shutdown suggesting that they were well connected to or close to the pumping wells m105 m104 m102 m100 m96 m97 m98 m93 m94 and m95 showed moderate increases of heads on the other hand some observation wells like b1 b3 r11m m69 s33 m73 m76 m120 m12b e3m el4m m107 m109 p2 p7 and p10 were insensitive to the shutdown event 2 on july 16th 2014 the pumping rate of e 13 decreased from 1600 m3 d to 500 m3 d and the pumping rates of e 4 and e 8 increased slightly these changes led to notable raises of heads in some wells fig 4b such as m105 m101 m104 m102 and r3m descending order in terms of responses other wells e g m118 m77 and m81 had moderate increases about 0 3 m some wells e g m119 r4 and r5 had small increases or even decreases in the head it is interesting to point out that although m119 and some wells had large responses during the system shutdown they were not sensitive to the rate change at e 13 well in other words head change record of event 2 clearly revealed hydraulic connectivity information between e 13 and observation wells event 3 on november 24th 2014 e23 was turned off and the pumping rates of e1 e13 were increased slightly and the recharge rates at all the recharge wells were reduced moderately according to fig 4c m122 and r11m were apparently connected to well e23 this observation is different from that in the events related to e13 event 2 meaning that this event can provide new information about the hydraulic connections between wells event 4 on may 20th 2015 e 6 was shut down and e 24 was turned on albeit the head changes at the observation wells see fig 4d were small ranging from 0 4 to 0 2 m they still can be used to infer the relative impacts of the event for instance m12a which is close to e24 was influenced by the restart of e24 and had a significant decrease of head in comparison with those of other wells 2 5 detailed 3 d geological map to obtain a complete list of borehole logs we have synthesized and reconciled information from several key data sources earth tech 2007 hydrogeologic 2012 montgomery associates 2015 fig 5 a shows the location and profile of the 245 geological boreholes notice that some of them are out of the model domain or completely in the vadose zone each borehole log contains the borehole name locations elevation of the ground the depth of the screen intervals and the corresponding unified soil classification system uscs codes these codes were simplified into 12 classifications zhang and brusseau 1999 and we assigned each of the 12 classifications a k value according to the chart in fig 13 of the work by pradel and raad 1993 the k values between boreholes and other locations were interpolated using kriging to construct a 3 d geological k field fig 5b with the same dimensions of the numerical model to be discussed in section 3 2 3 ht analysis method with the collected data during the four events simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle xiang et al 2009 combined with a 3 d transient groundwater flow finite element model vsaft3 srivastava and yeh 1992 were used to estimate the k and ss fields of the afp44 site in the following we briefly describe the simsle algorithm see also fig 6 for a flowchart of simsle and the model setups for the inversions of both field data and simulated data based on a synthetic aquifer 3 1 simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle the simsle algorithm is succeeded from successive linear estimator sle developed by yeh et al 1996 with the improvement that it simultaneously considers all events during an ht survey so that the resolution can be maximized in general sle or simsle is a successive bayesian linear estimator that optimizes the element wise hydraulic parameters k and ss conditioned on the observed drawdown time curves different from other inverse approaches sle conceptualizes the aquifer property e g k as a highly parameterized random field described by a prior geostatistical model sle estimates the conditional expectation of the parameter y e g n 1 element wise lnk with observed pressure responses d e g m 1 head change during the p t operation at the observation wells during an ht survey a kriging like stochastic linear estimator is used to include the observed information in which the nonlinear relationship between y and d is handled by a successive iteration scheme 1 y c r 1 y c r ω r t d d r where y c is the conditional expectation of y and d r is the simulated heads at the observation locations and times obtained from the forward model i e vsaft3 in this study using the parameters obtained at iteration r y r is given by the prior mean value the weighting coefficient matrix ω m n is calculated as 2 ε dd r ω r ε dy r where ε dd is the conditional auto covariance of observation data ε dy is the conditional cross covariance between parameter y and data d the levenberg marquardt algorithm pujol 2007 is used to stabilize the solution by expanding the diagonal elements of ε dd the covariances involved in eq 2 is given by the first order numerical approximation yeh and liu 2000 3 ε dd r j d r ε yy r j d r t ε dy r j d r ε yy r where j d m n is the sensitivity matrix of model predicted observation d with respect to the change of estimated parameters y at iteration r j d is obtained by adjoint state method pujol 2007 since it is computationally efficient in geostatistical inversion ε yy n n is the auto covariance of parameter y which is constructed by a geostatistical prior model with a description of mean variance correlation scales at r 0 and subsequently updated for r 0 via 4 ε yy r 1 ε yy r ω r t ε dy r the iteration process will be terminated if some conditions are met e g reaching the maximum iteration number of the mismatch between the simulated and observed head is small than a user specified value in summary simsle starts from some prior geostatistical information about the k and ss parameters mean y r 0 variance and correlation scales for constructing ε yy r 0 and then it assimilates the hydraulic head information in d gradually by iteratively updating the conditional mean y c as well as covariance functions a series of forward simulations relating d r and y r require calling vsaft3 3 2 setup of the numerical model the setup of the numerical analysis for vsaft3 including initial conditions boundary conditions and prior information for geostatistical inversion are described below a 4000 m 3000 m horizontal domain see fig 1 of the field site was discretized into 50 m 50 m elements because of the focus of the study was the saturated zone of the field site we ignored the vadose zone in this model and only a saturated zone of a total thickness of 85 m from the depth of the groundwater table 35 m to a depth of 120 m see fig 2 was considered this vertical saturated zone was discretized into 20 layers with variable grid sizes as a result the total element number of the entire simulation domain became 96 000 and the total node number was 103 761 notice that this grid was designed according to the spatial distribution of the well locations fig 1 vertical well screens fig 2 and the complexity of the geological structure fig 5 as such the simulated results would closely replicate the field situation while the computational resources and storage requirement for inverse modeling was affordable the initial condition was assumed hydrostatic prior to the beginning of the four events based on the regional flow pattern constant head boundary conditions were assigned to boundaries at y 0 and 3000 m while the left right top and bottom boundaries were treated as no flux boundaries since we used the head change with respect to the initial condition prior to each event as the observation in the inverse model the uncertainty in the initial condition and the value of the two constant head boundary conditions should not affect the ht estimates albeit the choice of no flux or constant head boundary could affect the inversion results but the effects on the inversion estimates would be limited to a narrow region along the boundary only and could be visually detected zha et al 2014 in order to use simsle the prior spatial statistics of the unknown lnk and lnss need to be specified according to zhang and brusseau 1999 the geometric mean of k was 3 m d and the mean ss was 1 5 10 4 m 1 the variance of lnk was set to be 1 0 and the variance of lnss is 0 5 although the variance values were uncertain they mainly affected the uncertainty estimation and had minor impacts on the parameter distributions the spatial correlation was assumed to be described by an exponential covariance function with correlation scales of 500 m 500 m and 3 m in x y and z directions for both lnk and lnss correlation scales represent the average size of the heterogeneity in three dimensions which were obtained from the variogram analysis of the borehole logs section 2 5 while these estimates were imprecise their effects on the ht estimate were overridden by the large number of hydraulic data from the ht survey which already carry information of the detailed site specific heterogeneity yeh and liu 2000 4 ht analysis of the field data several approaches were used to evaluate the results of the ht inversions first the calibration performance in ht simulated head change versus the observed data was used as a criterion that is a proper prior mean model leads to a small calibration error next we used two validation methods to further demonstrate the robustness of the ht estimates 1 the 3 d k tomogram from ht inversion with the uniform mean was visually compared with the 3 d geological model 2 the estimated k and ss values were used as input to predict the head changes in the observation wells during the period not used in the ht inversion 4 1 ht inversions based on different prior means to demonstrate the feasibility exploiting the field data collected from the p t as ht survey to characterize the aquifers we used the data sets from the selected four events to conduct ht inversions with different prior mean hydraulic parameter values based on geological information fig 6 and table 2 we first used uniform mean parameter values then we used kriged mean k values while keeping ss values uniform owing to difficulties in relating ss with geological borehole data lastly we executed ht inversion with mean values from a calibrated zonation model as the prior information the last inversion approach involved two steps at the first step a 3 d lithological or zonation model was obtained using a k means clustering approach elsheikh et al 2013 to create several zones based on the kriged k field fig 5b different numbers of zones nc were considered since the zones were defined based on the kriged field the zone pattern maintained the general spatial structure of the site geology afterward simsle adjusted the k and ss values for each zone to yield simulated heads that best matched the observed head data of the four events resultant k and ss values were the effective k and ss values of each zone which produced an unbiased general behavior ht head data this cluster approach in essence is a zonation approach during the second step the estimated parameter values of the zones were employed as an initial guess to recalibrate the model using simsle with a highly parameterized conceptual model previous studies suggest that the sequential estimation of k illman et al 2008 and the simultaneous estimation of k and ss zha et al 2017b in a highly parameterized model is very sensitive to the initial parameter values some inappropriate prior mean values may lead to spurious estimates since a zonation model is very easy to calibrate the zonal k and ss values serving as prior information may improve the ht estimates especially at locations where wells are sparse zhao and illman 2017 2018 1 results based on uniform means starting from uniform mean k and ss table 2 simsle yielded a low k zone in the southeast region x axis is to the north a thin low k zone in the middle of the aquifer 50 80 m pinching out in the north and west directions and a top low k zone see fig 7 a notice that vertical and horizontal axes are not to scale these results were consistent with the geological survey however the estimated ss pattern fig 7b was difficult to be related to geology at this site although illman et al 2009 showed that the estimated k and ss for a fractured geologic medium have a strong negative correlation for further comparison a scatterplot for lnk from ht versus that from geology is presented in fig 8 the index l1 1 116 indicated the magnitude of the average difference between geological and ht lnk the scatters in fig 8 suggested that lnk from ht using this approach had larger spatial variability than that of geology the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 0768 indicating that the heterogeneity mapped with ht explained little of the geological structure which is not surprising since the estimated k based on geological model at this kilometer scale site also contained large uncertainty the usefulness of geological information at a small scale site have been reported in zhao and illman 2017 2018 while it would be interesting to examine whether geological information at afp44 is helpful to ht similarly the head scatterplot fig 9 a simulated heads from the calibrated model vs the observed heads showed large scattering the mean absolute error l1 mean squared error l2 linear fitting formula as well as the red fitting line and the r2 value are also presented 2 results using kriged mean when a kriged k field based on geological borehole information and a uniform ss were used in the ht inversion the estimated k and ss values were similar to those from ht with uniform means not shown the estimated k also showed stratification and low k zones in the southeast region the detailed tomograms exhibited some differences especially in the northeast region where there are few observation wells the calibration performance was slightly better l2 0 038 than that using the uniform means 3 results using calibrated zonal mean values different from the highly parameterized conceptual model discussed above the zonation model with predefined geometry and layer locations assumed each layer to have uniform lnk and lnss values using the zonation model ht was applied to calibrate the values of the parameters for each layer for the two zone model nc 2 we obtained two effective lnk 0 54 and 0 02 m d see fig 10 a and two effective lnss values 1 2 10 4 and 9 1 10 4 1 m not shown since they were effective parameters for only two zones over the entire domain the best the calibration can do was to yield an unbiased but loose matches with the observed heads as reflected by a relatively large fitting error simulated head l2 value 2 4 m2 as the number of zones increased to 12 nc 12 see fig 10b for zones and lnk values the l2 value decreased to 1 2 m2 but the simulated heads still deviated from the observed heads noticeably the significant deviation was likely due to the predetermined zone geometries that were not adjusted during the calibration process such fixed zones led to unreasonable parameter estimates similar behavior was observed by zhao and illman 2017 2018 in their ht analyses of multiple pumping tests at a field site consisting of glaciofluvial sediments next we used the estimated parameter fields k and ss from the zonation approach i e fig 10 as prior mean values to calibrate a highly parameterized conceptual model i e without specifying the layer geometry apparently a highly parameterized model had more degrees of freedom than the zonation model to adjust the parameters so that the observed head data were better matched fig 11 the calibration performance l2 values of the inversion using different number of clusters as prior information is illustrated in fig 12 notice that the l2 decreased rapidly when the prior information based on nc 2 was used in comparison to that based on nc 1 afterward the prior information from increasing numbers of zones did not lead to significant decreases in l2 or improvement of the calibration this is possibly due to the fact that the prior information based on nc 2 had captured the large scale binary high k and low k information in part this is also due to the fact that all heads were depth averaged values over large screen intervals which smoothen out the pressure responses from detailed heterogeneity we also found that more accurate mean values of lnk and lnss improved the calibration result since the l2 of ht results with one calibrated zone was better than that with a guessed uniform mean black diamond in fig 12 this is likely attributed to the fact that the two step calibration approach provided more accurate mean ss compared to a guessed one in summary calibration of the p t data using a zonation model solely based on clustering of the geological model will lead to the loss of some important information about aquifer heterogeneity instead interpreting ht data based on a highly parameterized geostatistical model is most appropriate although a geological clustering model cannot fully interpret ht data the calibrated geological clustering model can be used as a prior mean for ht inversion and improve the results we therefore advocate calibrating a geological model as the first step and then using the calibrated result as the prior information of ht analysis may be the preferred procedure for ht inversion since it can improve the result outside the well field where the wells are sparse and preserve the connectivity of both high and low k zones 4 2 validation of ht results based on field data the estimated parameter fields by ht were further evaluated by their ability to predict independent datasets which were not used in the inversion since only four short term events were selected for model calibration the rest of the events from june 2014 to july 2015 were treated as independent events for the validation purpose due to similarity in validation results based on estimates from different calibration approaches only the validation of ht estimates based on uniform prior mean is presented here here we present two validation cases the first case as shown in fig 13 compared the predicted head changes red solid lines versus the true ones black solid lines induced by a short term event in jan 8 2015 which was not included in the ht inversion in general the predicted results captured the correct trend increase or decrease and the magnitude of the head changes moreover the two dashed lines in each subplot indicated the upper and lower bounds of the predicted head changes by adding or subtracting one standard deviation of the mean prediction the standard deviation of prediction was calculated using the sensitivity matrix and the residual covariance of the parameters based on a first order approximation the detailed formula can be found in wöhling et al 2016 zha et al 2017a it was found that the discrepancies between the prediction and the observation results were of the order of one standard deviation of prediction indicating a proper accounting of uncertainties in the field case the second result fig 14 presents the prediction of the long term head fluctuation starting from june 20th 2014 through july 13 2015 overall the prediction using the estimated parameters using uniform mean as prior information captured the short term head changes a temporal scale of 10 days induced by pumping and injection however the observed long term trend in some wells such as el4m m12b were not reproduced the long term head changes a temporal scale of 100 days may be caused by regional flow which was not considered in the conceptual model also unknown errors uncertainty in the pumping injection records as well as initial and boundary conditions could be the reasons 5 synthetic experiments in addition to the analysis of the afp44 field data groundwater variations of a synthetic aquifer in response to several shut down and resume events of a p t setup identical to that of affp44 were created the groundwater variations which carried non redundant information about the heterogeneity of the synthetic aquifer were used to demonstrate the benefits of additional events on the parameter estimation such a synthetic aquifer was necessary to simulate groundwater level responses of new events which were not available at the afp44 field site in addition the true parameter values of the synthetic aquifer were known exactly and the simulated groundwater responses were free of any error the improvements due to additional events thus can be unequivocally assured 5 1 synthetic ht investigation setups the numerical setup for the synthetic aquifer was the same as that for the field case with a uniform prior mean except that the observed head variations were simulated by the forward modeling using synthetic true heterogeneous parameter fields generated by a random field generator gutjahr 1989 these parameter fields had the same spatial statistics as that in the field data two scenarios were considered scenario 1 used the same four events to stress the aquifer as used in the field case scenario 2 considered additional six events which represented the shutdown of individual recharge well r2 r8 and r11 as event 5 6 and 7 respectively and extraction well e1 e7 and e13 as event 8 9 and 10 respectively in order to maintain the total pumping or extraction rate the changes in the rates were evenly distributed to the remaining pumping or injection wells 5 2 results of the synthetic investigation to demonstrate the usefulness of non redundant events for site characterization the statistical metrics l1 l2 r2 slope and intercept of the estimated lnk and lnss compared to their true values are listed in table 3 generally the results showed that k estimates were better than ss estimates i e r2 0 4557 of lnk versus r2 0 1079 of lnss for four events this corroborates the results by previous investigations wu et al 2005 which attributes to the fact that the ss is only sensitive to the early stage of a pumping test and early time data are often infested with noise including numerical errors most importantly these results indicate that more events lead to improvement of the inversion e g r2 0 4557 of lnk for four events versus r2 0 5667 for ten events this is consistent with the findings by yeh and liu 2000 and the explanation by zha et al 2015 about the non redundant information about the heterogeneity carried by the data from a hydraulic tomographic survey therefore the logic behind exploiting p t operations as a cost effective way to characterize the aquifer is further substantiated that is the characterization of a site can be improved with the collection of additional non redundant information using the same well facilities by alternating pumping and injection locations to alter the flow fields 6 summary conclusions and future work in this study we analyzed the one year hydraulic head responses collected at the afp44 site from 2014 to 2015 induced by the variations of pumping and injection rates due to shut down and resume events these variations of groundwater levels exhibited different patterns reflecting heterogeneous nature of the aquifer at this site we selected four events which likely carried non redundant information about aquifer heterogeneity through careful examination of p t rate records and the corresponding head changes these datasets were then analyzed using the geostatistical inverse code simsle to derive the spatial distribution of k and ss values these estimated fields corroborated well with the 3 d geological model to further improve these estimates several schemes for deriving prior mean k values while ss was treated to be constant for simsle were examined and their impacts on the estimates were studied in addition to the analysis of the field data we conducted two synthetic experiments one with four shutdown and resume events and the other ten events the two experiments had the same modeling setups as those of the field analysis except that the true hydraulic parameters and groundwater responses of the synthetic site were simulated and known exactly these two experiments were designed to demonstrate the usefulness of changing pumping and injection strategy for characterizing the aquifer based on the results of the study we reach the following conclusions 1 it is possible to characterize the hydraulic property heterogeneity at p t sites over several kilometers utilizing existing pumping injection and observation well network as large scale ht surveys 2 geological information used as prior information can improve the ht results compared to inversion using a uniform prior mean the inversion with kriged mean or pre calibrated zonal mean lead to better calibration performance and the inversed patterns are more geologically reasonable for afp44 sites pre calibrated zonal mean with approximately five zones resulted in the best calibration results 3 the results of the synthetic experiments confirmed that more events included in ht can improve the resolution of the estimates when the four events were increased to ten in ht inversion the r2 for lnk increased from 0 4557 to 0 5667 and that for lnss increased from 0 1079 to 0 3896 we emphasize the fact that no additional operational costs are required to create more events nevertheless changes in p t operational strategy often requires approval from site operators and regulators in practice a close collaboration between site management and regulators as well as a great appreciation among different stakeholders on how the different events can lead to useful hydrogeologic information are needed so that p t operations can be designed to be more effective than current practices with hundreds of p t sites across the u s the proposed method provides a cost effective way for contaminated site characterization using existing infrastructure and minimal disruption to normal site operation the pumping injection and head monitoring records at pump and treat sites provide a wealth of information on site hydrogeology that has largely been untapped many of these sites are under performance assessment for closure or transition a systematic review of the p t monitoring records is essential to guide such decision while using these records for ht will yield detailed hydraulic parameter distributions that can be used as evidence to support site management decisions future work at afp44 can include joint inversion of head data and other information such as detailed flowrate profiles li et al 2008 tso et al 2016 zha et al 2014 and geophysical

6516,this work investigates the potential of using the bayesian based model conditional processor mcp for complementing satellite precipitation products with a rainfall dataset derived from satellite soil moisture observations mcp which is a bayesian inversion approach was originally developed for predictive uncertainty estimates of water level and discharge to support real time flood forecasting it is applied here for the first time to precipitation to provide its probability distribution conditional on multiple satellite precipitation estimates derived from trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis real time product v 7 0 3b42rt and the soil moisture based rainfall product sm2rain cci in mcp 3b42rt and sm2rain cci represent a priori information predictors about the true precipitation predictand and are used to provide its real time a posteriori probabilistic estimate by means of the bayes theorem mcp is tested across italy during a 6 year period 2010 2015 at daily 0 25 deg temporal spatial scale results demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides rainfall estimates that are superior to both 3b42rt as well as its successor imerg early run and sm2rain cci in terms of both median bias random errors and categorical scores the study confirms that satellite soil moisture derived rainfall can provide valuable information for improving state of the art satellite precipitation products thus making them more attractive for water resource management and large scale flood forecasting applications keywords rainfall soil moisture predictive uncertainty water resource management 1 introduction accurate quantitative precipitation estimation is of great importance for water resources management agricultural planning and monitoring forecasting of natural hazards such as floods drought and landslides in situ observations are limited around the earth especially in remote areas kidd et al 2017 thus satellite precipitation products spps are often the only alternative for applications however their accuracy depends upon many factors ebert et al 2007 i e type of storms temporal sampling season etc thus limiting their real utility traditional spps sense cloud properties to retrieve instantaneous rainfall estimates by combining a range of observations from geostationary geo and low earth orbiting leo satellites rainfall can be inferred from different sensors i visible images since thick clouds that are more likely to be associated with rainfall tend to be brighter than the surface ii infrared ir radiances since heavier rain tends to be associated with larger and taller clouds with colder tops iii passive microwave pmw as radiation and scattering caused by precipitating ice particles lead to a decrease in the signal during the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the global precipitation mission gpm eras e g hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2007 several techniques have been developed to take advantage of the synergy between pmw observations derived from polar orbiting satellites infrequent more direct and ir radiances derived from geo observations more frequent but less direct in particular gpm has brought a significant advancement in the measurement of precipitation from space thanks to a new dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and a more accurate radiometer which are used to intercalibrate observations coming from a constellation of sensors chiaravalloti et al 2018 gaona et al 2016 he et al 2017 liu 2016 prakash et al 2016 tan et al 2017 tang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 state of the art spps rely upon combinations of instantaneous observations of precipitation and thus are inherently affected by sampling errors behrangi and yixin 2017 due to the intermittent nature of rainfall and its high temporal and spatial variability these errors can translate into significant biases and missed precipitation events ciabatta et al 2016 which may impact their skills in operational applications like flood forecasting habib et al 2009 maggioni and massari 2018 common bias correction methods only adjust the total rainfall volume and may result in underestimation or overestimation of instantaneous precipitation aghakouchak et al 2012 as spps show strong dependence of the error on rain rate maggioni et al 2016 recent studies have proposed to use satellite soil moisture observations for correcting spps camici et al 2017 ciabatta et al 2015 crow et al 2009 2011 pellarin et al 2008 2013 wanders et al 2015 zhan et al 2015 the underlying idea is that soil moisture can be used as a trace of precipitation as after a rain event it can persist from a few hours to several days in other words soil moisture is informative of the amount of water stored in the soil after a rainfall event which can be exploited to retrieve information on the fallen precipitation on this basis the sm2rain method developed by brocca et al 2014 inverts the soil water budget equation and uses two consecutive soil moisture measurements for estimating the precipitation fallen within the interval between two satellite overpasses sm2rain rainfall estimate derived from active and passive soil moisture products was shown to perform fairly well over semi arid areas of africa and australia and south america while less performing results were obtained over cold areas mountainous regions and dense forests ciabatta et al 2018 massari et al 2017 the conceptually different measurement method of sm2rain is complementary to and independent from the one of traditional spps that is while spps estimates are based on averaging instantaneous observations of rainfall soil moisture based satellite precipitation products sm spps provide estimates of the accumulated precipitation within a time interval therefore the combination of these two different measurements can potentially reduce the problems related to temporal sampling however the merging or integration between spps and sm spps is not a simple task and should account for the dependence of errors on rainfall intensity and seasonality although many interesting studies have been published dealing with the integration of satellite rainfall estimates gauges radars and model reanalysis li et al 2015 mazzetti and todini 2009 xie and xiong 2011 a notable example is the one of beck et al 2017 only few of them ma et al 2018 focused only on spps spps have the main advantage of being available everywhere and in near real time nevertheless spps typically show non stationary seasonal and rain rate dependent biases aghakouchak et al 2012 ebert et al 2007 maggioni et al 2016 which are difficult to predict in this respect blending spps with sm spps adds an additional challenge as the latter tend to underestimate high precipitation rates and are less reliable in humid climates this is due to the fact that when soil moisture reaches saturation no change in soil water storage and consequently in precipitation can be recorded sm spps are also affected by noise in the satellite soil moisture signal which can provide false precipitation rate especially during dry seasons zhan et al 2015 past attempts to merge spps and sm spps or correct spps with satellite soil moisture observations have used either simple nudging schemes with constant weighing factors ciabatta et al 2015 2017 or data assimilation approaches based on sequential filtering techniques e g kalman based methods smart crow et al 2011 and particle filters pellarin et al 2013 román cascón et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 as nudging schemes are not being able to account for the dependency of errors on rainfall intensity they might provide suboptimal merged products sequential filtering techniques provide a dynamical correction of spps but this correction is either assumed only on the random component of the spp error i e the systematic component is deliberately ignored crow et al 2011 or only applied to non zero satellite precipitation zero precipitation values are left unchanged román cascón et al 2017 it must be noted that neglecting the systematic component of the error means overlooking the problem of biases in spps however total and hit biases are extremely important for many applications as they dictate the temporal trend of soil moisture and runoff errors within land surface and hydrological models gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 in this work we investigate the use of a conceptually different technique which is based on the predictive uncertainty pu concept to combine spps and sm spps that is spps and sm spps are seen as the a priori information predictors about the precipitation predictand and are used to provide its real time a posteriori probabilistic estimate by means of the bayes theorem we chose the model conditional processor mcp todini 2008 which was originally developed to support real time flood forecasting and thus to provide the a posteriori probabilistic estimates of water level discharge based on the knowledge of multiple forecasting model outputs mcp is based on the definition of the multi variate conditional distribution i e the density of the predictand precipitation in this case conditional on multiple deterministic model predictions or satellite observations i e spps and sm spps in this case it is worth mentioning that the notion bayesian must be intended here in terms of prediction and not as bayesian inference draper and krnjajic 2013 specifically we used a special case of bayesian inversion in which the predictand and predictor are available at the same time i e filtering despite its conceptual difference with respect to previously developed techniques this approach has the same final objective that is seeking an optimal way to include soil moisture information into spps with the aim of reducing their error and improving their quality mcp s advantages over other techniques e g beck et al 2017 ciabatta et al 2015 tarpanelli et al 2017 is its ability to correct for the error as a function of rainfall intensity moreover it not only corrects for random errors which is the main target of sequential assimilation techniques crow et al 2011 pellarin et al 2013 román cascón et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 but also provides a bias reduction in the final precipitation product in this article we use the two terms integration and merging interchangeably when referring to the mcp application the main objective of this work is to assess the efficiency of mcp in integrating spps and sm spps information so that the resulting product is superior with respect to its parent products i e it performs better in terms of error correlation and categorical scores mcp is thus applied to merge the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis real time product v 7 0 3b42rt huffman et al 2007 and the sm2rain cci sm spp ciabatta et al 2018 obtained from the inversion of the satellite soil moisture observations derived from the esa climate change initiative cci dorigo et al 2017 via sm2rain the analysis was carried out in italy during a 6 year period 2010 2015 at daily 0 25 temporal spatial scale the time series was split into two sub periods 2010 2012 was used for calibration and 2013 2015 for validation both calibration and validation were performed against a dense rain gauge network covering the entire study area see section 3 2 the proposed merging technique and the statistical metrics adopted to evaluate the different precipitation products are presented in the next section the study area and datasets are described in section 3 results are discussed in section 4 and discussion and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology the methodology used in this work provides the probabilistic estimate of rainfall through the application of mcp considering two satellite rainfall products one of which derived from satellite soil moisture measurements mcp was applied to mutual non zero precipitation estimates whereas in the other cases a heuristic type of approach was used see section 2 3 2 1 the multi model conditional processor mcp the model conditional processor mcp is a bayesian approach developed for estimating the flood predictive uncertainty pu defined as the probability density of a future outcome conditional on all the available information usually provided by model flood forecasts therefore mcp was originally proposed for pu estimate to support the flood forecasting activities in real time and it is essentially based on the definition of the multi variate conditional distribution i e the density of the predictand water level discharge etc conditional on multiple deterministic model forecasts predictors the analysis through mcp can be done by considering a unique model forecast single model approach or multiple model forecasts multi model approach coccia and todini 2011 moreover mcp can be applied either on a unique forecast horizon i e the single temporal approach coccia and todini 2011 or on multiple lead times i e the multi temporal approach barbetta et al 2016 2017 mcp identifies the multi variate conditional distribution i e the probability density of the predictant conditional on the model predictions this distribution is obtained by dividing the joint predictand prediction distribution by the joint marginal distribution of the predictor s and is estimated by considering an identified calibration data period specifically the calibration identifies the joint and marginal probability distributions required for bayes theorem application the main characteristics of mcp are presented in what follows while for additional details the reader is referred to coccia and todini 2011 and barbetta et al 2016 2017 the mcp application is based on four main steps fig 1 1 the observed precipitation y and the precipitation products i e the prior knowledge that we have on precipitation y k k 1 m with m being the number of precipitation products that are combined together are converted into the normal space using the normal quantile transformation nqt fig 1 blue box on the left side note that the use of nqt is not in contrast with the use of other approaches based on the fitting of the distributions like gamma sloughter et al 2007 but it is justified in this case by the relatively large sample size three years of data in practice y and y k whose empirical cumulative distribution functions are computed using the weibull plotting position see eqs 1 and 2 are converted into their transformed values η and η k respectively which are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance the probability of each element of η and η k is the same as their original corresponding values in y and y k thus the relation between the original variables and their transformed values is 1 p y y i i n 1 p η η i 2 p y k y ki i n 1 p η k η ki where i 1 n n number of observed available data i plotting position order in the normal space the joint probability distribution of observed and product variables f η η with η η 1 η 2 η m is assumed to be a normal multivariate distribution fig 1 red box on the left side 2 the conditional probability distribution i e the conditional predictive density is obtained applying the following equation that is known in the literature as the bayesian inverse problem which starts from the bayes formula fig 1 green box on the right side 3 f η η f η η f η where f η η f η η 1 η 2 η m is the conditional probability distribution f η η f η η 1 η 2 η m is the joint probability density of predictand and predictors and f η f η 1 η 2 η m the joint probability density of predictors the conditional predictive density f η η is a gaussian distribution with mean μ η η and variance σ 2 η η defined as 4 μ η η σ η η σ η η 1 η 1 η 2 η m 5 σ 2 η η 1 σ η η σ η η 1 σ η η t 3 the pu in the normal space is finally reconverted to the real space through the inverse nqt fig 1 grey box on the right side mcp requires as input rainfall observations and the corresponding estimates derived from the satellite products for each time step mcp provides as output the expected value of the identified multi variate conditional distribution i e the mean value and the cumulative 0 05 quantiles 5 10 95 in this study mcp was applied to two rainfall products a spp and a sm spp as predictors y k while a ground based rainfall product was used as predictand y as resulting merged rainfall product p mcp the expected value of the multi variate conditional distribution was selected 2 2 choice of the predictand for mcp for building the density probability function f described above mcp requires the knowledge of true precipitation field i e the predictand however in practice this information is never known thus substituting the ground based value for the actual value is a common practice in flood forecasting applications coccia and todini 2011 this concept can be also applied to precipitation as rain gauge based precipitation products are often assumed as truth for example many spps are named corrected when rain gauge observations are used for bias adjustment inherently assuming that gauges provide a better estimate of the true rainfall volumes further proofs of this assumption are the existence of a number of studies using rain gauge observations for validating spps and assuming that the biases of rain gauge observations are small when compared to the ones in satellite estimates xie and arkin 1995 it has been also demonstrated that hydrologic simulations carried out in poorly gauged regions using spps provide performance equal or inferior to simulations that employ even just a few rain gauges xie and arkin 1995 in this study we used a gauge based rainfall dataset as the predictand see section 3 2 for further details to extract the a priori information provided by spps and sm spps during a calibration period i e 2010 2012 the knowledge of the predictand is no longer necessary after calibration and mcp can provide a posteriori probabilistic rainfall estimates in near real time the mcp output is the multi variate conditional distribution and the cumulated 0 05 probability quantiles i e 5 10 95 which can be easily used to extract confidence bounds and the expected value of the estimates as highlighted before the expected value was considered in this work as the final merged rainfall product i e p mcp other applications and users may be interested in adopting a particular percentile of the distribution 2 3 a heuristic merging approach for categorical cases one of the underlying assumptions of mcp is the possibility to transform the joint probability distribution associated to different products and observations to the normal space with water levels and discharges this is usually possible see coccia and todini 2011 for further details however when dealing with precipitation its intermittent nature and the large presence of zero values especially at short time scales determine a high probability of zero non zero cases when comparing two different products this translates into a joint distribution that is highly skewed and very difficult to transform into the normal space this issue is marginal for precipitation accumulations across 5 10 days but it can be significant at the daily scale when cases with one product being zero and the other being non zero are very common although more robust approaches are possible e g sloughter et al 2007 wang and robertson 2011 to overcome this issue mcp was applied here only to hit cases when both predictand and predictors are non zero during calibration and when both predictors are non zero during validation the zero non zero cases can be either left unchanged and equal to the spp or treated differently generally the first option is favorable if the spp detection quality i e correctly identifying zero and non zero precipitation values is relatively good and the inclusion of soil moisture information has a limited or even detrimental effect on the final result otherwise like in our case it may be worth to investigate whether the soil moisture based product can add any value to the detection capability of the final product let us assume that we have to merge two precipitation products a and b if both products record 0 mm day we trust they are correct and assign 0 mm d to the merged dataset however if only one of the two is 0 mm d let us say product a and the other one records rain let us say product b then we may have one of the two following cases i product a is correct and product b is giving a false alarm ii product a is missing rain and product b is correct in order to properly merge the two products in these cases we assumed the probability density function of false alarms pf following an exponential law as function of rain rate rsat 6 pf r sat λ exp λ r sat the underlying assumption is that false alarm rates are highly dependent on the satellite precipitation algorithm and the recorded rain rate that is the higher the rain rate the lower the probability of that being a false alarm hossain and anagnostou 2004 hossain and anagnostou 2006 the λ parameter was calibrated by fitting eq 6 to data i e zero non zero cases collected during the calibration period see fig 2 for a curve fitting example in a pixel in central italy λ is spatially variable i e can vary from pixel to pixel and was calibrated for both product a λ a and product b λ b then based on pf rsat at every time t0 and location x0 at which product a was 0 mm d and product b was rsatb greater than 0 mm day the probability pf of false alarm of b pfb was determined by 7 p f b x 0 0 r satb λ b x 0 exp λ b x 0 r sat d r sat if pfb was larger than 90 then the algorithm trusted product a and assigned 0 mm day to the merged product on the other hand if pfb was lower than 90 then the algorithm averaged products a and b since chances were that b was overestimating and a underestimating rainfall the same procedure was applied to times locations at which product b was 0 mm d and product a larger than 0 mm day by using pfa although simple this method accounts for false alarms and missed rainfall cases which were shown in previous studies to significantly contribute to total precipitation maggioni et al 2016 different false probability thresholds were tested and the 90 provided the best categorical score and bias reduction as for mcp the reference dataset used for calibration was a gauge based rainfall dataset described in section 3 2 the application of this categorical case integration method in addition to mcp inherently poses a problem concerning the evaluation of the benefit of mcp itself therefore to demonstrate its effectiveness of mcp alone we also considered scores calculated only on hits see section 2 4 in addition we verified that if the method described in this section is not implemented not shown here the overall scores do not change significantly although the missed volume of precipitation remains relatively high it has also to be noted that treating differently zero and non zero precipitation values at a daily time scale has a limited but still recognizable benefit however this benefit would be much higher if shorter temporal scales were considered 2 4 performance scores the performance of p mcp was assessed against a gauge based rainfall dataset see section 3 2 for further details on this product continuous and categorical error metrics were adopted in this study based on a pixel to pixel 0 25 comparison for daily rainfall accumulations specifically three categorical scores were considered probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and threat score ts pod refers to the measures the likelihood of a spp to detect an event when it in fact occurs with 1 being the perfect pod far measures the likelihood that a precipitation event does not occur when spp estimates rain with 0 being the perfect far while ts provides an integrated measure of the two scores and measures the fraction of observed events that were correctly predicted by the spp the perfect ts is 1 they are defined as follows 8 pod h h m 9 far f f h 10 ts h h f m where h represents the number of rainfall events successfully detected hits m is the number of the missed events and f is the number of no rain events erroneously predicted as events false alarms for each given threshold a rainfall event is scored as hit miss or false depending on how the observed and estimated rainfall behave with respect to that threshold hit if they both reach it miss if only the observed rainfall reaches it false if only the estimated rainfall reaches it three rainfall thresholds were selected in order to guarantee both the evaluation of the products for low 2mm day medium 2 10 mm day and high 10 mm day rainfall accumulation amounts and the representativeness of each class three continuous scores were also taken into account pearson correlation coefficient r adjusted r squared r2 root mean squared error rmse and total bias bias which was evaluated both in terms of difference in millimetres between ground precipitation and estimated precipitation fallen during the study period and in relative terms i e percentage r provides a measure of the linear association between spp and the observations the perfect score is 1 whereas r2 indicates the percentage of variance explained by spp with respect to the total observed precipitation variance rmse is the square root of the average of the squared differences between spp and the observations and gives more weight to large errors than smaller errors which may be good if large errors are especially undesirable but may also encourage conservative precipitation estimation the perfect score is zero and it has the units of precipitation r rmse and bias were also calculated on hit cases only rhits rmsehits biashit to investigate the spp performance only when rainfall is larger than zero i e by considering only the effect of mcp in addition to these scores two volumetric bias scores were considered as defined in tian et al 2009 missed volume of precipitation ms vol and falsely detected precipitation volume fa vol 3 study area and datasets the proposed merging technique is tested across the italian peninsula which offers large variability in terms of terrain complexity and precipitation systems italy is characterized by a complex topography that spans from the mediterranean sea to the alps and apennines the climate includes hot dry summers and humid cold winters with high rainfall variability for instance a clear contrast exists between the more rainy northern part liguria and friuli regions and the drier southern area sicily calabria and sardinia the median annual precipitation averaged over the region during the study period is 1149 mm year with a minimum of 450 mm year in southern italy and a maximum of 3200 mm year in northern italy using the rainfall dataset described in section 3 2 a significant seasonal variability also exists with late autumn and early winter months september november being the wettest crespi et al 2018 3 1 satellite based rainfall datasets trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis real time product v 7 0 3b42rt developed by huffman et al 2007 is the spp adopted in this work the tmpa algorithm merges information from pmw sensors and geostationary ir observations the pmw data are intercalibrated to the trmm combined instrument tci which includes information from the precipitation radar pr an electronically scanning radar operating at 13 8 ghz trmm started collecting data in 1998 but the mission came to an end in april 2015 the 3b42 rt product has a 9 hr latency is available at 0 25 3 hr spatial temporal resolution and has quasi global coverage 50 n 50 s sm2rain cci ciabatta et al 2018 applies the sm2rain algorithm to the esa climate change initiative cci soil moisture dataset dorigo et al 2017 the algorithm has been calibrated during three different periods 1998 2001 2002 2006 and 2007 2013 against the global precipitation climatology centre full data daily dataset gpcc fdd schamm et al 2015 the quality flag provided within the raw soil moisture observations was used to mask out low quality data as well as the areas characterized by high topographic complexity high frozen soil and snow probability and presence of tropical forests therefore this product does not cover all the italian territory the integration exercise was then carried out only the remaining pixels in addition to 3b42rt and sm2rain cci the gpm imerg early run and final run precipitation products v 4 0 huffman et al 2015 were used to intercompare the merged product across the study area no merging was carried out with these products given the relatively short record of rainfall observations currently available the imerg algorithm firstly released in early 2015 huffman et al 2015 is run at 0 1 0 1 spatial and half hourly temporal resolutions in three modes based on latency and accuracy early latency of 4 6 h after observation late 12 18 h and final 3 months the main difference between the early and final runs is beyond the way the different sensor measurements are propagated in time the fact that the early run has a climatological rain gauge adjustment while the final run uses a month to month adjustment based on gpcc gauge data in this study the two daily imerg products were upscaled to 0 25 by using a box shaped kernel with antialiasing which approach was found to outperform simple spatial averaging 3 2 ground based dataset a ground based rainfall dataset obtained from more than 3000 rain gauges over the italian territory and covering the period 2010 2015 was used for the calibration as predictand for mcp and the validation of the procedure the dataset is composed by hourly rain gauge measurements recorded by the national monitoring network of the italian civil protection department the hourly rain gauge observations are spatially interpolated over the analysis grid i e 0 25 using the random generator of space interpolations from uncertain observations griso ciabatta et al 2015 pignone et al 2010 algorithm and aggregated at daily time step 4 results table 1 summarizes the performance of sm2rain cci 3b42rt and p mcp during the calibration period 2010 2012 in terms of median r rhits rmse rmsehits and bias a clear increase in correlation 0 15 in median and a reduction in error of 1 mm day in median and bias 20 30 in median is observed when p mcp estimates are considered with respect the two parent products these increments and reductions are evident both when considering all the precipitation and when considering only hits rhits rmsehits suggesting that the main driver of the improvements is the application of mcp to non zero precipitation values the p mcp performance was also investigated through the comparison between the estimated non zero p mpc precipitation percentiles and the corresponding observed occurrences during the calibration and the validation period fig 3 a and b specifically the performance of the processor was evaluated by plotting the cumulated 0 05 probability quantiles assessed by the p mcp against the corresponding percentages of observed data that fall below each percentile a line close to the one to one line black diagonal suggests a good performance of the processor during the calibration period this happens for almost all the pixels red line in fig 3a during the validation period the correlation scores and the errors are significantly increased reduced in particular p mcp correlation is close to 0 65 and median rmse is reduced to a value close to 5 mm day about 1 3 mm day and 0 5 mm day lower than 3b42rt and sm2rain cci while the bias is close to zero about 4 if compared against the imerg early run product imerg ea during march 2014 december 2015 p mcp provides better scores in terms of r and rhits rmse rmsehits and bias with respect to the imerg final product imerg fr however correlations are worse but errors and bias are lower which is remarking as the final run version of imerg is corrected with gauge observations and released only after a couple of months after sensing unlike calibration the diagram in fig 3b obtained during the validation period indicates a deterioration of the performance with a slight tendency to underestimate the probability quantiles this is likely due to the non stationary nature of precipitation products which might be affected by the climatic regime and type of precipitation and can vary from year to year ciabatta et al 2016 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 fig 4 a and b display daily and monthly rainfall time series averaged across the study area obtained by 3b42rt sm2rain cci and p mcp during the validation period p mpc estimates show a better agreement with the benchmark dataset with respect to the parent products with a tendency of overestimating summer precipitation particularly in the monthly time series accumulations fig 4b a bias improvement is also observed for most months with better identified rainfall peaks the problem of overestimation during summer could be simply avoided by a seasonal calibration of mcp however given the relatively short observational period available here this is not a recommended solution as it reduces too much the number of days when both predictand and predictors are available within the specific calibration season fig 5 presents the yearly accumulated rainfall from a gauges b 3b42rt c sm2rain cci and d p mcp during 2013 2015 and the related frequency of rainy days where a rainy day is defined as a rainfall accumulation of more than 2 mm both sm2rain cci and 3b42rt provide a significant underestimation of the ground based rainfall field and a different spatial pattern on the contrary p mcp provides a spatial rainfall accumulation distribution closer to the one of the rain gauges the number of rainy days is significantly underestimated by 3b42rt and overestimated by sm2rain cci due to the noise contained in satellite soil moisture observations in this respect p mcp is mainly impacted by the overestimation of rainy days provided by sm2rain cci and shows a general overestimation across the study area fig 6 a 6b shows the difference between r2 rmse of p mcp and r2 rmse of 3b42rt correlation is generally improved all over the study area except few pixels 25 out of 393 located in central and southern italy similarly rmse is consistently improved with a few pixels deteriorated 4 out of 393 for these pixels the correlation of 3b42rt is below 0 2 not shown and it is likely that mcp struggles to provide a reliable precipitation estimates in these cases scatterplots in fig 6c and 6d show a general unconditional increase in r2 and a reduction in rmse the same plots but relative to sm2rain cci are reported in the supplementary material fig s1 they show 1 a slight tendency to worsen correlation in southern italy by p mcp due to the relatively low performance of 3b42rt here correlation below 0 3 and 2 a clear pattern of improvement in rmse with larger corrections in areas characterized by a relatively higher accumulation amounts wetter areas the sub optimal p mcp performance in terms of correlation obtained with respect to sm2rain cci in southern italy can be also due to the relatively short calibration period associated with 1 the larger rainfall temporal variability of the mediterranean climate with respect to monsoon type of climates and 2 the smaller number of rainy days caused by the more arid climate which causes a less robust mcp calibration bias scores are reported in fig 7 p mcp shows a median bias close to zero the variability is also reduced with smaller 25th an 75th percentiles on one hand false precipitation volumes fa vol are reduced with respect to sm2rain cci but not with respect to 3b42rt on the other hand missed precipitation volumes are significantly reduced with respect to both products suggesting the effectiveness of the procedure described in section 2 3 the sub optimal behaviour in terms of false volume is also due to the low performance of sm2rain cci in this respect this is likely due to noise present in satellite soil moisture observations that is mistakenly identified as rainfall zhan et al 2015 nevertheless false precipitation volumes are much lower than missed and hit precipitation volumes and have therefore a relatively low impact on the total bias in terms of hit bias the merged product performs well confirming the robustness of the mcp procedure in merging non zero precipitation values when compared with imerg products during march 2014 december 2015 fig s2 in the supplementary material p mcp shows better performance in terms of hit bias and again a slightly worse performance in terms false volume of precipitation fig 8 displays the improvements obtained by p mcp with respect to 3b42rt in terms of categorical scores far pod and ts for three representative rainfall classes defined as light 2mm medium 2 10 mm and strong 10 mm there is a deterioration of false alarms in medium and strong rainfall regimes but a significant improvement in terms of pod on the contrary for light rainfall pod is slightly deteriorated and far is slightly improved the resulting differences in ts are generally positive showing that a good compromise is reached by the merging procedure in integrating the parent products the improvement with respect to sm2rain cci categorical scores is reported in the supplementary material fig s3 here p mcp consistently outperforms the parent products both in terms of far and pod which results in an overall enhanced ts with respect to the parent product fig 9 shows one of the most interesting results of this study the 30 day moving mean spatial correlation of 3b42rt sm2rain cci and p mcp calculated for each day during the validation period it can be seen that p mcp consistently provides better correlations with respect to the parent products and performs either better or at least similar to the best parent product even when 3b42rt s spatial correlation becomes negative or close to zero this confirms its ability to provide estimates that are closer to the benchmark rainfall fields 5 discussion and conclusions this work investigates the potential of a novel and alternative approach for complementing spps derived from 3b42rt with sm spps derived from sm2rain cci which is based on the use of the model conditional processor as the inclusion of zero precipitation values in the procedure might significantly skew the probability distributions associated with the products we applied mcp only to mutual non zero precipitation values i e hits and implemented a heuristic based approach to consider categorical cases i e when one of the product is zero while the other is larger than zero and vice versa because of the large precipitation volumes missed by the spp results demonstrate that the proposed method overall improves both spp and sm spp providing a valid alternative to complement spps with satellite soil moisture observations significant benefits are observed in terms of correlation rmse categorical scores and biases particularly in terms of hits suggesting that the main driver of improvements is the mcp the p mcp product outperforms the parent products also in reproducing the spatial distribution of precipitation across italy this is due to the mcp main concept which does not provide a simple merged product but rather the probability and therefore an estimate of the true rainfall conditioned on the available information this ability of correctly estimating the precipitation spatial distribution can be extremely important in many operational applications including flood forecasting when the contribution of different catchments to the total flow at the outlet has to be considered relative to the other methods like the ones proposed by crow et al 2011 and pellarin et al 2013 this method provides similar results in terms of correlation rmse and categorical scores enhancement but being conceptually different it shows some additional potential to improve the systematic error component of spps this is confirmed by 1 the better rmse and bias scores obtained here with respect to past integration exercises carried out in the same study region by ciabatta et al 2015 2017 and tarpanelli et al 2017 and 2 with respect to the performance of gpm products some limitations are found in terms of estimation of frequency of rainy days like in zhan et al 2015 which we found highly impacted by high frequency noise in satellite soil moisture observations this causes larger uncertainty in the false alarm rainfall which however has a marginal effect on the final total bias we expect that new satellite soil moisture observations like the ones derived from the soil moisture active and passive mission smap entekhabi et al 2010 can significantly reduce this problem thanks to their recognized better signal to noise ratio a strategy to solve this issue can be also the limitation of the integration to only non zero precipitation values e g zhan et al 2015 corrected only 3b42rt precipitation values larger than 2 mm which has not been followed within this study because of the poor performance of 3b42rt in this respect in this context the consideration of the new imerg products characterized by significant better detection skills with respect to 3b42rt can make the strategy of correcting only non zero precipitation values more successful the method potentially suffers from a few additional limitations for instance some deterioration was observed in pixels located in drier precipitation regimes where the relatively large number of zero precipitation values associated with the relatively short calibration period for that climatology i e too few precipitation events impacted the robustness of the mcp calibration process this can be overcome with alternative calibration strategies which involve the inclusion of spatial information on precipitation i e more pixels at the same time to increase the size of the calibration dataset moreover a reliable calibration dataset i e the predictand which is not always available is necessary to overcome this difficulty alternative calibration strategies can be considered like the use of available observations in areas characterized by similar climatic and topographic conditions to the study area or calibrating mcp with rainfall observations available at much larger spatial scales i e the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc provides long time series of daily rainfall observations at 1 degree spatial resolution these two solutions are currently under investigation the reader is also advised that the results obtained here refer to daily accumulation rainfall with a 0 25 degree spatial resolution therefore their general validity cannot be guaranteed at other spatiotemporal scales this limits in part the range of applications suitable for using the integrated product to for instance drought monitoring large scale flood forecasting and crop modelling applications requiring sub daily precipitation values like flash flood forecasting are not covered due to the revisit time of current satellite soil moisture products typically one day or more lastly it must be stressed that only two products were integrated nevertheless mcp could be easily applied to multiple products thus opening new opportunities for the development of blended global rainfall data in near real time which can be extremely useful for many operational applications declaration of interests none acknowledgements

6516,this work investigates the potential of using the bayesian based model conditional processor mcp for complementing satellite precipitation products with a rainfall dataset derived from satellite soil moisture observations mcp which is a bayesian inversion approach was originally developed for predictive uncertainty estimates of water level and discharge to support real time flood forecasting it is applied here for the first time to precipitation to provide its probability distribution conditional on multiple satellite precipitation estimates derived from trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis real time product v 7 0 3b42rt and the soil moisture based rainfall product sm2rain cci in mcp 3b42rt and sm2rain cci represent a priori information predictors about the true precipitation predictand and are used to provide its real time a posteriori probabilistic estimate by means of the bayes theorem mcp is tested across italy during a 6 year period 2010 2015 at daily 0 25 deg temporal spatial scale results demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides rainfall estimates that are superior to both 3b42rt as well as its successor imerg early run and sm2rain cci in terms of both median bias random errors and categorical scores the study confirms that satellite soil moisture derived rainfall can provide valuable information for improving state of the art satellite precipitation products thus making them more attractive for water resource management and large scale flood forecasting applications keywords rainfall soil moisture predictive uncertainty water resource management 1 introduction accurate quantitative precipitation estimation is of great importance for water resources management agricultural planning and monitoring forecasting of natural hazards such as floods drought and landslides in situ observations are limited around the earth especially in remote areas kidd et al 2017 thus satellite precipitation products spps are often the only alternative for applications however their accuracy depends upon many factors ebert et al 2007 i e type of storms temporal sampling season etc thus limiting their real utility traditional spps sense cloud properties to retrieve instantaneous rainfall estimates by combining a range of observations from geostationary geo and low earth orbiting leo satellites rainfall can be inferred from different sensors i visible images since thick clouds that are more likely to be associated with rainfall tend to be brighter than the surface ii infrared ir radiances since heavier rain tends to be associated with larger and taller clouds with colder tops iii passive microwave pmw as radiation and scattering caused by precipitating ice particles lead to a decrease in the signal during the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the global precipitation mission gpm eras e g hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2007 several techniques have been developed to take advantage of the synergy between pmw observations derived from polar orbiting satellites infrequent more direct and ir radiances derived from geo observations more frequent but less direct in particular gpm has brought a significant advancement in the measurement of precipitation from space thanks to a new dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and a more accurate radiometer which are used to intercalibrate observations coming from a constellation of sensors chiaravalloti et al 2018 gaona et al 2016 he et al 2017 liu 2016 prakash et al 2016 tan et al 2017 tang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 state of the art spps rely upon combinations of instantaneous observations of precipitation and thus are inherently affected by sampling errors behrangi and yixin 2017 due to the intermittent nature of rainfall and its high temporal and spatial variability these errors can translate into significant biases and missed precipitation events ciabatta et al 2016 which may impact their skills in operational applications like flood forecasting habib et al 2009 maggioni and massari 2018 common bias correction methods only adjust the total rainfall volume and may result in underestimation or overestimation of instantaneous precipitation aghakouchak et al 2012 as spps show strong dependence of the error on rain rate maggioni et al 2016 recent studies have proposed to use satellite soil moisture observations for correcting spps camici et al 2017 ciabatta et al 2015 crow et al 2009 2011 pellarin et al 2008 2013 wanders et al 2015 zhan et al 2015 the underlying idea is that soil moisture can be used as a trace of precipitation as after a rain event it can persist from a few hours to several days in other words soil moisture is informative of the amount of water stored in the soil after a rainfall event which can be exploited to retrieve information on the fallen precipitation on this basis the sm2rain method developed by brocca et al 2014 inverts the soil water budget equation and uses two consecutive soil moisture measurements for estimating the precipitation fallen within the interval between two satellite overpasses sm2rain rainfall estimate derived from active and passive soil moisture products was shown to perform fairly well over semi arid areas of africa and australia and south america while less performing results were obtained over cold areas mountainous regions and dense forests ciabatta et al 2018 massari et al 2017 the conceptually different measurement method of sm2rain is complementary to and independent from the one of traditional spps that is while spps estimates are based on averaging instantaneous observations of rainfall soil moisture based satellite precipitation products sm spps provide estimates of the accumulated precipitation within a time interval therefore the combination of these two different measurements can potentially reduce the problems related to temporal sampling however the merging or integration between spps and sm spps is not a simple task and should account for the dependence of errors on rainfall intensity and seasonality although many interesting studies have been published dealing with the integration of satellite rainfall estimates gauges radars and model reanalysis li et al 2015 mazzetti and todini 2009 xie and xiong 2011 a notable example is the one of beck et al 2017 only few of them ma et al 2018 focused only on spps spps have the main advantage of being available everywhere and in near real time nevertheless spps typically show non stationary seasonal and rain rate dependent biases aghakouchak et al 2012 ebert et al 2007 maggioni et al 2016 which are difficult to predict in this respect blending spps with sm spps adds an additional challenge as the latter tend to underestimate high precipitation rates and are less reliable in humid climates this is due to the fact that when soil moisture reaches saturation no change in soil water storage and consequently in precipitation can be recorded sm spps are also affected by noise in the satellite soil moisture signal which can provide false precipitation rate especially during dry seasons zhan et al 2015 past attempts to merge spps and sm spps or correct spps with satellite soil moisture observations have used either simple nudging schemes with constant weighing factors ciabatta et al 2015 2017 or data assimilation approaches based on sequential filtering techniques e g kalman based methods smart crow et al 2011 and particle filters pellarin et al 2013 román cascón et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 as nudging schemes are not being able to account for the dependency of errors on rainfall intensity they might provide suboptimal merged products sequential filtering techniques provide a dynamical correction of spps but this correction is either assumed only on the random component of the spp error i e the systematic component is deliberately ignored crow et al 2011 or only applied to non zero satellite precipitation zero precipitation values are left unchanged román cascón et al 2017 it must be noted that neglecting the systematic component of the error means overlooking the problem of biases in spps however total and hit biases are extremely important for many applications as they dictate the temporal trend of soil moisture and runoff errors within land surface and hydrological models gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 in this work we investigate the use of a conceptually different technique which is based on the predictive uncertainty pu concept to combine spps and sm spps that is spps and sm spps are seen as the a priori information predictors about the precipitation predictand and are used to provide its real time a posteriori probabilistic estimate by means of the bayes theorem we chose the model conditional processor mcp todini 2008 which was originally developed to support real time flood forecasting and thus to provide the a posteriori probabilistic estimates of water level discharge based on the knowledge of multiple forecasting model outputs mcp is based on the definition of the multi variate conditional distribution i e the density of the predictand precipitation in this case conditional on multiple deterministic model predictions or satellite observations i e spps and sm spps in this case it is worth mentioning that the notion bayesian must be intended here in terms of prediction and not as bayesian inference draper and krnjajic 2013 specifically we used a special case of bayesian inversion in which the predictand and predictor are available at the same time i e filtering despite its conceptual difference with respect to previously developed techniques this approach has the same final objective that is seeking an optimal way to include soil moisture information into spps with the aim of reducing their error and improving their quality mcp s advantages over other techniques e g beck et al 2017 ciabatta et al 2015 tarpanelli et al 2017 is its ability to correct for the error as a function of rainfall intensity moreover it not only corrects for random errors which is the main target of sequential assimilation techniques crow et al 2011 pellarin et al 2013 román cascón et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 but also provides a bias reduction in the final precipitation product in this article we use the two terms integration and merging interchangeably when referring to the mcp application the main objective of this work is to assess the efficiency of mcp in integrating spps and sm spps information so that the resulting product is superior with respect to its parent products i e it performs better in terms of error correlation and categorical scores mcp is thus applied to merge the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis real time product v 7 0 3b42rt huffman et al 2007 and the sm2rain cci sm spp ciabatta et al 2018 obtained from the inversion of the satellite soil moisture observations derived from the esa climate change initiative cci dorigo et al 2017 via sm2rain the analysis was carried out in italy during a 6 year period 2010 2015 at daily 0 25 temporal spatial scale the time series was split into two sub periods 2010 2012 was used for calibration and 2013 2015 for validation both calibration and validation were performed against a dense rain gauge network covering the entire study area see section 3 2 the proposed merging technique and the statistical metrics adopted to evaluate the different precipitation products are presented in the next section the study area and datasets are described in section 3 results are discussed in section 4 and discussion and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology the methodology used in this work provides the probabilistic estimate of rainfall through the application of mcp considering two satellite rainfall products one of which derived from satellite soil moisture measurements mcp was applied to mutual non zero precipitation estimates whereas in the other cases a heuristic type of approach was used see section 2 3 2 1 the multi model conditional processor mcp the model conditional processor mcp is a bayesian approach developed for estimating the flood predictive uncertainty pu defined as the probability density of a future outcome conditional on all the available information usually provided by model flood forecasts therefore mcp was originally proposed for pu estimate to support the flood forecasting activities in real time and it is essentially based on the definition of the multi variate conditional distribution i e the density of the predictand water level discharge etc conditional on multiple deterministic model forecasts predictors the analysis through mcp can be done by considering a unique model forecast single model approach or multiple model forecasts multi model approach coccia and todini 2011 moreover mcp can be applied either on a unique forecast horizon i e the single temporal approach coccia and todini 2011 or on multiple lead times i e the multi temporal approach barbetta et al 2016 2017 mcp identifies the multi variate conditional distribution i e the probability density of the predictant conditional on the model predictions this distribution is obtained by dividing the joint predictand prediction distribution by the joint marginal distribution of the predictor s and is estimated by considering an identified calibration data period specifically the calibration identifies the joint and marginal probability distributions required for bayes theorem application the main characteristics of mcp are presented in what follows while for additional details the reader is referred to coccia and todini 2011 and barbetta et al 2016 2017 the mcp application is based on four main steps fig 1 1 the observed precipitation y and the precipitation products i e the prior knowledge that we have on precipitation y k k 1 m with m being the number of precipitation products that are combined together are converted into the normal space using the normal quantile transformation nqt fig 1 blue box on the left side note that the use of nqt is not in contrast with the use of other approaches based on the fitting of the distributions like gamma sloughter et al 2007 but it is justified in this case by the relatively large sample size three years of data in practice y and y k whose empirical cumulative distribution functions are computed using the weibull plotting position see eqs 1 and 2 are converted into their transformed values η and η k respectively which are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance the probability of each element of η and η k is the same as their original corresponding values in y and y k thus the relation between the original variables and their transformed values is 1 p y y i i n 1 p η η i 2 p y k y ki i n 1 p η k η ki where i 1 n n number of observed available data i plotting position order in the normal space the joint probability distribution of observed and product variables f η η with η η 1 η 2 η m is assumed to be a normal multivariate distribution fig 1 red box on the left side 2 the conditional probability distribution i e the conditional predictive density is obtained applying the following equation that is known in the literature as the bayesian inverse problem which starts from the bayes formula fig 1 green box on the right side 3 f η η f η η f η where f η η f η η 1 η 2 η m is the conditional probability distribution f η η f η η 1 η 2 η m is the joint probability density of predictand and predictors and f η f η 1 η 2 η m the joint probability density of predictors the conditional predictive density f η η is a gaussian distribution with mean μ η η and variance σ 2 η η defined as 4 μ η η σ η η σ η η 1 η 1 η 2 η m 5 σ 2 η η 1 σ η η σ η η 1 σ η η t 3 the pu in the normal space is finally reconverted to the real space through the inverse nqt fig 1 grey box on the right side mcp requires as input rainfall observations and the corresponding estimates derived from the satellite products for each time step mcp provides as output the expected value of the identified multi variate conditional distribution i e the mean value and the cumulative 0 05 quantiles 5 10 95 in this study mcp was applied to two rainfall products a spp and a sm spp as predictors y k while a ground based rainfall product was used as predictand y as resulting merged rainfall product p mcp the expected value of the multi variate conditional distribution was selected 2 2 choice of the predictand for mcp for building the density probability function f described above mcp requires the knowledge of true precipitation field i e the predictand however in practice this information is never known thus substituting the ground based value for the actual value is a common practice in flood forecasting applications coccia and todini 2011 this concept can be also applied to precipitation as rain gauge based precipitation products are often assumed as truth for example many spps are named corrected when rain gauge observations are used for bias adjustment inherently assuming that gauges provide a better estimate of the true rainfall volumes further proofs of this assumption are the existence of a number of studies using rain gauge observations for validating spps and assuming that the biases of rain gauge observations are small when compared to the ones in satellite estimates xie and arkin 1995 it has been also demonstrated that hydrologic simulations carried out in poorly gauged regions using spps provide performance equal or inferior to simulations that employ even just a few rain gauges xie and arkin 1995 in this study we used a gauge based rainfall dataset as the predictand see section 3 2 for further details to extract the a priori information provided by spps and sm spps during a calibration period i e 2010 2012 the knowledge of the predictand is no longer necessary after calibration and mcp can provide a posteriori probabilistic rainfall estimates in near real time the mcp output is the multi variate conditional distribution and the cumulated 0 05 probability quantiles i e 5 10 95 which can be easily used to extract confidence bounds and the expected value of the estimates as highlighted before the expected value was considered in this work as the final merged rainfall product i e p mcp other applications and users may be interested in adopting a particular percentile of the distribution 2 3 a heuristic merging approach for categorical cases one of the underlying assumptions of mcp is the possibility to transform the joint probability distribution associated to different products and observations to the normal space with water levels and discharges this is usually possible see coccia and todini 2011 for further details however when dealing with precipitation its intermittent nature and the large presence of zero values especially at short time scales determine a high probability of zero non zero cases when comparing two different products this translates into a joint distribution that is highly skewed and very difficult to transform into the normal space this issue is marginal for precipitation accumulations across 5 10 days but it can be significant at the daily scale when cases with one product being zero and the other being non zero are very common although more robust approaches are possible e g sloughter et al 2007 wang and robertson 2011 to overcome this issue mcp was applied here only to hit cases when both predictand and predictors are non zero during calibration and when both predictors are non zero during validation the zero non zero cases can be either left unchanged and equal to the spp or treated differently generally the first option is favorable if the spp detection quality i e correctly identifying zero and non zero precipitation values is relatively good and the inclusion of soil moisture information has a limited or even detrimental effect on the final result otherwise like in our case it may be worth to investigate whether the soil moisture based product can add any value to the detection capability of the final product let us assume that we have to merge two precipitation products a and b if both products record 0 mm day we trust they are correct and assign 0 mm d to the merged dataset however if only one of the two is 0 mm d let us say product a and the other one records rain let us say product b then we may have one of the two following cases i product a is correct and product b is giving a false alarm ii product a is missing rain and product b is correct in order to properly merge the two products in these cases we assumed the probability density function of false alarms pf following an exponential law as function of rain rate rsat 6 pf r sat λ exp λ r sat the underlying assumption is that false alarm rates are highly dependent on the satellite precipitation algorithm and the recorded rain rate that is the higher the rain rate the lower the probability of that being a false alarm hossain and anagnostou 2004 hossain and anagnostou 2006 the λ parameter was calibrated by fitting eq 6 to data i e zero non zero cases collected during the calibration period see fig 2 for a curve fitting example in a pixel in central italy λ is spatially variable i e can vary from pixel to pixel and was calibrated for both product a λ a and product b λ b then based on pf rsat at every time t0 and location x0 at which product a was 0 mm d and product b was rsatb greater than 0 mm day the probability pf of false alarm of b pfb was determined by 7 p f b x 0 0 r satb λ b x 0 exp λ b x 0 r sat d r sat if pfb was larger than 90 then the algorithm trusted product a and assigned 0 mm day to the merged product on the other hand if pfb was lower than 90 then the algorithm averaged products a and b since chances were that b was overestimating and a underestimating rainfall the same procedure was applied to times locations at which product b was 0 mm d and product a larger than 0 mm day by using pfa although simple this method accounts for false alarms and missed rainfall cases which were shown in previous studies to significantly contribute to total precipitation maggioni et al 2016 different false probability thresholds were tested and the 90 provided the best categorical score and bias reduction as for mcp the reference dataset used for calibration was a gauge based rainfall dataset described in section 3 2 the application of this categorical case integration method in addition to mcp inherently poses a problem concerning the evaluation of the benefit of mcp itself therefore to demonstrate its effectiveness of mcp alone we also considered scores calculated only on hits see section 2 4 in addition we verified that if the method described in this section is not implemented not shown here the overall scores do not change significantly although the missed volume of precipitation remains relatively high it has also to be noted that treating differently zero and non zero precipitation values at a daily time scale has a limited but still recognizable benefit however this benefit would be much higher if shorter temporal scales were considered 2 4 performance scores the performance of p mcp was assessed against a gauge based rainfall dataset see section 3 2 for further details on this product continuous and categorical error metrics were adopted in this study based on a pixel to pixel 0 25 comparison for daily rainfall accumulations specifically three categorical scores were considered probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and threat score ts pod refers to the measures the likelihood of a spp to detect an event when it in fact occurs with 1 being the perfect pod far measures the likelihood that a precipitation event does not occur when spp estimates rain with 0 being the perfect far while ts provides an integrated measure of the two scores and measures the fraction of observed events that were correctly predicted by the spp the perfect ts is 1 they are defined as follows 8 pod h h m 9 far f f h 10 ts h h f m where h represents the number of rainfall events successfully detected hits m is the number of the missed events and f is the number of no rain events erroneously predicted as events false alarms for each given threshold a rainfall event is scored as hit miss or false depending on how the observed and estimated rainfall behave with respect to that threshold hit if they both reach it miss if only the observed rainfall reaches it false if only the estimated rainfall reaches it three rainfall thresholds were selected in order to guarantee both the evaluation of the products for low 2mm day medium 2 10 mm day and high 10 mm day rainfall accumulation amounts and the representativeness of each class three continuous scores were also taken into account pearson correlation coefficient r adjusted r squared r2 root mean squared error rmse and total bias bias which was evaluated both in terms of difference in millimetres between ground precipitation and estimated precipitation fallen during the study period and in relative terms i e percentage r provides a measure of the linear association between spp and the observations the perfect score is 1 whereas r2 indicates the percentage of variance explained by spp with respect to the total observed precipitation variance rmse is the square root of the average of the squared differences between spp and the observations and gives more weight to large errors than smaller errors which may be good if large errors are especially undesirable but may also encourage conservative precipitation estimation the perfect score is zero and it has the units of precipitation r rmse and bias were also calculated on hit cases only rhits rmsehits biashit to investigate the spp performance only when rainfall is larger than zero i e by considering only the effect of mcp in addition to these scores two volumetric bias scores were considered as defined in tian et al 2009 missed volume of precipitation ms vol and falsely detected precipitation volume fa vol 3 study area and datasets the proposed merging technique is tested across the italian peninsula which offers large variability in terms of terrain complexity and precipitation systems italy is characterized by a complex topography that spans from the mediterranean sea to the alps and apennines the climate includes hot dry summers and humid cold winters with high rainfall variability for instance a clear contrast exists between the more rainy northern part liguria and friuli regions and the drier southern area sicily calabria and sardinia the median annual precipitation averaged over the region during the study period is 1149 mm year with a minimum of 450 mm year in southern italy and a maximum of 3200 mm year in northern italy using the rainfall dataset described in section 3 2 a significant seasonal variability also exists with late autumn and early winter months september november being the wettest crespi et al 2018 3 1 satellite based rainfall datasets trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis real time product v 7 0 3b42rt developed by huffman et al 2007 is the spp adopted in this work the tmpa algorithm merges information from pmw sensors and geostationary ir observations the pmw data are intercalibrated to the trmm combined instrument tci which includes information from the precipitation radar pr an electronically scanning radar operating at 13 8 ghz trmm started collecting data in 1998 but the mission came to an end in april 2015 the 3b42 rt product has a 9 hr latency is available at 0 25 3 hr spatial temporal resolution and has quasi global coverage 50 n 50 s sm2rain cci ciabatta et al 2018 applies the sm2rain algorithm to the esa climate change initiative cci soil moisture dataset dorigo et al 2017 the algorithm has been calibrated during three different periods 1998 2001 2002 2006 and 2007 2013 against the global precipitation climatology centre full data daily dataset gpcc fdd schamm et al 2015 the quality flag provided within the raw soil moisture observations was used to mask out low quality data as well as the areas characterized by high topographic complexity high frozen soil and snow probability and presence of tropical forests therefore this product does not cover all the italian territory the integration exercise was then carried out only the remaining pixels in addition to 3b42rt and sm2rain cci the gpm imerg early run and final run precipitation products v 4 0 huffman et al 2015 were used to intercompare the merged product across the study area no merging was carried out with these products given the relatively short record of rainfall observations currently available the imerg algorithm firstly released in early 2015 huffman et al 2015 is run at 0 1 0 1 spatial and half hourly temporal resolutions in three modes based on latency and accuracy early latency of 4 6 h after observation late 12 18 h and final 3 months the main difference between the early and final runs is beyond the way the different sensor measurements are propagated in time the fact that the early run has a climatological rain gauge adjustment while the final run uses a month to month adjustment based on gpcc gauge data in this study the two daily imerg products were upscaled to 0 25 by using a box shaped kernel with antialiasing which approach was found to outperform simple spatial averaging 3 2 ground based dataset a ground based rainfall dataset obtained from more than 3000 rain gauges over the italian territory and covering the period 2010 2015 was used for the calibration as predictand for mcp and the validation of the procedure the dataset is composed by hourly rain gauge measurements recorded by the national monitoring network of the italian civil protection department the hourly rain gauge observations are spatially interpolated over the analysis grid i e 0 25 using the random generator of space interpolations from uncertain observations griso ciabatta et al 2015 pignone et al 2010 algorithm and aggregated at daily time step 4 results table 1 summarizes the performance of sm2rain cci 3b42rt and p mcp during the calibration period 2010 2012 in terms of median r rhits rmse rmsehits and bias a clear increase in correlation 0 15 in median and a reduction in error of 1 mm day in median and bias 20 30 in median is observed when p mcp estimates are considered with respect the two parent products these increments and reductions are evident both when considering all the precipitation and when considering only hits rhits rmsehits suggesting that the main driver of the improvements is the application of mcp to non zero precipitation values the p mcp performance was also investigated through the comparison between the estimated non zero p mpc precipitation percentiles and the corresponding observed occurrences during the calibration and the validation period fig 3 a and b specifically the performance of the processor was evaluated by plotting the cumulated 0 05 probability quantiles assessed by the p mcp against the corresponding percentages of observed data that fall below each percentile a line close to the one to one line black diagonal suggests a good performance of the processor during the calibration period this happens for almost all the pixels red line in fig 3a during the validation period the correlation scores and the errors are significantly increased reduced in particular p mcp correlation is close to 0 65 and median rmse is reduced to a value close to 5 mm day about 1 3 mm day and 0 5 mm day lower than 3b42rt and sm2rain cci while the bias is close to zero about 4 if compared against the imerg early run product imerg ea during march 2014 december 2015 p mcp provides better scores in terms of r and rhits rmse rmsehits and bias with respect to the imerg final product imerg fr however correlations are worse but errors and bias are lower which is remarking as the final run version of imerg is corrected with gauge observations and released only after a couple of months after sensing unlike calibration the diagram in fig 3b obtained during the validation period indicates a deterioration of the performance with a slight tendency to underestimate the probability quantiles this is likely due to the non stationary nature of precipitation products which might be affected by the climatic regime and type of precipitation and can vary from year to year ciabatta et al 2016 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 fig 4 a and b display daily and monthly rainfall time series averaged across the study area obtained by 3b42rt sm2rain cci and p mcp during the validation period p mpc estimates show a better agreement with the benchmark dataset with respect to the parent products with a tendency of overestimating summer precipitation particularly in the monthly time series accumulations fig 4b a bias improvement is also observed for most months with better identified rainfall peaks the problem of overestimation during summer could be simply avoided by a seasonal calibration of mcp however given the relatively short observational period available here this is not a recommended solution as it reduces too much the number of days when both predictand and predictors are available within the specific calibration season fig 5 presents the yearly accumulated rainfall from a gauges b 3b42rt c sm2rain cci and d p mcp during 2013 2015 and the related frequency of rainy days where a rainy day is defined as a rainfall accumulation of more than 2 mm both sm2rain cci and 3b42rt provide a significant underestimation of the ground based rainfall field and a different spatial pattern on the contrary p mcp provides a spatial rainfall accumulation distribution closer to the one of the rain gauges the number of rainy days is significantly underestimated by 3b42rt and overestimated by sm2rain cci due to the noise contained in satellite soil moisture observations in this respect p mcp is mainly impacted by the overestimation of rainy days provided by sm2rain cci and shows a general overestimation across the study area fig 6 a 6b shows the difference between r2 rmse of p mcp and r2 rmse of 3b42rt correlation is generally improved all over the study area except few pixels 25 out of 393 located in central and southern italy similarly rmse is consistently improved with a few pixels deteriorated 4 out of 393 for these pixels the correlation of 3b42rt is below 0 2 not shown and it is likely that mcp struggles to provide a reliable precipitation estimates in these cases scatterplots in fig 6c and 6d show a general unconditional increase in r2 and a reduction in rmse the same plots but relative to sm2rain cci are reported in the supplementary material fig s1 they show 1 a slight tendency to worsen correlation in southern italy by p mcp due to the relatively low performance of 3b42rt here correlation below 0 3 and 2 a clear pattern of improvement in rmse with larger corrections in areas characterized by a relatively higher accumulation amounts wetter areas the sub optimal p mcp performance in terms of correlation obtained with respect to sm2rain cci in southern italy can be also due to the relatively short calibration period associated with 1 the larger rainfall temporal variability of the mediterranean climate with respect to monsoon type of climates and 2 the smaller number of rainy days caused by the more arid climate which causes a less robust mcp calibration bias scores are reported in fig 7 p mcp shows a median bias close to zero the variability is also reduced with smaller 25th an 75th percentiles on one hand false precipitation volumes fa vol are reduced with respect to sm2rain cci but not with respect to 3b42rt on the other hand missed precipitation volumes are significantly reduced with respect to both products suggesting the effectiveness of the procedure described in section 2 3 the sub optimal behaviour in terms of false volume is also due to the low performance of sm2rain cci in this respect this is likely due to noise present in satellite soil moisture observations that is mistakenly identified as rainfall zhan et al 2015 nevertheless false precipitation volumes are much lower than missed and hit precipitation volumes and have therefore a relatively low impact on the total bias in terms of hit bias the merged product performs well confirming the robustness of the mcp procedure in merging non zero precipitation values when compared with imerg products during march 2014 december 2015 fig s2 in the supplementary material p mcp shows better performance in terms of hit bias and again a slightly worse performance in terms false volume of precipitation fig 8 displays the improvements obtained by p mcp with respect to 3b42rt in terms of categorical scores far pod and ts for three representative rainfall classes defined as light 2mm medium 2 10 mm and strong 10 mm there is a deterioration of false alarms in medium and strong rainfall regimes but a significant improvement in terms of pod on the contrary for light rainfall pod is slightly deteriorated and far is slightly improved the resulting differences in ts are generally positive showing that a good compromise is reached by the merging procedure in integrating the parent products the improvement with respect to sm2rain cci categorical scores is reported in the supplementary material fig s3 here p mcp consistently outperforms the parent products both in terms of far and pod which results in an overall enhanced ts with respect to the parent product fig 9 shows one of the most interesting results of this study the 30 day moving mean spatial correlation of 3b42rt sm2rain cci and p mcp calculated for each day during the validation period it can be seen that p mcp consistently provides better correlations with respect to the parent products and performs either better or at least similar to the best parent product even when 3b42rt s spatial correlation becomes negative or close to zero this confirms its ability to provide estimates that are closer to the benchmark rainfall fields 5 discussion and conclusions this work investigates the potential of a novel and alternative approach for complementing spps derived from 3b42rt with sm spps derived from sm2rain cci which is based on the use of the model conditional processor as the inclusion of zero precipitation values in the procedure might significantly skew the probability distributions associated with the products we applied mcp only to mutual non zero precipitation values i e hits and implemented a heuristic based approach to consider categorical cases i e when one of the product is zero while the other is larger than zero and vice versa because of the large precipitation volumes missed by the spp results demonstrate that the proposed method overall improves both spp and sm spp providing a valid alternative to complement spps with satellite soil moisture observations significant benefits are observed in terms of correlation rmse categorical scores and biases particularly in terms of hits suggesting that the main driver of improvements is the mcp the p mcp product outperforms the parent products also in reproducing the spatial distribution of precipitation across italy this is due to the mcp main concept which does not provide a simple merged product but rather the probability and therefore an estimate of the true rainfall conditioned on the available information this ability of correctly estimating the precipitation spatial distribution can be extremely important in many operational applications including flood forecasting when the contribution of different catchments to the total flow at the outlet has to be considered relative to the other methods like the ones proposed by crow et al 2011 and pellarin et al 2013 this method provides similar results in terms of correlation rmse and categorical scores enhancement but being conceptually different it shows some additional potential to improve the systematic error component of spps this is confirmed by 1 the better rmse and bias scores obtained here with respect to past integration exercises carried out in the same study region by ciabatta et al 2015 2017 and tarpanelli et al 2017 and 2 with respect to the performance of gpm products some limitations are found in terms of estimation of frequency of rainy days like in zhan et al 2015 which we found highly impacted by high frequency noise in satellite soil moisture observations this causes larger uncertainty in the false alarm rainfall which however has a marginal effect on the final total bias we expect that new satellite soil moisture observations like the ones derived from the soil moisture active and passive mission smap entekhabi et al 2010 can significantly reduce this problem thanks to their recognized better signal to noise ratio a strategy to solve this issue can be also the limitation of the integration to only non zero precipitation values e g zhan et al 2015 corrected only 3b42rt precipitation values larger than 2 mm which has not been followed within this study because of the poor performance of 3b42rt in this respect in this context the consideration of the new imerg products characterized by significant better detection skills with respect to 3b42rt can make the strategy of correcting only non zero precipitation values more successful the method potentially suffers from a few additional limitations for instance some deterioration was observed in pixels located in drier precipitation regimes where the relatively large number of zero precipitation values associated with the relatively short calibration period for that climatology i e too few precipitation events impacted the robustness of the mcp calibration process this can be overcome with alternative calibration strategies which involve the inclusion of spatial information on precipitation i e more pixels at the same time to increase the size of the calibration dataset moreover a reliable calibration dataset i e the predictand which is not always available is necessary to overcome this difficulty alternative calibration strategies can be considered like the use of available observations in areas characterized by similar climatic and topographic conditions to the study area or calibrating mcp with rainfall observations available at much larger spatial scales i e the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc provides long time series of daily rainfall observations at 1 degree spatial resolution these two solutions are currently under investigation the reader is also advised that the results obtained here refer to daily accumulation rainfall with a 0 25 degree spatial resolution therefore their general validity cannot be guaranteed at other spatiotemporal scales this limits in part the range of applications suitable for using the integrated product to for instance drought monitoring large scale flood forecasting and crop modelling applications requiring sub daily precipitation values like flash flood forecasting are not covered due to the revisit time of current satellite soil moisture products typically one day or more lastly it must be stressed that only two products were integrated nevertheless mcp could be easily applied to multiple products thus opening new opportunities for the development of blended global rainfall data in near real time which can be extremely useful for many operational applications declaration of interests none acknowledgements

6517,single well injection tests in a petroleum contaminated region stimulate microbial growth and cause bioclogging because of the intrusion of elevated dissolved oxygen do which may affect the hydraulic conductivity k estimation in this study we developed a mathematical model considering multispecies and multiphase reactive transport and bioclogging for a single well injection test in a confined aquifer to investigate the microbial effects on parameter estimation the finite difference method was used to solve the model the temporal heads in the injection well in both cases of clean and petroleum contaminated aquifers were compared the results indicated that the bioclogging led to an abnormal bulge of the drawdown time curve at an intermediately late time of injection based on sensitivity analysis and cooper jacob straight line fitting associated with the least square method the underestimation degree of k was 17 7 with default parameters 11 9 with double injection rate q 31 1 with double maximum biomass growth rate μ max j and 39 5 with double initial contaminant concentration c 2 ini moreover introducing an approximate damköhler number indicated that increasing q reduced the underestimation by flushing and diluting the essential materials for microbial growth to the downstream and that larger c 2 ini and μ max j resulted in an increase in underestimation due to the increase in favorable conditions and strong growth ability of microbes finally we suggest that when petroleum contamination is inevitable in a single well injection test moderate increases in q and the test duration can reduce the underestimation degree of k to a considerable extent keywords single well injection test petroleum contaminated aquifer hydraulic conductivity estimation microbial effects finite difference method 1 introduction pumping and injection tests are widely conducted in subsurface hydrology and petroleum engineering to determine the hydraulic parameters of the target aquifers or reservoirs starting with the relatively simple theis model theis 1935 with a number of idealized assumptions extensive studies have been dedicated to expand the theis model by relaxing the assumptions to accommodate more realistic field circumstances expansion of the model includes models considering unconfined aquifers boulton 1954 bear 1972 leaky confined aquifers hantush and jacob 1955 delayed yield from storage boulton 1963 wellbore storage papadopulos and cooper 1967 partially penetrating wells neuman 1974 non darcian flow instead of darcian flow sen 1988 wen et al 2009 and 2011 heterogeneous aquifers butler and liu 1993 skin effects novakowski 1989 chiu et al 2007 and variable pumping rate wen et al 2017 among others however all the works mentioned above only consider the physical processes associated with a pumping or injection well the microbial effects are rarely considered in aquifer tests this study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by specifically considering the effects of microbial growth on a single well injection test the motivation of this research is illustrated below injection tests are popular in arid regions for hydraulic parameter estimation because the aquifer is usually deep resulting in high water lift cost through a pumping test additionally for those permeable media without waterlogged pores the flow field inside can be triggered by injection test rather than pumping test the single well test is widely applied because of low drilling cost halford et al 2010 li et al 2018 and short test duration petroleum products are the most commonly observed contaminants in aquifers and the contamination from a leaking subsurface storage tank is one of the typical examples robertson 1996 kao and prosser 2001 kim et al 2011 moreover aquifers are also extensively contaminated by wastewater from oil exploration ferreira et al 2015 and oil spills from pipelines doherty and otitoloju 2013 in petroleum contaminated confined aquifers the dissolved oxygen do concentration is usually from less than 0 1 to 0 2 mg l chen and liu 2003 edmunds et al 2003 or even less because of aerobic biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons phcs however a certain amount of aerobic microbes most likely grow under such a hypoxic condition balcke et al 2008 reported that extremely low but permanent resupply of oxygen 0 01 mg l could provide microaerophilic specialists with sufficient ability to degrade chlorobenzene the experimental results of táncsics et al 2010 and táncsics et al 2012 indicated that betaproteobacteria and genus rhodoferax related species respectively could successfully complete the catechol 2 3 dioxygenase mrna transcripts in an oxygen limited petroleum contaminated site in addition to the aerobic forms facultative anaerobes are also widespread under the relatively anaerobic environment sperfeld et al 2018 as a result of water injection with relatively high do concentration the indigenous microbes near the injection well pioneer the use of do the aerobic microbes propagate without further oxygen limitations moreover the facultative anaerobes can change their metabolism pattern for example from anaerobic to aerobic respiration partridge et al 2006 arai et al 2008 schroth et al 1998 performed an extensive series of single well push pull tests to quantify the aerobic respiration rate and observed considerable oxygen consumption due to aerobic respiration several hours after do injection into a petroleum contaminated aquifer cho et al 2013 performed single well push pull tests to estimate in situ biodegradation rates of petroleum hydrocarbons in a fractured bedrock aquifer without any initially detectable bacterial group after a 50 min injection phase and 3 h rest phase through extraction they detected 20 bacterial species after do injection indicating that the fractured bedrock aquifer contaminated by petroleum may contain indigenous contamination degrading bacteria which can be stimulated by oxygen injection therefore a reasonable assumption is that because of the injection of high do concentration water microbes in petroleum contaminated aquifers may grow considerably around the well screen when aerobic respiration is activated after the injection of high do concentration water the microbes can grow and gradually plug the pores in the medium a series of studies depict how microbial communities modify the hydraulic properties of a porous medium taylor et al 1990 proposed a model based on the assumption that biofilms cover uniformly the medium grains vandevivere 1995 relaxed the uniform biofilm assumption and developed a model considering cell aggregates clogging the pore lumen in a saturated porous medium clement et al 1996 advanced macroscopic models that relate hydraulic property changes to average biomass concentrations seki and miyazaki 2001 raised a colony model considering nonuniform microbial distribution based on some of the old but classical models mentioned above efforts have been directed to column or sand box studies coupling flow or solute transport with bioclogging kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 thullner et al 2004 thullner 2010 seifert and engesgaard 2012 moreover pore scale researches on biofilm mediated solute transport orgogozo et al 2013 or bioamended changes in hydraulic properties brangarí et al 2017 have also been conducted because the bioclogging stimulated by do injection can form a low permeability region in the vicinity of the well screen a microbially mediated skin should be involved in well hydraulics overall we investigated the microbial effects on the flow from an injection well the skin effect has received increasing attention in recent years yang and yeh 2009 wen et al 2011 wang et al 2012 wen and wang 2013 feng and wen 2016 li et al 2018 the conclusion is that the type and thickness of skin greatly influence the drawdown in the skin zone but have little effect on the drawdown in the formation zone feng and wen 2016 with respect to a single well test without an observation well wen and wang 2013 and li et al 2018 reported that the drawdown in the pumping well with positive skin which indicates the skin zone has lower hydraulic conductivity than the formation zone yeh and chang 2013 is higher than that without skin wen et al 2011 concluded that a relatively thick positive skin results in a reduced well discharge therefore in this study a bioamended skin effect on hydraulic parameter estimation through a single well test was apparently inevitable considering that the hydraulic data inside the injection well were the only reference for parameter estimation although microbial effects are very likely to affect the parameter estimation by aquifer tests such effects have almost never been carefully investigated which is most likely because of a few limitations first in petroleum contaminated aquifers with the huge diversity of contaminants and microbes leahy and colwell 1990 magot et al 2000 gennadiev et al 2015 the biogeochemical processes particularly the initiation mechanism of aerobic respiration as soon as do is captured are difficult to express accurately moreover bioclogging mediated by reactive transport has been rarely involved in the skin effect of well hydraulics during the last decades biologists have developed various bioclogging models for hydraulic property changes taylor et al 1990 vandevivere 1995 clement et al 1996 seki and miyazaki 2001 hydraulicians particularly well hydraulicians have deeply investigated the skin effect on aquifer tests novakowski 1989 chiu et al 2007 wen et al 2011 and environmentalists have studied experimentally or theoretically the incorporation of bioclogging flow field and solute transport kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 thullner 2010 seifert and engesgaard 2012 newcomer et al 2016 2018 caruso et al 2017 however the bioclogging induced skin effects on parameter estimation due to reactive transport coupled with microbial growth have been rarely investigated the microbially mediated skin controlled by reactive transport indicates that both the skin thickness and permeability are temporally variable which is completely different from the skins of yang and yeh 2009 wen et al 2011 wang et al 2012 wen and wang 2013 and feng and wen 2016 all of which set a skin with constant thickness and permeability although li et al 2018 investigated a nonuniform skin the thickness was prescribed by a sinusoidal function of the vertical coordinate as an initial condition and did not vary temporally hence this study investigated how the microbial effects i e the bioclogging induced skin effects caused by reactive transport after do injection affected the hydraulic conductivity estimation with a single well injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer for this purpose we developed accordingly a mathematical model in the case of single well injection the petroleum contaminants were treated as a non aqueous phase liquid napl which when released into the aqueous phase produced various dissolved phcs among which benzene toluene and xylene btx were the most representative these three species and do were involved in the reactive transport in our model additionally these phcs had their immobile phase due to the adsorption to medium particles the microbes were also classified into immobile and mobile phases and the interrelationship between the two phases was dominated by attachment and detachment processes the model integrated radial groundwater flow reactive transport of multispecies and multiphase interactions with temporal and spatial hydraulic parameter variations due to bioclogging 2 problem statement of the single well bioaffected injection test figure 1 is a schematic program of an injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer both the water and oxygen are transported along the radial direction i e the r axis in this cylindrical system and toward infinity from the well the aquifer is axisymmetric where the point intersected by the well s central axis and the aquifer bottom is the origin the well fully penetrates the aquifer which has uniform thickness radially prior to injection a contaminated region existed around a well with radius rcont which also supports a limited amount of microbes and bioclogging due to low do concentration hence the aquifer is initially homogeneous and isotropic horizontally except in the contaminated region the blue domain black dots and red markers indicate the do spreading contaminants and microbes respectively the mathematical model of this injection test considering bioclogging is depicted below 2 1 groundwater flow in a nonuniform aquifer under axisymmetric case because of the arrival of high concentration do the interparticle biogrowth near the well makes the homogeneous aquifer heterogeneous hence this model considered flow in a nonuniform aquifer under the axisymmetric case additionally the wellbore storage was considered and the injection rate was supposed as constant the aquifer system before injection was recognized as hydrostatic therefore the mathematical description of the flow model can be depicted as papadopulos and cooper 1967 wen et al 2008 2011 1 1 r r q r s m s t 2 s r t 0 0 3 s r t 0 4 2 π r w m q r r w π r c 2 d s w

which remains negative for injecting q s and s are the specific velocity l t drawdown l and storage coefficient respectively q is calculated as 5 q k r t s r where k r t indicates the hydraulic conductivity l t and can be changed temporally and spatially because of bioclogging 2 2 reactive transport in a nonuniform aquifer under axisymmetric case the governing equation to describe multispecies advection dispersion reaction is gelhar and collins 1971 moench 1989 6 r ret c i t 1 r r rd c i r v a c i r r i where ci indicates the concentration of each mobile component i m l3 at

as 8 d r α v a d 0 where α is the dispersivity l d 0 indicates the effective molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t for description convenience we prescribed i to be 1 for do 2 for mobile btx and 3 for mobile biomass the initial and boundary conditions for do were different from those for the other two components do concentration was initially low and uniform over the whole confined aquifer and do had an only external supply from the injection well which can be described as 9 c 1 r t 0 c 1 ini 10 c 1 r t r 0 11 v a c 1 d c 1 r r r w v a c 1 inj r r w where c 1 ini indicates the initial do concentration and the infinite boundary concentration m l3 c 1 inj represents the do concentration in the injection well m l3 considering that the mobile btx was composed of benzene toluene and xylene c2 was prescribed with another subscript j as c2 j to represent the dissolved concentration of each component m l3 all dissolved phcs were considered initially to fill a certain area around the well and their initial and boundary concentrations were zero which can be expressed as 12 c 2 j 0 r r s t 0 c 2 j ini 13 c 2 j r r s t 0 0 14 c 2 j r t r 0 15 v a c 2 j d c 2 j r r r w 0 where rs indicates the dividing point between contaminated and clean regions l c 2 j ini is the initial mobile concentration of the jth dissolved phc m l3 which can be regarded as a historical legacy from napl release and calculated as 16 c 2 j ini c 2 ini f j where c 2 ini is the initial dissolved napl concentration m l3 and fj is the mole fraction of each component in the napl because the rich phcs could support a certain amount of biomass with oxygen limitation the mobile biomass had same initial and boundary conditions to mobile btx as 16 c 3 0 r r s t 0 c 3 m o b ini 17 c 3 r r s t 0 0 18 c 3 r t r 0 19 v

with respect to the configuration of the aquifer and initial and boundary conditions are listed in table 1 2 3 source and sink 2 3 1 napl release and phc sorption for btx the mass transfer from napl to aqueous phase is actually the hydrocarbon dissolution which is a rate limited process brauner and widdowson 2001 the rate of napl release rnapl expressed by waddill and widdowson 2000 is 20 r napl

calculated as 21 c eq j c sol j f j where csol j is the pure phase solubility of the jth phc in water m l3 the sorption process of btx causes retardation of the whole reactive transport process for a linear sorption model the retardation factor of each component is expressed as 22 r ret j 1 ρ bulk θ k d j where ρ bulk is the bulk density of the medium m l3 k d j is the distribution coefficient of the jth component l3 m the parameters involved in the properties of btx components are listed in table 2 2 3 2 attachment and detachment of biomass the attachment and detachment processes of biomass are relatively microscopic the attachment rate was computed through colloid filtration theory as harvey and garabedian 1991 scheibe et al 2007 23 k att 3 1 θ v a η 2 d g where dg is the mean characteristic grain diameter l η is the collector efficiency which indicates the frequency of collisions between mobile and attached phases and is calculated as martin et al 1996 24 η 4 a s 1 3 n pe

γ 1 θ 1 3 the remaining parameters involved in the above equations are defined in table 3 the buildup of biomass and the reduction of pore space lead to an increase in flow velocity which eventually leads to significant detachment of biomass due to the increasing shear forces therefore we employed the semiempirical equation proposed by rittmann 1982 which has been used by brovelli et al 2009 for bioclogging model development to express the velocity dependent detachment rate as 31 k det c d γ v a 1 θ 3 d p 2 θ 3 m 0 58 the parameters involved are listed in table 3 2 3 3 microbially mediated reaction the microbially mediated reaction is described by a michaelis menton type equation whereas the biomass decays by a first order kinetic process the biomass growth was assumed to be limited by do electron acceptor concentration dissolved phcs electron donor and biomass concentration we assumed that both mobile and immobile biomass could conduct the reaction the michaelis menton type equation for our model is 32 r mob j μ max j c 3 m o b c 2 j c 2 j k 2 j c 1 c 1 k 1 f 33 r imm j μ max j c 3 i m m c 2 j c 2 j k 2 j c 1 c 1 k 1 f where r mob j and r imm j are the growth rate of mobile m l3 t and immobile biomass m m t respectively due to the consumption of the jth phc with c3 mob indicating mobile biomass m l3 and c3 imm immobile biomass m m μ max j is the maximum growth rate with consuming the jth phc 1 t k 1 and k 2 j are the half saturation constants of do m l3 and the jth phc m l3 f is the limitation factor which accounts for the effects of limited pore space on growth and is computed as kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 34 f 1 c 3 i m m ρ bulk ρ s θ clean where ρ bulk is the bulk density m l3 and ρs is the density of biomass m dry biomass l3 water θ clean is the effective porosity of a clean aquifer the decay rate of mobile or immobile biomass was computed as 35 r dec m o b i m m c 3 m o b i m m k dec where k dec is the decay rate of mobile or immobile biomass 1 t the consumption rate of each dissolved btx component was expressed as 36 r rea j 1 y j r mob j r imm j ρ bulk θ where rrea j indicates the consumption rate of the jth phc m l3 t yj is the

phcs m l3 t rb rt and rx are the consumption rate of dissolved benzene toluene and xylene concentration respectively as eq 36 indicates m l3 t fb ft and fx are the consumption ratios of benzene toluene and xylene to oxygen respectively upon the integration of the different processes the reactive transport of each species can be described as the following odes 38 c 1 t 1 r r rd c 1 r v a c 1

benzene b toluene t and xylene x with respect to mobile and immobile biomass respectively 2 4 bioclogging effects several bioclogging models are listed in the introduction section and considering that our model serves for a field site problem the spatial configuration that depends on the interparticle characteristics was not the best choice for the incorporation into our reactive transport model instead we employed the macroscopic approach clement et al 1996 which involves little about the microscopic biomass distribution but focuses more on the assemblage of biofilm colonies and plugs at pore throats the occupation fraction of the total pore volume θ bio was calculated with the macroscopic approach as 42 θ bio c 3 i m m ρ bulk ρ s the bioclogging affected porosity θ which can be substituted into eq 7 to modify the average pore velocity is 43 θ θ clean θ bio the macroscopic model of clement et al 1996 relates hydraulic conductivity to biomass affected porosity as 44 k k clean θ θ clean 19 6 where kclean is the hydraulic conductivity without any bioclogging effects l t k is the biomass affected hydraulic conductivity l t and can be substituted into eq 5 for the next iteration to implement the effects on flow due to bioclogging the parameters involved in the microbially mediated reaction and bioclogging are listed in table 3 3 numerical solution we employed the finite difference method to solve the reactive transport model considering multispecies and multiphases the details for discretization are shown in appendix a first the use of benchmark solutions to test the accuracies of our solute transport models was essential because many studies state that numerical errors can occur because of inappropriate temporal or spatial discretization when using the finite difference method for the solute transport model without considering oxygen consumption the semianalytical solution of moench and ogata 1981 can be used as the benchmark solution with its laplace domain solution expressed as 45 c c inj p exp r r w 2 α r a i p 2 3 pr α r 0 25 a i p 2 3 p r w α r 0 25 where c is the concentration in the laplace domain p is the laplace variable ai is the airy function of the first kind to solve eq 45 this study employed the stehfest method stehfest 1970a b to conduct the analytical inverse laplace transformation figure 2 is the comparison between semi analytical solution and numerical solution for the solute transport model with the parameters listed in table 1 the high consistency indicated that the results of the numerical method coincided very well with those of the semi analytical method with different observation radii from the well hence the conclusions were that the numerical solutions for the solute transport performed well and that the discretization for the finite difference method was reliable to support the accurate description of other source and sink items which can cause spatial and temporal variation in permeability 4 results 4 1 microbially mediated skin effect figure 3 reveals the spatial and temporal reduction in hydraulic conductivity initially due to extremely low do concentration the weak biomass accumulation resulted in a very limited reduction in hydraulic conductivity several percent the limited reduction coincided with the tiny curve discrepancy between the theis case and the microbially affected case at early times as shown in fig 4 the theis case does not consider any skin effect according to the characteristics of aquifer test duration we defined early times as 0 to 1 104 s intermediately late times as 1 104 to 1 105 s and super late times as later than 1 105 s as shown in fig 4 as fig 3 shows at intermediately late times a distinct nonuniform reduction in hydraulic conductivity 18 30 percent was found from the well screen to several decimeters distant correspondingly the curve discrepancy between the two cases expands greatly at intermediately late times in fig 4 at super late times the reduction in hydraulic conductivity decreased and eventually became zero i e the bioclogging vanished as the injection continued accordingly as fig 4 reveals the microbially affected curve approaches the theis curve at super late times the convergence was observed because at early times the head around the well had not reached steady state and groundwater velocity was low due to the low hydraulic gradient resulting in less influence of transport on the reaction therefore the essential food for microbes had a sufficiently long residence time to undergo the microbial reaction contributing to the accumulation of biomass at early times and partial intermediately late times when the intermediately late times were almost completed the groundwater cone of uplift around the well reached a steady state with the highest hydraulic gradient within the entire injection period the groundwater velocity also became the highest with the result that the effects of transport overwhelmed those of reaction i e the essential microbial food was flushed and diluted to the downstream instead of participating in the reaction moreover no external supplies were available for both microbes and contaminants and the only source of btx was the dissolution of phcs high groundwater velocity not only increased the detachment rate of immobile biomass but also resulted in less residence time for the mobile btx and biomass to conduct the reaction actually we were interested in the performance of the microbially affected curve at intermediately late times first if such a test was conducted in the field the observed data of the wellhead would very likely perform the same as indicated by the curve from our model or at least it is highly possible that the field data of a wellhead in a contaminated aquifer would deviate from those in a clean aquifer at intermediately late times additionally considering the influences of wellbore storage on early drawdown novakowski 1989 pasandi et al 2008 the field data at intermediately late times are more reliable for parameter estimation therefore the microbially mediated processes involved in this model are of a great significance in the hydraulic parameter estimation 4 2 sensitivity analysis to investigate how the wellhead was affected a sensitivity analysis was conducted because of the variety of parameters involved in this bioamended reactive transport model sensitivity analysis on all parameters would be cumbersome instead we chose the parameters that depended much on artificial factors aquifer properties biomass and phc properties which are parameters that affect directly the reactive transport process therefore the parameters we selected for sensitivity analysis were injection rate q hydraulic conductivity of a clean aquifer kclean the initial concentration of mobile biomass c 3 m o b ini the initial concentration of mobile btx concentration c 2 ini the maximum growth rate μ max j and the yield coefficient of each phc yj similar to kabala 2001 and huang and yeh 2007 the normalized sensitivity of the abovementioned parameters was calculated and the results are shown in fig 5 every parameter increment had a distinct impact on the head in the injection well at intermediately late times however only q and kclean had the greatest impacts through the entire injection period the large effects were observed because both q and kclean not only dominated directly the head in the whole flow field even without any microbial effects but also affected indirectly the reactive transport through the modulation of groundwater velocity for the other parameters c 2 ini and μ max j had the second greatest influences during the bioclogging period followed by c 3 m o b ini these three parameters reflected the initiation foundation and production ability for microbial growth because abundant food and sufficiently vigorous microbes can support a normal microbial metabolism and influential bioclogging yj influenced indirectly the microbial growth through the consumption of substrate thus yj represented the lowest effects 4 3 parameter estimation to estimate accurately the hydraulic parameters based on the single wellhead obtained from the injection test the two most frequently used methods were adopted which were the type curve fitting method based upon the theis formula 1935 and the straight line fitting method through cooper jacob approximation cooper and jacob 1946 to date several software programs have been developed on the above theoretical basis to assist the estimation of hydraulic parameters such as aquifertest aqtesolv and aquifer well test among others obviously regardless of the fitting method employed for parameter estimation the aim is to best match the observed data with a theoretical curve or line therefore the fitting error should be minimized as much as possible in this study we used the cooper jacob straight line fitting method as an example to explain how bioclogging affects the parameter estimation with the single well injection test the relevant knowledge about the cooper jacob straight line fitting method is provided in appendix c the algorithm we adopted for fitting was the least square method which has been employed in both type curve fitting maslia and randolph 1987 maslia and prowell 1990 motz 2009 and straight line approximation fitting maslia and randolph 1987 we assumed our modeling results were the analogue of measured data i e the performance of the bioaffected head in the actual test was completely accordant to our modeling results note that the measuring time interval in an actual aquifer test was unnecessarily the same as the temporal step in our model and in such a semilog coordinate the result was that the weight of intermediately late data bioaffected data was different between modeling and field test when applying the least square method however the modeling data remained qualitatively adequate to indicate the microbial effects on parameter estimation figure 6 reveals different cases about the bioaffected estimation on hydraulic conductivity in the semilog x coordinate the black markers which were calculated based on the theis model theis 1935 for a clean aquifer without any microbial effects represent a base case the black line which fits the black markers very well has the slope that yields the hydraulic conductivity of a clean aquifer which is the kclean in fact moreover all the other cases were microbially affected and among them the red markers indicate the bioaffected case with the default parameter values listed in tables 1 3 obviously the bioclogging resulted in an abnormal bulge of red markers at intermediately late times thus the red line which was also fitted to the red markers by the least square method yielded a higher slope than that of the black line as eq c 6 in appendix c indicates when a slope g is obtained by the least square method the bioaffected hydraulic conductivity kbio can be calculated as 46 k bio 0 183 q gm which can be compared to kclean to determine the degree of parameter underestimation for the other three cases in fig 6 each of them doubled the default value of one parameter the green one doubled the injection rate q the indigotic one doubled the maximum growth rate with the consumption of each btx contamination μ max j and the blue one doubled the initial mobile btx concentration c 2 ini similar to the previous fitting and calculation procedure each of these three cases reached an underestimation degree additionally we also doubled the initial hydraulic conductivity kclean and the contamination radius rcont to determine the underestimation degrees the underestimation degrees of all abovementioned cases are listed in table 4 we defined the underestimation degree of k as kclean kbio kclean as fig 6 and table 4 indicate the default case yielded an underestimation degree of 17 7 based on which a doubled q reduced this value to 11 9 which was because an increasing q resulted in an increasing porous velocity near the well that not only accelerated the detachment of biomass from the adsorbed phase but also flushed all mobile materials for microbial metabolism including mobile biomass contamination and do to the downstream within an exponentially growing area therefore we inferred that an increase in injection rate led to a dilution effect on this solute transport system and relaxed the bioclogging effect resulting in an underestimation lower than that with a reduced injection rate by contrast a doubled c 2 ini and a doubled μ max j expanded the underestimation degree to 39 5 and 31 1 respectively this expansion was because both these factors directly influenced the reaction rate and at large values microbial growth was stimulated causing a series of hydraulic data with the strongest bioclogging at intermediately late times resulting in the fitting process yielding a reduced hydraulic conductivity additionally doubling kclean and rcont had very limited influence with both yielding an underestimation degree of nearly 17 7 similar to the default case which was because an increase in kclean did not lead to either additional do into the system or promote the groundwater velocity considering that it was a constant rate injection rather than constant head injection test for rcont although its expansion indicated more electron donors in the system the limited test duration could only support the solute transport to a very restricted radius which indicated the electron donors added could not be utilized therefore similar to kclean an increase in contamination radius also had little influence 4 4 interrelation between underestimation degree and damköhler number notably an increase in q apparently had two opposite effects on microbial growth one was the addition of electron acceptors do into the contaminated system to stimulate metabolism and the other one was flushing and diluting the essential materials for the microbial reaction to inhibit metabolism therefore we introduced the damköhler number da to compare the roles of reaction and transport in this system normally the da is defined as the ratio of the characteristic reaction rate rc to the characteristic transport rate τ as zarnetske et al 2012 47 d a r c τ in our model the accurate depiction of both the reaction and transport rates was difficult because our model had neither a simple first order reaction rate nor a steady state flow field hence we advanced another approximate expression of d a o 2 with respect to do as 48 d ao a j b t x μ max j b j q c 1 inj with 49 a 2 π r cont 2 m θ clean c 3 m o b ini 50 b j f j y j where a j b t x μ max j b j represents the do consumption rate m t when all microorganisms in this system work in biodegradation a indicates the total initial concentration of biomass based on mobile and immobile biomass with the same initial amount for the attach detachment balance with a equal to double the mobile concentration of mobile biomass j b t x μ max j b j is the sum of do consumption coefficients of all phc degradation processes indicating the do consumption rate of unit concentration microorganism with a dimension 1 t q c 1 inj reveals the rate of do injection into the system m t which can represent the transport velocity inside the system therefore when the do injection rate overwhelms the do consumption rate the value of d a o 2 is small indicating that transport is the dominant process in this system whereas when the opposite occurs reaction dominates figure 7 reveals the relationship between underestimation degree and d a o 2 with respect to different initial mobile btx concentration c 2 ini along the horizontal d a o 2 axis logarithmic based on the default value d a o 2 3 3 the d a o 2 value decreases with an increasing q and increases with increasing μ max j or c 3 m o b ini the underestimation degree decreased as the d a o 2 decreased until zero was approached i e when the injection rate was sufficiently large the underestimation could be eliminated theoretically however the underestimation degree increased as the d a o 2 increased i e initially sufficient vigorous biomass strongly negatively influenced the hydraulic parameter estimation moreover with the same values of d a o 2 as fig 7 shows the underestimation degree increased with an increasing initial btx concentration indicating that a relatively contaminated site is unfavorable for conducting this aquifer test however when the contaminated degree is low the underestimation degree can most likely be neglected or at least a hydraulic conductivity is yielded with the same order of magnitude as its actual value 5 discussion this study investigated the microbial effects on well hydraulics through a model of a single well injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer the underestimation degree was quantified through cooper jacob straight line fitting coupled with the least square method additionally an approximate damköhler number was advanced to quantitatively and comprehensively describe the effect of each parameter on the underestimation degree our work provides insights into the data interpretation in an actual single well injection test affected by bioclogging and some solutions to decrease the underestimation degree in such a case are proposed despite the originality of this research topic the study is after all only a numerical modeling study based on a simplified approximation of an extremely complicated system in reality the phc contaminated aquifer had compounds in addition to benzene toluene and xylene as table 5 shows nevertheless btx had higher solubility and greater molar fraction than inert decane and the btx properties with respect to reactive transport have been widely investigated therefore we think that using btx to represent the entire group of phcs was reasonably feasible additionally the microbial world of this phc contaminated site was difficult to accurately depict for a hydrologist the microbial detection before conducting an aquifer test is always an extra cost and the trigger mechanism for aerobic respiration after do injection is most likely unpredictable however this study provided a hint of the microbial effects that could actually occur on the single well injection test the lgs lgt or s lgt curve would show an abnormal bulge at a specific time when this bulge occurs the aquifer tester can avoid the effects of bioaffected data by increasing the injection rate or extending the test duration moreover with the absence of microscopic observation of the microbial community accurate depiction of the pore scale pattern of biogrowth was difficult considering also the least empirical parameters required in eqs 42 44 we adopted the macroscopic model clement et al 1996 rather than the other models taylor et al 1990 vandevivere 1995 seki and miyazaki 2001 to depict bioaffected parameters nevertheless for the homogeneous aquifer in our model the pore size distribution index λ is normally a large value brooks and corey 1964 such as 2 to 5 clement et al 1996 demonstrated that when λ equals 3 the macroscopic model is essentially equivalent to the biofilm model taylor et al 1990 and even the other values of λ between 2 and 5 produce very limited deviation between macroscopic and biofilm models as rockhold et al 2002 state a universally applicable model to describe the bioaffected hydraulic parameter in saturated porous medium is difficult to identify but when one must describe the bioclogging induced permeability with regard to our scenario the macroscopic model is the most reasonable and convenient to investigate the bioclogging effects on parameter estimation additionally the bioclogging at super late times tended to vanish in our model because of the high detachment rate and short residence time for reaction however this result is in contrast to the wide understanding that 100 cleanup of the microbial community is theoretically impossible under this situation speitel et al 1987 observed 33 and 67 detachments of newly formed biomass with phenol and paranitrophenol respectively as substrates in a packed column reactor rao et al 1992 reported over 70 detachment of the newly generated biomass in a concentric cylinder bioreactor gjaltema et al 1995 adopted biofilm airlift suspension reactors with different configurations and found two distinguishing phases of detachment processes with the detachment rate in the first phase relatively high and that in the second phase much lower obviously none of those previous studies obtained 100 detachment of biomass actually eq 31 expressing the detachment rate was first developed by rittmann 1982 to address the criticism of the steady state biofilm theory rittmann et al 1980 1982 which considered biomass decay as the only loss mechanism but neglected the effects of shear stress nevertheless the test duration and lack of external electron donors make it difficult for our model to reach rittmann s steady state thus the detachment rate of rittmann 1982 is most likely not a fit for our model compared with the detachment most likely causing great disappearance of bioclogging at super late times in our model the first quick and then slow microbial detachment of gjaltema et al 1995 is more reasonable however the results of gjaltema et al 1995 are derived only from experiments and an absence of universal expressions for the detachment rate remains conversely rittmann s detachment rate can provide a worst case of biomass loss with respect to detachment i e if our scenario in fact could not reach a steady state such as that of rittmann et al 1980 1982 then the detachment induced biomass loss would not be as much as our current model calculated at super late times then the bioclogging effects would not disappear that soon and the bulge of the s lgt or lgs lgt curve at intermediately late times would approach flatness slowly and most likely not superpose the theis case curve at super late times therefore in an actual field test the curve performance at super late times can be checked thoroughly and when the extended test duration cannot weaken the bioclogging effects increasing the injection rate can efficiently decrease the parameter underestimation as fig 6 reveals additionally the effects of gas production on permeability in saturated system have been widely reported gardescu 1930 oberdorfer and peterson 1985 fry et al 1997 seki et al 1998 for example seki et al 1998 found the reduction of hydraulic conductivity was due to the methane generated by the microbes that feed on glucose oberdorfer and peterson 1985 reported the same observation which resulted from nitrogen production in this study the endogenous microbes in the aquifer are presumed to be responsible for the production of the gases as by product of fermentation or anaerobic respiration which is ignored in our model nevertheless the microbial growth rate of aerobic respiration is much greater than that of other metabolism patterns grishchenkov et al 2000 chapelle et al 2002 and the gaseous by product of aerobic respiration is carbon dioxide which is much more soluble than the anaerobic gases consequently the gas production in our model can be assumed to have limited impact on the hydraulic conductivity finally despite the consideration for growth decay attachment detachment and transport the starvation and dormancy affecting the microbial dynamics were not involved in our model we assumed the microbial reaction to be energy spilling at any time but neglected the oligotrophic effects in some local sites due to zero external carbon supply stolpovsky et al 2011 developed a transition mechanism between active and dormant cells by comparing the actual gibbs energy released and the maintenance energy tijhuis et al 1993 hess et al 1996 when the redox reaction does not generate sufficient energy for maintenance requirements the active biomass goes through starvation transforming into a dormant state that can no longer grow via biodegradation except for the maintenance energy to express an oligotrophic growth rate the thermodynamic limitation factor developed by jin and bethke 2007 and larowe and van cappellen 2011 in different forms relates directly the growth rate with the gibbs energy released from redox reactions for our model although the groundwater flush resulted in an oligotrophic environment at super late times we presume that the dormant biomass attached onto medium particles should continue to preserve a certain bioclogging ability which also supports the phenomenon that not all biomass is flushed down speitel et al 1987 rao et al 1992 nevertheless to involve bioenergetics in our model was not feasible because the maintenance energy is not an easily accessible parameter and the gibbs energy calculation involves temperature atp synthesis energy activity and stoichiometric coefficient of each reactant and some other energy related parameters would result in huge computation cost and calculation errors to the best of our knowledge no universal methods exist to mathematically depict both eutrophic and oligotrophic effects on microbial metabolism therefore the microbial metabolism at super late times might be more complicated than that presented here this limitation of our model was most relaxed by increasing the injection rate rather than extending the test duration since higher injection rate can efficiently smooth the bulge of drawdown time curve still extending the test duration may not be adequate to completely eliminate the bioclogging due to the oligotrophic metabolism of biomass although all the parameters employed in our model are cited from previous literature more efforts of actual field tests are required to calibrate some parameters we used furthermore our numerical modeling with respect to the microbially mediated reactive transport process should be validated by previous models or actual field data considering the limited availability of studies which can provide a benchmark solution to our model thus we conducted a field test for our model with chemical and microbial assistance despite this limitation our work can arouse extensive awareness of microbial effects on well hydraulics in some circumstances and give theoretical interpretation and treatment methods if one encounters the problems described here such as the abnormal bulge in the drawdown time curve 6 summary and conclusions in this study the necessity to consider microbial effects in a single well injection test in a petroleum contaminated area was first elaborated and then a mathematical model combining radial groundwater flow solute transport and microbial growth together in the case of an injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer was presented considering temporal and spatial variations in permeability due to microbial growth we compared the heads in the injection well between bioclogged and clean aquifer cases and employed sensitivity analysis and cooper jacob straight line fitting associated with the least square method to reach the following several conclusions 1 the bioclogging resulted in an abnormal bulge of the drawdown time curve at intermediately late times of the injection 2 extending the test duration might moderately reduce the underestimation degree but considering the modeling limitations increasing the injection rate would more likely achieve this effect 3 high initial biomass or contaminant concentration and a biomass with a high maximum growth rate expanded the underestimation degree 4 the effect of each parameter on the underestimation degree can be efficiently revealed by an approximate damköhler number in the discussion section the composition simplification of petroleum contaminant the choice of bioclogging model and the neglect of effects of gas production on permeability have been demonstrated to be reasonable in our model the oligotrophic metabolism of biomass that may support the later survival of bioclogging is not a strong limitation if the injection rate is increased declaration of interests none acknowledgements this research was partially supported by the

6517,single well injection tests in a petroleum contaminated region stimulate microbial growth and cause bioclogging because of the intrusion of elevated dissolved oxygen do which may affect the hydraulic conductivity k estimation in this study we developed a mathematical model considering multispecies and multiphase reactive transport and bioclogging for a single well injection test in a confined aquifer to investigate the microbial effects on parameter estimation the finite difference method was used to solve the model the temporal heads in the injection well in both cases of clean and petroleum contaminated aquifers were compared the results indicated that the bioclogging led to an abnormal bulge of the drawdown time curve at an intermediately late time of injection based on sensitivity analysis and cooper jacob straight line fitting associated with the least square method the underestimation degree of k was 17 7 with default parameters 11 9 with double injection rate q 31 1 with double maximum biomass growth rate μ max j and 39 5 with double initial contaminant concentration c 2 ini moreover introducing an approximate damköhler number indicated that increasing q reduced the underestimation by flushing and diluting the essential materials for microbial growth to the downstream and that larger c 2 ini and μ max j resulted in an increase in underestimation due to the increase in favorable conditions and strong growth ability of microbes finally we suggest that when petroleum contamination is inevitable in a single well injection test moderate increases in q and the test duration can reduce the underestimation degree of k to a considerable extent keywords single well injection test petroleum contaminated aquifer hydraulic conductivity estimation microbial effects finite difference method 1 introduction pumping and injection tests are widely conducted in subsurface hydrology and petroleum engineering to determine the hydraulic parameters of the target aquifers or reservoirs starting with the relatively simple theis model theis 1935 with a number of idealized assumptions extensive studies have been dedicated to expand the theis model by relaxing the assumptions to accommodate more realistic field circumstances expansion of the model includes models considering unconfined aquifers boulton 1954 bear 1972 leaky confined aquifers hantush and jacob 1955 delayed yield from storage boulton 1963 wellbore storage papadopulos and cooper 1967 partially penetrating wells neuman 1974 non darcian flow instead of darcian flow sen 1988 wen et al 2009 and 2011 heterogeneous aquifers butler and liu 1993 skin effects novakowski 1989 chiu et al 2007 and variable pumping rate wen et al 2017 among others however all the works mentioned above only consider the physical processes associated with a pumping or injection well the microbial effects are rarely considered in aquifer tests this study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by specifically considering the effects of microbial growth on a single well injection test the motivation of this research is illustrated below injection tests are popular in arid regions for hydraulic parameter estimation because the aquifer is usually deep resulting in high water lift cost through a pumping test additionally for those permeable media without waterlogged pores the flow field inside can be triggered by injection test rather than pumping test the single well test is widely applied because of low drilling cost halford et al 2010 li et al 2018 and short test duration petroleum products are the most commonly observed contaminants in aquifers and the contamination from a leaking subsurface storage tank is one of the typical examples robertson 1996 kao and prosser 2001 kim et al 2011 moreover aquifers are also extensively contaminated by wastewater from oil exploration ferreira et al 2015 and oil spills from pipelines doherty and otitoloju 2013 in petroleum contaminated confined aquifers the dissolved oxygen do concentration is usually from less than 0 1 to 0 2 mg l chen and liu 2003 edmunds et al 2003 or even less because of aerobic biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons phcs however a certain amount of aerobic microbes most likely grow under such a hypoxic condition balcke et al 2008 reported that extremely low but permanent resupply of oxygen 0 01 mg l could provide microaerophilic specialists with sufficient ability to degrade chlorobenzene the experimental results of táncsics et al 2010 and táncsics et al 2012 indicated that betaproteobacteria and genus rhodoferax related species respectively could successfully complete the catechol 2 3 dioxygenase mrna transcripts in an oxygen limited petroleum contaminated site in addition to the aerobic forms facultative anaerobes are also widespread under the relatively anaerobic environment sperfeld et al 2018 as a result of water injection with relatively high do concentration the indigenous microbes near the injection well pioneer the use of do the aerobic microbes propagate without further oxygen limitations moreover the facultative anaerobes can change their metabolism pattern for example from anaerobic to aerobic respiration partridge et al 2006 arai et al 2008 schroth et al 1998 performed an extensive series of single well push pull tests to quantify the aerobic respiration rate and observed considerable oxygen consumption due to aerobic respiration several hours after do injection into a petroleum contaminated aquifer cho et al 2013 performed single well push pull tests to estimate in situ biodegradation rates of petroleum hydrocarbons in a fractured bedrock aquifer without any initially detectable bacterial group after a 50 min injection phase and 3 h rest phase through extraction they detected 20 bacterial species after do injection indicating that the fractured bedrock aquifer contaminated by petroleum may contain indigenous contamination degrading bacteria which can be stimulated by oxygen injection therefore a reasonable assumption is that because of the injection of high do concentration water microbes in petroleum contaminated aquifers may grow considerably around the well screen when aerobic respiration is activated after the injection of high do concentration water the microbes can grow and gradually plug the pores in the medium a series of studies depict how microbial communities modify the hydraulic properties of a porous medium taylor et al 1990 proposed a model based on the assumption that biofilms cover uniformly the medium grains vandevivere 1995 relaxed the uniform biofilm assumption and developed a model considering cell aggregates clogging the pore lumen in a saturated porous medium clement et al 1996 advanced macroscopic models that relate hydraulic property changes to average biomass concentrations seki and miyazaki 2001 raised a colony model considering nonuniform microbial distribution based on some of the old but classical models mentioned above efforts have been directed to column or sand box studies coupling flow or solute transport with bioclogging kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 thullner et al 2004 thullner 2010 seifert and engesgaard 2012 moreover pore scale researches on biofilm mediated solute transport orgogozo et al 2013 or bioamended changes in hydraulic properties brangarí et al 2017 have also been conducted because the bioclogging stimulated by do injection can form a low permeability region in the vicinity of the well screen a microbially mediated skin should be involved in well hydraulics overall we investigated the microbial effects on the flow from an injection well the skin effect has received increasing attention in recent years yang and yeh 2009 wen et al 2011 wang et al 2012 wen and wang 2013 feng and wen 2016 li et al 2018 the conclusion is that the type and thickness of skin greatly influence the drawdown in the skin zone but have little effect on the drawdown in the formation zone feng and wen 2016 with respect to a single well test without an observation well wen and wang 2013 and li et al 2018 reported that the drawdown in the pumping well with positive skin which indicates the skin zone has lower hydraulic conductivity than the formation zone yeh and chang 2013 is higher than that without skin wen et al 2011 concluded that a relatively thick positive skin results in a reduced well discharge therefore in this study a bioamended skin effect on hydraulic parameter estimation through a single well test was apparently inevitable considering that the hydraulic data inside the injection well were the only reference for parameter estimation although microbial effects are very likely to affect the parameter estimation by aquifer tests such effects have almost never been carefully investigated which is most likely because of a few limitations first in petroleum contaminated aquifers with the huge diversity of contaminants and microbes leahy and colwell 1990 magot et al 2000 gennadiev et al 2015 the biogeochemical processes particularly the initiation mechanism of aerobic respiration as soon as do is captured are difficult to express accurately moreover bioclogging mediated by reactive transport has been rarely involved in the skin effect of well hydraulics during the last decades biologists have developed various bioclogging models for hydraulic property changes taylor et al 1990 vandevivere 1995 clement et al 1996 seki and miyazaki 2001 hydraulicians particularly well hydraulicians have deeply investigated the skin effect on aquifer tests novakowski 1989 chiu et al 2007 wen et al 2011 and environmentalists have studied experimentally or theoretically the incorporation of bioclogging flow field and solute transport kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 thullner 2010 seifert and engesgaard 2012 newcomer et al 2016 2018 caruso et al 2017 however the bioclogging induced skin effects on parameter estimation due to reactive transport coupled with microbial growth have been rarely investigated the microbially mediated skin controlled by reactive transport indicates that both the skin thickness and permeability are temporally variable which is completely different from the skins of yang and yeh 2009 wen et al 2011 wang et al 2012 wen and wang 2013 and feng and wen 2016 all of which set a skin with constant thickness and permeability although li et al 2018 investigated a nonuniform skin the thickness was prescribed by a sinusoidal function of the vertical coordinate as an initial condition and did not vary temporally hence this study investigated how the microbial effects i e the bioclogging induced skin effects caused by reactive transport after do injection affected the hydraulic conductivity estimation with a single well injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer for this purpose we developed accordingly a mathematical model in the case of single well injection the petroleum contaminants were treated as a non aqueous phase liquid napl which when released into the aqueous phase produced various dissolved phcs among which benzene toluene and xylene btx were the most representative these three species and do were involved in the reactive transport in our model additionally these phcs had their immobile phase due to the adsorption to medium particles the microbes were also classified into immobile and mobile phases and the interrelationship between the two phases was dominated by attachment and detachment processes the model integrated radial groundwater flow reactive transport of multispecies and multiphase interactions with temporal and spatial hydraulic parameter variations due to bioclogging 2 problem statement of the single well bioaffected injection test figure 1 is a schematic program of an injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer both the water and oxygen are transported along the radial direction i e the r axis in this cylindrical system and toward infinity from the well the aquifer is axisymmetric where the point intersected by the well s central axis and the aquifer bottom is the origin the well fully penetrates the aquifer which has uniform thickness radially prior to injection a contaminated region existed around a well with radius rcont which also supports a limited amount of microbes and bioclogging due to low do concentration hence the aquifer is initially homogeneous and isotropic horizontally except in the contaminated region the blue domain black dots and red markers indicate the do spreading contaminants and microbes respectively the mathematical model of this injection test considering bioclogging is depicted below 2 1 groundwater flow in a nonuniform aquifer under axisymmetric case because of the arrival of high concentration do the interparticle biogrowth near the well makes the homogeneous aquifer heterogeneous hence this model considered flow in a nonuniform aquifer under the axisymmetric case additionally the wellbore storage was considered and the injection rate was supposed as constant the aquifer system before injection was recognized as hydrostatic therefore the mathematical description of the flow model can be depicted as papadopulos and cooper 1967 wen et al 2008 2011 1 1 r r q r s m s t 2 s r t 0 0 3 s r t 0 4 2 π r w m q r r w π r c 2 d s w

which remains negative for injecting q s and s are the specific velocity l t drawdown l and storage coefficient respectively q is calculated as 5 q k r t s r where k r t indicates the hydraulic conductivity l t and can be changed temporally and spatially because of bioclogging 2 2 reactive transport in a nonuniform aquifer under axisymmetric case the governing equation to describe multispecies advection dispersion reaction is gelhar and collins 1971 moench 1989 6 r ret c i t 1 r r rd c i r v a c i r r i where ci indicates the concentration of each mobile component i m l3 at radial distance r l and time t t including do mobile btx and mobile biomass ri is the source and sink item due to the biochemical reaction rret is the retardation factor va is the average pore

as 8 d r α v a d 0 where α is the dispersivity l d 0 indicates the effective molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t for description convenience we prescribed i to be 1 for do 2 for mobile btx and 3 for mobile biomass the initial and boundary conditions for do were different from those for the other two components do concentration was initially low and uniform over the whole confined aquifer and do had an only external supply from the injection well which can be described as 9 c 1 r t 0 c 1 ini 10 c 1 r t r 0 11 v a c 1 d c 1 r r r w v a c 1 inj r r w where c 1 ini indicates the initial do concentration and the infinite boundary concentration m l3 c 1 inj represents the do concentration in the injection well m l3 considering that the mobile btx was composed of benzene toluene and xylene c2 was prescribed with another subscript j as c2 j to represent the dissolved concentration of each component m l3 all dissolved phcs were considered initially to fill a certain area around the well and their initial and boundary concentrations were zero which can be expressed as 12 c 2 j 0 r r s t 0 c 2 j ini 13 c 2 j r r s t 0 0 14 c 2 j r t r 0 15 v a c 2 j d c 2 j r r r w 0 where rs indicates the dividing point between contaminated and clean regions l c 2 j ini is the initial mobile concentration of the jth dissolved phc m l3 which can be regarded as a historical legacy from napl release and calculated as 16 c 2 j ini c 2 ini f j where c 2 ini is the initial dissolved napl concentration m l3 and fj is the mole fraction of each component in the napl because the rich phcs could support a certain amount of biomass with oxygen limitation the mobile biomass had same initial and boundary conditions to mobile btx as 16 c 3 0 r r s t 0 c 3 m o b ini 17 c 3 r r s t 0 0 18 c 3 r t r 0 19 v a c 3 d c 3 r r r w 0 where c 3 mob ini is the initial mobile biomass concentration m l3 correspondingly the initial immobile biomass concentration is denoted as c 3 i m m ini the values of parameters with respect to the configuration of the aquifer and initial and boundary conditions are listed in table 1 2 3 source and sink 2 3 1 napl release and phc sorption for btx the mass transfer from napl to aqueous phase is actually the hydrocarbon dissolution which is a rate limited process brauner and widdowson 2001 the rate of napl release rnapl expressed by waddill and widdowson 2000 is 20 r napl j k napl c eq j c 3 j where knapl is the mass transfer rate coefficient 1 t rnapl j is the mass transfer rate of the jth phc 1 t ceq j is the equilibrium concentration of the jth phc m l3 and can be calculated as 21 c eq j c sol j f j where csol j is the pure phase solubility of the jth phc in water m l3 the sorption process of btx causes retardation of the whole reactive transport process for a linear sorption model the retardation factor of each component is expressed as 22 r ret j 1 ρ bulk θ k d j where ρ bulk is the bulk density of the medium m l3 k d j is the distribution coefficient of the jth component l3 m the parameters involved in the properties of btx components are listed in table 2 2 3 2 attachment and detachment of biomass the attachment and detachment processes of biomass are relatively microscopic the attachment rate was computed through colloid filtration theory as harvey and garabedian 1991 scheibe et al 2007 23 k att 3 1 θ v a η 2 d g where dg is the mean characteristic grain diameter l η is the collector efficiency which indicates the frequency of collisions between mobile and attached phases and is calculated as martin et al 1996 24 η 4 a s 1 3 n pe

γ 1 θ 1 3 the remaining parameters involved in the above equations are defined in table 3 the buildup of biomass and the reduction of pore space lead to an increase in flow velocity which eventually leads to significant detachment of biomass due to the increasing shear forces therefore we employed the semiempirical equation proposed by rittmann 1982 which has been used by brovelli et al 2009 for bioclogging model development to express the velocity dependent detachment rate as 31 k det c d γ v a 1 θ 3 d p 2 θ 3 m 0 58 the parameters involved are listed in table 3 2 3 3 microbially mediated reaction the microbially mediated reaction is described by a michaelis menton type equation whereas the biomass decays by a first order kinetic process the biomass growth was assumed to be limited by do electron acceptor concentration dissolved phcs electron donor and biomass concentration we assumed that both mobile and immobile biomass could conduct the reaction the michaelis menton type equation for our model is 32 r mob j μ max j c 3 m o b c 2 j c 2 j k 2 j c 1 c 1 k 1 f 33 r imm j μ max j c 3 i m m c 2 j c 2 j k 2 j c 1 c 1 k 1 f where r mob j and r imm j are the growth rate of mobile m l3 t and immobile biomass m m t respectively due to the consumption of the jth phc with c3 mob indicating mobile biomass m l3 and c3 imm immobile biomass m m μ max j is the maximum growth rate with consuming the jth phc 1 t k 1 and k 2 j are the half saturation constants of do m l3 and the jth phc m l3 f is the limitation factor which accounts for the effects of limited pore space on growth and is computed as kildsgaard and engesgaard 2001 34 f 1 c 3 i m m ρ bulk ρ s θ clean where ρ bulk is the bulk density m l3 and ρs is the density of biomass m dry biomass l3 water θ clean is the effective porosity of a clean aquifer the decay rate of mobile or immobile biomass was computed as 35 r dec m o b i m m c 3 m o b i m m k dec where k dec is the decay rate of mobile or immobile biomass 1 t the consumption rate of each dissolved btx component was expressed as 36 r rea j 1 y j r mob j r imm j ρ bulk θ where rrea j indicates the consumption rate of the jth phc m l3 t yj is the yield coefficient of the jth phc the consumption rate of do was expressed as 37 r o r rea b f b r rea t f t r rea x f x where ro is the do consumption rate due to the aerobic biodegradation of all phcs m l3 t rb rt and rx are the consumption rate of dissolved benzene toluene and xylene concentration respectively as eq 36 indicates m l3 t fb ft and fx are the consumption ratios of benzene toluene and xylene to oxygen respectively upon the integration of the different processes the reactive transport of each species can be described as the following odes 38 c 1 t 1 r r rd c 1 r v a c 1

benzene b toluene t and xylene x with respect to mobile and immobile biomass respectively 2 4 bioclogging effects several bioclogging models are listed in the introduction section and considering that our model serves for a field site problem the spatial configuration that depends on the interparticle characteristics was not the best choice for the incorporation into our reactive transport model instead we employed the macroscopic approach clement et al 1996 which involves little about the microscopic biomass distribution but focuses more on the assemblage of biofilm colonies and plugs at pore throats the occupation fraction of the total pore volume θ bio was calculated with the macroscopic approach as 42 θ bio c 3 i m m ρ bulk ρ s the bioclogging affected porosity θ which can be substituted into eq 7 to modify the average pore velocity is 43 θ θ clean θ bio the macroscopic model of clement et al 1996 relates hydraulic conductivity to biomass affected porosity as 44 k k clean θ θ clean 19 6 where kclean is the hydraulic conductivity without any bioclogging effects l t k is the biomass affected hydraulic conductivity l t and can be substituted into eq 5 for the next iteration to implement the effects on flow due to bioclogging the parameters involved in the microbially mediated reaction and bioclogging are listed in table 3 3 numerical solution we employed the finite difference method to solve the reactive transport model considering multispecies and multiphases the details for discretization are shown in appendix a first the use of benchmark solutions to test the accuracies of our solute transport models was essential because many studies state that numerical errors can occur because of inappropriate temporal or spatial discretization when using the finite difference method for the solute transport model without considering oxygen consumption the semianalytical solution of moench and ogata 1981 can be used as the benchmark solution with its laplace domain solution expressed as 45 c c inj p exp r r w 2 α r a i p 2 3 pr α r 0 25 a i p 2 3 p r w α r 0 25 where c is the concentration in the laplace domain p is the laplace variable ai is the airy function of the first kind to solve eq 45 this study employed the stehfest method stehfest 1970a b to conduct the analytical inverse laplace transformation figure 2 is the comparison between semi analytical solution and numerical solution for the solute transport model with the parameters listed in table 1 the high consistency indicated that the results of the numerical method coincided very well with those of the semi analytical method with different observation radii from the well hence the conclusions were that the numerical solutions for the solute transport performed well and that the discretization for the finite difference method was reliable to support the accurate description of other source and sink items which can cause spatial and temporal variation in permeability 4 results 4 1 microbially mediated skin effect figure 3 reveals the spatial and temporal reduction in hydraulic conductivity initially due to extremely low do concentration the weak biomass accumulation resulted in a very limited reduction in hydraulic conductivity several percent the limited reduction coincided with the tiny curve discrepancy between the theis case and the microbially affected case at early times as shown in fig 4 the theis case does not consider any skin effect according to the characteristics of aquifer test duration we defined early times as 0 to 1 104 s intermediately late times as 1 104 to 1 105 s and super late times as later than 1 105 s as shown in fig 4 as fig 3 shows at intermediately late times a distinct nonuniform reduction in hydraulic conductivity 18 30 percent was found from the well screen to several decimeters distant correspondingly the curve discrepancy between the two cases expands greatly at intermediately late times in fig 4 at super late times the reduction in hydraulic conductivity decreased and eventually became zero i e the bioclogging vanished as the injection continued accordingly as fig 4 reveals the microbially affected curve approaches the theis curve at super late times the convergence was observed because at early times the head around the well had not reached steady state and groundwater velocity was low due to the low hydraulic gradient resulting in less influence of transport on the reaction therefore the essential food for microbes had a sufficiently long residence time to undergo the microbial reaction contributing to the accumulation of biomass at early times and partial intermediately late times when the intermediately late times were almost completed the groundwater cone of uplift around the well reached a steady state with the highest hydraulic gradient within the entire injection period the groundwater velocity also became the highest with the result that the effects of transport overwhelmed those of reaction i e the essential microbial food was flushed and diluted to the downstream instead of participating in the reaction moreover no external supplies were available for both microbes and contaminants and the only source of btx was the dissolution of phcs high groundwater velocity not only increased the detachment rate of immobile biomass but also resulted in less residence time for the mobile btx and biomass to conduct the reaction actually we were interested in the performance of the microbially affected curve at intermediately late times first if such a test was conducted in the field the observed data of the wellhead would very likely perform the same as indicated by the curve from our model or at least it is highly possible that the field data of a wellhead in a contaminated aquifer would deviate from those in a clean aquifer at intermediately late times additionally considering the influences of wellbore storage on early drawdown novakowski 1989 pasandi et al 2008 the field data at intermediately late times are more reliable for parameter estimation therefore the microbially mediated processes involved in this model are of a great significance in the hydraulic parameter estimation 4 2 sensitivity analysis to investigate how the wellhead was affected a sensitivity analysis was conducted because of the variety of parameters involved in this bioamended reactive transport model sensitivity analysis on all parameters would be cumbersome instead we chose the parameters that depended much on artificial factors aquifer properties biomass and phc properties which are parameters that affect directly the reactive transport process therefore the parameters we selected for sensitivity analysis were injection rate q hydraulic conductivity of a clean aquifer kclean the initial concentration of mobile biomass c 3 m o b ini the initial concentration of mobile btx concentration c 2 ini the maximum growth rate μ max j and the yield coefficient of each phc yj similar to kabala 2001 and huang and yeh 2007 the normalized sensitivity of the abovementioned parameters was calculated and the results are shown in fig 5 every parameter increment had a distinct impact on the head in the injection well at intermediately late times however only q and kclean had the greatest impacts through the entire injection period the large effects were observed because both q and kclean not only dominated directly the head in the whole flow field even without any microbial effects but also affected indirectly the reactive transport through the modulation of groundwater velocity for the other parameters c 2 ini and μ max j had the second greatest influences during the bioclogging period followed by c 3 m o b ini these three parameters reflected the initiation foundation and production ability for microbial growth because abundant food and sufficiently vigorous microbes can support a normal microbial metabolism and influential bioclogging yj influenced indirectly the microbial growth through the consumption of substrate thus yj represented the lowest effects 4 3 parameter estimation to estimate accurately the hydraulic parameters based on the single wellhead obtained from the injection test the two most frequently used methods were adopted which were the type curve fitting method based upon the theis formula 1935 and the straight line fitting method through cooper jacob approximation cooper and jacob 1946 to date several software programs have been developed on the above theoretical basis to assist the estimation of hydraulic parameters such as aquifertest aqtesolv and aquifer well test among others obviously regardless of the fitting method employed for parameter estimation the aim is to best match the observed data with a theoretical curve or line therefore the fitting error should be minimized as much as possible in this study we used the cooper jacob straight line fitting method as an example to explain how bioclogging affects the parameter estimation with the single well injection test the relevant knowledge about the cooper jacob straight line fitting method is provided in appendix c the algorithm we adopted for fitting was the least square method which has been employed in both type curve fitting maslia and randolph 1987 maslia and prowell 1990 motz 2009 and straight line approximation fitting maslia and randolph 1987 we assumed our modeling results were the analogue of measured data i e the performance of the bioaffected head in the actual test was completely accordant to our modeling results note that the measuring time interval in an actual aquifer test was unnecessarily the same as the temporal step in our model and in such a semilog coordinate the result was that the weight of intermediately late data bioaffected data was different between modeling and field test when applying the least square method however the modeling data remained qualitatively adequate to indicate the microbial effects on parameter estimation figure 6 reveals different cases about the bioaffected estimation on hydraulic conductivity in the semilog x coordinate the black markers which were calculated based on the theis model theis 1935 for a clean aquifer without any microbial effects represent a base case the black line which fits the black markers very well has the slope that yields the hydraulic conductivity of a clean aquifer which is the kclean in fact moreover all the other cases were microbially affected and among them the red markers indicate the bioaffected case with the default parameter values listed in tables 1 3 obviously the bioclogging resulted in an abnormal bulge of red markers at intermediately late times thus the red line which was also fitted to the red markers by the least square method yielded a higher slope than that of the black line as eq c 6 in appendix c indicates when a slope g is obtained by the least square method the bioaffected hydraulic conductivity kbio can be calculated as 46 k bio 0 183 q gm which can be compared to kclean to determine the degree of parameter underestimation for the other three cases in fig 6 each of them doubled the default value of one parameter the green one doubled the injection rate q the indigotic one doubled the maximum growth rate with the consumption of each btx contamination μ max j and the blue one doubled the initial mobile btx concentration c 2 ini similar to the previous fitting and calculation procedure each of these three cases reached an underestimation degree additionally we also doubled the initial hydraulic conductivity kclean and the contamination radius rcont to determine the underestimation degrees the underestimation degrees of all abovementioned cases are listed in table 4 we defined the underestimation degree of k as kclean kbio kclean as fig 6 and table 4 indicate the default case yielded an underestimation degree of 17 7 based on which a doubled q reduced this value to 11 9 which was because an increasing q resulted in an increasing porous velocity near the well that not only accelerated the detachment of biomass from the adsorbed phase but also flushed all mobile materials for microbial metabolism including mobile biomass contamination and do to the downstream within an exponentially growing area therefore we inferred that an increase in injection rate led to a dilution effect on this solute transport system and relaxed the bioclogging effect resulting in an underestimation lower than that with a reduced injection rate by contrast a doubled c 2 ini and a doubled μ max j expanded the underestimation degree to 39 5 and 31 1 respectively this expansion was because both these factors directly influenced the reaction rate and at large values microbial growth was stimulated causing a series of hydraulic data with the strongest bioclogging at intermediately late times resulting in the fitting process yielding a reduced hydraulic conductivity additionally doubling kclean and rcont had very limited influence with both yielding an underestimation degree of nearly 17 7 similar to the default case which was because an increase in kclean did not lead to either additional do into the system or promote the groundwater velocity considering that it was a constant rate injection rather than constant head injection test for rcont although its expansion indicated more electron donors in the system the limited test duration could only support the solute transport to a very restricted radius which indicated the electron donors added could not be utilized therefore similar to kclean an increase in contamination radius also had little influence 4 4 interrelation between underestimation degree and damköhler number notably an increase in q apparently had two opposite effects on microbial growth one was the addition of electron acceptors do into the contaminated system to stimulate metabolism and the other one was flushing and diluting the essential materials for the microbial reaction to inhibit metabolism therefore we introduced the damköhler number da to compare the roles of reaction and transport in this system normally the da is defined as the ratio of the characteristic reaction rate rc to the characteristic transport rate τ as zarnetske et al 2012 47 d a r c τ in our model the accurate depiction of both the reaction and transport rates was difficult because our model had neither a simple first order reaction rate nor a steady state flow field hence we advanced another approximate expression of d a o 2 with respect to do as 48 d ao a j b t x μ max j b j q c 1 inj with 49 a 2 π r cont 2 m θ clean c 3 m o b ini 50 b j f j y j where a j b t x μ max j b j represents the do consumption rate m t when all microorganisms in this system work in biodegradation a indicates the total initial concentration of biomass based on mobile and immobile biomass with the same initial amount for the attach detachment balance with a equal to double the mobile concentration of mobile biomass j b t x μ max j b j is the sum of do consumption coefficients of all phc degradation processes indicating the do consumption rate of unit concentration microorganism with a dimension 1 t q c 1 inj reveals the rate of do injection into the system m t which can represent the transport velocity inside the system therefore when the do injection rate overwhelms the do consumption rate the value of d a o 2 is small indicating that transport is the dominant process in this system whereas when the opposite occurs reaction dominates figure 7 reveals the relationship between underestimation degree and d a o 2 with respect to different initial mobile btx concentration c 2 ini along the horizontal d a o 2 axis logarithmic based on the default value d a o 2 3 3 the d a o 2 value decreases with an increasing q and increases with increasing μ max j or c 3 m o b ini the underestimation degree decreased as the d a o 2 decreased until zero was approached i e when the injection rate was sufficiently large the underestimation could be eliminated theoretically however the underestimation degree increased as the d a o 2 increased i e initially sufficient vigorous biomass strongly negatively influenced the hydraulic parameter estimation moreover with the same values of d a o 2 as fig 7 shows the underestimation degree increased with an increasing initial btx concentration indicating that a relatively contaminated site is unfavorable for conducting this aquifer test however when the contaminated degree is low the underestimation degree can most likely be neglected or at least a hydraulic conductivity is yielded with the same order of magnitude as its actual value 5 discussion this study investigated the microbial effects on well hydraulics through a model of a single well injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer the underestimation degree was quantified through cooper jacob straight line fitting coupled with the least square method additionally an approximate damköhler number was advanced to quantitatively and comprehensively describe the effect of each parameter on the underestimation degree our work provides insights into the data interpretation in an actual single well injection test affected by bioclogging and some solutions to decrease the underestimation degree in such a case are proposed despite the originality of this research topic the study is after all only a numerical modeling study based on a simplified approximation of an extremely complicated system in reality the phc contaminated aquifer had compounds in addition to benzene toluene and xylene as table 5 shows nevertheless btx had higher solubility and greater molar fraction than inert decane and the btx properties with respect to reactive transport have been widely investigated therefore we think that using btx to represent the entire group of phcs was reasonably feasible additionally the microbial world of this phc contaminated site was difficult to accurately depict for a hydrologist the microbial detection before conducting an aquifer test is always an extra cost and the trigger mechanism for aerobic respiration after do injection is most likely unpredictable however this study provided a hint of the microbial effects that could actually occur on the single well injection test the lgs lgt or s lgt curve would show an abnormal bulge at a specific time when this bulge occurs the aquifer tester can avoid the effects of bioaffected data by increasing the injection rate or extending the test duration moreover with the absence of microscopic observation of the microbial community accurate depiction of the pore scale pattern of biogrowth was difficult considering also the least empirical parameters required in eqs 42 44 we adopted the macroscopic model clement et al 1996 rather than the other models taylor et al 1990 vandevivere 1995 seki and miyazaki 2001 to depict bioaffected parameters nevertheless for the homogeneous aquifer in our model the pore size distribution index λ is normally a large value brooks and corey 1964 such as 2 to 5 clement et al 1996 demonstrated that when λ equals 3 the macroscopic model is essentially equivalent to the biofilm model taylor et al 1990 and even the other values of λ between 2 and 5 produce very limited deviation between macroscopic and biofilm models as rockhold et al 2002 state a universally applicable model to describe the bioaffected hydraulic parameter in saturated porous medium is difficult to identify but when one must describe the bioclogging induced permeability with regard to our scenario the macroscopic model is the most reasonable and convenient to investigate the bioclogging effects on parameter estimation additionally the bioclogging at super late times tended to vanish in our model because of the high detachment rate and short residence time for reaction however this result is in contrast to the wide understanding that 100 cleanup of the microbial community is theoretically impossible under this situation speitel et al 1987 observed 33 and 67 detachments of newly formed biomass with phenol and paranitrophenol respectively as substrates in a packed column reactor rao et al 1992 reported over 70 detachment of the newly generated biomass in a concentric cylinder bioreactor gjaltema et al 1995 adopted biofilm airlift suspension reactors with different configurations and found two distinguishing phases of detachment processes with the detachment rate in the first phase relatively high and that in the second phase much lower obviously none of those previous studies obtained 100 detachment of biomass actually eq 31 expressing the detachment rate was first developed by rittmann 1982 to address the criticism of the steady state biofilm theory rittmann et al 1980 1982 which considered biomass decay as the only loss mechanism but neglected the effects of shear stress nevertheless the test duration and lack of external electron donors make it difficult for our model to reach rittmann s steady state thus the detachment rate of rittmann 1982 is most likely not a fit for our model compared with the detachment most likely causing great disappearance of bioclogging at super late times in our model the first quick and then slow microbial detachment of gjaltema et al 1995 is more reasonable however the results of gjaltema et al 1995 are derived only from experiments and an absence of universal expressions for the detachment rate remains conversely rittmann s detachment rate can provide a worst case of biomass loss with respect to detachment i e if our scenario in fact could not reach a steady state such as that of rittmann et al 1980 1982 then the detachment induced biomass loss would not be as much as our current model calculated at super late times then the bioclogging effects would not disappear that soon and the bulge of the s lgt or lgs lgt curve at intermediately late times would approach flatness slowly and most likely not superpose the theis case curve at super late times therefore in an actual field test the curve performance at super late times can be checked thoroughly and when the extended test duration cannot weaken the bioclogging effects increasing the injection rate can efficiently decrease the parameter underestimation as fig 6 reveals additionally the effects of gas production on permeability in saturated system have been widely reported gardescu 1930 oberdorfer and peterson 1985 fry et al 1997 seki et al 1998 for example seki et al 1998 found the reduction of hydraulic conductivity was due to the methane generated by the microbes that feed on glucose oberdorfer and peterson 1985 reported the same observation which resulted from nitrogen production in this study the endogenous microbes in the aquifer are presumed to be responsible for the production of the gases as by product of fermentation or anaerobic respiration which is ignored in our model nevertheless the microbial growth rate of aerobic respiration is much greater than that of other metabolism patterns grishchenkov et al 2000 chapelle et al 2002 and the gaseous by product of aerobic respiration is carbon dioxide which is much more soluble than the anaerobic gases consequently the gas production in our model can be assumed to have limited impact on the hydraulic conductivity finally despite the consideration for growth decay attachment detachment and transport the starvation and dormancy affecting the microbial dynamics were not involved in our model we assumed the microbial reaction to be energy spilling at any time but neglected the oligotrophic effects in some local sites due to zero external carbon supply stolpovsky et al 2011 developed a transition mechanism between active and dormant cells by comparing the actual gibbs energy released and the maintenance energy tijhuis et al 1993 hess et al 1996 when the redox reaction does not generate sufficient energy for maintenance requirements the active biomass goes through starvation transforming into a dormant state that can no longer grow via biodegradation except for the maintenance energy to express an oligotrophic growth rate the thermodynamic limitation factor developed by jin and bethke 2007 and larowe and van cappellen 2011 in different forms relates directly the growth rate with the gibbs energy released from redox reactions for our model although the groundwater flush resulted in an oligotrophic environment at super late times we presume that the dormant biomass attached onto medium particles should continue to preserve a certain bioclogging ability which also supports the phenomenon that not all biomass is flushed down speitel et al 1987 rao et al 1992 nevertheless to involve bioenergetics in our model was not feasible because the maintenance energy is not an easily accessible parameter and the gibbs energy calculation involves temperature atp synthesis energy activity and stoichiometric coefficient of each reactant and some other energy related parameters would result in huge computation cost and calculation errors to the best of our knowledge no universal methods exist to mathematically depict both eutrophic and oligotrophic effects on microbial metabolism therefore the microbial metabolism at super late times might be more complicated than that presented here this limitation of our model was most relaxed by increasing the injection rate rather than extending the test duration since higher injection rate can efficiently smooth the bulge of drawdown time curve still extending the test duration may not be adequate to completely eliminate the bioclogging due to the oligotrophic metabolism of biomass although all the parameters employed in our model are cited from previous literature more efforts of actual field tests are required to calibrate some parameters we used furthermore our numerical modeling with respect to the microbially mediated reactive transport process should be validated by previous models or actual field data considering the limited availability of studies which can provide a benchmark solution to our model thus we conducted a field test for our model with chemical and microbial assistance despite this limitation our work can arouse extensive awareness of microbial effects on well hydraulics in some circumstances and give theoretical interpretation and treatment methods if one encounters the problems described here such as the abnormal bulge in the drawdown time curve 6 summary and conclusions in this study the necessity to consider microbial effects in a single well injection test in a petroleum contaminated area was first elaborated and then a mathematical model combining radial groundwater flow solute transport and microbial growth together in the case of an injection test in a petroleum contaminated confined aquifer was presented considering temporal and spatial variations in permeability due to microbial growth we compared the heads in the injection well between bioclogged and clean aquifer cases and employed sensitivity analysis and cooper jacob straight line fitting associated with the least square method to reach the following several conclusions 1 the bioclogging resulted in an abnormal bulge of the drawdown time curve at intermediately late times of the injection 2 extending the test duration might moderately reduce the underestimation degree but considering the modeling limitations increasing the injection rate would more likely achieve this effect 3 high initial biomass or contaminant concentration and a biomass with a high maximum growth rate expanded the underestimation degree 4 the effect of each parameter on the underestimation degree can be efficiently revealed by an approximate damköhler number in the discussion section the composition simplification of petroleum contaminant the choice of bioclogging model and the neglect of effects of gas production on permeability have been demonstrated to be reasonable in our model the oligotrophic metabolism of biomass that may support the later survival of bioclogging is not a strong limitation if the injection rate is increased declaration of interests none acknowledgements this research was partially supported by the

6518,groundwater serves as a significant freshwater supply for coastal regions in many coastal areas extensive islands have been created by filling the sea these reclaimed islands not only provide valuable space for urban development but also can serve as valuable aquifers recharge of fresh water from rainfall can flush out salt water and eventually create a freshwater lens beneath the reclaimed island however how a fresh groundwater lens grows in reclaimed islands and the factors that control its growth are unclear here we use a series of three dimensional density dependent flow and transport models to investigate the process of fresh salt water mixing and quantify the potential maximum volume of fresh groundwater that can occur beneath reclaimed islands our results show that the recharge rate controls the growth rate and the initialization of the fresh groundwater lens whereas the permeability of the underlying fill materials and bedrock determines the shape of freshwater lens beneath the island but has a minor influence on freshwater volume increasing porosity enlarges the total water volume but diminishes the proportion of fresh water as the larger volume of original salt water in the aquifer requires more recharge to flush and dilute longitudinal dispersivity promotes the fresh salt water circulation in a certain range but limits the maximum fresh volume storage and vertical transverse dispersivity facilitates extending mixing areas to enlarge the freshwater lens heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field increases the variability of groundwater flow restricts the average speed of fresh salt water circulation and results in a decrease in the growth rate and maximum volume of the freshwater lens our study has large implications for planning and management of reclaimed lands for water sustainability in the future in coastal areas keywords fresh groundwater reclaimed island density dependent flow numerical model scenarios 1 introduction water scarcity in coastal areas within 100 km of the ocean is well known these areas contain 40 the world s population and eight of the ten largest cities in the world are located along coastlines creel 2003 oude essink 2001 reed 2010 siirilä 2010 small islands nations face water scarcity problems under increasing population and climate change bailey et al 2016 holding et al 2016 white and falkland 2009 groundwater can serve as a critical source of drinking water and can maintain coastal ecosystems in small island nations i e controlling salinity danielopol et al 2003 hancock et al 2005 however freshwater resources on small islands are generally limited and frequently overexploited resulting in saline water intrusion therefore retaining and storing more fresh water from rainfall is important for solving water scarcity issues reclaimed islands not only provide valuable land for urban development e g industrial base recreation and commercial ground or residential area but also can be important freshwater aquifers to retain rainfall and store fresh water roughly 173 000 km2 was converted from water to land between 1985 and 2015 worldwide and reclaimed land construction in coastal countries is one of the most important ways to increase the urban area donchyts et al 2016 examples of reclaimed land include the largest reclaimed island of palm island and its adjacent islands in dubai that cover about 80 km2 for recreation rectangular reclaimed island of kansai international airport 38 km2 in japan developed for transportation about 76 km2 of reclaimed island in singapore constructed for supporting industrial use donchyts et al 2016 the impact of coastal land reclamation on groundwater levels and the sea water interface has been investigated with steady state analytical solutions guo and jiao 2007 groundwater lenses beneath these reclaimed islands are analogous to those beneath natural island werner et al 2017 but differences exist the similarity is represented by the structure of groundwater a convex lens of fresh groundwater overlying denser salt water underwood et al 1992 the size and shape of the fresh lenses are controlled by the geologic framework and hydrodynamic process schneider and kruse 2005 the difference between artificial islands and natural islands is manifested by the shape and the geologic structure artificial sedimentary sequence created by multiple sources of filling materials and compaction technology alzaylaie and abdelaziz 2016 yan et al 2013 the characteristics of groundwater lenses on natural islands are influenced by the long term recharge rate and the hydraulic conductivity of underlying holocene sediments gingerich et al 2017 wallace and bailey 2017 the vertical permeability and vertical longitudinal dispersion caused by vertically oscillating flow control the mixing process for small atoll islands underwood et al 1992 limited by data availability and high computation requirements these factors are normally evaluated using two dimensional models or models with short simulation times three dimensional flow patterns and mixing processes under multiple varying variables are difficult to assess furthermore geologic heterogeneities influence the geometry of freshwater lens bailey et al 2013 dose et al 2014 prasad and simmons 2003 vacher 1988 however how the heterogeneity of the strata comprising the freshwater lens influences the behavior of flow pattern and maximum freshwater storage is poorly understood reclaimed islands worldwide are one of the most important potential reservoirs for land limited coastal areas the hydrologic dynamics including subsurface flow and transport processes of such potential reservoirs and sensitivities of variables on freshwater lens beneath reclaimed islands are mostly unclear this fundamental but missing insight is necessary for future water sustainability of the world one key gap is the extent to which fresh groundwater is retained in these artificial aquifers and how the flow and transport variables control the volume of the freshwater lens that develops to investigate the pattern of the freshwater lens mixing process of salt water and fresh recharge and maximum fresh groundwater storage in reclaimed islands a 3 d numerical density dependent flow and transport model was constructed simulations of 100 years were performed using 20 scenarios with varying flow parameters of recharge rate hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy and transport parameters of porosity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivity to explore the effects of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity of reclaimed aquifers on flow patterns and mixing behaviors a gaussian sequential model was used to generate heterogeneous conductivity fields of varying complexity for multiple scenarios the results of this modeling investigation provide broad knowledge for reclaimed meta project planning and sustainable coastal development in the future as well as knowledge for guiding aquifer recharge management for existing reclaimed lands 2 methodology 2 1 model development this study uses numerical flow and transport models to evaluate the processes of freshwater lens growth beneath reclaimed islands and investigate the role of flow and transport parameters in controlling freshwater lens growth the seawat code langevin et al 2003 which couples modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 was used to simulate the density dependent flow that occurs beneath reclaimed islands a base model was first developed for a generalized reclaimed groundwater system a rectangular domain was designed to represent a reclaimed island measuring 5 km long by 2 km wide with permeable sediments to a depth of 40 m below the land surface fig 1 according to the reports of reclaimed construction van t hoff and van der kolff 2012 the domain was conceptualized as mainly two lithologic layers sand silty sand as well as gravel and sand layer at the top and a bedrock layer at the bottom each layer of the base model was specified as homogeneous and isotropic along the horizontal direction the domain was discretized into 50 m grids with 40 rows and 100 columns and the two lithological layers were refined to 20 model layers for better vertical resolution in the model simulations the model has a total of 80 000 grids cells the time step of the base model was daily and the total simulated time was 100 years to simulate the growth in the volume of fresh groundwater lenses the base model included a steady state simulation and 36 500 transient time steps and the model was considered to attain convergence when each transient simulation converged within 0 01 m3 d of the water budget the robustness of the solution was tested by a separate model with 25 m and 100 m grids the simulated groundwater levels concentrations and fluid densities were consistent between the two separate models results differed by 0 01 0 0001 and 0 01 respectively thus the solution is considered insensitive to the model discretization used the unconsolidated fill materials of the reclaimed island are assumed to be saturated with salt water following construction so the salinity of the original groundwater is 35 g l the top flow boundary condition of the base model was a specified recharge flux which represents the infiltrated rainfall to the groundwater table net precipitation after an interception by surface flow and evaporation the initial recharge rate of the base model was assigned a value in the range of 0 001 0 003 m d as estimated from previous studies underwood et al 1992 the salinity of recharge from rainfall was assigned 0 g l the same as pure fresh water a specified head boundary was assigned to the island boundary for all layers to represent the specified sea level around the model domain a salinity of 35 g l was assigned to this specified sea boundary based on parameter values from published references the flow and transport parameters were assigned to the base model table 1 the initial horizontal hydraulic conductivity k was assigned a value of 10 m d for the top 18 model layers and 0 1 m d for the bottom two model layers representing bedrock specific storage ss was assigned a value of 0 0002 1 m and anisotropy ansi the ratio of horizontal hydraulic conductivity to vertical hydraulic conductivity was assigned a value of 3 transport parameters included porosity p longitudinal dispersivity al schulze makuch 2005 and vertical transverse dispersivity atv were assigned values of 0 3 20 m and 0 2 m respectively 2 2 quantification of fresh lens growth and maximum storage we used a salinity of 1 0 g l as the upper threshold for fresh groundwater which is the world health organization guideline for drinking water world health organization 2004 the percentage of volume pv which is the ratio of freshwater volume to total volume of water in the reclaimed aquifer is used to quantify the freshwater growth rather than the thickness of the freshwater lens as the purpose of this study is to explore the potential maximum volume of fresh groundwater in three dimensions the maximum freshwater storage maxs is considered to be attained when pv remains steady with time however the maximum volume is not attained under some parameter combinations within 100 years in these situations we use the result from the last time step of the 100 year simulation as the maxs as the original groundwater in the reclaimed aquifers is sea water salinity of 35 g l some time is required after recharge is initiated to create groundwater with the salinity of less than 1 0 g l the time at which the pv starts to be greater than zero is defined as start point which is the time of the first occurrence of fresh groundwater in the reclaimed aquifer 2 3 sensitivity scenarios for parameters the global sensitivity of maxs to flow and transport parameters was evaluated using a dimensionless elasticity index ei ei is defined as a function of input p and output q that measures the relative sensibility of the various parameters 1 ei p 0 q 0 q 0 q i p 0 p i where p 0 is the input value of base model and p i is the changed input value q 0 is the simulated output with respect to p 0 and q i is the simulated output with respect to p i the changes of pv and maxs to flow and transport parameters were evaluated to identify the controls on fresh groundwater growth and mixing processes the parameters varied in the sensitivity analyses included the flow parameters of recharge rate k and ansi and the transport parameters of porosity longitudinal dispersivity and vertical transverse dispersivity the range of parameters was initially estimated from published model studies table 1 and then adjusted to assure model convergence the range of parameters values used for model scenarios is listed on table 4 according to the value range of scenarios we generated 20 equi spaced values and each value was then assigned to the model to simulate the change in pv and maxs 2 4 random conductivity field generation for representing heterogeneity a geostatistical model was used to represent geologic heterogeneity under the same mean and spatial covariance structure lee et al 2007 in this study the sequential gaussian model was used to create conditional realizations of the 3 d k field under a series of varying mean and covariance structures dai et al 2016 these k fields were then applied to the base model to evaluate the effect of a variable k field on pv and maxs the sequential gaussian simulation is based on a conditional probability density function cpdf zhang 2001 1 p k 1 k 2 k n p k 1 k 2 k n 1 p k n k 1 k 2 k n 1 p k 1 p k 2 k 1 p k n k 1 k 2 k n 1 where p k 1 k 2 k n is an n dimensional cpdf to represent the product of an n 1 dimensional cpdf of a single variable and an unconditional probability density function for the k field even though it is difficult to obtain a cpdf the characteristics of the probability distribution are identified by the first and second order moments of the gaussian probability distribution thus the k field is represented as 2 k x n c k x n i 1 n 1 a i x n k i k x i 3 va r c k x n σ k 2 x n i 1 n 1 a i x n c k x i x n where superscript c is the conditional moment σ k 2 x n and c k x i x j are the variance and covariance of k x n respectively the coefficient a i x n is determined by 4 4 j 1 n 1 a j x n c k x i x j c k x i x n i 1 n 1 the procedure used to generate random k fields is summarized in table 3 three dimensional random k fields were generated for the upper 18 model layers and a constant low value of 0 1 m d was assigned to the bottom two layers the correlation length was 300 m and 10 m along the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and the gaussian model was selected to generate the random k fields for each variance ten random k fields were generated so that 200 realizations of flow and transport models were carried out and the mean of simulated results for each variance was obtained to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity on development of fresh groundwater lens 3 results 3 1 characteristics of fresh groundwater lens growth the growth of a fresh groundwater lens for 100 years was simulated with the base model the growth of the freshwater volume is represented in fig 2 in this generalized reclaimed groundwater system the occurrence of fresh groundwater 1 0 g l starts at the year of 9 4 then the pv sustains growth at an average rate of 0 79 of total pore volume per year since the two bottom layers in the model have a low permeability the maxs is about 72 of total pore space fig 2 a the salinity distribution at year 100 in is a basin shape fresh groundwater lens surrounded by sea water fig 2 b and e the evolution of the fresh groundwater lens in 3d is simulated by the model fig 2 c e the thickness of the fresh lens is less than 1 m after 10 years 20 7 m after 50 years and 32 5 m after 100 years with an average recharge rate of 0 003 m d groundwater flow paths and salinity changes were also analyzed using path lines the particle tracking code modpath pollock 2012 was used for this evaluation a total of 462 particles were placed across the model domain to track flow paths this artificial groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall on the land surface with subsequent discharges to the sea the transient salinity distribution at year 10 along cross section a a is shown on fig 3 b the freshwater lens and its transition zone 5g l have a wave shape in which the lens is thinner in the middle of the model than at both sides the flows are stressed by salt water when they move to the boundary on both sides whereas brine water 5g l moves upward driven by buoyant effects in the middle of the model 3 2 factors controlling fresh groundwater lens growth a dimensionless elasticity index ei was used to evaluate the global sensitivity of flow parameters and transport parameters a positive ei represents an increase in maxs when the parameter increases and a negative ei represents a decrease in maxs for an increase in the parameter table 5 shows that the flow parameters of recharge k and anis positively control the maxs and the transport parameters of porosity longitudinal dispersivity al and trvt negatively control maxs from the absolute ei value maxs is most sensitive to recharge porosity and longitudinal dispersivity the variability of pv and maxs with varying flow parameters were evaluated under alternative recharge rate k and anis scenarios fig 4 the recharge rate controls the maxs growth rate and start point of the pv as depicted on fig 4 a with an increase in annual recharge from 0 1 to 2 m year the occurrence of fresh groundwater lens start point advances from the 87 years to 4 4 years the maxs after 100 years increases from 1 7 to 73 with increasing recharge rate at recharge rates of 1 2 m year and greater the maximum pv is 73 for this generalized aquifer system as shown on fig 4 b at a recharge rate of 1 02 m year the maximum pv is obtained after 100 years whereas at higher recharge rates the time to maximum pv is shorter at a recharge rate of 2 m year the maximum pv is obtained after about 50 years pv and maxs are not very sensitive to k and anis the varying k has limited effects on the start point and growth rate of pv fig 4 c the maxs decreases from 73 to 68 when k increases from 0 1 to 2 02 m d but it increases from 68 to 73 when k ranges between 2 02 m d and 15 m d in the first phase the k of upper unconsolidated fill materials is the same as the bedrock and there is no preferential flow in horizontal direction so that the flow can penetrate to bedrock with the constant recharge with an increase in k of the upper unconsolidated fill materials the horizontal flow increases and the vertical flow within the bedrock decreases which results in a decrease in maxs a horizontal k of 2 02 m d at which the minimum in max s occurs is not a general value for all artificial islands it is the case under the permeability configuration of 0 1 m d in the bedrock this result indicates there exists a minimum maxs that is dependent on the configuration of the permeability of the bedrock and upper layers pv is not sensitive to anisotropy fig 4 e and maxs has a slight declining trend from 72 3 to 71 2 with the anisotropy increasing from 0 1 to 100 fig 4 f the variability of pv and maxs with varying transport parameters was evaluated under alternative porosity longitudinal dispersivity a l and trvt scenarios fig 5 maxs is very sensitive to the value of porosity with an increase in the porosity from 0 1 to 0 4 the start point changes from the year 2 5 to year 18 3 and maxs decreases from 76 to 66 fig 5 b even though a larger porosity equates to an aquifer with more water in storage increasing porosity does not result in an increase in pv within a 100 year time frame aquifers with a larger porosity initially contain more salt water and thus more recharge is needed to flush out the salt water as a result the freshwater volume decreases with an increase in porosity longitudinal dispersivity al describes the local variations of velocity along the groundwater flow direction schulze makuch 2005 and here represent the variations of mixing velocity along the horizontal and vertical flow directions longitudinal dispersivity has a significant effect on pv and maxs fig 5 d maxs has a declining trend from 74 to 69 with the longitudinal dispersivity increasing from 16 and 25 m however it displays a high variability when longitudinal dispersivity is less than 10 m and low variability between 10 and 15 m the value where maxs changes from an increasing to decreasing trend 10 m is not the same for all case it applies when k is 10 m d rather maxs is co determined by the flow velocity configuration and dispersivity increasing longitudinal dispersivity al extends the mixing area along flow directions and speeds up the mixing process but this limits the dilution of salinity this explains the decrease in maxs when longitudinal dispersivity is greater than 15 m transverse dispersivity trvt is used to represent the variation of mixing velocity of concentration field perpendicular to vertical flow direction trvt has a less effect on start point pv and maxs than longitudinal dispersivity the maxs increases slightly with increasing trvt however trvt has variable effects on growth speed of pv during the period between the start point and year 60 increasing trvt restricts the speed of pv growth for the reason that a higher variability in the mixing velocity reduces the dilution of the groundwater salinity after the year 60 when a stable fresh groundwater lens has formed higher trvt contributes to enlarging the size of the freshwater lens 3 3 effects of heterogeneity a total of 200 random k fields were generated with the sequential gaussian model under lnk variances varying between 10 6 and 2 0 variance is a measure of the complexity of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field with a large variance representing a more complex field fig 6 shows the first model layer of the simulated fields with the variance of lnk ranging between 10 6 and 2 0 the mean k increases from 2 7 to 6 5 m d and the difference between the maximum and minimum k changes from one to eight orders of magnitude these simulated k fields were used in the model to explore the effects of heterogeneity on the growth of the fresh groundwater lens from the results of the model scenarios fig 7 a the heterogeneity of k has only a small influence on the start point of pv but with increasing complexity restricts the growth rate of pv maxs decreases from 68 to 66 with an increase in the complexity of heterogeneity fig 8 shows the flow pattern in 3d and cross section view in a heterogeneity field with a lnk variance of 2 compared with the homogeneous k field fig 3 heterogeneity increases the variability of movement of groundwater flow within the reclaimed aquifer and decreases the speed of mixing circulation this result is consistent with previous studies showing that spatial heterogeneity limits the movement of saline flow hodgkinson et al 2007 4 discussion and implication 4 1 significance of hydrogeology setting and land use design in the reclaimed land meta projects of coastal land reclamation are so expensive that all factors related to future sustainability should be considered in the planning process according to our sensitivity scenarios permeability and porosity of fill materials and bedrock influence groundwater flow paths and the mixing of saline and fresh water resulting in varying times to establish a freshwater lens under reclaimed lands and varying maximum volumes of freshwater therefore hydrogeologic setting and structure should be assessed and considered from the aspect of water sustainability when designing and constructing reclaimed land furthermore recharge rate is the dominating factor controlling the speed of growth and the maximum storage of fresh groundwater so that the land use and artificial recharge enhancement approaches such as injecting fresh water and minimizing surface water runoff have a large influence on the creation of freshwater lenses 4 2 potential of fresh lens in the reclaimed aquifer in the world facing the challenge of freshwater shortage across the world the occurrence of fresh groundwater lenses beneath reclaimed lands was evaluated by a series of numerical models based on the results of simulations it is estimated that 70 of total aquifer volume beneath the reclaimed lands would be replenished with fresh water under an annual recharge rate of 1 m year within 100 years for the 173 000 km2 of coastal lands reclaimed between 1985 and 2015 donchyts et al 2016 approximately 1453 km3 of fresh groundwater potentially can be retained beneath these new lands by 2115 under the assumption of porosity of 0 3 and averaged aquifer thickness of 40 m this volume of water can supply the water needs of at least 4 billion people for 50 years based on a freshwater quantity of 20 l per capita per day world health organization 2004 to increase the rate of development of fresh groundwater lenses under reclaimed

groundwater model was developed as a base model for characterizing the development of a freshwater lens beneath reclaimed islands multiple alternative scenarios for flow parameters were conducted to evaluate the processes and controlling factors that impact growth rate and maximum volume of the freshwater lenses that form beneath reclaimed lands furthermore the impacts of heterogeneity on fresh groundwater lens development were assessed by applying a sequential gaussian model to generate random k field major study findings include the following 1 the initial development of a fresh groundwater lens is initialized after a period in which the salinity of the original groundwater beneath the island is flushed and diluted basin shape of freshwater lens and transient zone are controlled by the shape of reclaimed islands and the hydraulic conductivity the maximum volume of fresh groundwater that will eventually be attained is dependent on the recharge rate the porosity and the thickness of unconsolidated deposits beneath the island 2 the recharge rate dominates the growth rate start point of the fresh groundwater lens and the maximum volume of fresh water the hydraulic conductivity influences the maximum volume by the structure of the geologic setting but has little effect on growth rate and start point for the controlling factors of transport processes porosity limits the growth rate start point and maximum volume of fresh water because larger porosity retains more original salt water in the aquifer which requires more fresh recharge to flush and dilute longitudinal dispersivity both promotes and restricts the fresh salt water circulation depending on parameter value range vertical transverse dispersivity facilitates extending mixing areas 3 increasing complexity in the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field increases the variability of groundwater flow this results in a lowering of the growth rate and maximum volume of the freshwater lens with increasing complexity our results demonstrate the potential of retaining large volumes of fresh water in the aquifers of reclaimed islands managing the fresh water in the aquifers of artificial islands requires effective recharge and extraction configurations for coastal freshwater sustainability our results based on an investigation of the mechanisms controlling fresh salt water circulation indicate that consideration of the hydrogeological characteristics of the fill materials and bedrock in the planning for mega reclaimed projects is essential for optimizing the rate of development and volume of freshwater lenses beneath reclaimed lands studies of the optimization of suitable recharge and extraction schemes for artificial islands is needed in the future

6518,groundwater serves as a significant freshwater supply for coastal regions in many coastal areas extensive islands have been created by filling the sea these reclaimed islands not only provide valuable space for urban development but also can serve as valuable aquifers recharge of fresh water from rainfall can flush out salt water and eventually create a freshwater lens beneath the reclaimed island however how a fresh groundwater lens grows in reclaimed islands and the factors that control its growth are unclear here we use a series of three dimensional density dependent flow and transport models to investigate the process of fresh salt water mixing and quantify the potential maximum volume of fresh groundwater that can occur beneath reclaimed islands our results show that the recharge rate controls the growth rate and the initialization of the fresh groundwater lens whereas the permeability of the underlying fill materials and bedrock determines the shape of freshwater lens beneath the island but has a minor influence on freshwater volume increasing porosity enlarges the total water volume but diminishes the proportion of fresh water as the larger volume of original salt water in the aquifer requires more recharge to flush and dilute longitudinal dispersivity promotes the fresh salt water circulation in a certain range but limits the maximum fresh volume storage and vertical transverse dispersivity facilitates extending mixing areas to enlarge the freshwater lens heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field increases the variability of groundwater flow restricts the average speed of fresh salt water circulation and results in a decrease in the growth rate and maximum volume of the freshwater lens our study has large implications for planning and management of reclaimed lands for water sustainability in the future in coastal areas keywords fresh groundwater reclaimed island density dependent flow numerical model scenarios 1 introduction water scarcity in coastal areas within 100 km of the ocean is well known these areas contain 40 the world s population and eight of the ten largest cities in the world are located along coastlines creel 2003 oude essink 2001 reed 2010 siirilä 2010 small islands nations face water scarcity problems under increasing population and climate change bailey et al 2016 holding et al 2016 white and falkland 2009 groundwater can serve as a critical source of drinking water and can maintain coastal ecosystems in small island nations i e controlling salinity danielopol et al 2003 hancock et al 2005 however freshwater resources on small islands are generally limited and frequently overexploited resulting in saline water intrusion therefore retaining and storing more fresh water from rainfall is important for solving water scarcity issues reclaimed islands not only provide valuable land for urban development e g industrial base recreation and commercial ground or residential area but also can be important freshwater aquifers to retain rainfall and store fresh water roughly 173 000 km2 was converted from water to land between 1985 and 2015 worldwide and reclaimed land construction in coastal countries is one of the most important ways to increase the urban area donchyts et al 2016 examples of reclaimed land include the largest reclaimed island of palm island and its adjacent islands in dubai that cover about 80 km2 for recreation rectangular reclaimed island of kansai international airport 38 km2 in japan developed for transportation about 76 km2 of reclaimed island in singapore constructed for supporting industrial use donchyts et al 2016 the impact of coastal land reclamation on groundwater levels and the sea water interface has been investigated with steady state analytical solutions guo and jiao 2007 groundwater lenses beneath these reclaimed islands are analogous to those beneath natural island werner et al 2017 but differences exist the similarity is represented by the structure of groundwater a convex lens of fresh groundwater overlying denser salt water underwood et al 1992 the size and shape of the fresh lenses are controlled by the geologic framework and hydrodynamic process schneider and kruse 2005 the difference between artificial islands and natural islands is manifested by the shape and the geologic structure artificial sedimentary sequence created by multiple sources of filling materials and compaction technology alzaylaie and abdelaziz 2016 yan et al 2013 the characteristics of groundwater lenses on natural islands are influenced by the long term recharge rate and the hydraulic conductivity of underlying holocene sediments gingerich et al 2017 wallace and bailey 2017 the vertical permeability and vertical longitudinal dispersion caused by vertically oscillating flow control the mixing process for small atoll islands underwood et al 1992 limited by data availability and high computation requirements these factors are normally evaluated using two dimensional models or models with short simulation times three dimensional flow patterns and mixing processes under multiple varying variables are difficult to assess furthermore geologic heterogeneities influence the geometry of freshwater lens bailey et al 2013 dose et al 2014 prasad and simmons 2003 vacher 1988 however how the heterogeneity of the strata comprising the freshwater lens influences the behavior of flow pattern and maximum freshwater storage is poorly understood reclaimed islands worldwide are one of the most important potential reservoirs for land limited coastal areas the hydrologic dynamics including subsurface flow and transport processes of such potential reservoirs and sensitivities of variables on freshwater lens beneath reclaimed islands are mostly unclear this fundamental but missing insight is necessary for future water sustainability of the world one key gap is the extent to which fresh groundwater is retained in these artificial aquifers and how the flow and transport variables control the volume of the freshwater lens that develops to investigate the pattern of the freshwater lens mixing process of salt water and fresh recharge and maximum fresh groundwater storage in reclaimed islands a 3 d numerical density dependent flow and transport model was constructed simulations of 100 years were performed using 20 scenarios with varying flow parameters of recharge rate hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy and transport parameters of porosity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivity to explore the effects of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity of reclaimed aquifers on flow patterns and mixing behaviors a gaussian sequential model was used to generate heterogeneous conductivity fields of varying complexity for multiple scenarios the results of this modeling investigation provide broad knowledge for reclaimed meta project planning and sustainable coastal development in the future as well as knowledge for guiding aquifer recharge management for existing reclaimed lands 2 methodology 2 1 model development this study uses numerical flow and transport models to evaluate the processes of freshwater lens growth beneath reclaimed islands and investigate the role of flow and transport parameters in controlling freshwater lens growth the seawat code langevin et al 2003 which couples modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 was used to simulate the density dependent flow that occurs beneath reclaimed islands a base model was first developed for a generalized reclaimed groundwater system a rectangular domain was designed to represent a reclaimed island measuring 5 km long by 2 km wide with permeable sediments to a depth of 40 m below the land surface fig 1 according to the reports of reclaimed construction van t hoff and van der kolff 2012 the domain was conceptualized as mainly two lithologic layers sand silty sand as well as gravel and sand layer at the top and a bedrock layer at the bottom each layer of the base model was specified as homogeneous and isotropic along the horizontal direction the domain was discretized into 50 m grids with 40 rows and 100 columns and the two lithological layers were refined to 20 model layers for better vertical resolution in the model simulations the model has a total of 80 000 grids cells the time step of the base model was daily and the total simulated time was 100 years to simulate the growth in the volume of fresh groundwater lenses the base model included a steady state simulation and 36 500 transient time steps and the model was considered to attain convergence when each transient simulation converged within 0 01 m3 d of the water budget the robustness of the solution was tested by a separate model with 25 m and 100 m grids the simulated groundwater levels concentrations and fluid densities were consistent between the two separate models results differed by 0 01 0 0001 and 0 01 respectively thus the solution is considered insensitive to the model discretization used the unconsolidated fill materials of the reclaimed island are assumed to be saturated with salt water following construction so the salinity of the original groundwater is 35 g l the top flow boundary condition of the base model was a specified recharge flux which represents the infiltrated rainfall to the groundwater table net precipitation after an interception by surface flow and evaporation the initial recharge rate of the base model was assigned a value in the range of 0 001 0 003 m d as estimated from previous studies underwood et al 1992 the salinity of recharge from rainfall was assigned 0 g l the same as pure fresh water a specified head boundary was assigned to the island boundary for all layers to represent the specified sea level around the model domain a salinity of 35 g l was assigned to this specified sea boundary based on parameter values from published references the flow and transport parameters were assigned to the base model table 1 the initial horizontal hydraulic conductivity k was assigned a value of 10 m d for the top 18 model layers and 0 1 m d for the bottom two model layers representing bedrock specific storage ss was assigned a value of 0 0002 1 m and anisotropy ansi the ratio of horizontal hydraulic conductivity to vertical hydraulic conductivity was assigned a value of 3 transport parameters included porosity p longitudinal dispersivity al schulze makuch 2005 and vertical transverse dispersivity atv were assigned values of 0 3 20 m and 0 2 m respectively 2 2 quantification of fresh lens growth and maximum storage we used a salinity of 1 0 g l as the upper threshold for fresh groundwater which is the world health organization guideline for drinking water world health organization 2004 the percentage of volume pv which is the ratio of freshwater volume to total volume of water in the reclaimed aquifer is used to quantify the freshwater growth rather than the thickness of the freshwater lens as the purpose of this study is to explore the potential maximum volume of fresh groundwater in three dimensions the maximum freshwater storage maxs is considered to be attained when pv remains steady with time however the maximum volume is not attained under some parameter combinations within 100 years in these situations we use the result from the last time step of the 100 year simulation as the maxs as the original groundwater in the reclaimed aquifers is sea water salinity of 35 g l some time is required after recharge is initiated to create groundwater with the salinity of less than 1 0 g l the time at which the pv starts to be greater than zero is defined as start point which is the time of the first occurrence of fresh groundwater in the reclaimed aquifer 2 3 sensitivity scenarios for parameters the global sensitivity of maxs to flow and transport parameters was evaluated using a dimensionless elasticity index ei ei is defined as a function of input p and output q that measures the relative sensibility of the various parameters 1 ei p 0 q 0 q 0 q i p 0 p i where p 0 is the input value of base model and p i is the changed input value q 0 is the simulated output with respect to p 0 and q i is the simulated output with respect to p i the changes of pv and maxs to flow and transport parameters were evaluated to identify the controls on fresh groundwater growth and mixing processes the parameters varied in the sensitivity analyses included the flow parameters of recharge rate k and ansi and the transport parameters of porosity longitudinal dispersivity and vertical transverse dispersivity the range of parameters was initially estimated from published model studies table 1 and then adjusted to assure model convergence the range of parameters values used for model scenarios is listed on table 4 according to the value range of scenarios we generated 20 equi spaced values and each value was then assigned to the model to simulate the change in pv and maxs 2 4 random conductivity field generation for representing heterogeneity a geostatistical model was used to represent geologic heterogeneity under the same mean and spatial covariance structure lee et al 2007 in this study the sequential gaussian model was used to create conditional realizations of the 3 d k field under a series of varying mean and covariance structures dai et al 2016 these k fields were then applied to the base model to evaluate the effect of a variable k field on pv and maxs the sequential gaussian simulation is based on a conditional probability density function cpdf zhang 2001 1 p k 1 k 2 k n p k 1 k 2 k n 1 p k n k 1 k 2 k n 1 p k 1 p k 2 k 1 p k n k 1 k 2 k n 1 where p k 1 k 2 k n is an n dimensional cpdf to represent the product of an n 1 dimensional cpdf of a single variable and an unconditional probability density function for the k field even though it is difficult to obtain a cpdf the characteristics of the probability distribution are identified by the first and second order moments of the gaussian probability distribution thus the k field is represented as 2 k x n c k x n i 1 n 1 a i x n k i k x i 3 va r c k x n σ k 2 x n i 1 n 1 a i x n c k x i x n where superscript c is the conditional moment σ k 2 x n and c k x i x j are the variance and covariance of k x n respectively the coefficient a i x n is determined by 4 4 j 1 n 1 a j x n c k x i x j c k x i x n i 1 n 1 the procedure used to generate random k fields is summarized in table 3 three dimensional random k fields were generated for the upper 18 model layers and a constant low value of 0 1 m d was assigned to the bottom two layers the correlation length was 300 m and 10 m along the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and the gaussian model was selected to generate the random k fields for each variance ten random k fields were generated so that 200 realizations of flow and transport models were carried out and the mean of simulated results for each variance was obtained to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity on development of fresh groundwater lens 3 results 3 1 characteristics of fresh groundwater lens growth the growth of a fresh groundwater lens for 100 years was simulated with the base model the growth of the freshwater volume is represented in fig 2 in this generalized reclaimed groundwater system the occurrence of fresh groundwater 1 0 g l starts at the year of 9 4 then the pv sustains growth at an average rate of 0 79 of total pore volume per year since the two bottom layers in the model have a low permeability the maxs is about 72 of total pore space fig 2 a the salinity distribution at year 100 in is a basin shape fresh groundwater lens surrounded by sea water fig 2 b and e the evolution of the fresh groundwater lens in 3d is simulated by the model fig 2 c e the thickness of the fresh lens is less than 1 m after 10 years 20 7 m after 50 years and 32 5 m after 100 years with an average recharge rate of 0 003 m d groundwater flow paths and salinity changes were also analyzed using path lines the particle tracking code modpath pollock 2012 was used for this evaluation a total of 462 particles were placed across the model domain to track flow paths this artificial groundwater system receives recharge from rainfall on the land surface with subsequent discharges to the sea the transient salinity distribution at year 10 along cross section a a is shown on fig 3 b the freshwater lens and its transition zone 5g l have a wave shape in which the lens is thinner in the middle of the model than at both sides the flows are stressed by salt water when they move to the boundary on both sides whereas brine water 5g l moves upward driven by buoyant effects in the middle of the model 3 2 factors controlling fresh groundwater lens growth a dimensionless elasticity index ei was used to evaluate the global sensitivity of flow parameters and transport parameters a positive ei represents an increase in maxs when the parameter increases and a negative ei represents a decrease in maxs for an increase in the parameter table 5 shows that the flow parameters of recharge k and anis positively control the maxs and the transport parameters of porosity longitudinal dispersivity al and trvt negatively control maxs from the absolute ei value maxs is most sensitive to recharge porosity and longitudinal dispersivity the variability of pv and maxs with varying flow parameters were evaluated under alternative recharge rate k and anis scenarios fig 4 the recharge rate controls the maxs growth rate and start point of the pv as depicted on fig 4 a with an increase in annual recharge from 0 1 to 2 m year the occurrence of fresh groundwater lens start point advances from the 87 years to 4 4 years the maxs after 100 years increases from 1 7 to 73 with increasing recharge rate at recharge rates of 1 2 m year and greater the maximum pv is 73 for this generalized aquifer system as shown on fig 4 b at a recharge rate of 1 02 m year the maximum pv is obtained after 100 years whereas at higher recharge rates the time to maximum pv is shorter at a recharge rate of 2 m year the maximum pv is obtained after about 50 years pv and maxs are not very sensitive to k and anis the varying k has limited effects on the start point and growth rate of pv fig 4 c the maxs decreases from 73 to 68 when k increases from 0 1 to 2 02 m d but it increases from 68 to 73 when k ranges between 2 02 m d and 15 m d in the first phase the k of upper unconsolidated fill materials is the same as the bedrock and there is no preferential flow in horizontal direction so that the flow can penetrate to bedrock with the constant recharge with an increase in k of the upper unconsolidated fill materials the horizontal flow increases and the vertical flow within the bedrock decreases which results in a decrease in maxs a horizontal k of 2 02 m d at which the minimum in max s occurs is not a general value for all artificial islands it is the case under the permeability configuration of 0 1 m d in the bedrock this result indicates there exists a minimum maxs that is dependent on the configuration of the permeability of the bedrock and upper layers pv is not sensitive to anisotropy fig 4 e and maxs has a slight declining trend from 72 3 to 71 2 with the anisotropy increasing from 0 1 to 100 fig 4 f the variability of pv and maxs with varying transport parameters was evaluated under alternative porosity longitudinal dispersivity a l and trvt scenarios fig 5 maxs is very sensitive to the value of porosity with an increase in the porosity from 0 1 to 0 4 the start point changes from the year 2 5 to year 18 3 and maxs decreases from 76 to 66 fig 5 b even though a larger porosity equates to an aquifer with more water in storage increasing porosity does not result in an increase in pv within a 100 year time frame aquifers with a larger porosity initially contain more salt water and thus more recharge is needed to flush out the salt water as a result the freshwater volume decreases with an increase in porosity longitudinal dispersivity al describes the local variations of velocity along the groundwater flow direction schulze makuch 2005 and here represent the variations of mixing velocity along the horizontal and vertical flow directions longitudinal dispersivity has a significant effect on pv and maxs fig 5 d maxs has a declining trend from 74 to 69 with the longitudinal dispersivity increasing from 16 and 25 m however it displays a high variability when longitudinal dispersivity is less than 10 m and low variability between 10 and 15 m the value where maxs changes from an increasing to decreasing trend 10 m is not the same for all case it applies when k is 10 m d rather maxs is co determined by the flow velocity configuration and dispersivity increasing longitudinal dispersivity al extends the mixing area along flow directions and speeds up the mixing process but this limits the dilution of salinity this explains the decrease in maxs when longitudinal dispersivity is greater than 15 m transverse dispersivity trvt is used to represent the variation of mixing velocity of concentration field perpendicular to vertical flow direction trvt has a less effect on start point pv and maxs than longitudinal dispersivity the maxs increases slightly with increasing trvt however trvt has variable effects on growth speed of pv during the period between the start point and year 60 increasing trvt restricts the speed of pv growth for the reason that a higher variability in the mixing velocity reduces the dilution of the groundwater salinity after the year 60 when a stable fresh groundwater lens has formed higher trvt contributes to enlarging the size of the freshwater lens 3 3 effects of heterogeneity a total of 200 random k fields were generated with the sequential gaussian model under lnk variances varying between 10 6 and 2 0 variance is a measure of the complexity of heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field with a large variance representing a more complex field fig 6 shows the first model layer of the simulated fields with the variance of lnk ranging between 10 6 and 2 0 the mean k increases from 2 7 to 6 5 m d and the difference between the maximum and minimum k changes from one to eight orders of magnitude these simulated k fields were used in the model to explore the effects of heterogeneity on the growth of the fresh groundwater lens from the results of the model scenarios fig 7 a the heterogeneity of k has only a small influence on the start point of pv but with increasing complexity restricts the growth rate of pv maxs decreases from 68 to 66 with an increase in the complexity of heterogeneity fig 8 shows the flow pattern in 3d and cross section view in a heterogeneity field with a lnk variance of 2 compared with the homogeneous k field fig 3 heterogeneity increases the variability of movement of groundwater flow within the reclaimed aquifer and decreases the speed of mixing circulation this result is consistent with previous studies showing that spatial heterogeneity limits the movement of saline flow hodgkinson et al 2007 4 discussion and implication 4 1 significance of

conductivity influences the maximum volume by the structure of the geologic setting but has little effect on growth rate and start point for the controlling factors of transport processes porosity limits the growth rate start point and maximum volume of fresh water because larger porosity retains more original salt water in the aquifer which requires more fresh recharge to flush and dilute longitudinal dispersivity both promotes and restricts the fresh salt water circulation depending on parameter value range vertical transverse dispersivity facilitates extending mixing areas 3 increasing complexity in the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field increases the variability of groundwater flow this results in a lowering of the growth rate and maximum volume of the freshwater lens with increasing complexity our results demonstrate the potential of retaining large volumes of fresh water in the aquifers of reclaimed islands managing the fresh water in the aquifers of artificial islands requires effective recharge and extraction configurations for coastal freshwater sustainability our results based on an investigation of the mechanisms controlling fresh salt water circulation indicate that consideration of the hydrogeological characteristics of the fill materials and bedrock in the planning for mega reclaimed projects is essential for optimizing the rate of development and volume of freshwater lenses beneath reclaimed lands studies of the optimization of suitable recharge and extraction schemes for artificial islands is needed in the future

northwest china fig 1 most of the region in the study area lies in the gobi desert and its elevation ranges from 2800 to 3500 m above sea level a small human population inhabits the basin the area is characterized by the typical climate of dry inland regions with scarce precipitation and intense evaporation the average annual precipitation of the region in the last 50 years has been less than 30 mm a and has mainly occurred in summers while the annual average evaporation rate is more than 2700 mm a the average annual temperature is approximately 3 0 c with a maximum temperature of 35 3 c and a minimum of 29 5 c a desert oasis exists around the edge of the alluvial fan in the shallow groundwater area and groundwater overflow zone 2 2 hydrometeorological data climate is a long term average of the weather or meteorological elements pan et al 2018 a long term record of the meteorological data is used to study the climate change that influences the vegetation in this study area data from several national meteorological stations in the qaidam basin was collected the nearest meteorological station being xiao zaohuo the monthly temperature and precipitation data of the study area from 1961 to 2016 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been widely used for assessing the ecological responses to long time environmental change climate change and human activities peruelo and lauenroth 1998 lu et al 2003 wardlow et al 2007 jacquin et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 the value of ndvi is a ratio of the spectral reflectance difference between the near infrared nir and red bands to their reflectance summation the ndvi can be used to assess the status of land surface vegetation large positive values generally indicate higher vegetation coverage small positive values indicate low vegetation coverage and negative and zero values indicate a water body or bare land lv et al 2013 in this study landsat series images were used to estimate the ndvi considering its variation in the study area over the past 30 years from 1986 to 2011 the landsat 5 thematic mapper tm image was used and from 2013 to 2016 the landsat 8 operational land imager oli image was used the ndvi can be described by the following equation 1 ndvi r nir r red r nir r red where rred and rnir represent the average reflectance measured in the visible red and near infrared regions respectively during the ndvi computation process on the remote image processing system envi spectral radiometric calibrations and atmospheric corrections were made for accuracy considering the spectral difference between landsat 8 oli and landsat 5 tm table 1 the results of the ndvi derived from the two types of remote sensing images being slightly different pan et al 2018 the ndvi data should be carried on uniformization to compare the vegetation variation by the ndvi values in different years the following equation constructed by roy et al 2016 with approximately 28 million 30 m pixels extracted from 6317 landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images was used to express the regression relationship between the ndvi derived from the two types of images the wavelengths of nir and red bands of landsat 5 tm are identical to those of landsat 7 etm and the equation below can also be used to describe the relationship between the ndvi derived from the landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli images roy et al 2016 2 ndv i 5 n d v i 7 0 011 0 969 n d v i 8 where ndvi5 ndvi7 and ndvi8 represent the ndvi values derived from the landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images respectively the study area is located in a single scene image with path number 138 and row number 34 and the image in each year was selected from the summer of june to august all of the images with a 30 m resolution were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud website supported by the computer network information center at the chinese academy of sciences 3 results 3 1 climatic characteristics to investigate climate change in the nalenggele alluvial fan region the annual mean temperature precipitation and relative humidity from 1961 to 2016 were considered the time series plot of the annual mean temperature from the xiao zaohuo station is shown in fig 2 which demonstrates a significant increasing trend of the temperature in the study area with a confidence coefficient of 95 on the other hand the annual mean precipitation shows a slightly increasing trend fig 3 but does not meet the required confidence coefficient of 95 which means that the precipitation in the study area does not show a significant increase this was also discussed by fu et al 2011 climate has an inevitable impact on the environment in which vegetation grows traditional hydrometeorological indicators such as precipitation temperature and humidity are widely considered as the main factors having an impact on vegetation growth ye et al 2012 shen et al 2015 the climate of the study area during the past 55 years 1961 2016 had exhibited a significant warming and wetting trend the rates of increase in temperature and precipitation are approximately 0 65 c decade and 2 1 mm decade respectively and the climate regime has not changed significantly during the past 30 years 1986 2016 the monthly relative humidity from 1961 to 2016 showed a slightly decreasing tendency which is the opposite of the increasing tendency of temperature and precipitation and relative humidity showed an obvious increasing trend from 1986 to 2016 which is different from that from 1961 to 2016 3 2 ndvi variation over the past decades the ndvis from 1986 to 2016 were derived from the landsat scenes to evaluate the variation of vegetation coverage the spatial distribution of the average ndvi from 1986 to 2016 shows that the alluvial fan was mainly covered by the lower ndvi values majority of ndvi values of the area is less than or equal to zero because of the gobi desert sand dunes and river water which cover approximately 75 to 80 of the study area the positive ndvi value which indicates the existence of vegetation cover was used to express the variation of vegetation coverage during the past 30 years during the field survey in july 2011 it was found that the land with continuous coverage of high density vegetation has an ndvi value greater than 0 2 the computed ndvi in the study area and the field survey results in 2011 are shown in fig 4 typical ndvi values greater than 0 2 which were considered representative of high density vegetation of the desert oasis in the past 30 years cover only 0 10 to 11 52 of the study area fig 5 the maximum and average ndvi values of all the positive ndvi values show an increasing trend from 1986 to 2016 fig 6 the area proportions of positive ndvi values ndvi 0 2 also show an increasing trend fig 5 which reflects the progressive tendency of vegetation growth in order to find a correlation between climate change and the temporal variation of the ndvis a correlation analysis involving the computation of correlation coefficients between the ndvi values and the climatic variables was conducted previous studies in regard to the vegetation of arid areas in northwest china have shown that the response of vegetation to temperature was intense amid climate warming and the precipitation may not directly support the vegetation growth jin et al 2014 xu et al 2018 pan et al 2018 from the results shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the increased temperature precipitation and relative humidity all contribute to the vegetation growth the climatic variables also exhibit a certain correlation with the changing ndvi values in the past 30 years 1986 2016 however all of the correlation coefficients are less than 0 5 which indicates the climatic variables did not have any significant impact on the variation of vegetation cover all of the evidences suggest these climatic factors have little direct correlation with the ndvis of the nalenggele alluvial fan 3 3 correlation between vegetation and groundwater vegetation growth mainly depends on sunlight and water which are the main ingredients of photosynthesis pan et al 2018 as the growth season energy from the sunlight falling on the gobi desert is sufficient the vegetation growth there depends mainly on the supply of soil water in the root zone as discussed above the study area is located in an extremely arid environment with an average annual precipitation of less than 30 mm and evaporation more than 2700 mm precipitation cannot recharge the water in the root zone or the aeration zone and the shallow buried groundwater could supply majority of the water demand for vegetation growth the distribution of ndvi values during july 2011 is shown in fig 4 and the contour map of dwt in the same period obtained from observational data through the spatial interpolation method is shown in fig 8 from the spatial distribution of the ndvi values which indicate land surface vegetation cover of the study area it is clear that majority of the vegetation is distributed over the alluvial fan fringe area with shallow buried groundwater and it greatly depends on dwt as well the values of ndvi and dwt in the same location were extracted and the corresponding scatter diagram is shown in fig 9 the ndvi values range from 0 63 0 74 and the dwt values vary between 0 01 and 312 9 m approximately 76 of the data points are concentrated in the range of 0 63 ndvi 0 with the dwt range from zero to more than 300 m part a in fig 9 the corresponding spatial location of the data points is distributed among the desert the mountain area and the oasis another 24 of the data points are distributed in the range of 0 ndvi 0 74 part b in fig 9 the location of the data points is distributed among the desert and oasis with dwt ranging from 0 to 100 m data points with ndvi values greater than 0 2 are distributed among the areas with dwt ranging from 0 to 100 m part c in fig 9 and the vast majority of data points are distributed among the areas with dwt less than 20 m part d in fig 9 in addition some of the ndvi values were negative in the shallow groundwater area which could be due to the intense soil salinization in this area and the soil salinization was confirmed during a field survey fig 10 4 discussions 4 1 impact of changing environmental conditions on gdes the vegetation characteristics may be attributed to the combined influence of multiple factors including climate soil cover and hydrogeological features jin et al 2011 lv et al 2013 based on the above discussion it stands to reason that dwt should be the governing factor of vegetation in this area and the dsg is controlled by groundwater recharge and exploitation according to the previous studies shallow groundwater in the alluvial fan of this area is mainly recharged by river infiltration and the underground lateral flow that originates from the snowmelt and precipitation from the kunlun mountains su et al 2015 xu 2015 xu et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 groundwater recharge is directly related to the nalenggele river discharge which is controlled by the effective snowmelt in the mountain area and the snowmelt runoff will increase with the rising temperatures as a result of climate change wang and li 2005 therefore for future research groups to study the impact of climate change on vegetation an established groundwater flow numerical simulation model was used to predict the distribution of groundwater level xu 2015 several scenarios were proposed with the consideration of different river water discharges related to climate change and water resource exploitation long time series runoff data could not be monitored because the hydrometric station was set up for only four years during the 1960s the river discharge data in 1960 1963 were monitored by the hydrologic institution and the data in 2009 2011 and 2012 were monitored by the researchers during field surveys it is impossible to establish the relations between river discharge and climate change the maximum average and minimum river discharges in 1960 to 1963 2009 and 2011 to 2012 were used to express the river discharge of high normal and low flow years under the control of changing climate approximately 53 of the river discharges infiltrate and recharge the groundwater xu 2015 xu et al 2017 the quantity of water resource exploitation was determined based on the requirements of the existing water intake project and water resources planning the exploitation of groundwater includes a water source site and water demand from some mineral enterprises in this project the river water is supplied to agricultural irrigation by a diversion canal zhang et al 2014 three scenarios with extreme conditions have been proposed to simulate the river discharge scenario a sustained high temperature causes river discharge under the high flow condition with a flow quantity of 20 1 108 m3 a from 2011 to 2020 scenario b sustained normal temperature causes river discharge under the normal flow condition with a flow quantity of 12 9 108 m3 a from 2011 to 2020 scenario c sustained low temperature causes river discharge under the low flow condition with a flow quantity of 8 73 108 m3 a from 2011 to 2020 exploitation of groundwater and river from 2011 to 2020 is 0 40 108 m3 a and 2 15 108 m3 a in each scenario the detailed information of the scenarios are shown in table 2 the prediction model was tested under various input conditions and the depths to groundwater table for 2020 in different scenarios are shown in fig 11 groundwater availability for vegetation growth determines the correlation between vegetation and dwt variation which is controlled by a limitation of dwt this limitation is the ecological water level that was discussed for different areas with arid conditions similar to that of the nalenggele alluvial fan an ecological water level of 10 m was confirmed as the limitation of dwt in the semi arid hailiutu river catchment area of china lv et al 2013 and a similar limitation 8 10 m has also been established in australia at multiple sites zencich et al 2002 benyon et al 2006 o grady et al 2006 in the ejina area of china the suitable dwt limitation was found to be 2 8 5 0 m jin et al 2011 the limitation of dwt in the mahai river basin of the qaidam basin and in the desert oasis of the hexi corridor areas was found to be approximately 3 0 4 5 m zhao et al 2003 liu 2014 the limitation of dwt is influenced by a combination of floral species soil cover and climatic characteristics in this study the dwt of the boundary between the desert and the oasis is approximately 4 0 m according to the field survey and the depth might be the dividing limit considered as the limitation of dwt the distribution of range area with dwt less than 4 0 m is highlighted in fig 11 the number of areas with dwt less than 4 0 m in different scenarios was counted and compared with that in the status year of 2011 the areas in scenarios a b and c are approximately 86 82 5 and 78 of the areas in the status quo year respectively which means that the vegetation is at a risk of degradation from the combined influence of climate change and human activities temperature and precipitation were continuously increasing during the past years figs 2 and 3 which was proven to have caused an increase of ice snow melting and groundwater recharge in the natural state the groundwater flow system can attain a recharge drainage balance due to the regulation and storage capacity of groundwater aquifers therefore a decrease in dsg in the proposed scenarios should be caused by the disruption of groundwater flow balance which is directly caused by water resource exploitation and is a main reason behind the ecological degradation of gdes 4 2 consideration of management strategy and legislation for protection of gdes gdes are increasingly threatened by human led exploitation of water resources which often exceeds natural recharge rates gleeson et al 2015 rohde et al 2017 independent ecosystem protection or included underwater management strategy and legislation is one of the solutions for ensuring ecological health and sustainability of gdes there has not been any recent management strategy and legislation implemented in this area in china concerned authorities should educate themselves from the experiences of others for example adaptive management which is at the core of australia s approach for managing gdes utilizes ongoing monitoring and research to inform management decisions for determining the hydrologic conditions and thresholds required to maintain a gde richardson et al 2011 serov et al 2012 the learning by doing form of adaptive management strategy is suitable for the area of blank data monitoring and legislative supervision an iterative process from primal conceptualization to filling the knowledge gaps in the study of gdes combined with the internationally recognized concept of precautionary principle would be the purport of gdes protection under the adaptive management strategy ecological water requirements which include threshold value of depth to water table targets water quality standards and flow dynamic criteria at the boundary of interconnected surface water bodies rohde et al 2017 are the key elements in gdes management strategy formulation the determination of thresholds for gdes still remains a challenge for water management authorities largely due to the knowledge and information gaps present in the ecohydrology of the study area it is important for managers to integrate the biotic and abiotic factors of the gdes into local monitoring work understanding the abiotic factors including groundwater recharge mechanism and groundwater level water quality and groundwater surface water interaction and biotic factors including ecosystem structure species composition reproduction and growth are the essential prerequisites for gde protection risk assessments are required in the interim to prevent any adverse consequences of management actions that replying the natural resources exploitation and climate change legislators of natural resources management can achieve these local needs by leveraging additional assistance from research institutions and legislation and management strategy formulations are both interrelated in addition a coordinated approach of common frameworks and methodological approaches need to be mulled to promote overall success in the implementation of legislation rohde et al 2017 5 conclusions this study was conducted with an aim to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation in groundwater dependent ecosystems in arid areas long time series meteorological data and ndvi values were used to recognize the changing trend of climate change and variation of vegetation coverage during the past several decades from 1986 to 2016 the climate showed a warming and wetting trend and the variation of ndvi values showed an increasing trend which could indicate a progressive trend in vegetation growth however all of the climatic factors in the nalenggele alluvial fan were found to have little direct correlation with the ndvis of the region groundwater is the major source of water for vegetation growth in arid areas the distribution of shallow groundwater which is under the control of groundwater recharge mechanism determines the vegetation growth in the alluvial fan the warming temperature will cause an increasing trend of snowmelt runoff and the river discharge and infiltration to groundwater will increase both of which could cause an increase in the shallow groundwater area however human activities involving groundwater and river water exploitation will be counterproductive in some cases a prediction was made to tackle the situation three scenarios were proposed with the consideration of river discharges and water resources exploitation and the results showed that the distribution of shallow groundwater with the ecological water level dwt 4 m in 2020 will decrease to approximately 78 86 of the status quo year although vegetation growth in this area during the past several decades has been improving amid climate change the intervention of human activities will inevitably hinder the otherwise advantageous processes of vegetation growth in gdes thus proper management strategy and legislation for gde protection must be ratified to meet the challenges of human accelerated climate change and increasing demand of naturel resources declaration of interests the authors declare that

ndvi can be used to assess the status of land surface vegetation large positive values generally indicate higher vegetation coverage small positive values indicate low vegetation coverage and negative and zero values indicate a water body or bare land lv et al 2013 in this study landsat series images were used to estimate the ndvi considering its variation in the study area over the past 30 years from 1986 to 2011 the landsat 5 thematic mapper tm image was used and from 2013 to 2016 the landsat 8 operational land imager oli image was used the ndvi can be described by the following equation 1 ndvi r nir r red r nir r red where rred and rnir represent the average reflectance measured in the visible red and near infrared regions respectively during the ndvi computation process on the remote image processing system envi spectral radiometric calibrations and atmospheric corrections were made for accuracy considering the spectral difference between landsat 8 oli and landsat 5 tm table 1 the results of the ndvi derived from the two types of remote sensing images being slightly different pan et al 2018 the ndvi data should be carried on uniformization to compare the vegetation variation by the ndvi values in different years the following equation constructed by roy et al 2016 with approximately 28 million 30 m pixels extracted from 6317 landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images was used to express the regression relationship between the ndvi derived from the two types of images the wavelengths of nir and red bands of landsat 5 tm are identical to those of landsat 7 etm and the equation below can also be used to describe the relationship between the ndvi derived from the landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli images roy et al 2016 2 ndv i 5 n d v i 7 0 011 0 969 n d v i 8 where ndvi5 ndvi7 and ndvi8 represent the ndvi values derived from the landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images respectively the study area is located in a single scene image with path number 138 and row number 34 and the image in each year was selected from the summer of june to august all of the images with a 30 m resolution were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud website supported by the computer network information center at the chinese academy of sciences 3 results 3 1 climatic characteristics to investigate climate change in the nalenggele alluvial fan region the annual mean temperature precipitation and relative humidity from 1961 to 2016 were considered the time series plot of the annual mean temperature from the xiao zaohuo station is shown in fig 2 which demonstrates a significant increasing trend of the temperature in the study area with a confidence coefficient of 95 on the other hand the annual mean precipitation shows a slightly increasing trend fig 3 but does not meet the required confidence coefficient of 95 which means that the precipitation in the study area does not show a significant increase this was also discussed by fu et al 2011 climate has an inevitable impact on the environment in which vegetation grows traditional hydrometeorological indicators such as precipitation temperature and humidity are widely considered as the main factors having an impact on vegetation growth ye et al 2012 shen et al 2015 the climate of the study area during the past 55 years 1961 2016 had exhibited a significant warming and wetting trend the rates of increase in temperature and precipitation are approximately 0 65 c decade and 2 1 mm decade respectively and the climate regime has not changed significantly during the past 30 years 1986 2016 the monthly relative humidity from 1961 to 2016 showed a slightly decreasing tendency which is the opposite of the increasing tendency of temperature and precipitation and relative humidity showed an obvious increasing trend from 1986 to 2016 which is different from that from 1961 to 2016 3 2 ndvi variation over the past decades the ndvis from 1986 to 2016 were derived from the landsat scenes to evaluate the variation of vegetation coverage the spatial distribution of the average ndvi from 1986 to 2016 shows that the alluvial fan was mainly covered by the lower ndvi values majority of ndvi values of the area is less than or equal to zero because of the gobi desert sand dunes and river water which cover approximately 75 to 80 of the study area the positive ndvi value which indicates the existence of vegetation cover was used to express the variation of vegetation coverage during the past 30 years during the field survey in july 2011 it was found that the land with continuous coverage of high density vegetation has an ndvi value greater than 0 2 the computed ndvi in the study area and the field survey results in 2011 are shown in fig 4 typical ndvi values greater than 0 2 which were considered representative of high density vegetation of the desert oasis in the past 30 years cover only 0 10 to 11 52 of the study area fig 5 the maximum and average ndvi values of all the positive ndvi values show an increasing trend from 1986 to 2016 fig 6 the area proportions of positive ndvi values ndvi 0 2 also show an increasing trend fig 5 which reflects the progressive tendency of vegetation growth in order to find a correlation between climate change and the temporal variation of the ndvis a correlation analysis involving the computation of correlation coefficients between the ndvi values and the climatic variables was conducted previous studies in regard to the vegetation of arid areas in northwest china have shown that the response of vegetation to temperature was intense amid climate warming and the precipitation may not directly support the vegetation growth jin et al 2014 xu et al 2018 pan et al 2018 from the results shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the increased temperature precipitation and relative humidity all contribute to the vegetation growth the climatic variables also exhibit a certain correlation with the changing ndvi values in the past 30 years 1986 2016 however all of the correlation coefficients are less than 0 5 which indicates the climatic variables did not have any significant impact on the variation of vegetation cover all of the evidences suggest these climatic factors have little direct correlation with the ndvis of the nalenggele alluvial fan 3 3 correlation between vegetation and groundwater vegetation growth mainly depends on sunlight and water which are the main ingredients of photosynthesis pan et al 2018 as the growth season energy from the sunlight falling on the gobi desert is sufficient the vegetation growth there depends mainly on the supply of soil water in the root zone as discussed above the study area is located in an extremely arid environment with an average annual precipitation of less than 30 mm and evaporation more than 2700 mm precipitation cannot recharge the water in the root zone or the aeration zone and the shallow buried groundwater could supply majority of the water demand for vegetation growth the distribution of ndvi values during july 2011 is shown in fig 4 and the contour map of dwt in the same period obtained from observational data through the spatial interpolation method is shown in fig 8 from the spatial distribution of the ndvi values which indicate land surface vegetation cover of the study area it is clear that majority of the vegetation is distributed over the alluvial fan fringe area with shallow buried groundwater and it greatly depends on dwt as well the values of ndvi and dwt in the same location were extracted and the corresponding scatter diagram is shown in fig 9 the ndvi values range from 0 63 0 74 and the dwt values vary between 0 01 and 312 9 m approximately 76 of the data points are concentrated in the range of 0 63 ndvi 0 with the dwt range from zero to more than 300 m part a in fig 9 the corresponding spatial location of the data points is distributed among the desert the mountain area and the oasis another 24 of the data points are distributed in the range of 0 ndvi 0 74 part b in fig 9 the location of the data points is distributed among the desert and oasis with dwt ranging from 0 to 100 m data points with ndvi values greater than 0 2 are distributed among the areas with dwt ranging from 0 to 100 m part c in fig 9 and the vast majority of data points are distributed among the areas with dwt less than 20 m part d in fig 9 in addition some of the ndvi values were negative in the shallow groundwater area which could be due to the intense soil salinization in this area and the soil salinization was confirmed during a field survey fig 10 4 discussions 4 1 impact of changing environmental conditions on gdes the vegetation characteristics may be attributed to the combined influence of multiple factors including climate soil cover and hydrogeological features jin et al 2011 lv et al 2013 based on the above discussion it stands to reason that dwt should be the governing factor of vegetation in this area and the dsg is controlled by groundwater recharge and exploitation according to the previous studies shallow groundwater in the alluvial fan of this area is mainly recharged by river infiltration and the underground lateral flow that originates from the snowmelt and precipitation from the kunlun mountains su et al 2015 xu 2015 xu et al 2017 xiao et al 2018 groundwater recharge is directly related to the nalenggele river discharge which is controlled by the effective snowmelt in the mountain area and the snowmelt runoff will increase with the rising temperatures as a result of climate change wang and li 2005 therefore for future research groups to study the impact of climate change on vegetation an established groundwater flow numerical simulation model was used to predict the distribution of groundwater level xu 2015 several scenarios were proposed with the consideration of different river water discharges related to climate change and water resource exploitation long time series runoff data could not be monitored because the hydrometric station was set up for only four years during the 1960s the river discharge data in 1960 1963 were monitored by the hydrologic institution and the data in 2009 2011 and 2012 were monitored by the researchers during field surveys it is impossible to establish the relations between river discharge and climate change the maximum average and minimum river discharges in 1960 to 1963 2009 and 2011 to 2012 were used to express the river discharge of high normal and low flow years under the control of changing climate approximately 53 of the river discharges infiltrate and recharge the groundwater xu 2015 xu et al 2017 the quantity of water resource exploitation was determined based on the requirements of the existing water intake project and water resources planning the exploitation of groundwater includes a water source site and water demand from some mineral enterprises in this project the river water is supplied to agricultural irrigation by a diversion canal zhang et al 2014 three scenarios with extreme conditions have been proposed to simulate the river discharge scenario a sustained high temperature causes river discharge under the high flow condition with a flow quantity of 20 1 108 m3 a from 2011 to 2020 scenario b sustained normal temperature causes river discharge under the normal flow condition with a flow quantity of 12 9 108 m3 a from 2011 to 2020 scenario c sustained low temperature causes river discharge under the low flow condition with a flow quantity of 8 73 108 m3 a from 2011 to 2020 exploitation of groundwater and river from 2011 to 2020 is 0 40 108 m3 a and 2 15 108 m3 a in each scenario the detailed information of the scenarios are shown in table 2 the prediction model was tested under various input conditions and the depths to groundwater table for 2020 in different scenarios are shown in fig 11 groundwater availability for vegetation growth determines the correlation between vegetation and dwt variation which is controlled by a limitation of dwt this limitation is the ecological water level that was discussed for different areas with arid conditions similar to that of the nalenggele alluvial fan an ecological water level of 10 m was confirmed as the limitation of dwt in the semi arid hailiutu river catchment area of china lv et al 2013 and a similar limitation 8 10 m has also been established in australia at multiple sites zencich et al 2002 benyon et al 2006 o grady et al 2006 in the ejina area of china the suitable dwt limitation was found to be 2 8 5 0 m jin et al 2011 the limitation of dwt in the mahai river basin of the qaidam basin and in the desert oasis of the hexi corridor areas was found to be approximately 3 0 4 5 m zhao et al 2003 liu 2014 the limitation of dwt is influenced by a combination of floral species soil cover and climatic characteristics in this study the dwt of the boundary between the desert and the oasis is approximately 4 0 m according to the field survey and the depth might be the dividing limit considered as the limitation of dwt the distribution of range area with dwt less than 4 0 m is highlighted in fig 11 the number of areas with dwt less than 4 0 m in different scenarios was counted and compared with that in the status year of 2011 the areas in scenarios a b and c are approximately 86 82 5 and 78 of the areas in the status quo year respectively which means that the vegetation is at a risk of degradation from the combined influence of climate change and human activities temperature and precipitation were continuously increasing during the past years figs 2 and 3 which was proven to have caused an increase of ice snow melting and groundwater recharge in the natural state the groundwater flow system can attain a recharge drainage balance due to the regulation and storage capacity of groundwater aquifers therefore a decrease in dsg in the proposed scenarios should be caused by the disruption of groundwater flow balance which is directly caused by water resource exploitation and is a main reason behind the ecological degradation of gdes 4 2 consideration of management strategy and legislation for protection of gdes gdes are increasingly threatened by human led exploitation of water resources which often exceeds natural recharge rates gleeson et al 2015 rohde et al 2017 independent ecosystem protection or included underwater management strategy and legislation is one of the solutions for ensuring ecological health and sustainability of gdes there has not been any recent management strategy and legislation implemented in this area in china concerned authorities should educate themselves from the experiences of others for example adaptive management which is at the core of australia s approach for managing gdes utilizes ongoing monitoring and research to inform management decisions for determining the hydrologic conditions and thresholds required to maintain a gde richardson et al 2011 serov et al 2012 the learning by doing form of adaptive management strategy is suitable for the area of blank data monitoring and legislative supervision an iterative process from primal conceptualization to filling the knowledge gaps in the study of gdes combined with the internationally recognized concept of precautionary principle would be the purport of gdes protection under the adaptive management strategy ecological water requirements which include threshold value of depth to water table targets water quality standards and flow dynamic criteria at the boundary of interconnected surface water bodies rohde et al 2017 are the key elements in gdes management strategy formulation the determination of thresholds for gdes still remains a challenge for water management authorities largely due to the knowledge and information gaps present in the ecohydrology of the study area it is important for managers to integrate the biotic and abiotic factors of the gdes into local monitoring work understanding the abiotic factors including groundwater recharge mechanism and groundwater level water quality and groundwater surface water interaction and biotic factors including ecosystem structure species composition reproduction and growth are the essential prerequisites for gde protection risk assessments are required in the interim to prevent any adverse consequences of management actions that replying the natural resources exploitation and climate change legislators of natural resources management can achieve these local needs by leveraging additional assistance from research institutions and legislation and management strategy formulations are both interrelated in addition a coordinated approach of common frameworks and methodological approaches need to be mulled to promote overall success in the implementation of legislation rohde et al 2017 5 conclusions this study was conducted with an aim to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation in groundwater dependent ecosystems in arid areas long time series meteorological data and ndvi values were used to recognize the changing trend of climate change and variation of vegetation coverage during the past several decades from 1986 to 2016 the climate showed a warming and wetting trend and the variation of ndvi values showed an increasing trend which could indicate a progressive trend in vegetation growth however all of the climatic factors in the nalenggele alluvial fan were found to have little direct correlation with the ndvis of the region groundwater is the major source of water for vegetation growth in arid areas the distribution of shallow groundwater which is under the control of groundwater recharge mechanism determines the vegetation growth in the alluvial fan the warming temperature will cause an increasing trend of snowmelt runoff and the river discharge and infiltration to groundwater will increase both of which could cause an increase in the shallow groundwater area however human activities involving groundwater and river water exploitation will be counterproductive in some cases a prediction was made to tackle the situation three scenarios were proposed with the consideration of river discharges and water resources exploitation and the results showed that the distribution of shallow groundwater with the ecological water level dwt 4 m in 2020 will decrease to approximately 78 86 of the status quo year although vegetation growth in this area during the past several decades has been improving amid climate change the intervention of human activities will inevitably hinder the otherwise advantageous processes of vegetation growth in gdes thus proper management strategy and legislation for gde protection must be ratified to meet the challenges of human accelerated climate change and increasing demand of naturel resources declaration of interests the authors declare that
