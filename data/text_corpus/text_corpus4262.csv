21310,islands and reefs in the south china sea scs have typical characteristics of coral reef topography and geomorphology due to the complexity of topography and geomorphology waves propagating from the deep water area to the islands and reefs area deform much the short term characteristics and long term distribution characteristics of the waves are very different from the deep sea and of great importance to the evaluation of the movement and load of offshore engineering structures therefore this paper takes the typical island and reef area in the south china sea as an object on the one hand based on the field experiment data near the typical islands and reefs in the scs three models are applied to obtain the joint distribution of wave heights and periods through the comparison the goodness of data is given and the suitable model for the islands and reefs is put forward on the basis of the above the wave environment contour is obtained by using iform model to evaluate the joint distribution of wave heights and periods corresponding to different recurrence periods for the specific engineering sea area on the other hand starting from the short term wave behavior based on the characteristic sea conditions of typhoon waves and waves caused by the northeast monsoon at the fixed point the wave spectrum characteristics are analyzed to obtain the spectral slope of the high frequency of the wave spectrum which reveals the difference with that of the deep water wave spectrum the results of the above study lay a preliminary foundation for the accurate description of the characteristics of long term and short term wave conditions near islands and reefs of the scs keywords coral reef joint distribution of wave heights and periods goodness of data iform model environmental contour method ecm wave spectrum 1 introduction water waves are the most important environmental loads acting on marine structures the design of a marine structure always starts from prediction of wave loads to be encountered by the structure during her whole service life it is however difficult to accurately estimate transient loads from water waves due to the fact that an ocean wave is neither constant in its amplitude nor regular in its period as typical stochastic process ocean waves can be fully described by two excellent mathematical tools that is wave spectrum and joint distribution of wave heights and periods the former describes the short term energy distributions of waves 20 min 3 h over frequencies while the latter describes the long term statistical behavior of waves these two mathematical tools wave spectrum and joint distribution provide all necessary input information for a successful design of a marine structure in the present practices across worldwide design companies therefore a lot of research efforts have been devoted to determining them worldwide since world war ii the present paper is going to discuss the joint distribution of wave heights and periods and wave spectra near islands and reefs of scs the first seminal paper on the joint distribution of wave height period dates back to longuet higgins 1975 although the topic was already touched towards the end of world war ii he proposed the joint distribution of wave height period using the parameter v of spectrum width based on narrow banded wave spectrum assumption the distribution form is symmetric with respect to dimensionless period t 1 the work is remarkable in the aspect that he established the link between short term properties and long term behavior of water waves by inserting spectrum width in the height period distribution form this paper led to plenty and fruitful researches in the following decades an important progress was that the symmetric distribution form was replaced by asymmetric ones based on on site observation data bycavanié 1976 ochi 1976 and goda 1978 to name a few this led longuet higgins 1983 to modify his previous distribution model to an asymmetric one through introducing a pair of normalization factors fang and hogben 1982 made a long term statistics of the waves in the china sea and the northwest pacific ocean and proposed a joint distribution correction model of wave heights and periods based on the ochi method many authors among whom are haver 1985 bitner gregersen and haver 1989 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 and bitner gregersen 2005 adopted the conditional modeling pproach cma to model the joint distribution of wave height and period the probability of wave height follows rayleigh distribution or three parameter weibull distribution and the probability density function of periodic condition follows gaussian distribution or lognormal distribution more recently based on the measured data along the coast of spain guedes soares and carvalho 2015 studied the joint distribution of wave height and period with the characteristics of wind wave and swell wave spectra vanem 2016 presented a detailed study on the goodness of fits of various statistical models used for the joint distribution of wave heights and periods including the cma model bivariate lognormal model and several models based on families of symmetric and asymmetric copulas it is indicated that appropriate statistical models are still challenging to establish using a mixture of distributions to describe the long term joint behaviors of sea state parameters more accurate and realistic eg copula mixture dong et al 2015 soukissian 2017 zhang 2018 lin and dong 2020 in the study of joint distribution of wave height and period hindcast wave data from the models such as wam or wave watch iii is becoming an important source pilar 2008 orimolade 2016 wang 2018 lin and dong 2020 the research on environmental contour method ecm was first proposed bywinterstein 1993 the iform inverse first order reliability method method was used to evaluate the joint distribution characteristics of different extreme value variables such as the joint distribution of wave heights and periods the joint distribution of winds and waves and the joint distribution of winds currents and waves dnv 2010 haver 2009 later some scholars extended the method for example cai 2018 adopted the isorm inverse second order reliability method method to obtain a more conservative extreme joint distribution feature haselsteiner 2017 proposed to use the hdc highest density contour method to close the highest density region of a given probability density to obtain an environmental contour lin 2020 adopted the iform method to obtain the wave contours of the four seasons in the north atlantic eckert gallup et al 2014 proposed to use pca principal component analysis method to improve the contour of wave environment the wave spectrum mainly reflects the short term energy distribution characteristics of the wave the study of the wave spectrum can be traced back to the work of phillips 1958 afterwards many scholars proposed the widely used p m spectrum moscowitz 1964 ittc spectrum report of seakeeping committee 1978 and jonswap spectrum hasselmann 1973 goda 1999 in ocean engineering and ship engineering based on the measured data from the north atlantic and the north sea the main feature of these spectra is unimodal which can describe the sea conditions of pure wind waves or pure swells however the mixed waves often appear in the actual sea conditions therefore strekalov 1972 first proposed the superposition of unimodal spectra to construct a bimodal wave spectrum based on the idea a six parameter spectrum formula is proposed to express the mixed waves according to the measured spectrum data of the north atlantic by ochi and hubble 1976 after that a four parameter spectrum formula is constructed based on the measured data from the north atlantic and the north sea to describe the wind wave and swell parts by guedes soares 1984 1991 guedes soares and henriques 1998 and ewans 2006 the torsethaugen bimodal spectrum based on the measured data of the norwegian continental shelf is proposed to describe the mixed waves near continental shelf by torsethaugen 1993 2004 in recent years the application of the three bimodal spectra has been further expanded such as panahi and shafieefar 2015 lucas 2015 akbaria 2019 2020 in addition to the structure of the bimodal spectrum some scholars have also studied the relationship between seasonal wind waves in specific sea areas and the occurrence of bimodal spectra kumar 2012 rashmi 2012 nair 2016 glejin 2013 and how to separate wind wave and swell in the bimodal spectrum portilla 2009 voorrips 1997 rodriguez 1999 violante carvalho 2002 gerling 1992 as far as the current research progress is concerned there has not been a systematic study on the long term wave characteristics and statistical characteristics of wave spectrum near islands and reefs of scs the island and reef area is a finite depth or shallow water area whose topography and landform features are mainly coral reefs when the waves propagate from the deep sea to the area near the islands and reefs due to the influence of the seabed topography both wave breaking and bottom friction cause the wave energy to attenuate therefore there is going to be different for the long term and short term characteristics between the waves near islands and those in the deep sea this paper presents the long term and short term wave characteristics near islands and reefs from two aspects on the one hand based on long term observation data the different models of the joint distribution of wave heights and periods are used for fitting and the comparative analysis is carried out to obtain the suitable model for the islands and reefs on the basis of the suitable mode the wave environment contour method is used to obtain wave height and period combinations corresponding to the different recurrence periods in specific engineering sea area on the other hand taking typhoon waves and northeast monsoon waves as the typical sea conditions the high frequency attenuation characteristics of the wave spectrum near the islands and reefs are analyzed and the distribution of the peak frequencies of wind wave and swell related to the bimodal wave spectra under the typical sea conditions is obtained 2 theoretical models 2 1 the joint distribution of wave heights and periods 2 1 1 bivariate log normal distribution oh model the bivariate log normal distribution is proposed by ochi 1978 and may be written as 1 f x y 0 5 x y π 1 α 2 ε x ε y exp 0 5 1 α 2 ln x ξ x 2 ε x 2 2 α ln x ξ x ln y ξ y ε x ε y ln y ξ y 2 ε y 2 where x represents the significant wave height h s y represents the peak wave period t p or the zero up crossing wave period t z ξ x e lnx ε x v a r ln x ξ y e lny ε y v a r ln y α c o v ln x ln y ε x ε y these parameters are obtained from the natural logarithms of the observed values applying the usual estimators for the parameters of a normal distribution ochi 1978 has applied the bivariate log normal distribution to wave data from the north atlantic ocean and found it could describe long term wave conditions as a whole 2 1 2 fang and hogben s distribution f h model fang and hogben 1982 introduced a modification to the joint bivariate log normal distribution to include some correction for skewness in the significant wave heights 2 f x y 0 5 x y π 1 α 2 ε x ε y exp 0 5 1 α 2 ln x ξ x 2 ε x 2 2 α ln x ξ x ln y ξ y ε x ε y ln y ξ y 2 ε y 2 1 κ y 6 3 l n y ξ y l n y ξ y 3 where κ y is the coefficient of skewness of ln y some improvement in the fit to the data was obtained by this modification especially for cumulative probabilities exceeding 0 95 later fang 1994 continued to apply this method to study the wave characteristics of the china sea and the northwest pacific ocean 2 1 3 bitner gregersen distribution bg model bitner gregersen 1989 2005 advocate that wave height distribution follows rayleigh distribution or weibull distribution and the conditional distribution of wave period follows gaussian distribution or lognormal distribution the bitner gregersen joint distribution is to be constructed from the combination of the marginal distribution for significant wave height and the conditional distribution for wave period the wave height distribution may be expressed as 3 f h β α h γ α β 1 exp h γ α β where h represents the wave height α β and γ are parameters of distribution eq 3 is 3 parameter form of weibull distribution if γ 0 it becomes 2 parameter form adopted in the paper the conditional distribution for wave period may be written as 4 f t h 1 σ t 2 π exp ln t μ 2 2 σ 2 where μ and σ are obtained from the observed data the fitting formula is given as 5 μ e ln t a 0 a 1 h a 2 6 σ s t d ln t b 0 b 1 e b 2 h in eqs 5 and 6 a 0 a 1 a 2 b 0 b 1 and b 2 are empirical parameters which are obtained by the non linear least squares method therefore the joint model may be expressed as 7 f h t f t h f h 1 σ t 2 π exp ln t μ 2 2 σ 2 β α h γ α β 1 exp h γ α β bitner gregersen 1989 2005 applied the method to study the wave statistics for the norwegian continental shelf and the west shetland all measuring locations of the both sites have a water depth of more than 150 m 2 2 goodness of fits according to mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 consider just one cell with index i j of a bivariate scatter diagram an observed data point x y falls in this cell if 8 x i x x i 1 9 y i y y i 1 ww where x i i 1 2 l and y i j 1 2 m are the boundaries of the cells under the hypothesised distribution f x y x y the expected probability may be expressed as 10 p i j e f x y x i 1 y j 1 f x y x i 1 y f x y x i y j 1 f x y x i y j the expected standard deviation for the number of data points falling in each cell as 11 σ i j e n p i j e 1 p i j e the normalized cell deviation d i j defined by 12 d i j n i j o n i j e σ i j e n i j o n p i j e n p i j e 1 p i j e in eqs 11 and 12 n is the number of cells n l m obviously values of d i j closer to zero indicate a good fit the sum of d i j may be given as 13 d t o t i 1 l j 1 m d i j 2 7 environmental contour method ecm the environmental contour concept represents a rational procedure for defining an extreme sea state condition the idea is to define contours in the environmental parameter space usually h s t p or t z along which extreme responses with given return period should lie winterstein et al 1993 the iform inverse first order reliability method method is applied in the paper first determine the joint environmental model of sea state variables for example eq 7 is the joint environment model of h s and t p secondly transform the distribution to standard normalized u space 14 φ u 1 f h s h 15 φ u 2 f t z o r t p h s h after that establish the circle for prescribed return period in u space for observations recorded each 3rd hour the radius for the 100 year contour is 16 u 1 2 u 2 2 β φ 1 1 100 365 24 3 4 5 finally transform the circle into a contour in the environmental parameter space 17 h s f h s 1 φ u 1 18 t z o r t p f 1 t z o r t p h s φ u 2 2 4 spectrum modeling techniques p m spectrum and jonswap spectrum are widely used in ocean engineering as a basic type the bimodal spectrum can be constructed by partial superposition of wind sea and swell components such as ochi hubble spectrum soares spectrum and torsethaugen spectrum assumed to be described by 19 g f g s w f g w w f where g s w f is swell component g w w f is wind sea component if a modified jonswap spectrual function is basis the summation of these is used to describe the whole frequency spectrum given in terms of significant wave height h s spectral peak frequency f p and the peak enhancement factor γ the modified jonswap spectrual function is given by ewans 2006 20 g j f c f f p 5 exp 1 25 f f p 4 γ exp f

components in each sub spectrum are obtained by expressions composed of empirical parameters ochi 1976 in the torsethaugen model torsethaugen 1993 2004 each sea state is classified as swell dominated sea or wind dominated sea according to the criterion 24 t f a f h s 1 3 if t p t f the local wind sea dominates the spectral peak if t p t f the swell dominates the spectral peak in the paper a f take 5 3 3 example applications 3 1 field experiment points near islands and reefs there are three representative types of islands and reefs the first type is the multi port atoll lagoon the second type is the semi closed lagoon the third type is submerged reef there are two field measurement points inside the atoll lagoon as shown in fig 1 marked as no 1 and no 2 point 1 is located on the southeast side of the lagoon the water depth is about 30 m the measurement time period is 2014 6 1 2018 6 30 the number of samples is 56 416 and the sample interval is half an hour which is the sampling time of wave rider itself point 2 is located in the west of the lagoon the water depth is about 40 m the measurement time period is 2017 12 3 2018 10 14 the number of samples is 7495 and the sample interval is 1 h which is the sampling time of adcp itself the semi enclosed lagoon area is shown in fig 2 the filed measurement point is marked as no 3 which is located in the middle of the island chain the water depth is about 20 m the measurement period is from 2017 7 12 to 2017 11 3 the number of samples is 1368 and the sample interval is 2 h which is the sampling time set by adcp in the submerged reef the reef flats are all below the water surface as shown in fig 3 the field point is marked as no 4 the water depth is about 20 m the measurement time period is 2018 6 28 2018 10 31 the number of samples is 1506 and the sample interval is 2 h which is the sampling time set by adcp it should be noted that figs 2 and 3 can only show the relative position map of the measuring point and the islands and reefs respectively for no 3 and no 4 it is because there is only position information and local water depth but no detailed water depth data of surrounding sea area 3 2 comparison of the joint distribution of wave heights and periods generally speaking the water depth of the field experiment points of islands and reefs is less than 50 m and the waves are affected by the island reef shielding or terrain refraction to increase the resolution and the goodness of wave statistics the wave height level resolution is 0 25 m and the period level resolution is 0 5 s for no 1 no 3 for no 4 due to the large wave height range if the wave height level resolution is 0 25 m it will cause too many levels therefore the wave height level resolution is 0 5 m and the period level resolution is 0 5 s the above three models in section 2 1 are all based on deep water wave conditions or wave conditions with little influence of terrain which model is more suitable for describing wave conditions near islands and reefs this section will conduct detailed analysis and comparison when applying the bivariate log normal model the fitting parameters can be obtained from the observation data and substituted into equation 1 which can easily obtain the corresponding joint distribution of wave heights and periods similarly when applying the fang hogben model adding the correction term can also easily obtain the corresponding joint distribution of wave heights and periods for the bitner gregersen model first the wave height probability needs to be fitted and then the conditional period probability density at a given wave height is fitted the process of bitner gregersen is more complicated than the previous two models and we will focus on the process here the two parameter weibull distribution is adopted here the logarithm is obtained by the cumulative probability of wave height and then the least squares iterative fitting is performed to obtain the fitting parameters taking the measurement point 1 as an example the logarithmic fitting result of the cumulative distribution of the wave height is shown in fig 4 a and the comparison of probability density distribution between the corresponding fitted wave height and the observed wave height is shown in fig 4 b similarly the fitting parameters of measurement points 2 3 and 4 can be obtained and the results will not be presented in detail here seeing the fitting parameters of wave height for the measurement points 1 4 in table 1 for the conditional probability fitting of periods at a given wave height using eqs 5 and 6 the fitting parameters can be obtained by nonlinear iteration still taking measurement point 1 as an example the fitting result of the conditional probability of the periods at a given wave height is shown in fig 5 and the probability of the periods at the different wave heights is shown in fig 6 overall the fitting results are in good agreement with the observation data seeing the values of the conditional probability fitting parameters of the periods at the given wave heights related to points 1 to 4 in table 1 the three models bg model oh model and f h model are applied for the field measurement points 1 4 the comparison between the fitting results and the observation data is shown in figs 7 10 from the contour cloud diagrams related to the joint distribution of the wave heights and periods compared with the oh model and the f h model the fitting result trend of bg model is closer to the measured result the fitting results of the oh model and the f h model are closer to further quantitatively evaluate the deviation distribution of different models see figs 11 14 the statistical results are given in table 2 for measurement point 1 the deviation range of the bg model is 0 0000 5 5485 the sum of deviation is 63 54 the deviation range of the oh model is 0 0006 6 7532 the sum of deviation is 99 02 the deviation range of the f h model is 0 0002 7 2329 the sum of deviation 101 66 hence the order of fitting accuracy is bg model oh model and f h model for measurement points 2 3 and 4 bg model is the best f h model is second and oh model is worst according to the order of fitting accuracy overall the bg model is the most suitable for islands and reefs 3 3 environmental contours in engineering sea area the measurement point 1 is located in an engineering sea area and it is necessary to obtain wave heights and periods values of different recurrence periods as input conditions for platform motion and load evaluation therefore based on the observation data of the measurement point 1 the iform model is used to evaluate the contours of wave heights and periods corresponding to the recurrence periods of 5 years 10 years 25 years and 50 years as shown in fig 15 here the limit curve of wave steepness is also given the wave on the left side of the limit curve will break under the condition of small wavelength and large wave height that is the wave is not considered to occur in this case the wave on the right side is considered to be reasonable in the paper the wave steepness value refers to danel 1952 that is the wave steepness coefficient is 0 12 in engineering applications wave height probability distribution is often used to estimate the extreme values the extreme values of wave heights of different recurrence periods are estimated by the weibull distribution and the maximum significant wave heights corresponding to different recurrence periods of the wave contours are given in table 3 and the related results are shown in fig 16 the results show that it is conservative when using the univariate wave height distribution to calculate the extreme value of wave height additionally as the recurrence period increases the difference increases 3 4 characteristics of wave spectra among the above field measurement points near the islands and reefs the measurement time of point 1 is longer and the wave spectrum data is more abundant in the following the measurement point 1 is taken as an example to analyze the wave spectrum characteristics under typical sea conditions of typhoon waves and northeast monsoon waves here the typhoon kalmeagi typhoon number 201 415 2014 09 15 16 00 2014 09 16 17 30 and typhoon kujira typhoon number 201 508 2015 06 21 14 00 2015 06 24 19 30 are taken as two examples and the northeast monsoon wave takes 2014 12 19 18 30 2014 12 20 00 30 no 201412 and 2015 01 12 12 00 2015 01 13 09 00 no 201501 as two examples in the above examples the wave spectrum corresponding to the significant wave height greater than 1 0 m is selected and the time interval of wave spectrum output is half an hour in order to obtain the overall characteristics of the wave spectrum a dimensionless spectrum is used to normalize 25 ω ω ω p s s ω p 16 m 0 m 0 s ω d ω where ω p is peak angular frequency s ω is wave energy spectrum expressed in angular frequency and m 0 is 0 th moment of wave energy spectrum for the typhoon kalmaegi there are 53 the wave spectra the significant wave height of which is more than 1 0 m are shown in fig 17 in the high frequency part the spectral slope is about 2 9 which is very different from that of the deep sea both p m and jonswap spectral slopes are 5 0 during the period there are bimodal wave spectra in order to better present the characteristics of the bimodal wave spectrum 15 more obvious bimodal wave spectra were isolated as shown in fig 18 the spectral slope of the part is about 3 5 in the wind sea component the peak frequency of the spectrum is relatively discrete with a distribution range of 1 194 1 634 rad s in the swell component the spectral peak frequency distribution range is slightly narrow 0 628 1 068 rad s the statistical values of peak frequencies for this sea state are listed in table 4 for the typhoon kujira there are 156 the wave spectra the significant wave height of which is more than 1 0 m the number of bimodal wave spectra is 69 seeing fig 19 the spectral slope of the wave spectrum is about 3 5 which is also quite different from the high frequency spectral slope of the deep sea spectrum which is consistent with the spectral slope of the high frequency part of the kalmaegi typhoon wave bimodal spectrum the statistical values of the peak frequencies are listed in table 4 the peak frequency distribution of the wind sea part is discrete with a range of 0 880 1 759 rad s the peak frequency distribution of the swell part is slightly concentrated with a range of 0 628 0 942 rad s for no 201412 northeast monsoon waves there are 13 wave spectra with significant wave height of more than 1 0 m all of which are bimodal spectra as shown in fig 20 in the high frequency the spectral slope is about 4 5 which is almost consistent with that of the deep sea spectrum the peak frequency of the wind sea part is relatively concentrated ranging from 1 571 to 2 199 rad s the peak frequency of the swell part is also concentrated ranging from 0 754 to 0 942 rad s the values of the peak frequencies are listed in table 4 for no 201501 northeast monsoon wave there are 27 wave spectra with significant wave height of more than 1 0 m which are also bimodal spectra as shown in fig 21 in the high frequency the spectral slope is also about 4 5 which is consistent with the high frequency spectral slope of the no 201412 the spectral peak frequency distribution of the wind sea part is relatively concentrated ranging from 1 382 to 1 948 rad s the spectral peak frequency of the swell part is also relatively concentrated ranging from 0 754 to 1 131 rad s the values of the peak frequencies are listed in table 4 we use the empirical parameters of the ochi hubble abbreviated as oh wave spectrum to evaluate the peak swell frequency and peak wind wave frequency under the above four sea conditions and compare with the measured peak frequency and evaluate the applicability of torsethaugen abbreviated as tau spectrum criterion identifying wind sea part and swell part as for the typhoon waves the measured peak wind sea frequency of the kalmaegi typhoon wave is greater than the oh result and the measured peak swell frequency is mostly greater than the oh result as shown in fig 22 indicating that the oh model parameters are not suitable for evaluating the sea state near islands and reefs the tau separation frequency curve is basically between the peak wind sea frequency curve and the peak swell frequency curve indicating that the tau spectrum criterion can identify the wind sea component and the swell component of the mixed waves the kugira typhoon wave has the same characteristics as the kalmaegi typhoon wave as shown in fig 23 in view of the northeast monsoon waves in fig 24 the measured peak wind sea frequency and peak swell frequency of no 201412 are greater than the oh evaluation the tau separation frequency curve is basically between the peak wind sea frequency curve and the peak swell frequency distribution curve the same tendency presents for no 201501 as shown in fig 25 the comparison results of the four sea states indicate that the oh model parameters are not suitable for evaluating the peak frequency of mixed waves near islands and reefs and tau spectrum criterion is suitable for the separation of the components of mixed waves near islands and reefs 4 conclusions for the sea area near islands and reefs in scs this paper studies the long term wave and short term wave conditions and the results show that i for long term wave conditions the three models of the joint distribution of wave heights and periods are used for fitting and the fitted results are in good agreement with the overall trend of the measured results from the comparison of fitting accuracy the bg model is the most suitable for islands and reefs ii the wave contours can give the joint distribution value of wave heights and periods in different recurrence periods but the condition of the wave steepness limit curve also needs to be considered to determine the reasonable wave condition in engineering judging from the comparison between the maximum significant wave height corresponding to different recurrence periods of the wave contours and the extreme values of wave heights calculated using the univariate distribution of wave height the latter is more conservative iii the wave spectrum of typhoon waves near islands and reefs has bimodal characteristic and the high frequency spectral slope is about 3 5 which is quite different from the commonly used deep water wave spectrum the wave spectrum under the northeast monsoon wave sea conditions is all bimodal wave spectrum the high frequency spectral slope is about 4 5 which is basically consistent with the attenuation characteristics of the commonly used deep water wave spectrum iv the empirical parameters of the ochi hubble wave spectrum are not suitable for evaluating the peak frequency of mixed waves near islands and reefs and the torsethaugen criterion formula is applicable to the separation of the components of mixed waves near islands and reefs to sum up the research results of this paper provide a reference basis for the assessment of long term and short term wave conditions in the islands and reefs of scs and have certain guiding significance for the design construction and safe operation of

21310,islands and reefs in the south china sea scs have typical characteristics of coral reef topography and geomorphology due to the complexity of topography and geomorphology waves propagating from the deep water area to the islands and reefs area deform much the short term characteristics and long term distribution characteristics of the waves are very different from the deep sea and of great importance to the evaluation of the movement and load of offshore engineering structures therefore this paper takes the typical island and reef area in the south china sea as an object on the one hand

environmental contour method ecm wave spectrum 1 introduction water waves are the most important environmental loads acting on marine structures the design of a marine structure always starts from prediction of wave loads to be encountered by the structure during her whole service life it is however difficult to accurately estimate transient loads from water waves due to the fact that an ocean wave is neither constant in its amplitude nor regular in its period as typical stochastic process ocean waves can be fully described by two excellent mathematical tools that is wave spectrum and joint distribution of wave heights and periods the former describes the short term energy distributions of waves 20 min 3 h over frequencies while the latter describes the long term statistical behavior of

replaced by asymmetric ones based on on site observation data bycavanié 1976 ochi 1976 and goda 1978 to name a few this led longuet higgins 1983 to modify his previous distribution model to an asymmetric one through introducing a pair of normalization factors fang and hogben 1982 made a long term statistics of the waves in the china sea and the northwest pacific ocean and proposed a joint distribution correction model of wave heights and periods based on the ochi method many authors among whom are haver 1985 bitner gregersen and haver 1989 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 and bitner gregersen 2005 adopted the conditional modeling pproach cma to model the joint distribution of wave height and period the probability of wave height follows rayleigh distribution or three parameter weibull distribution and the probability density function of periodic condition follows gaussian distribution or lognormal distribution more recently based on the measured data along the coast of spain guedes soares and carvalho 2015 studied the joint distribution of wave height and period with the characteristics of wind wave and swell wave spectra vanem 2016 presented a detailed study on the goodness of fits of various statistical models used for the joint distribution of wave heights and periods including the cma model bivariate lognormal model and several models based on families of symmetric and asymmetric copulas it is indicated that appropriate statistical models are still challenging to establish using a mixture of distributions to describe the long term joint behaviors of sea state parameters more accurate and realistic eg copula mixture dong et al 2015 soukissian 2017 zhang 2018 lin and dong 2020 in the study of joint distribution of wave height and period hindcast wave data from the models such as wam or wave watch iii is becoming an important source pilar 2008 orimolade 2016 wang 2018 lin and dong 2020 the research on environmental contour method ecm was first proposed bywinterstein 1993 the iform inverse first order reliability method method was used to evaluate the joint distribution characteristics of different extreme value variables such as the joint distribution of wave heights and periods the joint distribution of winds and waves and the joint distribution of winds currents and waves dnv 2010 haver 2009 later some scholars extended the method for example cai 2018 adopted the isorm inverse second order reliability method method to obtain a more conservative extreme joint distribution feature haselsteiner 2017 proposed to use the hdc highest density contour method to close the highest density region of a given probability density to obtain an environmental contour lin 2020 adopted the iform method to obtain the wave contours of the four seasons in the north atlantic eckert gallup et al 2014 proposed to use pca principal component analysis method to improve the contour of wave environment the wave spectrum mainly reflects the short term energy distribution characteristics of the wave the study of the wave spectrum can be traced back to the work of phillips 1958 afterwards many scholars proposed the widely used p m spectrum moscowitz 1964 ittc spectrum report of seakeeping committee 1978 and jonswap spectrum hasselmann 1973 goda 1999 in ocean engineering and ship engineering based on the measured data from the north atlantic and the north sea the main feature of these spectra is unimodal which can describe the sea conditions of pure wind waves or pure swells however the mixed waves often appear in the actual sea conditions therefore strekalov 1972 first proposed the superposition of unimodal spectra to construct a bimodal wave spectrum based on the idea a six parameter spectrum formula is proposed to express the mixed waves according to the measured spectrum data of the north atlantic by ochi and hubble 1976 after that a four parameter spectrum formula is constructed based on the measured data from the north atlantic and the north sea to describe the wind wave and swell parts by guedes soares 1984 1991 guedes soares and henriques 1998 and ewans 2006 the torsethaugen bimodal spectrum based on the measured data of the norwegian continental shelf is proposed to describe the mixed waves near continental shelf by torsethaugen 1993 2004 in recent years the application of the three bimodal spectra has been further expanded such as panahi and shafieefar 2015 lucas 2015 akbaria 2019 2020 in addition to the structure of the bimodal spectrum some scholars have also studied the relationship between seasonal wind waves in specific sea areas and the occurrence of bimodal spectra kumar 2012 rashmi 2012 nair 2016 glejin 2013 and how to separate wind wave and swell in the bimodal spectrum portilla 2009 voorrips 1997 rodriguez 1999 violante carvalho 2002 gerling 1992 as far as the current research progress is concerned there has not been a systematic study on the long term wave characteristics and statistical characteristics of wave spectrum near islands and reefs of scs the island and reef area is a finite depth or shallow water area whose topography and landform features are mainly coral reefs when the waves propagate from the deep sea to the area near the islands and reefs due to the influence of the seabed topography both wave breaking and bottom friction cause the wave energy to attenuate therefore there is going to be different for the long term and short term characteristics between the waves near islands and those in the deep sea this paper presents the long term and short term wave characteristics near islands and reefs from two aspects on the one hand based on long term observation data the different models of the joint distribution of wave heights and periods are used for fitting and the comparative analysis is carried out to obtain the suitable model for the islands and reefs on the basis of the suitable mode the wave environment contour method is used to obtain wave height and period combinations corresponding to the different recurrence periods in specific engineering sea area on the other hand taking typhoon waves and northeast monsoon waves as the typical sea conditions the high frequency attenuation characteristics of the wave spectrum near the islands and reefs are analyzed and the distribution of the peak frequencies of wind wave and swell related to the bimodal wave spectra under the typical sea conditions is obtained 2 theoretical models 2 1 the joint distribution of wave heights and periods 2 1 1 bivariate log normal distribution oh model the bivariate log normal distribution is proposed by ochi 1978 and may be written as 1 f x y 0 5 x y π 1 α 2 ε x ε y exp 0 5 1 α 2 ln x ξ x 2 ε x 2 2 α ln x ξ x ln y ξ y ε x ε y ln y ξ y 2 ε y 2 where x represents the significant wave height h s y represents the peak wave period t p or the zero up crossing wave period t z ξ x e lnx ε x v a r ln x ξ y e lny ε y v a r ln y α c o v ln x ln y ε x ε y these parameters are obtained from the natural logarithms of the observed values applying the usual estimators for the parameters of a normal distribution ochi 1978 has applied the bivariate log normal distribution to wave data from the north atlantic ocean and found it could describe long term wave conditions as a whole 2 1 2 fang and hogben s distribution f h model fang and hogben 1982 introduced a modification to the joint bivariate log normal distribution to include some correction for skewness in the significant wave heights 2 f x y 0 5 x y π 1 α 2 ε x ε y exp 0 5 1 α 2 ln x ξ x 2 ε x 2 2 α ln x ξ x ln y ξ y ε x ε y ln y ξ y 2 ε y 2 1 κ y 6 3 l n y ξ y l n y ξ y 3 where κ y is the coefficient of skewness of ln y some improvement in the fit to the data was obtained by this modification especially for cumulative probabilities exceeding 0 95 later fang 1994 continued to apply this method to study the wave characteristics of the china sea and the northwest pacific ocean 2 1 3 bitner gregersen distribution bg model bitner gregersen 1989 2005 advocate that wave height distribution follows rayleigh distribution or weibull distribution and the conditional distribution of wave period follows gaussian distribution or lognormal distribution the bitner gregersen joint distribution is to be constructed from the combination of the marginal distribution for significant wave height and the conditional distribution for wave period the wave height distribution may be expressed as 3 f h β α h γ α β 1 exp h γ α β where h represents the wave height α β and γ are parameters of distribution eq 3 is 3 parameter form of weibull distribution if γ 0 it becomes 2 parameter form adopted in the paper the conditional distribution for wave period may be written as 4 f t h 1 σ t 2 π exp ln t μ 2 2 σ 2 where μ and σ are obtained from the observed data the fitting formula is given as 5 μ e ln t a 0 a 1 h a 2 6 σ s t d ln t b 0 b 1 e b 2 h in eqs 5 and 6 a 0 a 1 a 2 b 0 b 1 and b 2 are empirical parameters which are obtained by the non linear least squares method therefore the joint model may be expressed as 7 f h t f t h f h 1 σ t 2 π exp ln t μ 2 2 σ 2 β α h γ α β 1 exp h γ α β bitner gregersen 1989 2005 applied the method to study the wave statistics for the norwegian continental shelf and the west shetland all measuring locations of the both sites have a water depth of more than 150 m 2 2 goodness of fits according to mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 consider just one cell with index i j of a bivariate scatter diagram an observed data point x y falls in this cell if 8 x i x x i 1 9 y i y y i 1 ww where x i i 1 2 l and y i j 1 2 m are the boundaries of the cells under the hypothesised distribution f x y x y the expected probability may be expressed as 10 p i j

good fit the sum of d i j may be given as 13 d t o t i 1 l j 1 m d i j 2 7 environmental contour method ecm the environmental contour concept represents a rational procedure for defining an extreme sea state condition the idea is to define contours in the environmental parameter space usually h s t p or t z along which extreme responses with given return period should lie winterstein et al 1993 the iform inverse first order reliability method method is applied in the paper first determine the joint environmental model of sea state variables for example eq 7 is the joint environment model of h s and t p secondly transform the distribution to standard normalized u space 14 φ u 1 f h s h 15 φ u 2 f t z o r t p h s h after that establish the circle for prescribed return period in u space for observations recorded each 3rd hour the radius for the 100 year contour is 16 u 1 2 u 2 2 β φ 1 1 100 365 24 3 4 5 finally transform the circle into a contour in the environmental parameter space 17 h s f h s 1 φ u 1 18 t z o r t p f 1 t z o r t p h s φ u 2 2 4 spectrum modeling techniques p m spectrum and jonswap spectrum are widely used in ocean engineering as a basic type the bimodal spectrum can be constructed by partial superposition of wind sea and swell components such as ochi hubble spectrum soares spectrum and torsethaugen spectrum assumed to be described by 19 g f g s w f g w w f where g s w f is swell component g w w f is wind sea component if a modified jonswap spectrual function is basis the summation of these is used to describe the whole frequency spectrum given in terms of significant wave height h s spectral peak frequency f p and the peak enhancement factor γ the modified jonswap spectrual function is given by ewans 2006 20 g j f c f f p 5 exp 1 25 f f p 4 γ exp f

components in each sub spectrum are obtained by expressions composed of empirical parameters ochi 1976 in the torsethaugen model torsethaugen 1993 2004 each sea state is classified as swell dominated sea or wind dominated sea according to the criterion 24 t f a f h s 1 3 if t p t f the local wind sea dominates the spectral peak if t p t f the swell dominates the spectral peak in the paper a f take 5 3 3 example applications 3 1 field experiment points near islands and reefs there are three representative types of islands and reefs the first type is the multi port atoll lagoon the second type is the semi closed lagoon the third type is submerged reef there are two field measurement points inside the atoll lagoon as shown in fig 1 marked as no 1 and no 2 point 1 is located on the southeast side of the lagoon the water depth is about 30 m the measurement time period is 2014 6 1 2018 6 30 the number of samples is 56 416 and the sample interval is half an hour which is the sampling time of wave rider itself point 2 is located in the west of the lagoon the water depth is about 40 m the measurement time period is 2017 12 3 2018 10 14 the number of samples is 7495 and the sample interval is 1 h which is the sampling time of adcp itself the semi enclosed lagoon area is shown in fig 2 the filed measurement point is marked as no 3 which is located in the middle of the island chain the water depth is about 20 m the measurement period is from 2017 7 12 to 2017 11 3 the number of samples is 1368 and the sample interval is 2 h which is the sampling time set by adcp in the submerged reef the reef flats are all below the water surface as shown in fig 3 the field point is marked as no 4 the water depth is about 20 m the measurement time period is 2018 6 28 2018 10 31 the number of samples is 1506 and the sample interval is 2 h which is the sampling time set by adcp it should be noted that figs 2 and 3 can only show the relative position map of the measuring point and the islands and reefs respectively for no 3 and no 4 it is because there is only position information and local water depth but no detailed water depth data of surrounding sea area 3 2 comparison of the joint distribution of wave heights and periods generally speaking the water depth of the field experiment points of islands and reefs is less than 50 m and the waves are affected by the island reef shielding or terrain refraction to increase the resolution and the goodness of wave statistics the wave height level resolution is 0 25 m and the period level resolution is 0 5 s for no 1 no 3 for no 4 due to the large wave height range if the wave height level resolution is 0 25 m it will cause too many levels therefore the wave height level resolution is 0 5 m and the period level resolution is 0 5 s the above three models in section 2 1 are all based on deep water wave conditions or wave conditions with little influence of terrain which model is more suitable for describing wave conditions near islands and reefs this section will conduct detailed analysis and comparison when applying the bivariate log normal model the fitting parameters can be obtained from the observation data and substituted into equation 1 which can easily obtain the corresponding joint distribution of wave heights and periods similarly when applying the fang hogben model adding the correction term can also easily obtain the corresponding joint distribution of wave heights and periods for the bitner gregersen model first the wave height probability needs to be fitted and then the conditional period probability density at a given wave height is fitted the process of bitner gregersen is more complicated than the previous two models and we will focus on the process here the two parameter weibull distribution is adopted here the logarithm is obtained by the cumulative probability of wave height and then the least squares iterative fitting is performed to obtain the fitting parameters taking the measurement point 1 as an example the logarithmic fitting result of the cumulative distribution of the wave height is shown in fig 4 a and the comparison of probability density distribution between the corresponding fitted wave height and the observed wave height is shown in fig 4 b similarly the fitting parameters of measurement points 2 3 and 4 can be obtained and the results will not be presented in detail here seeing the fitting parameters of wave height for the measurement points 1 4 in table 1 for the conditional probability fitting of periods at a given wave height using eqs 5 and 6 the fitting parameters can be obtained by nonlinear iteration still taking measurement point 1 as an example the fitting result of the conditional probability of the periods at a given wave height is shown in fig 5 and the probability of the periods at the different wave heights is shown in fig 6 overall the fitting results are in good agreement with the observation data seeing the values of the conditional probability fitting parameters of the periods at the given wave heights related to points 1 to 4 in table 1 the three models bg model oh model and f h model are applied for the field measurement points 1 4 the comparison between the fitting results and the observation data is shown in figs 7 10 from the contour cloud diagrams related to the joint distribution of the wave heights and periods compared with the oh model and the f h model the fitting result trend of bg model is closer to the measured result the fitting results of the oh model and the f h model are closer to further quantitatively evaluate the deviation distribution of different models see figs 11 14 the statistical results are given in table 2 for measurement point 1 the deviation range of the bg model is 0 0000 5 5485 the sum of deviation is 63 54 the deviation range of the oh model is 0 0006 6 7532 the sum of deviation is 99 02 the deviation range of the f h model is 0 0002 7 2329 the sum of deviation 101 66 hence the order of fitting accuracy is bg model oh model and f h model for measurement points 2 3 and 4 bg model is the best f h model is second and oh model is worst according to the order of fitting accuracy overall the bg model is the most suitable for islands and reefs 3 3 environmental contours in engineering sea area the measurement point 1 is located in an engineering sea area and it is necessary to obtain wave heights and periods values of different recurrence periods as input conditions for platform motion and load evaluation therefore based on the observation data of the measurement point 1 the iform model is used to evaluate the contours of wave heights and periods corresponding to the recurrence periods of 5 years 10 years 25 years and 50 years as shown in fig 15 here the limit curve of wave steepness is also given the wave on the left side of the limit curve will break under the condition of small wavelength and large wave height that is the wave is not considered to occur in this case the wave on the right side is considered to be reasonable in the paper the wave steepness value refers to danel 1952 that is the wave steepness coefficient is 0 12 in engineering applications wave height probability distribution is often used to estimate the extreme values the extreme values of wave heights of different recurrence periods are estimated by the weibull distribution and the maximum significant wave heights corresponding to different recurrence periods of the wave contours are given in table 3 and the related results are shown in fig 16 the results show that it is conservative when using the univariate wave height distribution to calculate the extreme value of wave height additionally as the recurrence period increases the difference increases 3 4 characteristics of wave spectra among the above field measurement points near the islands and reefs the measurement time of point 1 is longer and the wave spectrum data is more abundant in the following the measurement point 1 is taken as an example to analyze the wave spectrum characteristics under typical sea conditions of typhoon waves and northeast monsoon waves here the typhoon kalmeagi typhoon number 201 415 2014 09 15 16 00 2014 09 16 17 30 and typhoon kujira typhoon number 201 508 2015 06 21 14 00 2015 06 24 19 30 are taken as two examples and the northeast monsoon wave takes 2014 12 19 18 30 2014 12 20 00 30 no 201412 and 2015 01 12 12 00 2015 01 13 09 00 no 201501 as two examples in the above examples the wave spectrum corresponding to the significant wave height greater than 1 0 m is selected and the time interval of wave spectrum output is half an hour in order to obtain the overall characteristics of the wave spectrum a dimensionless spectrum is used to normalize 25 ω ω ω p s s ω p 16 m 0 m 0 s ω d ω where ω p is peak angular frequency s ω is wave energy spectrum expressed in angular frequency and m 0 is 0 th moment of wave energy spectrum for the typhoon kalmaegi there are 53 the wave spectra the significant wave height of which is more than 1 0 m are shown in fig 17 in the high frequency part the spectral slope is about 2 9 which is very different from that of the deep sea both p m and jonswap spectral slopes are 5 0 during the period there are bimodal wave spectra in order to better present the characteristics of the bimodal wave spectrum 15 more obvious bimodal wave spectra were isolated as shown in fig 18 the spectral slope of the part is about 3 5 in the wind sea component the peak frequency of the spectrum is relatively discrete with a distribution range of 1 194 1 634 rad s in the swell component the spectral peak frequency distribution range is slightly narrow 0 628 1 068 rad s the statistical values of peak frequencies for this sea state are listed in table 4 for the typhoon kujira there are 156 the wave spectra the significant wave height of which is more than 1 0 m the number of bimodal wave spectra is 69 seeing fig 19 the spectral slope of the wave spectrum is about 3 5 which is also quite different from the high frequency spectral slope of the deep sea spectrum which is consistent with the spectral slope of the high frequency part of the kalmaegi typhoon wave bimodal spectrum the statistical values of the peak frequencies are listed in table 4 the peak frequency distribution of the wind sea part is discrete with a range of 0 880 1 759 rad s the peak frequency distribution of the swell part is slightly concentrated with a range of 0 628 0 942 rad s for no 201412 northeast monsoon waves there are 13 wave spectra with significant wave height of more than 1 0 m all of which are bimodal spectra as shown in fig 20 in the high frequency the spectral slope is about 4 5 which is almost consistent with that of the deep sea spectrum the peak frequency of the wind sea part is relatively concentrated ranging from 1 571 to 2 199 rad s the peak frequency of the swell part is also concentrated ranging from 0 754 to 0 942 rad s the values of the peak frequencies are listed in table 4 for no 201501 northeast monsoon wave there are 27 wave spectra with significant wave height of more than 1 0 m which are also bimodal spectra as shown in fig 21 in the high frequency the spectral slope is also about 4 5 which is consistent with the high frequency spectral slope of the no 201412 the spectral peak frequency distribution of the wind sea part is relatively concentrated ranging from 1 382 to 1 948 rad s the spectral peak frequency of the swell part is also relatively concentrated ranging from 0 754 to 1 131 rad s the values of the peak frequencies are listed in table 4 we use the empirical parameters of the ochi hubble abbreviated as oh wave spectrum to evaluate the peak swell frequency and peak wind wave frequency under the above four sea conditions and compare with the measured peak frequency and evaluate the applicability of torsethaugen abbreviated as tau spectrum criterion identifying wind sea part and swell part as for the typhoon waves the measured peak wind sea frequency of the kalmaegi typhoon wave is greater than the oh result and the measured peak swell frequency is mostly greater than the oh result as shown in fig 22 indicating that the oh model parameters are not suitable for evaluating the sea state near islands and reefs the tau separation frequency curve is basically between the peak wind sea frequency curve and the peak swell frequency curve indicating that the tau spectrum criterion can identify the wind sea component and the swell component of the mixed waves the kugira typhoon wave has the same characteristics as the kalmaegi typhoon wave as shown in fig 23 in view of the northeast monsoon waves in fig 24 the measured peak wind sea frequency and peak swell frequency of no 201412 are greater than the oh evaluation the tau separation frequency curve is basically between the peak wind sea frequency curve and the peak swell frequency distribution curve the same tendency presents for no 201501 as shown in fig 25 the comparison results of the four sea states indicate that the oh model parameters are not suitable for evaluating the peak frequency of mixed waves near islands and reefs and tau spectrum criterion is suitable for the separation of the components of mixed waves near islands and reefs 4 conclusions for the sea area near islands and reefs in scs this paper studies the long term wave and short term wave conditions and the results show that i for long term wave conditions the three models of the joint distribution of wave heights and periods are used for fitting and the fitted results are in good agreement with the overall trend of the measured results from the comparison of fitting accuracy the bg model is the most suitable for islands and reefs ii the wave contours can give the joint distribution value of wave heights and periods in different recurrence periods but the condition of the wave steepness limit curve also needs to be considered to determine the reasonable wave condition in engineering judging from the comparison between the maximum significant wave height corresponding to different recurrence periods of the wave contours and the extreme values of wave heights calculated using the univariate distribution of wave height the latter is more conservative iii the wave spectrum of typhoon waves near islands and reefs has bimodal characteristic and the high frequency spectral slope is about 3 5 which is quite different from the commonly used deep water wave spectrum the wave spectrum under the northeast monsoon wave sea conditions is all bimodal wave spectrum the high frequency spectral slope is about 4 5 which is basically consistent with the attenuation characteristics of the commonly used deep water wave spectrum iv the empirical parameters of the ochi hubble wave spectrum are not suitable for evaluating the peak frequency of mixed waves near islands and reefs and the torsethaugen criterion formula is applicable to the separation of the components of mixed waves near islands and reefs to sum up the research results of this paper provide a reference basis for the assessment of long term and short term wave conditions in the islands and reefs of scs and have certain guiding significance for the design construction and safe operation of

21311,due to ice floe impacts or iceberg collisions the side structures of ships and offshore platforms operating in arctic region may experience permanent deformations which may have significant influences on their structural safety and working performance to provide insight into the plastic deformations of plates this paper investigates the nonlinear elastic plastic responses of plates impacted by an ice wedge striker and an idealized rigid striker by both experimental and numerical methods the ice material model based on a soil and concrete material model is used in ansys ls dyna program to simulate the ice mechanical behaviour in an ice plate impact scenario good correlation is obtained between the experimental numerical and analytical results for plastic deformations of plate and collision forces the comparisons of elastic plastic responses of plate under these two strikers are conducted by both model tests and numerical simulations besides a series of numerical calculations are carried out to study the differences of ice plate impact and rigid striker plate impact the plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate energy dissipation of ice damage are investigated moreover for these specific cases studied an energy absorption reduction factor earf of plate under ice impact compared to rigid striker impact is proposed to estimate the structural damage which provide some useful information for the design of ship plate against ice impact keywords ship plates permanent deformations ice impact model tests energy absorption reduction factor 1 introduction arctic region has abundant oil and gas resources and acts as a lifeline for many communities with the increasing exploitation of the arctic channel more voyages across the arctic waters will be possible in the future due to the global warming and declined extent of sea ice however the increased ship traffic and resources exploitation activities in these waters may increase the probability of impacts between ice floes icebergs and ships and offshore structures which necessitates the safety assessment of these events thus the assessment of the dynamic structural behaviour of ship plates subjected to ice impacts is of paramount importance to improving the safety of ships and offshore structures operating in arctic region the structural design against ice impact has been commonly carried out using the limit state design approaches such as the ultimate limit state uls and accidental limit state als in this regard the loads from rare iceberg or huge ice floe impacts can be described as an abnormal level ice event alie as seen in international organization for standardization iso standards iso cd 19906 2010 which is in accordance with the accidental limit state als in the current standard codes for ship and offshore structures in als design method the annual probability of occurrence is typically 10 4 and the allowable structural damage due to ice impact loading can be determined based upon the fact that is the structure has enough residual strength to prevent progressive collapse and that the safety of the crew and environment can be maintained amdahl 2019 based on the als method there are three design strategies for ship structures namely the ductility design shared energy design and strength design as shown in fig 1 the shared energy design method is widely used in the design of general ice strengthened ships and by this method the plastic deformations are inevitable in ship operations this method implies that both the ship structure and the ice dissipate energies by undergoing significant deformations or damage the whole collision energy is shared by both colliding bodies as indicated in fig 2 for this design method the degree of structural deformation or damage depends on their relative strength when the ice is stiff enough or even can be assumed as an idealized rigid body the impact energies are mainly dissipated by the ship structures which corresponds to the ductile design method therefore it is of great significant to study the plastic deformation and energy absorption mechanisms arising from the impacts between the ship plates and ice floes or icebergs in recent years many studies have been dedicated to investigating the dynamic structural behaviour of ship structures impacted by ice floes or icebergs using both the experimental and numerical methods gagnon and derradji aouat 2006 and gagnon 2008 conducted full scale collision tests between ccgs terry fox icebreaker and a bergy bit gagnon 2007 and gagnon and wang 2012 also carried out scaled model collision tests between structures and ice body from which the test results agree well with the numerical results ritch et al 2008 also conducted small iceberg collision test for terry fox icebreaker and measured the local collision forces applied on the ship structure in the impact process kim et al 2017 carried out laboratory experiments for freshwater ice blocks impacting with a floating stiffened steel structure to study the shared energy absorbing mechanism in the ice structure impact process and the permanent deformations of this steel structure together with ice damage were investigated in the tests the aforementioned full scale tests and model tests can provide valuable results to validate the accuracy of numerical simulations numerical method is widely used to predict the ice impact loads and structural damage by mainly using the nonlinear finite element method nfem zhu et al 2016 and zhu et al 2018a used the isotropic elastic failure model to study the dynamic behaviour of ship plates under ice floe impacts gagnon 2011 and kim et al 2015 used a crushable foam material model to simulate the ice behaviour in the ice structure interaction problems liu et al 2011a and liu et al 2011b used a user defined elastic plastic material model to simulate the ice behaviour in the ship iceberg collision problems in their studies the yield criterion of the ice material is based on the tsai wu yield surface presented by derradji aouat 2000 they also proposed an empirical failure criterion based on the effective plastic strain and hydrostatic pressure gao et al 2015 improved the ice failure criterion proposed by liu et al 2011a to model the ice failure behaviour considered the temperature effect on ice mechanical properties shi et al 2017 proposed a temperature gradient dependent elastic plastic ice material model to study the influence of temperature on the collision forces obtained from the ship iceberg collisions polach and ehlers 2013 and polach et al 2013 applied the lemaitre damage model to model the ice failure behaviours and the numerical results were found to agree well with the related experimental results based on the kosori ice model ince et al 2017a and ince et al 2017b used a modified johnson cook material model to simulate the ice behaviours in the ice structure impact scenario ice has many pores internal flaws and initial cracks which is a complex natural composite material the ice failure behaviours are difficult to simulate by a numerical material model due to its strong brittle characteristics in the collision process considered the similarity between concrete constitutive relations and ice constitutive relations to some extent a similar soil and concrete constitutive ice model was proposed by cai et al 2020 to simulate the ice material behaviour in ice impact process based on this ice model the elasto plastic behaviours of plates under ice impact are studied both experimentally and numerically in this paper the laboratory experiments for scaled plates impacted by ice wedge and rigid wedge were conducted using the self designed horizontal impact machine the numerical results by using ansys ls dyna software are validated by the experimental results the study presented in this paper is motivated to provide more information about the comparisons of ship structure under ice impact and rigid body impact the aim of this paper is to investigate the differences between the ice plate impact and the rigid striker plate impact and to study the influences of energy dissipation of ice on the permanent deformations and energy absorption of the struck plates 2 experiment set up a series of model tests were carried out to study the elastic plastic behaviour of steel plates subjected to ice steel wedge impacts table 1 summarizes the initial impact mass initial impact velocity and initial impact energy of model tests the plate specimens used in the tests were cut from mild steel sheets with thickness h 2 mm and the size of the plate specimens were 560 560 mm and 960 560 mm as shown in fig 3 the impact model tests were conducted using a horizontal impact facility in the wut ifsi lab as shown in fig 4 the ice steel striking wedge travels along horizontal rails and hits the fully clamped specimen at its center the plate specimen is mounted onto a strong base via the square clamps with thickness 40 mm and 80 mm equally spaced bolts to achieve a fully clamped connection between the specimen and base 2 1 ice wedge impact tests in the ice plate impact experiments the ice floes are simplified as an ice wedge as shown in fig 5 it is a key challenge to produce ice wedges in a laboratory condition the ice wedge was prepared in a very particular way to homogenize the crystalline structure the ice model was made by freezing the mixture of water and crushed ice at 25 c temperature the size of crushed ice was approximately 5 mm the frozen temperature frozen time and ice frozen process were strictly controlled to be the same to ensure the same mechanical properties of ice wedge the geometrical dimensions of ice models produced in laboratory for the model tests are shown in fig 5 in the experimental process the ice wedge will be mounted within the wheel trolley as shown in fig 6 the wheel trolley carrying the ice wedge will slide down along the rails of the horizontal impact machine which can obtain an initial impact velocity determined by its start position on the curved rails fig 6 shows the experimental set up and the relevant measuring devices the struck plate specimens are clamped by 80 mm long equally spaced m8 bolts between two steel clamps the impact position is placed at the middle of the plate specimen as seen in fig 6 the high speed camera acceleration sensor and laser displacement sensor are used to measure the velocity histories of ice wedge the acceleration histories of ice wedge and the displacement histories of the central point of plate specimen relatively the m p data acquisition system and tmr data acquisition system are used to output the signal data 2 2 steel wedge impact tests the steel wedge striker plate impact test is similar to the ice plate impact test the time histories of collision accelerations and plate deformations are recorded by the measuring instruments the v shape vertical steel wedge striker is attached to the front of the wheel trolley as shown in fig 7 the striker is relatively sharp with a small radius at the rip and the vertical length of the striker is 200 mm it was fabricated using the high strength steel which has no deformations in the impact tests 3 numerical model 3 1 ice model in the ice impact process the ice failure behaviour mainly shows brittle characteristics to some extent the ice material behaves in a similar way like the concrete since the failure behaviour of the concrete material also shows brittle characteristics under compression therefore in this study a similar soil and concrete constitutive ice model is used to model the ice material properties specifically the material type mat soil concrete is selected from the ansys ls dyna material model library to simulate the ice model this constitutive model permits ice to be efficiently modelled in addition it is easy for material models to input characteristic parameters of materials besides the maximum equivalent stress failure criteria are added to the ice model properties by using the material type of mat add erosion this ice numerical model was introduced by cai et al 2020 and the detailed ice material parameter definitions can be found in this reference this ice model is an isotropic elastic plastic pressure dependent damage model the main material properties and failure criteria applied in the ice numerical model are summarized in table 2 3 2 plate model the dimensions of plate model are shown in fig 3 the standard in house quasi static tensile tests were conducted to obtain the mechanical properties of plate specimen the tensile specimens were machined according to the national standard gb t 2002 the engineering and true stress strain curves of plate material are presented in fig 8 and the mechanical properties of the plate model are summarized in table 3 the material of plate specimen is modelled by the material model mat 024 mat piecewise linear plasticiyt selected from ansys ls dyna in this material model mat 024 the true stress strain curve fig 8 can be applied and the strain rate sensitivity effect is considered as the cowper symonds constitutive equation is adopted since the actual dynamic material tests are not conducted to determine the material constants the values of d 40 4 s and q 5 are obtained from uniaxial tests by cowper and symonds 1957 3 3 fe model set up the commercial package ansys ls dyna is employed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of plate subjected to ice steel wedge impact according to the ice plate impact model tests the finite element models of ice plate impact are designed with three components plate specimen part 1 ice wedge part 2 and added mass part 3 as shown in fig 9 the added mass part 3 is used to replace the wheel trolley and other steel mass in tests the steel plate is modelled by four node shell elements with five integration points throughout the thickness with defining the hughes liu shell element formulation the ice wedge part 2 and added mass part 3 are modelled by solid 164 elements the ice material model part 2 is introduced in section 3 1 the material model of plate specimen part 1 is introduced in section 3 2 the material model of added mass part 3 uses the material type mat plastic kinematic selected from the library of ls dyna and in this material model the density is 7850 kg m3 the young s modulus is 206 gpa the poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the tangent modulus is 206 mpa the option contact eroding surface to surface is applied to define contact between plate specimen part 1 and the newly emerged surface of ice wedge part 2 if the ice element is eroded and the coefficient of friction is set to be 0 2 the mesh in the ice plate contact region is refined and the mesh size far away from the contact region is much sparser as shown in fig 9 the mesh size is typically 5 mm 5 mm for shell elements in central region of plate while the ice model at the front end of the wedge block is meshed with solid elements with 5 mm 5 mm in the numerical simulations for finite element model of steel wedge plate impact the element attributes model building meshing contact and initial conditions loadings and constraints solution time specifying and the executing file outputting in the pre processing period are the same with the numerical ice plate impact model unlike to ice plate impact model a rigid material is defined for steel wedge striker to ensure no deformation as signing steel mechanical properties the material mat 020 rigid used in the numerical model is selected from the ls dyna material library since the steel striker weight assembly is modelled as a simple wedge body an artificially large density is used to give the same mass as it used in the model tests the rigid elements are bypassed in the processing and there is no storage of history variables 4 elastic plastic behavior of ship plate model subjected to ice impact 4 1 experimental and numerical analysis the related numerical simulations referring to table 1 for model test details are conducted and the time history of collision force and deformations of plate are obtained in these numerical simulations fig 10 shows the time histories of deformations of plate under ice steel wedge impact and the comparisons of experimental and numerical results it can be seen from fig 10 that the deformation of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that under steel wedge impact and the impact time by ice wedge is larger than that by steel wedge in the initial stage of impact loading process as ice wedge has not large severe damage the displacements of plates under ice wedge impact and steel wedge impact are very close until the ice are rapidly crushing into fine powder upon contact with the plate the acceleration history was measured from acceleration sensor and the time history of collision force was obtained according to the measured acceleration history in the ice plate impact the lost mass of ice due to its damage is a small amount compared to the total impact mass so the lost mass of ice is not considered and the initial total mass is regarded as the total impact mass during the ice impact process fig 11 illustrates the time histories of collision forces under ice steel wedge impacts are obtained from model tests and numerical simulations it is found that the collision force of ice wedge impact is smaller than that of steel wedge impact the final deformation profiles of plate after ice steel wedge impact obtained from experiments and numerical simulations are presented in figs 12 and 13 the origin of x axis and y axis is established in the central point of plate and the x axis and y axis are along plate length direction and breadth direction relatively it is evident that the final deformations of plate under ice wedge impact are smaller than that under steel wedge impact as shown in fig 12 b and 13 b the plastic collapsing region of plate under ice wedge impact is shorter than that under steel wedge impact the ice crushing regions are mainly concentrated at the contact zone while the most of ice wedge remained intact and had no failure in the impact process at the beginning of ice impact tests the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated at the two sharp corners of the front end of the ice wedge and the maximal stresses and plastic strains of ice wedge firstly appeared at its two corners instead of its center thus the ice wedge firstly failed in its upper and lower corners at the contact region therefore the length of plastic hinge line of plate under ice wedge impact is shorter than that under steel wedge impact which is also reflected in the numerically obtained equivalent plastic strain contours as shown in figs 14 and 15 the distributions of the effective plastic strains of plate under ice steel wedge impact in numerical simulations are illustrated in figs 14 and 15 it can be found that the value of maximum plastic strains of plates under ice wedge impact are smaller than those under steel wedge impact as shown in fig 16 the high pressure zone of ice wedge emphasized as a red zone presented as red dotted line is symmetrical up and down in the impact process the collision forces were mainly transmitted through this high pressure zone fig 17 shows the distributions of maximum von mises stresses of plate under ice steel wedge impact in the numerical simulations the yield line hinges can be seen in fig 17 overall though there are some small differences in the collision time between experimental and numerical results good correlation between numerical and experimental results is obtained in term of the plate deformations and collision forces as above mentioned assuming the ice material is a steel body gives very unrealistic responses from the comparisons of results between the numerical simulations and the impact tests it can be found that the numerical method with the proposed ice material model can accurately and efficiently predict the dynamic responses of plates under ice steel wedge impact during the steel wedge plate impact process the total energy of the collision system includes two parts the kinetic energy of steel wedge and the absorbed energy of plate owing to its plastic deformations which can be expressed as 1 e 0 s e p s e k s where e 0s is the initial impact energy and e 0 s 0 5 m v 0 2 e ps is the absorbed energy of plate in the impact process e ks is the kinetic energy of steel wedge during the impact process in addition when the steel wedge rebounds after impact and the e ks represents the rebounding energy the energy transforming process is presented in fig 18 however in the ice wedge plate impact process the plate will absorb kinetic energy transmitted from ice wedges while the ice damage will also dissipate its own kinetic energy as shown in fig 18 the following formula is used to explain this process 2 e 0 i e i i e p i e k i where e 0i is the initial kinetic energy of the ice wedge e ii is the dissipated energy of ice due to its damage and e pi is the absorbed energy by the plate owing to its plastic deformations e ki represents the kinetic energy of ice wedge in the impact process it can be seen from fig 18 that the kinetic energy of ice wedge in the rebounding process is smaller than that of steel wedge fig 19 demonstrates the time histories of energy absorption of plate under ice steel wedge impact it is evident that the absorbed energy of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that of plate under steel wedge impact the energy absorption of plate with different dimensions under ice wedge impact is not the same the experimental and numerical results are summarized in table 4 4 2 analytical approach to predict the plastic damage extent of ship plate the response of ship plates subjected to rigid striker collision has been estimated based on the rigid plastic method zhu et al 1994 2018b zhu and faulkner 1996 here a similar method is adopted to propose a simplified theoretical approach to study the plastic behaviour of ship plate under ice floe impact fig 20 show a common idealized deformation shape of ship plate subjected to impacting loading by a rigid mass body that strikes at central location along the length and breadth but with the mass body nose parallel to the support of length b which is also illustrated in fig 17 these deformation shape of plate can be used in ice plate collision in the theoretical model the plate is fixed to rigid infinitive mass the general form of dynamic equation for rectangular plates can be simplified to eq 3 if the deformed plate is assumed to be subdivided into a number of rigid regions separated by s straight line hinges jones 2012 3 a p μ w w d a m 1 s l m n w m θ m d l m where μ is mass per unit area of plate μ ρ h h is the plate thickness and ρ is the steel material density of ship plate a is the total area of plate w is the transverse deflection m and n are the membrane force and bending moment which act on a plane which passes through a hinge and is transverse to the mid surface of a plate l m is the length of yield hinge and θ m is the relative angular velocity across a straight line hinge w is the transverse displacement along a line hinge for the uniformly distributed impact loading along the dented patch the impact force and patch pressure are 4 f m 0 w c 5 p f l d where l d is the central hinge line of plate in eq 4 w c is the maximum deformation of plate m 0 is the initial mass of striker therefore the left expression of eq 3 can be written as 6 a p w d a m 0 w c w c the a μ w w d a is the inertia term of dynamic eq 3 which can be expressed as 7 a μ w w d a 1 6 μ l b l d w c w c in the eq 7 the m p e is defined to represent the equivalent mass of ship plate in collision process which can be expressed as 8 m p e 1 6 μ l b l d where l d is the central hinge line of plate l and b are the length and width of ship plate relatively in the rigid plastic analysis method the plate absorbs the incident energy through membrane and bending strain energies the plastic dissipation due to bending is mainly concentrated at the dented line at inclined plastic hinges and at the plate boundaries as shown in fig 20 while the membrane strain energy dissipation is due to the elongation over the plastic zone between the dented line plastic hinges and the plate boundaries if the interaction between the membrane force and bending moment is neglected the circumscribing square yield criterion is employed to simplify the theoretical analysis as presented in fig 21 according to a corollary of the limit theorems the upper and lower bounds on the exact yield condition are provided jones 2012 therefore the expressions for the energy dissipation d due to the membrane tension d t p and hinge rotation d b p are given respectively as 9 d m 1 s l m n w m θ m d l m d t p d b p 10 d t p 2 n p b l d l l b l d w c w c 11 d b p 8 m p b l l b l d w c where m p 1 4 σ y h 2 is the fully plastic bending moment of plate per unit width n p σ y h is the plastic axial force of plate per unit width where σ y is the yield stress of ship plate and h is the plate thickness substituting the eqs 9 11 to eq 3 it can be shown that 12 w c η 2 w c γ where 13 η 2 4 n p ξ 1 m 0 m p e 14 γ 8 m p ξ 2 m 0 m p e in the eqs 13 and 14 ξ 1 and ξ 2 are the functions of the plate dimension parameters which are expressed as 15 ξ 1 b l d l l b l d 16 ξ 2 b l l b l d the solution to eq 12 can be obtained which should satisfy the following initial conditions 17 w c 0 0 18 w c 0 v 0 where v 0 is the initial velocity of contact region of ship plate when it begins to be impacted by the ice floe according to theorem of momentum the v 0 can be obtained 19 v 0 m 0 m 0 m p e v 0 as the ice mass is much larger than the plate mass m 0 m p e v 0 is assumed to be equal to v 0 the deflection velocity and acceleration are 20 w c t v 0 η sin η t γ η 2 1 cos η t 21 w c t v 0 cos η t γ η sin η t 22 w c t v 0 η sin η t γ cos η t the maximum permanent deflection of the plate is 23 w m γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 γ η 2 however in the rigid plastic analysis the elastic strain energy absorbed by the deformed structures is ignored jones 2014 proposed a simplified method to modify the rigid plastic solution to predict the dynamic response of plates under rigid mass impact the initial impact energy available for inelastic flow in the plate struck by a rigid mass can be expressed as m 0 v 0 2 2 e e where e e represents the elastic strain energy in the impact process the elastic strain energy absorbed by the deformed plate is transformed into the kinetic energy of rigid mass during the rebound process e e m 0 v r 2 2 zhu et al 2018a 2018b v r is the rebound velocity of ice floe in the impact process therefore the eq 23 can be rewritten as 24 w m γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 γ η 2 25 f m m 0 γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 based on the eqs 24 and 25 the maximum plastic deformations w m and maximum collision force f m of plate under rigid striker impact can be obtained the steel wedge impact is regarded as rigid wedge impact as the steel striker has no deformations in the impact process for ice wedge impact m 0 is the initial mass of ice and m δ represents the mass of ice during the collision process and is a function of the ice crushing length δ as the ice will have damage which will lead to lose a small part of ice mass in fact the lost mass of ice is a small amount compared to the total ice mass m 0 thus m δ m 0 besides in the ice impact process the ice also will absorb a part of initial kinetic energy due to its damage and the energy absorption of ice e i can be expressed as e i m 0 v i 2 2 which should be removed v i is the lost impact velocity caused by dissipated impact kinetic energy of ice due to its damage therefore the eq 2 can be rewritten as 26 1 2 m 0 v 0 2 1 2 m 0 v 0 2 1 2 m 0 v r 2 1 2 m 0 v i 2 according to eq 26 the v 0 2 can be repressed as 27 v 0 2 v 0 2 v r 2 v i 2 where 1 2 m 0 v 0 2 is regarded as the net initial kinetic energy which is completely transformed into the plastic strain energy of plate the v 0 is the net initial impact velocity therefore considering the influences of energy absorption of ice and the elastic strain energy of plate on the dynamic response of ship plates under ice collision the maximum permanent deformation of plate according to eq 23 can be modified as 28 w m γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 v i 2 γ η 2 for the same reason the maximum collision force is 29 f m m 0 γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 v i 2 the v r v i and l d can be obtained in the numerical simulations and model tests therefore according to eqs 28 and 29 the maximum plastic deformations w m and maximum collision force f m of plate under ice impact can be calculated the strain rate sensitivity effect for the mild steel material should be considered in the dynamic analysis the simplified analysis method for considering the strain rate sensitivity effect was investigated by zhu et al 1994 the influence of material strain rate sensitivity is assumed to obey the cowper symonds equation cowper and symonds 1957 30 n σ d σ y 1 ε d 1 q where n is the strain rate sensitivity factor of plate the σ d and σ y are the dynamic and static yield stresses with d 40 4 s 1 and q 5 for mild steel for the rectangular plate as presented in fig 20 according to the simplified method proposed by perrone and bhadra 1979 the strain rate sensitivity factor of the plate is estimated as 31 n σ d σ y 1 4 2 w m v 0 3 d l b l d 1 q since w m and n are interrelated iteration is required to obtain accurate values of n which are used to recalculate the coefficients defined in eqs 13 and 14 based on the ice wedge plate impact model presented in numerical simulations and model tests the semi analytical results of the maximal plastic deformations and collision force can be calculated according to eqs 28 and 29 as shown in table 5 it can be seen from table 5 that for the steel wedge plate impact the analytical results in maximum plastic deformation using the theoretical upper bound are compared well with experimental and numerical results however for the ice wedge plate impact the analytical results in maximum plastic deformation using the theoretical lower bound are compared well with experimental and numerical results 5 discussions based on the finite element models presented in fig 9 a series of numerical simulations are carried out to study the differences of ice plate impact and rigid striker plate impact in plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate the 18 groups of cases are numerically calculated with different ice masses m 0 and initial impact velocities v 0 as summarized in table 6 in these numerical calculations the initial impact velocity ranges from 1 m s to 4 m s and the initial impact mass ranges from 63 7 kg to 103 7 kg fig 22 shows the non dimensional maximum plastic deformation of plate versus initial impact kinetic energy the non dimensional maximum plastic deformation w p h is defined as the ratio of the deformation w p and thickness h of plate it is seen from fig 22 that with the increase of initial kinetic energy the non dimensional maximum plastic deformations of plates under ice wedge and steel wedge impact are both increasing it is evident that the w p h of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that under steel wedge impact when the plate dimensions are l b t 400 400 2 mm however when l b t 800 800 2 mm the w p h of plate under ice wedge impact is just a littler smaller than that under steel wedge impact because in these cases the plate impacted by steel wedge impact can store more elastic energy in the impact process the rebounding kinetic energy of steel wedge is larger than that of ice wedge in addition the deformation mode differences of plates with different dimensions will affect the value of plastic deformation fig 23 illustrates the energy ratios versus initial impact kinetic energy including the ratio of the absorbed energy of plate and initial impact kinetic energy e ps e 0 e pi e 0 and the ratio of the dissipated energy of ice wedge and initial impact kinetic energy e ii e 0 it indicates that with the increase of initial kinetic energy the ratios between the absorbed energy of plate under ice steel wedge impact and the initial kinetic energy are both increasing while the ratios between the dissipated energy of ice wedge and the initial kinetic energy are gradually decreasing besides obviously the ratio of the absorbed energy of plate under ice wedge impact and the initial kinetic energy is far smaller than that of plate under steel wedge impact in the ice wedge plate impact process the dissipated energy of ice wedge due to its deformations and damages accounts for a part of the total impact energy which cause the reduction of the plate absorbed energy in order to investigate the differences of the absorbed energy of plate under ice steel wedge impact and the influences of the dissipated energy of ice wedge due to ice crushing the energy absorption reduction factor earf of plate is defined as 32 e a d f e p i e p s in this equation e ps represents the final total absorbed energy of plate after the steel wedge impact and e pi represents the final total absorbed energy of plate after ice wedge impact the numerical results of eapf are summarized in table 7 it can be noted that for the specific ice steel wedge plate impact models the earf of plate with dimensions l b t 400 400 2 mm is found to lie between 0 2 and 0 3 and the earf of plate with dimensions l b t 800 400 2 mm is about within the range from 0 45 to 0 6 the value of earf of plate is related to the plate dimensions the earf can be used to establish a correlation between ice wedge impact and steel wedge impact to estimate the damage degree of plate under ice impact further for plastic design criteria the design parameters obtained by the rigid wedge impact model analysis may be multiplied by a reduction coefficient taking account of the crushing property of ice to obtain the design parameters in the ice impact analysis 6 concluding remarks this paper investigates the elastic plastic responses of plates under ice impact by model tests and numerical simulations based on ice plate impact scenario an ice material model based on a soil and concrete material model mat 78 is used in ls dyna program to simulate the ice mechanical behaviour in this paper the ice model is simulated by the proposed ice material model and the idealized rigid material model in the finite element program in addition the laboratory tests were carried out to study the nonlinear behaviours of plates under ice wedge and steel rigid wedge impact the plastic deformations of plates and collision forces were obtained in the tests which are used for validating the accuracy of numerical methods the comparisons of elastic plastic responses of plate under these two types strikers are conducted by model tests and numerical simulations moreover based on above impact models a series of numerical simulations are presented to investigate the differences of ice plate impact and rigid wedge plate impact the plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate energy dissipation due to ice damage are studied from the studies in this article the following concluding remarks can be drawn the dynamic responses of steel plates impacted by an ice wedge and a steel rigid wedge are investigated both experimentally and numerically during the impact process the deformations of plate collision force as well as the evolutions of ice damage and plastic zone of plate are studied the predicted results based on numerical simulations compares well with experiment results the comparisons between ice wedge plate impact and steel wedge plate impact show that assuming the ice material is a rigid material which gives unrealistic and inaccurate predicted responses besides the obtained deformations and absorbed energies of plates collision forces based on the ice wedge plate impact model are smaller than those based on the steel wedge plate impact model based on the rigid plastic theoretical method the simplified analytical solutions are performed to predict the plastic damage of plate under ice steel wedge impact good correlation is obtained between the experimental numerical and analytical results it is noted from a series of numerical simulations that with the increase of initial impact kinetic energy the maximum non dimensional plastic deformations and the ratio between the absorbed energy of plate under ice steel wedge impact and initial impact kinetic energy are gradually increasing meanwhile the ratio between the dissipated energy of ice wedge and initial impact kinetic energy may have a negative correlation with impact kinetic energy besides the absorbed energy of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that of plate under steel wedge impact the energy absorption reduction factor is defined to evaluate the damage degree of plate under ice impact compared to steel striker impact which provide some useful information for the design of ship plate under ice impact the plate specimens and ice floe models used in the presented model tests and numerical simulations were scaled and small considering aspect ratio and plate thickness used in normal polar ship design the scale effect between real ship structure and model test specimen will be

21311,due to ice floe impacts or iceberg collisions the side structures of ships and offshore platforms operating in arctic region may experience permanent deformations which may have significant influences on their structural safety and working performance to provide insight into the plastic deformations of plates this paper investigates the nonlinear elastic plastic responses of plates impacted by an ice wedge striker and an idealized rigid striker by both experimental and numerical methods the ice material model based on a soil and concrete material model is used in ansys ls dyna program to simulate the ice mechanical behaviour in an ice plate impact scenario good correlation is obtained between the experimental numerical and analytical results for plastic deformations of plate and collision forces the comparisons of elastic plastic responses of plate under these two strikers are conducted by both model tests and numerical simulations besides a series of numerical calculations are carried out to study the differences of ice plate impact and rigid striker plate impact the plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate energy dissipation of ice damage are investigated moreover for these specific cases studied an energy absorption reduction factor earf of plate under ice impact compared to rigid striker impact is proposed to estimate the structural damage which provide some useful information for the design of ship plate against ice impact keywords ship plates permanent deformations ice impact model tests energy absorption reduction factor 1 introduction arctic region has abundant oil and gas resources and acts as a lifeline for many communities with the increasing exploitation of the arctic channel more voyages across the arctic waters will be possible in the future due to the global warming and declined extent of sea ice however the increased ship traffic and resources exploitation activities in these waters may increase the probability of impacts between ice floes icebergs and ships and offshore structures which necessitates the safety assessment of these events thus the assessment of the dynamic structural behaviour of ship plates subjected to ice impacts is of paramount importance to improving the safety of ships and offshore structures operating in arctic region the structural design against ice impact has been commonly carried out using the limit state design approaches such as the ultimate limit state uls and accidental limit state als in this regard the loads from rare iceberg or huge ice floe impacts can be described as an abnormal level ice event alie as seen in international organization for standardization iso standards iso cd 19906 2010 which is in accordance with the accidental limit state als in the current standard codes for ship and offshore structures in als design method the annual probability of occurrence is typically 10 4 and the allowable structural damage due to ice impact loading can be determined based upon the fact that is the structure has enough residual strength to prevent progressive collapse and that the safety of the crew and environment can be maintained amdahl 2019 based on the als method there are three design strategies for ship structures namely the ductility design shared energy design and strength design as shown in fig 1 the shared energy design method is widely used in the design of general ice strengthened ships and by this method the plastic deformations are inevitable in ship operations this method implies that both the ship structure and the ice dissipate energies by undergoing significant deformations or damage the whole collision energy is shared by both colliding bodies as indicated in fig 2 for this design method the degree of structural deformation or damage depends on their relative strength when the ice is stiff enough or even can be assumed as an idealized rigid body the impact energies are mainly dissipated by the ship structures which corresponds to the ductile design method therefore it is of great significant to study the plastic deformation and energy absorption mechanisms arising from the impacts between the ship plates and ice floes or icebergs in recent years many studies have been dedicated to investigating the dynamic structural behaviour of ship structures impacted by ice floes or icebergs using both the experimental and numerical methods gagnon and derradji aouat 2006 and gagnon 2008 conducted full scale collision tests between ccgs terry fox icebreaker and a bergy bit gagnon 2007 and gagnon and wang 2012 also carried out scaled model collision tests between structures and ice body from which the test results agree well with the numerical results ritch et al 2008 also conducted small iceberg collision test for terry fox icebreaker and measured the local collision forces applied on the ship structure in the impact process kim et al 2017 carried out laboratory experiments for freshwater ice blocks impacting with a floating stiffened steel structure to study the shared energy absorbing mechanism in the ice structure impact process and the permanent deformations of this steel structure together with ice damage were investigated in the tests the aforementioned full scale tests and model tests can provide valuable results to validate the accuracy of numerical simulations numerical method is widely used to predict the ice impact loads and structural damage by mainly using the nonlinear finite element method nfem zhu et al 2016 and zhu et al 2018a used the isotropic elastic failure model to study the dynamic behaviour of ship plates under ice floe impacts gagnon 2011 and kim et al 2015 used a crushable foam material model to simulate the ice behaviour in the ice structure interaction problems liu et al 2011a and liu et al 2011b used a user defined elastic plastic material model to simulate the ice behaviour in the ship iceberg collision problems in their studies the yield criterion of the ice material is based on the tsai wu yield surface presented by derradji aouat 2000 they also proposed an empirical failure criterion based on the effective plastic strain and hydrostatic pressure gao et al 2015 improved the ice failure criterion proposed by liu et al 2011a to model the ice failure behaviour considered the temperature effect on ice mechanical properties shi et al 2017 proposed a temperature gradient dependent elastic plastic ice material model to study the influence of temperature on the collision forces obtained from the ship iceberg collisions polach and ehlers 2013 and polach et al 2013 applied the lemaitre damage model to model the ice failure behaviours and the numerical results were found to agree well with the related experimental results based on the kosori ice model ince et al 2017a and ince et al 2017b used a modified johnson cook material model to simulate the ice behaviours in the ice structure impact scenario ice has many pores internal flaws and initial cracks which is a complex natural composite material the ice failure behaviours are difficult to simulate by a numerical material model due to its strong brittle characteristics in the collision process considered the similarity between concrete constitutive relations and ice constitutive relations to some extent a similar soil and concrete constitutive ice model was proposed by cai et al 2020 to simulate the ice material behaviour in ice impact process based on this ice model the elasto plastic behaviours of plates under ice impact are studied both experimentally and numerically in this paper the laboratory experiments for scaled plates impacted by ice wedge and rigid wedge were conducted using the self designed horizontal impact machine the numerical results by using ansys ls dyna software are validated by the experimental results the study presented in this paper is motivated to provide more information about the comparisons of ship structure under ice impact and rigid body impact the aim of this paper is to investigate the differences between the ice plate impact and the rigid striker plate impact and to study the influences of energy dissipation of ice on the permanent deformations and energy absorption of the struck plates 2 experiment set up a series of model tests were carried out to study the elastic plastic behaviour of steel plates subjected to ice steel wedge impacts table 1 summarizes the initial impact mass initial impact velocity and initial impact energy of model tests the plate specimens used in the tests were cut from mild steel sheets with thickness h 2 mm and the size of the plate specimens were 560 560 mm and 960 560 mm as shown in fig 3 the impact model tests were conducted using a horizontal impact facility in the wut ifsi lab as shown in fig 4 the ice steel striking wedge travels along horizontal rails and hits the fully clamped specimen at its center the plate specimen is mounted onto a strong base via the square clamps with thickness 40 mm and 80 mm equally spaced bolts to achieve a fully clamped connection between the specimen and base 2 1 ice wedge impact tests in the ice plate impact experiments the ice floes are simplified as an ice wedge as shown in fig 5 it is a key challenge to produce ice wedges in a laboratory condition the ice wedge was prepared in a very particular way to homogenize the crystalline structure the ice model was made by freezing the mixture of water and crushed ice at 25 c temperature the size of crushed ice was approximately 5 mm the frozen temperature frozen time and ice frozen process were strictly controlled to be the same to ensure the same mechanical properties of ice wedge the geometrical dimensions of ice models produced in laboratory for the model tests are shown in fig 5 in the experimental process the ice wedge will be mounted within the wheel trolley as shown in fig 6 the wheel trolley carrying the ice wedge will slide down along the rails of the horizontal impact machine which can obtain an initial impact velocity determined by its start position on the curved rails fig 6 shows the experimental set up and the relevant measuring devices the struck plate specimens are clamped by 80 mm long equally spaced m8 bolts between two steel clamps the impact position is placed at the middle of the plate specimen as seen in fig 6 the high speed camera acceleration sensor and laser displacement sensor are used to measure the velocity histories of ice wedge the acceleration histories of ice wedge and the displacement histories of the central point of plate specimen relatively the m p data acquisition system and tmr data acquisition system are used to output the signal data 2 2 steel wedge impact tests the steel wedge striker plate impact test is similar to the ice plate impact test the time histories of collision accelerations and plate deformations are recorded by the measuring instruments the v shape vertical steel wedge striker is attached to the front of the wheel trolley as shown in fig 7 the striker is relatively sharp with a small radius at the rip and the vertical length of the striker is 200 mm it was fabricated using the high strength steel which has no deformations in the impact tests 3 numerical model 3 1 ice model in the ice impact process the ice failure behaviour mainly shows brittle characteristics to some extent the ice material behaves in a similar way like the concrete since the failure behaviour of the concrete material also shows brittle characteristics under compression therefore in this study a similar soil and concrete constitutive ice model is used to model the ice material properties specifically the material type mat soil concrete is selected from the ansys ls dyna material model library to simulate the ice model this constitutive model permits ice to be efficiently modelled in addition it is easy for material models to input characteristic parameters of materials besides the maximum equivalent stress failure criteria are added to the ice model properties by using the material type of mat add erosion this ice numerical model was introduced by cai et al 2020 and the detailed ice material parameter definitions can be found in this reference this ice model is an isotropic elastic plastic pressure dependent damage model the main material properties and failure criteria applied in the ice numerical model are summarized in table 2 3 2 plate model the dimensions of plate model are shown in fig 3 the standard in house quasi static tensile tests were conducted to obtain the mechanical properties of plate specimen the tensile specimens were machined according to the national standard gb t 2002 the engineering and true stress strain curves of plate material are presented in fig 8 and the mechanical properties of the plate model are summarized in table 3 the material of plate specimen is modelled by the material model mat 024 mat piecewise linear plasticiyt selected from ansys ls dyna in this material model mat 024 the true stress strain curve fig 8 can be applied and the strain rate sensitivity effect is considered as the cowper symonds constitutive equation is adopted since the actual dynamic material tests are not conducted to determine the material constants the values of d 40 4 s and q 5 are obtained from uniaxial tests by cowper and symonds 1957 3 3 fe model set up the commercial package ansys ls dyna is employed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of plate subjected to ice steel wedge impact according to the ice plate impact model tests the finite element models of ice plate impact are designed with three components plate specimen part 1 ice wedge part 2 and added mass part 3 as shown in fig 9 the added mass part 3 is used to replace the wheel trolley and other steel mass in tests the steel plate is modelled by four node shell elements with five integration points throughout the thickness with defining the hughes liu shell element formulation the ice wedge part 2 and added mass part 3 are modelled by solid 164 elements the ice material model part 2 is introduced in section 3 1 the material model of plate specimen part 1 is introduced in section 3 2 the material model of added mass part 3 uses the material type mat plastic kinematic selected from the library of ls dyna and in this material model the density is 7850 kg m3 the young s modulus is 206 gpa the poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the tangent modulus is 206 mpa the option contact eroding surface to surface is applied to define contact between plate specimen part 1 and the newly emerged surface of ice wedge part 2 if the ice element is eroded and the coefficient of friction is set to be 0 2 the mesh in the ice plate contact region is refined and the mesh size far away from the contact region is much sparser as shown in fig 9 the mesh size is typically 5 mm 5 mm for shell elements in central region of plate while the ice model at the front end of the wedge block is meshed with solid elements with 5 mm 5 mm in the numerical simulations for finite element model of steel wedge plate impact the element attributes model building meshing contact and initial conditions loadings and constraints solution time specifying and the executing file outputting in the pre processing period are the same with the numerical ice plate impact model unlike to ice plate impact model a rigid material is defined for steel wedge striker to ensure no deformation as signing steel mechanical properties the material mat 020 rigid used in the numerical model is selected from the ls dyna material library since the steel striker weight assembly is modelled as a simple wedge body an artificially large density is used to give the same mass as it used in the model tests the rigid elements are bypassed in the processing and there is no storage of history variables 4 elastic plastic behavior of ship plate model subjected to ice impact 4 1 experimental and numerical analysis the related numerical simulations referring to table 1 for model test details are conducted and the time history of collision force and deformations of plate are obtained in these numerical simulations fig 10 shows the time histories of deformations of plate under ice steel wedge impact and the comparisons of experimental and numerical results it can be seen from fig 10 that the deformation of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that under steel wedge impact and the impact time by ice wedge is larger than that by steel wedge in the initial stage of impact loading process as ice wedge has not large severe damage the displacements of plates under ice wedge impact and steel wedge impact are very close until the ice are rapidly crushing into fine powder upon contact with the plate the acceleration history was measured from acceleration sensor and the time history of collision force was obtained according to the measured acceleration history in the ice plate impact the lost mass of ice due to its damage is a small amount compared to the total impact mass so the lost mass of ice is not considered and the initial total mass is regarded as the total impact mass during the ice impact process fig 11 illustrates the time histories of collision forces under ice steel wedge impacts are obtained from model tests and numerical simulations it is found that the collision force of ice wedge impact is smaller than that of steel wedge impact the final deformation profiles of plate after ice steel wedge impact obtained from experiments and numerical simulations are presented in figs 12 and 13 the origin of x axis and y axis is established in the central point of plate and the x axis and y axis are along plate length direction and breadth direction relatively it is evident that the final deformations of plate under ice wedge impact are smaller than that under steel wedge impact as shown in fig 12 b and 13 b the plastic collapsing region of plate under ice wedge impact is shorter than that under steel wedge impact the ice crushing regions are mainly concentrated at the contact zone while the most of ice wedge remained intact and had no failure in the impact process at the beginning of ice impact tests the maximum stresses are mainly concentrated at the two sharp corners of the front end of the ice wedge and the maximal stresses and plastic strains of ice wedge firstly appeared at its two corners instead of its center thus the ice wedge firstly failed in its upper and lower corners at the contact region therefore the length of plastic hinge line of plate under ice wedge impact is shorter than that under steel wedge impact which is also reflected in the numerically obtained equivalent plastic strain contours as shown in figs 14 and 15 the distributions of the effective plastic strains of plate under ice steel wedge impact in numerical simulations are illustrated in figs 14 and 15 it can be found that the value of maximum plastic strains of plates under ice wedge impact are smaller than those under steel wedge impact as shown in fig 16 the high pressure zone of ice wedge emphasized as a red zone presented as red dotted line is symmetrical up and down in the impact process the collision forces were mainly transmitted through this high pressure zone fig 17 shows the distributions of maximum von mises stresses of plate under ice steel wedge impact in the numerical simulations the yield line hinges can be seen in fig 17 overall though there are some small differences in the collision time between experimental and numerical results good correlation between numerical and experimental results is obtained in term of the plate deformations and collision forces as above mentioned assuming the ice material is a steel body gives very unrealistic responses from the comparisons of results between the numerical simulations and the impact tests it can be found that the numerical method with the proposed ice material model can accurately and efficiently predict the dynamic responses of plates under ice steel wedge impact during the steel wedge plate impact process the total energy of the collision system includes two parts the kinetic energy of steel wedge and the absorbed energy of plate owing to its plastic deformations which can be expressed as 1 e 0 s e p s e k s where e 0s is the initial impact energy and e 0 s 0 5 m v 0 2 e ps is the absorbed energy of plate in the impact process e ks is the kinetic energy of steel wedge during the impact process in addition when the steel wedge rebounds after impact and the e ks represents the rebounding energy the energy transforming process is presented in fig 18 however in the ice wedge plate impact process the plate will absorb kinetic energy transmitted from ice wedges while the ice damage will also dissipate its own kinetic energy as shown in fig 18 the following formula is used to explain this process 2 e 0 i e i i e p i e k i where e 0i is the initial kinetic energy of the ice wedge e ii is the dissipated energy of ice due to its damage and e pi is the absorbed energy by the plate owing to its plastic deformations e ki represents the kinetic energy of ice wedge in the impact process it can be seen from fig 18 that the kinetic energy of ice wedge in the rebounding process is smaller than that of steel wedge fig 19 demonstrates the time histories of energy absorption of plate under ice steel wedge impact it is evident that the absorbed energy of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that of plate under steel wedge impact the energy absorption of plate with different dimensions under ice wedge impact is not the same the experimental and numerical results are summarized in table 4 4 2 analytical approach to predict the plastic damage extent of ship plate the response of ship plates subjected to rigid striker collision has been estimated based on the rigid plastic method zhu et al 1994 2018b zhu and faulkner 1996 here a similar method is adopted to propose a simplified theoretical approach to study the plastic behaviour of ship plate under ice floe impact fig 20 show a common idealized deformation shape of ship plate subjected to impacting loading by a rigid mass body that strikes at central location along the length and breadth but with the mass body nose parallel to the support of length b which is also illustrated in fig 17 these deformation shape of plate can be used in ice plate collision in the theoretical model the plate is fixed to rigid infinitive mass the general form of dynamic equation for rectangular plates can be simplified to eq 3 if the deformed plate is assumed to be subdivided into a number of rigid regions separated by s straight line hinges jones 2012 3 a p μ w w d a m 1 s l m n w m θ m d l m where μ is mass per unit area of plate μ ρ h h is the plate thickness and ρ is the steel material density of ship plate a is the total area of plate w is the transverse deflection m and n are the membrane force and bending moment which act on a plane which passes through a hinge and is transverse to the mid surface of a plate l m is the length of yield hinge and θ m is the relative angular velocity across a straight line hinge w is the transverse displacement along a line hinge for the uniformly distributed impact loading along the dented patch the impact force and patch pressure are 4 f m 0 w c 5 p f l d where l d is the central hinge line of plate in eq 4 w c is the maximum deformation of plate m 0 is the initial mass of striker therefore the left expression of eq 3 can be written as 6 a p w d a m 0 w c w c the a μ w w d a is the inertia term of dynamic eq 3 which can be expressed as 7 a μ w w d a 1 6 μ l b l d w c w c in the eq 7 the m p e is defined to represent the equivalent mass of ship plate in collision process which can be expressed as 8 m p e 1 6 μ l b l d where l d is the central hinge line of plate l and b are the length and width of ship plate relatively in the rigid plastic analysis method the plate absorbs the incident energy through membrane and bending strain energies the plastic dissipation due to bending is mainly concentrated at the dented line at inclined plastic hinges and at the plate boundaries as shown in fig 20 while the membrane strain energy dissipation is due to the elongation over the plastic zone between the dented line plastic hinges and the plate boundaries if the interaction between the membrane force and bending moment is neglected the circumscribing square yield criterion is employed to simplify the theoretical analysis as presented in fig 21 according to a corollary of the limit theorems the upper and lower bounds on the exact yield condition are provided jones 2012 therefore the expressions for the energy dissipation d due to the membrane tension d t p and hinge rotation d b p are given respectively as 9 d m 1 s l m n w m θ m d l m d t p d b p 10 d t p 2 n p b l d l l b l d w c w c 11 d b p 8 m p b l l b l d w c where m p 1 4 σ y h 2 is the fully plastic bending moment of plate per unit width n p σ y h is the plastic axial force of plate per unit width where σ y is the yield stress of ship plate and h is the plate thickness substituting the eqs 9 11 to eq 3 it can be shown that 12 w c η 2 w c γ where 13 η 2 4 n p ξ 1 m 0 m p e 14 γ 8 m p ξ 2 m 0 m p e in the eqs 13 and 14 ξ 1 and ξ 2 are the functions of the plate dimension parameters which are expressed as 15 ξ 1 b l d l l b l d 16 ξ 2 b l l b l d the solution to eq 12 can be obtained which should satisfy the following initial conditions 17 w c 0 0 18 w c 0 v 0 where v 0 is the initial velocity of contact region of ship plate when it begins to be impacted by the ice floe according to theorem of momentum the v 0 can be obtained 19 v 0 m 0 m 0 m p e v 0 as the ice mass is much larger than the plate mass m 0 m p e v 0 is assumed to be equal to v 0 the deflection velocity and acceleration are 20 w c t v 0 η sin η t γ η 2 1 cos η t 21 w c t v 0 cos η t γ η sin η t 22 w c t v 0 η sin η t γ cos η t the maximum permanent deflection of the plate is 23 w m γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 γ η 2 however in the rigid plastic analysis the elastic strain energy absorbed by the deformed structures is ignored jones 2014 proposed a simplified method to modify the rigid plastic solution to predict the dynamic response of plates under rigid mass impact the initial impact energy available for inelastic flow in the plate struck by a rigid mass can be expressed as m 0 v 0 2 2 e e where e e represents the elastic strain energy in the impact process the elastic strain energy absorbed by the deformed plate is transformed into the kinetic energy of rigid mass during the rebound process e e m 0 v r 2 2 zhu et al 2018a 2018b v r is the rebound velocity of ice floe in the impact process therefore the eq 23 can be rewritten as 24 w m γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 γ η 2 25 f m m 0 γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 based on the eqs 24 and 25 the maximum plastic deformations w m and maximum collision force f m of plate under rigid striker impact can be obtained the steel wedge impact is regarded as rigid wedge impact as the steel striker has no deformations in the impact process for ice wedge impact m 0 is the initial mass of ice and m δ represents the mass of ice during the collision process and is a function of the ice crushing length δ as the ice will have damage which will lead to lose a small part of ice mass in fact the lost mass of ice is a small amount compared to the total ice mass m 0 thus m δ m 0 besides in the ice impact process the ice also will absorb a part of initial kinetic energy due to its damage and the energy absorption of ice e i can be expressed as e i m 0 v i 2 2 which should be removed v i is the lost impact velocity caused by dissipated impact kinetic energy of ice due to its damage therefore the eq 2 can be rewritten as 26 1 2 m 0 v 0 2 1 2 m 0 v 0 2 1 2 m 0 v r 2 1 2 m 0 v i 2 according to eq 26 the v 0 2 can be repressed as 27 v 0 2 v 0 2 v r 2 v i 2 where 1 2 m 0 v 0 2 is regarded as the net initial kinetic energy which is completely transformed into the plastic strain energy of plate the v 0 is the net initial impact velocity therefore considering the influences of energy absorption of ice and the elastic strain energy of plate on the dynamic response of ship plates under ice collision the maximum permanent deformation of plate according to eq 23 can be modified as 28 w m γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 v i 2 γ η 2 for the same reason the maximum collision force is 29 f m m 0 γ 2 η 2 v 0 2 v r 2 v i 2 the v r v i and l d can be obtained in the numerical simulations and model tests therefore according to eqs 28 and 29 the maximum plastic deformations w m and maximum collision force f m of plate under ice impact can be calculated the strain rate sensitivity effect for the mild steel material should be considered in the dynamic analysis the simplified analysis method for considering the strain rate sensitivity effect was investigated by zhu et al 1994 the influence of material strain rate sensitivity is assumed to obey the cowper symonds equation cowper and symonds 1957 30 n σ d σ y 1 ε d 1 q where n is the strain rate sensitivity factor of plate the σ d and σ y are the dynamic and static yield stresses with d 40 4 s 1 and q 5 for mild steel for the rectangular plate as presented in fig 20 according to the simplified method proposed by perrone and bhadra 1979 the strain rate sensitivity factor of the plate is estimated as 31 n σ d σ y 1 4 2 w m v 0 3 d l b l d 1 q since w m and n are interrelated iteration is required to obtain accurate values of n which are used to recalculate the coefficients defined in eqs 13 and 14 based on the ice wedge plate impact model presented in numerical simulations and model tests the semi analytical results of the maximal plastic deformations and collision force can be calculated according to eqs 28 and 29 as shown in table 5 it can be seen from table 5 that for the steel wedge plate impact the analytical results in maximum plastic deformation using the theoretical upper bound are compared well with experimental and numerical results however for the ice wedge plate impact the analytical results in maximum plastic deformation using the theoretical lower bound are compared well with experimental and numerical results 5 discussions based on the finite element models presented in fig 9 a series of numerical simulations are carried out to study the differences of ice plate impact and rigid striker plate impact in plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate the 18 groups of cases are numerically calculated with different ice masses m 0 and initial impact velocities v 0 as summarized in table 6 in these numerical calculations the initial impact velocity ranges from 1 m s to 4 m s and the initial impact mass ranges from 63 7 kg to 103 7 kg fig 22 shows the non dimensional maximum plastic deformation of plate versus initial impact kinetic energy the non dimensional maximum plastic deformation w p h is defined as the ratio of the deformation w p and thickness h of plate it is seen from fig 22 that with the increase of initial kinetic energy the non dimensional maximum plastic deformations of plates under ice wedge and steel wedge impact are both increasing it is evident that the w p h of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that under steel wedge impact when the plate dimensions are l b t 400 400 2 mm however when l b t 800 800 2 mm the w p h of plate under ice wedge impact is just a littler smaller than that under steel wedge impact because in these cases the plate impacted by steel wedge impact can store more elastic energy in the impact process the rebounding kinetic energy of steel wedge is larger than that of ice wedge in addition the deformation mode differences of plates with different dimensions will affect the value of plastic deformation fig 23 illustrates the energy ratios versus initial impact kinetic energy including the ratio of the absorbed energy of plate and initial impact kinetic energy e ps e 0 e pi e 0 and the ratio of the dissipated energy of ice wedge and initial impact kinetic energy e ii e 0 it indicates that with the increase of initial kinetic energy the ratios between the absorbed energy of plate under ice steel wedge impact and the initial kinetic energy are both increasing while the ratios between the dissipated energy of ice wedge and the initial kinetic energy are gradually decreasing besides obviously the ratio of the absorbed energy of plate under ice wedge impact and the initial kinetic energy is far smaller than that of plate under steel wedge impact in the ice wedge plate impact process the dissipated energy of ice wedge due to its deformations and damages accounts for a part of the total impact energy which cause the reduction of the plate absorbed energy in order to investigate the differences of the absorbed energy of plate under ice steel wedge impact and the influences of the dissipated energy of ice wedge due to ice crushing the energy absorption reduction factor earf of plate is defined as 32 e a d f e p i e p s in this equation e ps represents the final total absorbed energy of plate after the steel wedge impact and e pi represents the final total absorbed energy of plate after ice wedge impact the numerical results of eapf are summarized in table 7 it can be noted that for the specific ice steel wedge plate impact models the earf of plate with dimensions l b t 400 400 2 mm is found to lie between 0 2 and 0 3 and the earf of plate with dimensions l b t 800 400 2 mm is about within the range from 0 45 to 0 6 the value of earf of plate is related to the plate dimensions the earf can be used to establish a correlation between ice wedge impact and steel wedge impact to estimate the damage degree of plate under ice impact further for plastic design criteria the design parameters obtained by the rigid wedge impact model analysis may be multiplied by a reduction coefficient taking account of the crushing property of ice to obtain the design parameters in the ice impact analysis 6 concluding remarks this paper investigates the elastic plastic responses of plates under ice impact by model tests and numerical simulations based on ice plate impact scenario an ice material model based on a soil and concrete material model mat 78 is used in ls dyna program to simulate the ice mechanical behaviour in this paper the ice model is simulated by the proposed ice material model and the idealized rigid material model in the finite element program in addition the laboratory tests were carried out to study the nonlinear behaviours of plates under ice wedge and steel rigid wedge impact the plastic deformations of plates and collision forces were obtained in the tests which are used for validating the accuracy of numerical methods the comparisons of elastic plastic responses of plate under these two types strikers are conducted by model tests and numerical simulations moreover based on above impact models a series of numerical simulations are presented to investigate the differences of ice plate impact and rigid wedge plate impact the plastic deformations and energy absorption of plate energy dissipation due to ice damage are studied from the studies in this article the following concluding remarks can be drawn the dynamic responses of steel plates impacted by an ice wedge and a steel rigid wedge are investigated both experimentally and numerically during the impact process the deformations of plate collision force as well as the evolutions of ice damage and plastic zone of plate are studied the predicted results based on numerical simulations compares well with experiment results the comparisons between ice wedge plate impact and steel wedge plate impact show that assuming the ice material is a rigid material which gives unrealistic and inaccurate predicted responses besides the obtained deformations and absorbed energies of plates collision forces based on the ice wedge plate impact model are smaller than those based on the steel wedge plate impact model based on the rigid plastic theoretical method the simplified analytical solutions are performed to predict the plastic damage of plate under ice steel wedge impact good correlation is obtained between the experimental numerical and analytical results it is noted from a series of numerical simulations that with the increase of initial impact kinetic energy the maximum non dimensional plastic deformations and the ratio between the absorbed energy of plate under ice steel wedge impact and initial impact kinetic energy are gradually increasing meanwhile the ratio between the dissipated energy of ice wedge and initial impact kinetic energy may have a negative correlation with impact kinetic energy besides the absorbed energy of plate under ice wedge impact is smaller than that of plate under steel wedge impact the energy absorption reduction factor is defined to evaluate the damage degree of plate under ice impact compared to steel striker impact which provide some useful information for the design of ship plate under ice impact the plate specimens and ice floe models used in the presented model tests and numerical simulations were scaled and small considering aspect ratio and plate thickness used in normal polar ship design the scale effect between real ship structure and model test specimen will be

21312,tidal energy turbines are significantly impacted by surface gravity waves and high turbulence levels which lead to increased blade loads and consequent device fatigue accurately describing turbulence quantities is a key factor to improve numerical models and ensure the minimum necessary device longevity the application of an appropriate wave turbulence decomposition technique substantially improves estimates and must be debated by the tidal energy community this work analyses two wave turbulence decomposition techniques i linear wave theory and ii synchrosqueezing wavelet transform swt based on physical modelling the experiments were conducted in a towing tank and the physical model used froude scaling to simulate wave heights and frequencies based on field measurements from a tidal energy candidate site in australia turbulence was generated using a grid with 47 mm openings replicating turbulence intensities of 17 23 and 25 both decomposition techniques present limitations in wave frequencies above 0 7 hz our results suggest that the swt technique is more versatile and more efficient under various conditions restrictions to the linear wave theory method are discussed with regards to adcp geometry and possible non linearity the variability obtained from the wave turbulence decomposition techniques emphasizes the importance of establishing

characterized by high levels of turbulence and large waves copping et al 2014 harrold and ouro 2019 these features are known for posing a considerable challenge for tidal turbine developers to ensure long term device integrity unsteady flow conditions increase power and thrust coefficients fluctuations which intensify turbine blade loading and can lead to device fatigue milne et al 2016 scarlett and viola 2020 minimising device maintenance is an essential step in making tidal energy more economically feasible and a competitive renewable energy source currently most turbine models rely on artificial turbulence as a consequence of a lack of accurate field measurements a significant contribution is to properly characterize turbulence parameters at prospective sites numerous studies have focused on characterizing wave climates and wave current interaction in such locations hashemi et al 2015 lewis et al 2014 venugopal et al 2018 and similar effort has been put into estimating turbulence parameters in potential tidal energy sites bouferrouk et al 2016 greenwood et al 2019 gunawan et al 2014 hay et al 2013 mccaffrey et al 2015 the characterization of turbulence parameters is based on statistical features of velocity fluctuations as turbulence is known for being statistically stable over short enough periods of time the reynolds decomposition separates the velocity signal into mean and fluctuating components in the presence of interaction with long surface gravity waves the velocity fluctuations can be biased by wave orbital motions in order to avoid overestimation of turbulence parameters and therefore of manufacturing and maintenance costs orbital velocities and turbulent fluctuations must be decomposed the significance of estimating turbulence parameters for tidal turbines has been highlighted in the literature but little has been done in relation to wave turbulence interaction and decomposition in prospective tidal energy sites as a consequence the international electrotechnical commission iec 2015 and the european marine energy centre emec 2009 guidelines for tidal energy site assessments do not present standards for performing turbulence characterization or wave turbulence decomposition in tidal energy sites traditionally turbulence is measured in the field with acoustic doppler velocimeters advs despite the ability to resolve fine scale turbulence with high sampling rates of up to 200 hz the sampling volume of advs is limited to the order of centimetres in addition field deployments at tidal energy sites with strong currents is often challenging guerra and thomson 2017 thomson et al 2013 acoustic doppler current profilers adcps offer an alternative with larger sampling volumes and the ability of profiling throughout the water column estimation of turbulence parameters from these instruments assumes the velocity field is horizontally homogeneous and relies on the variance of beam velocities stacey et al 1999 replicating the turbulent conditions found in tidal energy sites where these instruments are deployed is a challenge which is further increased by the addition of surface waves due to challenges of obtaining sufficient field measurements studies often rely on grids to disturb the flow and to create turbulence in a controlled environment e g in a wave tank or towing tank grid generated turbulence involves the characteristics of turbulence and has been widely investigated in past decades specificities of the grid such as bar width and solidity as well as downstream measurement distance can be adjusted in order to obtain the desired turbulence scales for instance in laboratory experiments atkinson and damiani 1986 cheng and law 2001 and baines and peterson 1951 found that homogeneity can only be achieved between 2 and 5 mesh sizes m downstream to the grid on the other hand groth and johansson 1988 conducted experiments in a wind tunnel and measured homogeneity approximately 20 mesh sizes downstream from the grid the isotropy level and turbulence scales generated by a vertically oscillating grid were also investigated by hopfinger and toly 1976 who found that integral scales were proportional to downstream distance with the proportionality coefficient varying with grid characteristics due to its ability to replicate various levels of turbulence intensities and eddy length scales grid generated turbulence has also been used to test tidal energy turbine models in laboratories blackmore et al 2016 used grid generated turbulence in a circulating water channel in order to test the impacts of turbulence on tidal turbine performance and loads by varying turbulence intensities and integral length scales similarly vinod and banerjee 2019 observed the effect of grid turbulence to the performance of a scaled tidal turbine and the turbine wake bachant 2011 placed a grid approximately 5 mesh sizes upstream to an adv and 10 mesh sizes upstream to a turbine prototype in a towing tank in order to investigate variation in turbine performance however in none of the experiments the interaction between turbulence and waves has been considered a wide range of techniques can be applied to decompose wave and turbulence resulting in various levels of accuracy and computational expenses bian et al 2018 bricker and monismith 2007 perez et al 2020 smyth et al 2002 the choice of standard wave turbulence decomposition techniques requires a certain degree of versatility as wave conditions can vary significantly in tidal energy sites the synchrosqueezing wavelet transform swt technique has been proven to successfully describe nonstationary signals and was only recently for the first time applied to data from a prospective tidal energy site perez et al 2020 when compared to other signal processing techniques the swt has provided the lowest level of turbulence underestimation nonetheless this is a strictly mathematical technique which may still result in some level of underestimation when the physical process is not accurately described by the mathematic approach it may yield an unsatisfactory performance as an alternative a method which relies on wave theory may lead to more precise estimation of wave orbital velocities and consequently of turbulence parameters in this paper we use a turbulence generator grid in a towing tank with a wave maker in order to test two wave turbulence decomposition techniques under various wave conditions the decomposition methods tested are the swt technique and a novel technique based on linear wave theory which were applied to the adv velocity component aligned with the towing direction we expect that the strictly mathematical and the physical approaches will present varying advantages and disadvantages when compared the results emphasize the importance of establishing guidelines for turbulence characterization when performing tidal energy site assessments moreover the findings obtained from the presented laboratory experiments as well as the proposed experimental set up can be even more useful if reapplied and a turbine downstream to the turbulence grid is included 2 methods 2 1 experimental design and data quality control 2 1 1 test facility experimental set up and test conditions the experiments were performed at the towing tank facility at the australian maritime college amc university of tasmania launceston the tank is 100 m long and 1 5 m deep and its carriage can move to up to 4 6 m s a wave maker is located at the end of the tank the wave maker can produce waves with frequencies ranging from 0 3 hz to 1 4 hz and wave heights ranging between 0 05 and 0 40 m fig 1 a sontek 16 mhz micro adv was used to characterize the flow in order to generate turbulence a grid with 47 mm square openings and 13 mm wide bars mesh size m 60 mm was placed at the front of the carriage approximately 5 m 0 30 m upstream from the adv similar to bachant 2011 with the aim to attain flow homogeneity and avoid coalescing jets grid dimensions were chosen considering the maximum possible downstream distance between the adv and the grid based on the carriage set up the experimental set up yielded a solidity of 0 39 and agreed with values obtained in other laboratory studies e g kurian and fransson 2009 and was below a maximum allowable solidity of 0 5 bearman and morel 1983 szaszák et al 2018 gramespacher et al 2019 appendix a fig a1 the adv sensor was located at mid depth 0 75 m and an ultrasonic wave gauge was aligned with it to measure the surface elevation fig 1 the adv was positioned so that the transducer for the x velocity component was aligned with the towing direction and wave direction perpendicular to the wave crests ball clay was added to the tank to increase the signal to noise ratio snr and improve the quality of the adv signal carriage speeds ranged from 1 m s to 1 75 m s wave frequencies from 0 3 hz to 1 1 hz and wave heights 0 132 m 0 221 m and 0 309 m were considered the wave frequencies were limited by constraints of the tank size and the combination with wave height runs were also conducted in the absence of waves at all selected speeds in order to allow for an evaluation on the effectiveness of the decomposition methods for repeatability two runs were conducted for each set of conditions with the exception of runs at 1 m s towing speed 0 3 hz wave frequency and 0 132 m wave height where five runs were repeated for an uncertainty analysis in total 66 runs were carried out in the presence of waves under 31 different set of conditions and 6 runs were conducted in the absence of waves totalizing 34 set of conditions table 1 each run was followed by an interval of approximately 15 min to let the waves to settle in the tank 2 1 2 scalability from field data banks strait australia banks strait is a tidal energy candidate site located in tasmania australia which has been characterized with numerous adcps deployments during field campaigns between march 2018 and february 2019 marsh et al 2019 penesis et al 2018 perez et al 2019 2020 for instance adcp data collected over three months at a 34 m deep site reveals mean current speed of 1 2 m s during fully developed tides and maximum current speed reaching over 2 m s fig 2 the mean wave frequency is 0 11 hz and wave heights for the experiments were chosen based on the local wave height conditions e g medium height waves 3 m large waves 5 m and large waves representing extreme conditions 7 m at the site the scaling factor for the physical experiments was 1 23 froude scaling the carriage was moving against the wave propagation and therefore the encounter frequency was estimated using equation 1 prior to transformation to full scale wave frequency table 1 1 ω enc u towing ω 2 g cos 0 ω towing speeds were also limited by the substantial drag force induced by the grid turbulence intensities estimated from a nortek signature ad2cp sampling at 8 hz in banks strait varied mostly between 12 and 17 a description of the instrument sampling configuration is revealed in perez et al 2020 2 1 3 instrument configuration and data quality control both the adv and the ultrasonic wave gauge were set to sample at a frequency of 50 hz which is the fastest possible sampling rate of the adv the velocity range was set to 2 50 m s in order to avoid phase wrapping data points with signal to noise ratio lower than 10 db and a correlation lower than 60 were removed from the analysis for data quality in addition velocities higher than the modulus of the average plus three times the standard deviation were removed and replaced by interpolation from the data set prior to the analysis similarly surface elevation data higher than the average plus two times the standard deviation were omitted from the analysis in addition the surface elevation time series was filtered using a moving median filter over 0 18 s time intervals to remove residual noise 2 1 4 uncertainty analysis experimental data present uncertainties which can be expressed as a combination of precision and bias uncertainties the uncertainty analysis was performed following the recommendations by the international towing tank conference ittc 2008 the precision uncertainty defined as type a concerns statistical analysis and is related to the fact that generally when a measurement is repeated its results will vary from the previous repeat murray et al 2018 it can be estimated as 2 u precision s n where n is the number of repeats and s is the standard deviation when multiple time series are compared then each time series mean should be treated as a sample and s is the standard deviation obtained from the means brouwer et al 2013 the bias uncertainty defined as type b is a result of judgement from of all relevant information available such as previous experiences manufacturer s specifications as well as model bias and positioning the combined uncertainty can be estimated as the positive square root of the sum of terms 3 u combined u precision 2 u bias 2 finally the expanded uncertainty can be defined as the combined uncertainty multiplied by a coverage factor k 2 7764 which gives a 95 confidence level the coverage factor was obtained from a student t distribution 4 u expanded k u combined here the uncertainty analysis was conducted over 5 repeats with carriage speed at 1 m s wave height of 0 132 m and wave frequency of 0 3 hz 2 2 estimation of turbulence parameters when performing the reynolds decomposition of a given velocity signal under the influence of surface gravity waves it can be described as 5 x x x x where x is the mean velocity x is the turbulent fluctuation and x is the wave orbital motion in order to avoid overestimation of turbulence parameters the latter must be removed from the signal by the applied wave turbulence decomposition techniques kolmogorov s theory predicts that the energy spectra in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence will follow a 5 3 slope with eddy wavenumbers although isotropic relations are frequently used to describe grid generated turbulence it will generally carry some degree of anisotropy groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 the simplest way to assess the level of large scale anisotropy in grid generated turbulence is to compare the root mean square of the cross stream and streamwise velocity fluctuations called the anisotropy ratio 6 a y 2 x 2 where x is the velocity parallel to the wave direction and y is the velocity perpendicular to the wave direction valente and vassilicos 2011 turbulence intensity is a quantity frequently adopted by the tidal energy community to describe the level of turbulence in a flow it is given in percentages and represents a ratio of turbulent fluctuations and mean velocity here it is defined as 7 t i x 2 x o where x o is the free stream carriage velocity the root mean square of velocity fluctuations is calculated for each run individually over 20 s so that periods in which the carriage was accelerating or decelerating were excluded 2 3 linear wave theory decomposition technique we introduce a novel wave turbulence decomposition technique based on estimating wave orbital velocities from the surface elevation and subtracting them from the total velocity signal assuming linear wave theory the horizontal component of the orbital velocity at an arbitrary depth parallel to the direction waves are coming from can be estimated from 8 x t a ω cosh k d z sinh k d sin k x ω t while the vertical component is described as 9 z t a ω sinh k d z sinh k d cos k x ω t where a is the wave amplitude ω is the wave angular frequency k is the wavenumber d is the mean water depth and z is the distance below the surface in which the velocity is to be calculated for a harmonic propagating wave the surface elevation time series can be obtained from 10 η t x a sin ω t k x where η is the water surface elevation holthuijsen 2007 therefore the horizontal component of the orbital velocity can be rewritten as 11 x t η t x ω cosh k d z sinh k d the method relies on instantaneous measurements of the surface elevation or of pressure in the absence of water level measurements which must be taken simultaneously with the velocity measurements because the velocity and surface elevation measurements must be aligned in time and position extracting the phase information from the water level is not necessary since cos sin π 2 the vertical component of the orbital velocity can be calculated by shifting the surface elevation time series by π 2 this is achieved by isolating the imaginary part of the hilbert transform of the surface elevation brandt 2011 thus the vertical component can be expressed as 12 z t h t i m η t x ω sinh k d z sinh k d where h t i m η t x represents the imaginary part of the hilbert transform according to colucci et al 2014 in the presence of strong currents which are often prevalent in tidal channels the measured ωo is doppler shifted and must be corrected by 13 ω ω o u cos α k where u is the current speed magnitude and α is the difference in degrees between the flow direction and direction of wave propagation in the experiments these directions were opposite and hence α 0 a continuous wavelet transform cwt of the surface elevation time series is performed in order to obtain information in the time frequency plane as per equations 10 and 11 the velocity transfer functions must be multiplied by the surface elevation cwt to obtain the streamwise and vertical velocities in the time frequency plane 14 x t f t f w η t f ω cosh k d z sinh k d 15 z t f t f w h t η t f ω sinh k d z sinh k d where x t f and z t f are the streamwise and vertical velocities in the time frequency plane and w η and w h t η are the cwt of the surface elevation and its imaginary hilbert transform respectively the appropriate wavenumbers k and wave frequency ω can be estimated considering the surface elevation frequency information the new orbital velocity time series x and z are reconstructed by performing an inverse cwt to x t f and z t f to perform the decomposition the new time series must be subtracted from the original velocity signal 16 x decomposed x x 17 z decomposed z z the application of this method is highly dependent on the direction of the waves in relation to the tidal current for adcp data from field deployments knowledge of the direction between waves and instrument beams is also crucial for a successful application of this technique when applied to field data the decomposition technique should be performed on beam velocities and then transformed to wave coordinates to consider the velocity vector aligned with wave direction the decomposition was applied only to the x component of the adv which was exactly aligned with the towing direction to guarantee optimal test conditions of this technique in the laboratory experiments the technique was tested on a dataset obtained from previous experiments that were conducted in a similar set up but with a different grid these tests confirmed that orbital velocities can be accurately estimated and the results obtained from this secondary dataset are provided in the supplementary material 2 4 synchrosqueezing wavelet transform decomposition technique the swt was introduced by daubechies et al 2011 and described as a combination of a wavelet transform and the reallocation method it aims to provide a more concentrated time frequency representation allowing for the extraction of instantaneous frequency lines the result provides a representation of the signal in the time frequency plane with a reduced energy spread and increased frequency resolution it has been proven to successfully describe independent components from nonstationary signals and has been applied to other research areas daubechies et al 2011 thakur et al 2013 this technique was first used for wave turbulence decomposition by bian et al 2018 the method consists of identifying the peak energies in the time frequency plane which are caused by the presence of surface gravity waves these components are used to reconstruct the signal x which is then subtracted from the total velocity signal this technique was first applied to data from a tidal energy site by perez et al 2020 here this analysis was conducted using the matlab synchrosqueezing toolbox made publicly available by thakur et al 2013 in order to allow for a comparison with the linear wave theory method the swt decomposition was also applied to the x adv velocity component 3 results the results of the uncertainty analysis are summarized in table 2 although it is expected that precision uncertainties will be higher than usual towing tank experiments due to the unsteady nature of the flow analysed the expanded uncertainties obtained are still low when compared to the targeted test conditions speeds and wave heights in the test facility the anisotropy ratio and turbulence intensities were estimated for the runs conducted at 1 1 5 and 1 75 m s in the absence of waves fig 3 maximum anisotropy ratio was observed in the runs conducted at 1 m s with a value of 1 03 and the minimum anisotropy ratio 0 71 occurred at 1 5 m s mean streamwise ti were 17 33 23 19 and 25 15 for 1 1 5 and 1 75 m s respectively the maximum difference in ti in between the two runs occurred at 1 75 m s with 2 08 difference indicating an overall good agreement when isotropic turbulence pertains the velocity fluctuations are expected to approximate a normal distribution ting 2016 in order to evaluate if the turbulent fields are normally distributed a gaussian curve was fitted to the velocity histogram so that the skewness and kurtosis factors could be estimated fig 4 generally the data distribution is in good approximation to the gaussian fit although some deviation from the normal distribution is observed the skewness and kurtosis factors are close to those expected in a gaussian curve 0 and 3 respectively this result also supports the suitability of the turbulent conditions in the experiments presented in fig 3 which shows the turbulent fields reveal an acceptable level of anisotropy in comparison with previous studies groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 valente and vassilicos 2011 velocity fluctuations recorded over 5 min by opposing adcp beams 2 and 4 at banks strait is provided in fig 4g and h the skewness and kurtosis factors agree satisfactorily with those obtained from experimental data which gives confidence in the scalability of the experiments to field conditions one of the runs conducted at 1 m s towing speed 0 9 hz wave frequency and 0 221 m wave height presented inaccurate surface elevation data and was removed from the analysis the energy spectra from eight runs conducted at different conditions is depicted in fig 4 the wave energy peak is not obvious in the spectra from runs with wave frequencies above 0 7 hz the decrease in isotropy presented in fig 3 is confirmed by the energy spectra from runs performed at higher speeds where the difference between streamwise cross stream and vertical directions is more pronounced we note that for runs with wave frequencies above 0 7 hz the waves were starting to break in the tank hence the energy was spread across a broader frequency band in the surface elevation spectrum another reason for this spread is that the surface elevation did not have the sinusoidal shape known from classic linear wave theory generally the 5 3 inertial subrange is more evident in runs with low towing speed and wave frequencies indicating isotropy all runs were decomposed using both the linear wave theory technique and the swt technique energy spectra and turbulence intensities were estimated from the original and decomposed signals 3 1 linear wave theory decomposition a slight decrease in the energy peak obtained from the liner wave theory decomposition can be observed in runs at 1 m s in contrast runs carried out at higher speeds were not significantly affected fig 5 runs were performed at 1 and 1 75 m s under the same wave conditions 0 4 hz frequency and wave height of 0 221 m but the magnitude of the measured oscillatory motion differs substantially between the runs according to linear wave theory the same wave conditions should yield the same orbital velocities since the magnitude of the orbital velocity is proportional to wave amplitude the method is expected to work better for larger wave amplitudes however the amplitude of the oscillatory motion is amplified by the presence of the grid which emanates jets as the flow passes through it this effect appears to be intensified as the towing speed increases as a consequence the peak cannot be completely removed even with a remaining wave energy peak in the spectra the estimation of orbital motion seems accurate a comparison of the estimated orbital velocities depicted in the supplementary material and fig 6 demonstrates that the magnitude of the estimated orbital velocities for the same wave conditions is in good agreement with the measured oscillatory motion moreover orbital velocities calculated from runs conducted under different towing speeds but the same wave conditions are in good agreement the difference between unfiltered and linear wave theory decomposed ti decreases as wave frequency increases and becomes negligible for frequencies above 0 7 hz fig 7 generally a larger difference in ti due to the decomposition occurs in runs at 1 m s contrastingly runs performed at 1 5 and 1 75 m s show a substantially smaller reduction in ti these results agree with those presented in fig 6 where the energy peak is barely affected by the decomposition in runs performed at 1 75 m s compared to those at 1 m s 3 2 synchrosqueezing wavelet transform decomposition the spectra for unfiltered and swt decomposed velocity show a drop in density at the frequencies where the wave peak was previously present indicating possible underestimation of turbulence fig 7 nonetheless the spectra remain unaffected at higher frequencies suggesting the technique did not alter turbulence results in these frequency bands after performing the swt decomposition for all runs ti were estimated and compared to the unfiltered values fig 8 the difference is larger at lower frequencies and significantly decreases in frequencies above 0 7 hz these results are similar to those obtained from the linear wave theory technique for all speeds original turbulence intensities were larger at lower wave frequencies at 1 5 and 1 75 m s the method seems to slightly underestimate turbulence intensities contrastingly the method considerably decreases ti estimates for runs carried out at 1 m s although some overestimation is still present when comparing runs conducted at 1 m s the ti difference increases with wave height suggesting that the swt is more accurate when the magnitude of the oscillatory motion is larger resulting in a more prominent energy peak in the spectrum see fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 turbulence characterization in the absence of waves turbulence in the experiments was characterized in terms of anisotropy the normal distribution and velocity spectra for runs conducted in the absence of waves anisotropy ratios varied between 0 7 and 1 these values reflect a reasonable level of isotropy especially at 1 m s considering the intrinsic anisotropy in grid generated turbulence and agree well with other grid turbulence studies carried out under different conditions groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 valente and vassilicos 2011 the analysis of gaussian distribution through skewness and kurtosis factors depicted in fig 4 also suggests some deviation from perfect isotropy but the generated turbulence still agreed satisfactorily with other grid turbulence studies vita et al 2018 isaza et al 2014 4 2 significance of wave turbulence decomposition in tidal energy sites the impact of surface gravity waves on estimates of turbulence in tidally energetic sites outlines the need to remove of the wave bias thiébaut et al 2020 togneri et al 2017 the substantially different results obtained from the two decomposition methods emphasize the importance of applying an accurate technique the disparity arising from different decomposition techniques has already been highlighted in a recent study perez et al 2020 the findings of this work underline these results but also point to the fact that the efficiency of decomposition techniques can be affected by sea conditions and therefore the choice of a method must be treated with caution the accurate estimation of turbulence parameters in tidal energy sites is crucial to improve turbulence models used for turbine design most models currently rely on the creation of synthetic turbulence spectra togneri et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 due to high costs associated with field data collection in such energetic sites whilst synthetic turbulence offers a more practical alternative for fast design improvements validation against field measurements is still of primary importance to avoid premature device fatigue in the presence of long surface waves the increased velocity fluctuations may lead to overestimation of turbulence and substantial overengineering a way to improve the accuracy and robustness of turbulence estimates from tidal energy sites with strong wave current interaction is to provide specific guidelines for site assessments such as those already in place for tidal current characterization emec 2009 iec 2015 4 3 similarity between field and experimental results wave frequency spectrum agrees well with those observed in banks strait for instance 94 5 of the wave periods observed at the field site are within the frequency band tested likewise wave parameters agree with those observed in banks strait although waves as large as 7 m were not observed during the deployment period those were included in the test matrix to represent extreme weather events as these are the most likely to cause damage to tidal turbines the solidity of the grid used in our experiment had a value of 0 39 and was below the recommended limit of 0 5 groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 but some increases in large scale fluctuations were observed the overestimation of the oscillatory motion in the dataset was likely caused by the proximity of the adv to the grid 5 m and is the main reason why the linear wave theory technique was not successful in completely removing energy peaks see supplementary material cheng and law 2001 and atkinson and damiani 1986 report that turbulence homogeneity can be achieved 3 m downstream of the grid and baines and peterson 1951 found that homogeneity occurs at a 5 m downstream distance on the other hand groth and johansson 1988 found that homogeneity only occurs at a distance of 20 m downstream to the grid our results suggest that 5 m was not sufficient to ensure uniformity but the impact of non uniform grid jets was less apparent at 1 m s towing speed the presence of the jets also explains the decrease in isotropy at higher towing speeds depicted in fig 3 as a consequence of the velocity increase caused by such jets the measured turbulence intensities at 1 5 and 1 75 m s were larger than experienced in banks strait the sensitivity of this effect to towing speed is reinforced by the results of the linear wave theory method shown in fig 7 as the low frequency oscillation is considerably more enhanced in runs performed at higher towing speeds turbulence intensities are barely affected in runs at 1 5 m s and 1 75 m s nonetheless as both decomposition techniques are more dominated by wave characteristics rather than turbulence characteristics this bias does not pose a significant problem for the outcome of the present work 4 4 linear wave theory x swt the unique experimental runs presented here allow to compare two decomposition techniques which yield estimates of turbulence intensities and anisotropy ratios the results give insight into the performance of each technique and its efficiency for different wave current interaction conditions generally there is a good match between lab conditions and those observed in tidal energy sites where wave peaks occur between 0 1 hz 0 3 hz and ti from 12 to 16 hashemi et al 2015 perez et al 2020 thiébaut et al 2020 the energy spectra demonstrated that the swt method successfully removed the energy peak when applied to a range of wave conditions however the results depicted in fig 8 suggest the technique is more suitable for lower frequency wave conditions and works best when a clear pronounced energy peak is present in the spectrum in runs performed at high wave frequencies wave breaking occurred so that the surface elevation deviated from the classic sinusoidal shape consequently energy was spread across a larger frequency band and the spectra did not show a pronounced peak as encountered for low frequency waves hence the swt technique was not as successful in identifying peak frequencies in the time frequency plane and removing the orbital motion similar observations were made with the linear wave theory decomposition technique as shown in fig 6 in addition such waves are short and its induced orbital motion is not expected to affect deep parts of the water column for instance a towing speed of 1 5 m s and frequency of 0 8 hz which was the lowest frequency when waves breaking occurred at this speed means a scaled up encounter frequency of 0 3 hz assuming linear wave theory as a first order approximation and estimating the wavelength with l g t 2 2 π leads to a wavelength of 17 68 m such wavelength and frequencies does not significantly enhance oscillations at mid water column in a 34 m deep site as the measurement station discussed here in fact the reference site banks strait presents mean and maximum wave frequencies of 0 11 and 0 38 hz and mean and maximum wave heights of 1 7 m and 5 2 m respectively perez et al 2020 implying that the technique should be successful in most conditions observed at the site comparison of results obtained from the swt technique at 1 m s and 1 5 m s prove that the method can still lead to some level of inaccuracy of turbulence intensities however the turbulence intensity estimates are considerably improved when compared to the values obtained prior to the decomposition 4 5 limitations of the linear wave theory technique applied to field data despite the fact the energy peaks could not be entirely removed by the linear wave theory observation of the velocity time series obtained from the linear wave theory technique applied to the secondary dataset supplementary material and that depicted in fig 6 shows that the estimated orbital velocities agree well this result suggests that the remaining low frequency velocity fluctuations are likely a result of collapsing adjacent jets introduced by the grid and as previously discussed cause an increase of the oscillatory motion the application of the linear wave theory technique to data obtained from adcp field deployments still poses a challenge when compared to the swt method turbulence parameters estimates from adcp measurements require the data to be recorded in beam velocities last generation instruments include four 25 slanted beams and one vertical beam due to the adcp beam geometry bins sampled by opposing beams are at a considerable distance from each other and are not in phase with the pressure signal in that case the method would require a time shift of the pressure signal in the time frequency domain considering respective wave celerity which considerably increases the complexity of the method this would not represent a significant issue in datasets collected with advs or the vertical beam only as horizontal and vertical velocities are obtained directly instead of estimated from diverging beams in addition to the challenges posed by instrument geometry the application of the linear wave theory technique is limited by the possible nonlinearity present in prospective tidal energy sites even though linear wave theory has been previously adopted in tidal energy studies nonlinearity has been pointed as a frequent characteristic of wave climates in prospective tidal sites for instance filipot et al 2015 used linear wave theory to perform wave turbulence decomposition however their method is limited to the frequency plan and does not provide a decomposed velocity time series hence it would not allow for example for the estimation of integral length scales using the temporal autocorrelation function as performed by bouferrouk et al 2016 and mccaffrey et al 2015 hashemi et al 2015 investigated the effects of wave current interaction on tidal resource using a high resolution coupled wave tide model and found that in the absence of a wave tide model linear wave theory can be used as an approximation to estimate wave orbital velocity nonetheless hashemi et al 2015 also point out the highly nonlinear nature of wave current interaction possible nonlinearity is also considered by venugopal et al 2018 and lewis et al 2014 who highlight that waves may propagate at an angle to tidal current direction and hence present high nonlinearity the assumption of conditions where linear wave theory can be applied is therefore limited and this represents a disadvantage when compared to the more versatile swt method such limitations suggest that the linear wave theory decomposing technique can only be applied to specific datasets and should be used with caution 5 conclusions two wave turbulence decomposition techniques have been applied to laboratory data representing various turbulence intensities anisotropy ratios and wave frequencies the experimental set up includes a turbulence generator grid and a wave maker and the boundary conditions were chosen to reproduce wave turbulence interactions observed in the field and can be used to test the performance of tidal turbines under wave turbulence interaction application of these methods to varying flow conditions allowed for the evaluation of the flexibility and its efficiency of each technique in different wave climates both decomposition techniques were found to be less effective in high frequency wave fields or when energy is spread across a broader frequency band however the swt method demonstrated to be more versatile and performs with less limitations compared to the linear wave theory method the findings of this work are promising to drive forward discussions regarding wave turbulence

21312,tidal energy turbines are significantly impacted by surface gravity waves and high turbulence levels which lead to increased blade loads and consequent device fatigue accurately describing turbulence quantities is a key factor to improve numerical models and ensure the minimum necessary device longevity the application of an appropriate wave turbulence decomposition technique substantially improves estimates and must be debated by the tidal energy community this work analyses two wave turbulence decomposition techniques i linear wave theory and ii synchrosqueezing wavelet

characterized by high levels of turbulence and large waves copping et al 2014 harrold and ouro 2019 these features are known for posing a considerable challenge for tidal turbine developers to ensure

and viola 2020 minimising device maintenance is an essential step in making tidal energy more economically feasible and a competitive renewable energy source currently most turbine models rely on artificial turbulence as a consequence of a lack of accurate field measurements a significant contribution is to properly characterize turbulence parameters at prospective sites numerous studies have focused on characterizing wave climates and wave current interaction in such locations hashemi et al 2015 lewis et al 2014 venugopal et al 2018 and similar effort has been put into estimating turbulence parameters in potential tidal energy sites bouferrouk et al 2016 greenwood et al 2019 gunawan et al 2014 hay et al 2013 mccaffrey et al 2015 the characterization of turbulence parameters is based on statistical features of velocity fluctuations as turbulence is known for being statistically stable over short enough periods of time the reynolds decomposition separates the velocity signal into mean and fluctuating components in the presence of interaction with long surface gravity waves the velocity fluctuations can be biased by wave orbital motions in order to avoid overestimation of turbulence parameters and therefore of manufacturing and maintenance costs orbital velocities and turbulent fluctuations must be decomposed the significance of estimating turbulence parameters for tidal turbines has been highlighted in the literature but little has been done in relation to wave turbulence interaction and decomposition in prospective tidal energy sites as a consequence the international electrotechnical commission iec 2015 and the european marine energy centre emec 2009 guidelines for tidal energy site assessments do not present standards for performing turbulence characterization or wave turbulence decomposition in tidal energy sites traditionally turbulence is measured in the field with acoustic doppler velocimeters advs despite the ability to resolve fine scale turbulence with high sampling rates of up to 200 hz the sampling volume of advs is limited to the order of centimetres in addition field deployments at tidal energy sites with strong currents is often challenging guerra and thomson 2017 thomson et al 2013 acoustic doppler current profilers adcps offer an alternative with larger sampling volumes and the ability of profiling throughout the water column estimation of turbulence parameters from these instruments assumes the velocity field is horizontally homogeneous and relies on the variance of beam velocities stacey et al 1999 replicating the turbulent conditions found in tidal energy sites where these instruments are deployed is a challenge which is further increased by the addition of surface waves due to challenges of obtaining sufficient field measurements studies often rely on grids to disturb the flow and to create turbulence in a controlled environment e g in a wave tank or towing tank grid generated turbulence involves the characteristics of turbulence and has been widely investigated in past decades specificities of the grid such as bar width and solidity as well as downstream measurement distance can be adjusted in order to obtain the desired turbulence scales for instance in laboratory experiments atkinson and damiani 1986 cheng and law 2001 and baines and peterson 1951 found that homogeneity can only be achieved between 2 and 5 mesh sizes m downstream to the grid on the other hand groth and johansson 1988 conducted experiments in a wind tunnel and measured homogeneity approximately 20 mesh sizes downstream from the grid the isotropy level and turbulence scales generated by a vertically oscillating grid were also investigated by hopfinger and toly 1976 who found that integral scales were proportional to downstream distance with the proportionality coefficient varying with grid characteristics due to its ability to replicate various levels of turbulence intensities and eddy length scales grid generated turbulence has also been used to test tidal energy turbine models in laboratories blackmore et al 2016 used grid generated turbulence in a circulating water channel in order to test the impacts of turbulence on tidal turbine performance and loads by varying turbulence intensities and integral length scales similarly vinod and banerjee 2019 observed the effect of grid turbulence to the performance of a scaled tidal turbine and the turbine wake bachant 2011 placed a grid approximately 5 mesh sizes upstream to an adv and 10 mesh sizes upstream to a turbine prototype in a towing tank in order to investigate variation in turbine performance however in none of the experiments the interaction between turbulence and waves has been considered a wide range of techniques can be applied to decompose wave and turbulence resulting in various levels of accuracy and computational expenses bian et al 2018 bricker and monismith 2007 perez et al 2020 smyth et al 2002 the choice of standard wave turbulence decomposition techniques requires a certain degree of versatility as wave conditions can vary significantly in tidal energy sites the synchrosqueezing wavelet transform swt technique has been proven to successfully describe nonstationary signals and was only recently for the first time applied to data from a prospective tidal energy site perez et al 2020 when compared to other signal processing techniques the swt has provided the lowest level of turbulence underestimation nonetheless this is a strictly mathematical technique which may still result in some level of underestimation when the physical process is not accurately described by the mathematic approach it may yield an unsatisfactory performance as an alternative a method which relies on wave theory may lead to more precise estimation of wave orbital velocities and consequently of turbulence parameters in this paper we use a turbulence generator grid in a towing tank with a wave maker in order to test two wave turbulence decomposition techniques under various wave conditions the decomposition methods tested are the swt technique and a novel technique based on linear wave theory which were applied to the adv velocity component aligned with the towing direction we expect that the strictly mathematical and the physical approaches will present varying advantages and disadvantages when compared the results emphasize the importance of establishing guidelines for turbulence characterization when performing tidal energy site assessments moreover the findings obtained from the presented laboratory experiments as well as the proposed experimental set up can be even more useful if reapplied and a turbine downstream to the turbulence grid is included 2 methods 2 1 experimental design and data quality control 2 1 1 test facility experimental set up and test conditions the experiments were performed at the towing tank facility at the australian maritime college amc university of tasmania launceston the tank is 100 m long and 1 5 m deep and its carriage can move to up to 4 6 m s a wave maker is located at the end of the tank the wave maker can produce waves with frequencies ranging from 0 3 hz to 1 4 hz and wave heights ranging between 0 05 and 0 40 m fig 1 a sontek 16 mhz micro adv was used to characterize the flow in order to generate turbulence a grid with 47 mm square openings and 13 mm wide bars mesh size m 60 mm was placed at the front of the carriage approximately 5 m 0 30 m upstream from the adv similar to bachant 2011 with the aim to attain flow homogeneity and avoid coalescing jets grid dimensions were chosen considering the maximum possible downstream distance between the adv and the grid based on the carriage set up the experimental set up yielded a solidity of 0 39 and agreed with values obtained in other laboratory studies e g kurian and fransson 2009 and was below a maximum allowable solidity of 0 5 bearman and morel 1983 szaszák et al 2018 gramespacher et al 2019 appendix a fig a1 the adv sensor was located at mid depth 0 75 m and an ultrasonic wave gauge was aligned with it to measure the surface elevation fig 1 the adv was positioned so that the transducer for the x velocity component was aligned with the towing direction and wave direction perpendicular to the wave crests ball clay was added to the tank to increase the signal to noise ratio snr and improve the quality of the adv signal carriage speeds ranged from 1 m s to 1 75 m s wave frequencies from 0 3 hz to 1 1 hz and wave heights 0 132 m 0 221 m and 0 309 m were considered the wave frequencies were limited by constraints of the tank size and the combination with wave height runs were also conducted in the absence of waves at all selected speeds in order to allow for an evaluation on the effectiveness of the decomposition methods for repeatability two runs were conducted for each set of conditions with the exception of runs at 1 m s towing speed 0 3 hz wave frequency and 0 132 m wave height where five runs were repeated for an uncertainty analysis in total 66 runs were carried out in the presence of waves under 31 different set of conditions and 6 runs were conducted in the absence of waves totalizing 34 set of conditions table 1 each run was followed by an interval of approximately 15 min to let the waves to settle in the tank 2 1 2 scalability from field data banks strait australia banks strait is a tidal energy candidate site located in tasmania australia which has been characterized with numerous adcps deployments during field campaigns between march 2018 and february 2019 marsh et al 2019 penesis et al 2018 perez et al 2019 2020 for instance adcp data collected over three months at a 34 m deep site reveals mean current speed of 1 2 m s during fully developed tides and maximum current speed reaching over 2 m s fig 2 the mean wave frequency is 0 11 hz and wave heights for the experiments were chosen based on the local wave height conditions e g medium height waves 3 m large waves 5 m and large waves representing extreme conditions 7 m at the site the scaling factor for the physical experiments was 1 23 froude scaling the carriage was moving against the wave propagation and therefore the encounter frequency was estimated using equation 1 prior to transformation to full scale wave frequency table 1 1 ω enc u towing ω 2 g cos 0 ω towing speeds were also limited by the substantial drag force induced by the grid turbulence intensities estimated from a nortek signature ad2cp sampling at 8 hz in banks strait varied mostly between 12 and 17 a description of the instrument sampling configuration is revealed in perez et al 2020 2 1 3 instrument configuration and data quality control both the adv and the ultrasonic wave gauge were set to sample at a frequency of 50 hz which is the fastest possible sampling rate of the adv the velocity range was set to 2 50 m s in order to avoid phase wrapping data points with signal to noise ratio lower than 10 db and a correlation lower than 60 were removed from the analysis for data quality in addition velocities higher than the modulus of the average plus three times the standard deviation were removed and replaced by interpolation from the data set prior to the analysis similarly surface elevation data higher than the average plus two times the standard deviation were omitted from the analysis in addition the surface elevation time series was filtered using a moving median filter over 0 18 s time intervals to remove residual noise 2 1 4 uncertainty analysis experimental data present uncertainties which can be expressed as a combination of precision and bias uncertainties the uncertainty analysis was performed following the recommendations by the international towing tank conference ittc 2008 the precision uncertainty defined as type a concerns statistical analysis and is related to the fact that generally when a measurement is repeated its results will vary from the previous repeat murray et al 2018 it can be estimated as 2 u precision s n where n is the number of repeats and s is the standard deviation when multiple time series are compared then each time series mean should be treated as a sample and s is the standard deviation obtained from the means brouwer et al 2013 the bias uncertainty defined as type b is a result of judgement from of all relevant information available such as previous experiences manufacturer s specifications as well as model bias and positioning the combined uncertainty can be estimated as the positive square root of the sum of terms 3 u combined u precision 2 u bias 2 finally the expanded uncertainty can be defined as the combined uncertainty multiplied by a coverage factor k 2 7764 which gives a 95 confidence level the coverage factor was obtained from a student t distribution 4 u expanded k u combined here the uncertainty analysis was conducted over 5 repeats with carriage speed at 1 m s wave height of 0 132 m and wave frequency of 0 3 hz 2 2 estimation of turbulence parameters when performing the reynolds decomposition of a given velocity signal under the influence of surface gravity waves it can be described as 5 x x x x where x is the mean velocity x is the turbulent fluctuation and x is the wave orbital motion in order to avoid overestimation of turbulence parameters the latter must be removed from the signal by the applied wave turbulence decomposition techniques kolmogorov s theory predicts that the energy spectra in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence will follow a 5 3 slope with eddy wavenumbers although isotropic relations are frequently used to describe grid generated turbulence it will generally carry some degree of anisotropy groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 the simplest way to assess the level of large scale anisotropy in grid generated turbulence is to compare the root mean square of the cross stream and streamwise velocity fluctuations called the anisotropy ratio 6 a y 2 x 2 where x is the velocity parallel to the wave direction and y is the velocity perpendicular to the wave direction valente and vassilicos 2011 turbulence intensity is a quantity frequently adopted by the tidal energy community to describe the level of turbulence in a flow it is given in percentages and represents a ratio of turbulent fluctuations and mean velocity here it is defined as 7 t i x 2 x o where x o is the free stream carriage velocity the root mean square of velocity fluctuations is calculated for each run individually over 20 s so that periods in which the carriage was accelerating or decelerating were excluded 2 3 linear wave theory decomposition technique we introduce a novel wave turbulence decomposition technique based on estimating wave orbital velocities from the surface elevation and subtracting them from the total velocity signal assuming linear wave theory the horizontal component of the orbital velocity at an arbitrary depth parallel to the direction waves are coming from can be estimated from 8 x t a ω cosh k d z sinh k d sin k x ω t while the vertical component is described as 9 z t a ω sinh k d z sinh k d cos k x ω t where a is the wave amplitude ω is the wave angular frequency k is the wavenumber d is the mean water depth and z is the distance below the surface in which the velocity is to be calculated for a harmonic propagating wave the surface elevation time series can be obtained from 10 η t x a sin ω t k x where η is the water surface elevation holthuijsen 2007 therefore the horizontal component of the orbital velocity can be rewritten as 11 x t η t x ω cosh k d z sinh k d the method relies on instantaneous measurements of the surface elevation or of pressure in the absence of water level measurements which must be taken simultaneously with the velocity measurements because the velocity and surface elevation measurements must be aligned in time and position extracting the phase information from the water level is not necessary since cos sin π 2 the vertical component of the orbital velocity can be calculated by shifting the surface elevation time series by π 2 this is achieved by isolating the imaginary part of the hilbert transform of the surface elevation brandt 2011 thus the vertical component can be expressed as 12 z t h t i m η t x ω sinh k d z sinh k d where h t i m η t x represents the imaginary part of the hilbert transform according to colucci et al 2014 in the presence of strong currents which are often prevalent in tidal channels the measured ωo is doppler shifted and must be corrected by 13 ω ω o u cos α k where u is the current speed magnitude and α is the difference in degrees between the flow direction and direction of wave propagation in the experiments these directions were opposite and hence α 0 a continuous wavelet transform cwt of the surface elevation time series is performed in order to obtain information in the time frequency plane as per equations 10 and 11 the velocity transfer functions must be multiplied by the surface elevation cwt to obtain the streamwise and vertical velocities in the time frequency plane 14 x t f t f w η t f ω cosh k d z sinh k d 15 z t f t f w h t η t f ω sinh k d z sinh k d where x t f and z t f are the streamwise and vertical velocities in the time frequency plane and w η and w h t η are the cwt of the surface elevation and its imaginary hilbert transform respectively the appropriate wavenumbers k and wave frequency ω can be estimated considering the surface elevation frequency information the new orbital velocity time series x and z are reconstructed by performing an inverse cwt to x t f and z t f to perform the decomposition the new time series must be subtracted from the original velocity signal 16 x decomposed x x 17 z decomposed z z the application of this method is highly dependent on the direction of the waves in relation to the tidal current for adcp data from field deployments knowledge of the direction between waves and instrument beams is also crucial for a successful application of this technique when applied to field data the decomposition technique should be performed on beam velocities and then transformed to wave coordinates to consider the velocity vector aligned with wave direction the decomposition was applied only to the x component of the adv which was exactly aligned with the towing direction to guarantee optimal test conditions of this technique in the laboratory experiments the technique was tested on a dataset obtained from previous experiments that were conducted in a similar set up but with a different grid these tests confirmed that orbital velocities can be accurately estimated and the results obtained from this secondary dataset are provided in the supplementary material 2 4 synchrosqueezing wavelet transform decomposition technique the swt was introduced by daubechies et al 2011 and described as a combination of a wavelet transform and the reallocation method it aims to provide a more concentrated time frequency representation allowing for the extraction of instantaneous frequency lines the result provides a representation of the signal in the time frequency plane with a reduced energy spread and increased frequency resolution it has been proven to successfully describe independent components from nonstationary signals and has been applied to other research areas daubechies et al 2011 thakur et al 2013 this technique was first used for wave turbulence decomposition by bian et al 2018 the method consists of identifying the peak energies in the time frequency plane which are caused by the presence of surface gravity waves these components are used to reconstruct the signal x which is then subtracted from the total velocity signal this technique was first applied to data from a tidal energy site by perez et al 2020 here this analysis was conducted using the matlab synchrosqueezing toolbox made publicly available by thakur et al 2013 in order to allow for a comparison with the linear wave theory method the swt decomposition was also applied to the x adv velocity component 3 results the results of the uncertainty analysis are summarized in table 2 although it is expected that precision uncertainties will be higher than usual towing tank experiments due to the unsteady nature of the flow analysed the expanded uncertainties obtained are still low when compared to the targeted test conditions speeds and wave heights in the test facility the anisotropy ratio and turbulence intensities were estimated for the runs conducted at 1 1 5 and 1 75 m s in the absence of waves fig 3 maximum anisotropy ratio was observed in the runs conducted at 1 m s with a value of 1 03 and the minimum anisotropy ratio 0 71 occurred at 1 5 m s mean streamwise ti were 17 33 23 19 and 25 15 for 1 1 5 and 1 75 m s respectively the maximum difference in ti in between the two runs occurred at 1 75 m s with 2 08 difference indicating an overall good agreement when isotropic turbulence pertains the velocity fluctuations are expected to approximate a normal distribution ting 2016 in order to evaluate if the turbulent fields are normally distributed a gaussian curve was fitted to the velocity histogram so that the skewness and kurtosis factors could be estimated fig 4 generally the data distribution is in good approximation to the gaussian fit although some deviation from the normal distribution is observed the skewness and kurtosis factors are close to those expected in a gaussian curve 0 and 3 respectively this result also supports the suitability of the turbulent conditions in the experiments presented in fig 3 which shows the turbulent fields reveal an acceptable level of anisotropy in comparison with previous studies groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 valente and vassilicos 2011 velocity fluctuations recorded over 5 min by opposing adcp beams 2 and 4 at banks strait is provided in fig 4g and h the skewness and kurtosis factors agree satisfactorily with those obtained from experimental data which gives confidence in the scalability of the experiments to field conditions one of the runs conducted at 1 m s towing speed 0 9 hz wave frequency and 0 221 m wave height presented inaccurate surface elevation data and was removed from the analysis the energy spectra from eight runs conducted at different conditions is depicted in fig 4 the wave energy peak is not obvious in the spectra from runs with wave frequencies above 0 7 hz the decrease in isotropy presented in fig 3 is confirmed by the energy spectra from runs performed at higher speeds where the difference between streamwise cross stream and vertical directions is more pronounced we note that for runs with wave frequencies above 0 7 hz the waves were starting to break in the tank hence the energy was spread across a broader frequency band in the surface elevation spectrum another reason for this spread is that the surface elevation did not have the sinusoidal shape known from classic linear wave theory generally the 5 3 inertial subrange is more evident in runs with low towing speed and wave frequencies indicating isotropy all runs were decomposed using both the linear wave theory technique and the swt technique energy spectra and turbulence intensities were estimated from the original and decomposed signals 3 1 linear wave theory decomposition a slight decrease in the energy peak obtained from the liner wave theory decomposition can be observed in runs at 1 m s in contrast runs carried out at higher speeds were not significantly affected fig 5 runs were performed at 1 and 1 75 m s under the same wave conditions 0 4 hz frequency and wave height of 0 221 m but the magnitude of the measured oscillatory motion differs substantially between the runs according to linear wave theory the same wave conditions should yield the same orbital velocities since the magnitude of the orbital velocity is proportional to wave amplitude the method is expected to work better for larger wave amplitudes however the amplitude of the oscillatory motion is amplified by the presence of the grid which emanates jets as the flow passes through it this effect appears to be intensified as the towing speed increases as a consequence the peak cannot be completely removed even with a remaining wave energy peak in the spectra the estimation of orbital motion seems accurate a comparison of the estimated orbital velocities depicted in the supplementary material and fig 6 demonstrates that the magnitude of the estimated orbital velocities for the same wave conditions is in good agreement with the measured oscillatory motion moreover orbital velocities calculated from runs conducted under different towing speeds but the same wave conditions are in good agreement the difference between unfiltered and linear wave theory decomposed ti decreases as wave frequency increases and becomes negligible for frequencies above 0 7 hz fig 7 generally a larger difference in ti due to the decomposition occurs in runs at 1 m s contrastingly runs performed at 1 5 and 1 75 m s show a substantially smaller reduction in ti these results agree with those presented in fig 6 where the energy peak is barely affected by the decomposition in runs performed at 1 75 m s compared to those at 1 m s 3 2 synchrosqueezing wavelet transform decomposition the spectra for unfiltered and swt decomposed velocity show a drop in density at the frequencies where the wave peak was previously present indicating possible underestimation of turbulence fig 7 nonetheless the spectra remain unaffected at higher frequencies suggesting the technique did not alter turbulence results in these frequency bands after performing the swt decomposition for all runs ti were estimated and compared to the unfiltered values fig 8 the difference is larger at lower frequencies and significantly decreases in frequencies above 0 7 hz these results are similar to those obtained from the linear wave theory technique for all speeds original turbulence intensities were larger at lower wave frequencies at 1 5 and 1 75 m s the method seems to slightly underestimate turbulence intensities contrastingly the method considerably decreases ti estimates for runs carried out at 1 m s although some overestimation is still present when comparing runs conducted at 1 m s the ti difference increases with wave height suggesting that the swt is more accurate when the magnitude of the oscillatory motion is larger resulting in a more prominent energy peak in the spectrum see fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 turbulence characterization in the absence of waves turbulence in the experiments was characterized in terms of anisotropy the normal distribution and velocity spectra for runs conducted in the absence of waves anisotropy ratios varied between 0 7 and 1 these values reflect a reasonable level of isotropy especially at 1 m s considering the intrinsic anisotropy in grid generated turbulence and agree well with other grid turbulence studies carried out under different conditions groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 valente and vassilicos 2011 the analysis of gaussian distribution through skewness and kurtosis factors depicted in fig 4 also suggests some deviation from perfect isotropy but the generated turbulence still agreed satisfactorily with other grid turbulence studies vita et al 2018 isaza et al 2014 4 2 significance of wave turbulence decomposition in tidal energy sites the impact of surface gravity waves on estimates of turbulence in tidally energetic sites outlines the need to remove of the wave bias thiébaut et al 2020 togneri et al 2017 the substantially different results obtained from the two decomposition methods emphasize the importance of applying an accurate technique the disparity arising from different decomposition techniques has already been highlighted in a recent study perez et al 2020 the findings of this work underline these results but also point to the fact that the efficiency of decomposition techniques can be affected by sea conditions and therefore the choice of a method must be treated with caution the accurate estimation of turbulence parameters in tidal energy sites is crucial to improve turbulence models used for turbine design most models currently rely on the creation of synthetic turbulence spectra togneri et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 due to high costs associated with field data collection in such energetic sites whilst synthetic turbulence offers a more practical alternative for fast design improvements validation against field measurements is still of primary importance to avoid premature device fatigue in the presence of long surface waves the increased velocity fluctuations may lead to overestimation of turbulence and substantial overengineering a way to improve the accuracy and robustness of turbulence estimates from tidal energy sites with strong wave current interaction is to provide specific guidelines for site assessments such as those already in place for tidal current characterization emec 2009 iec 2015 4 3 similarity between field and experimental results wave frequency spectrum agrees well with those observed in banks strait for instance 94 5 of the wave periods observed at the field site are within the frequency band tested likewise wave parameters agree with those observed in banks strait although waves as large as 7 m were not observed during the deployment period those were included in the test matrix to represent extreme weather events as these are the most likely to cause damage to tidal turbines the solidity of the grid used in our experiment had a value of 0 39 and was below the recommended limit of 0 5 groth and johansson 1988 kurian and fransson 2009 but some increases in large scale fluctuations were observed the overestimation of the oscillatory motion in the dataset was likely caused by the proximity of the adv to the grid 5 m and is the main reason why the linear wave theory technique was not successful in completely removing energy peaks see supplementary material cheng and law 2001 and atkinson and damiani 1986 report that turbulence homogeneity can be achieved 3 m downstream of the grid and baines and peterson 1951 found that homogeneity occurs at a 5 m downstream distance on the other hand groth and johansson 1988 found that homogeneity only occurs at a distance of 20 m downstream to the grid our results suggest that 5 m was not sufficient to ensure uniformity but the impact of non uniform grid jets was less apparent at 1 m s towing speed the presence of the jets also explains the decrease in isotropy at higher towing speeds depicted in fig 3 as a consequence of the velocity increase caused by such jets the measured turbulence intensities at 1 5 and 1 75 m s were larger than experienced in banks strait the sensitivity of this effect to towing speed is reinforced by the results of the linear wave theory method shown in fig 7 as the low frequency oscillation is considerably more enhanced in runs performed at higher towing speeds turbulence intensities are barely affected in runs at 1 5 m s and 1 75 m s nonetheless as both decomposition techniques are more dominated by wave characteristics rather than turbulence characteristics this bias does not pose a significant problem for the outcome of the present work 4 4 linear wave theory x swt the unique experimental runs presented here allow to compare two decomposition techniques which yield estimates of turbulence intensities and anisotropy ratios the results give insight into the performance of each technique and its efficiency for different wave current interaction conditions generally there is a good match between lab conditions and those observed in tidal energy sites where wave peaks occur between 0 1 hz 0 3 hz and ti from 12 to 16 hashemi et al 2015 perez et al 2020 thiébaut et al 2020 the energy spectra demonstrated that the swt method successfully removed the energy peak when applied to a range of wave conditions however the results depicted in fig 8 suggest the technique is more suitable for lower frequency wave conditions and works best when a clear pronounced energy peak is present in the spectrum in runs performed at high wave frequencies wave breaking occurred so that the surface elevation deviated from the classic sinusoidal shape consequently energy was spread across a larger frequency band and the spectra did not show a pronounced peak as encountered for low frequency waves hence the swt technique was not as successful in identifying peak frequencies in the time frequency plane and removing the orbital motion similar observations were made with the linear wave theory decomposition technique as shown in fig 6 in addition such waves are short and its induced orbital motion is not expected to affect deep parts of the water column for instance a towing speed of 1 5 m s and frequency of 0 8 hz which was the lowest frequency when waves breaking occurred at this speed means a scaled up encounter frequency of 0 3 hz assuming linear wave theory as a first order approximation and estimating the wavelength with l g t 2 2 π leads to a wavelength of 17 68 m such wavelength and frequencies does not significantly enhance oscillations at mid water column in a 34 m deep site as the measurement station discussed here in fact the reference site banks strait presents mean and maximum wave frequencies of 0 11 and 0 38 hz and mean and maximum wave heights of 1 7 m and 5 2 m respectively perez et al 2020 implying that the technique should be successful in most conditions observed at the site comparison of results obtained from the swt technique at 1 m s and 1 5 m s prove that the method can still lead to some level of inaccuracy of turbulence intensities however the turbulence intensity estimates are considerably improved when compared to the values obtained prior to the decomposition 4 5 limitations of the linear wave theory technique applied to field data despite the fact the energy peaks could not be entirely removed by the linear wave theory observation of the velocity time series obtained from the linear wave theory technique applied to the secondary dataset supplementary material and that depicted in fig 6 shows that the estimated orbital velocities agree well this result suggests that the remaining low frequency velocity fluctuations are likely a result of collapsing adjacent jets introduced by the grid and as previously discussed cause an increase of the oscillatory motion the application of the linear wave theory technique to data obtained from adcp field deployments still poses a challenge when compared to the swt method turbulence parameters estimates from adcp measurements require the data to be recorded in beam velocities last generation instruments include four 25 slanted beams and one vertical beam due to the adcp beam geometry bins sampled by opposing beams are at a considerable distance from each other and are not in phase with the pressure signal in that case the method would require a time shift of the pressure signal in the time frequency domain considering respective wave celerity which considerably increases the complexity of the method this would not represent a significant issue in datasets collected with advs or the vertical beam only as horizontal and vertical velocities are obtained directly instead of estimated from diverging beams in addition to the challenges posed by instrument geometry the application of the linear wave theory technique is limited by the possible nonlinearity present in prospective tidal energy sites even though linear wave theory has been previously adopted in tidal energy studies nonlinearity has been pointed as a frequent characteristic of wave climates in prospective tidal sites for instance filipot et al 2015 used linear wave theory to perform wave turbulence decomposition however their method is limited to the frequency plan and does not provide a decomposed velocity time series hence it would not allow for example for the estimation of integral length scales using the temporal autocorrelation function as performed by bouferrouk et al 2016 and mccaffrey et al 2015 hashemi et al 2015 investigated the effects of wave current interaction on tidal resource using a high resolution coupled wave tide model and found that in the absence of a wave tide model linear wave theory can be used as an approximation to estimate wave orbital velocity nonetheless hashemi et al 2015 also point out the highly nonlinear nature of wave current interaction possible nonlinearity is also considered by venugopal et al 2018 and lewis et al 2014 who highlight that waves may propagate at an angle to tidal current direction and hence present high nonlinearity the assumption of conditions where linear wave theory can be applied is therefore limited and this represents a disadvantage when compared to the more versatile swt method such limitations suggest that the linear wave theory decomposing technique can only be applied to specific datasets and should be used with caution 5 conclusions two wave turbulence decomposition techniques have been applied to laboratory data representing various turbulence intensities anisotropy ratios and wave frequencies the experimental set up includes a turbulence generator grid and a wave maker and the boundary conditions were chosen to reproduce wave turbulence interactions observed in the field and can be used to test the performance of tidal turbines under wave turbulence interaction application of these methods to varying flow conditions allowed for the evaluation of the flexibility and its efficiency of each technique in different wave climates both decomposition techniques were found to be less effective in high frequency wave fields or when energy is spread across a broader frequency band however the swt method demonstrated to be more versatile and performs with less limitations compared to the linear wave theory method the findings of this work are promising to drive forward discussions regarding wave turbulence decomposition amongst the tidal energy community and present important information for the implementation of guidelines addressing wave current interactions credit authorship contribution statement

until the larger frequent itemset can t be found then we get the human factors cause chain of ship accidents the case study shows that the above research method is effective the above research methods provide new theoretical and technical means for excavating the cause chain of ship accidents and preventing ship traffic accidents keywords ship accident human factor reason shel model multidimensional association rule algorithm 1 introduction water transportation has the advantages of large capacity less investment and low cost so the water transportation in the development of the national economy has a very important strategic position ship as the main water transport vehicle has been playing an increasing significant part in the transportation chain the rapid development of the water transportation has also put forward a very high request to the performance of the ship although maritime safety are improved in an comprehensive way thanks to the rapid development of modern technology and its application on the industry ship accident still break out occasionally however ship accidents caused by improper operation of equipment or incorrect judgment of the ship s navigation environment have become an important part of water traffic accidents according to the international maritime organization imo statistics maritime navigation accidents directly or indirectly caused by human factors take up more than 80 percent of the total accidents amountimo 1997 imo assembly resolution 1999 it can be seen that research on the relationship between ship related equipment ship navigation environment and the factors related to people in the daily organization management rules of ships and possible ship accidents has become an important way to analyze the causes of ship accidents to this end domestic and foreign scholars have put a lot of effort in this area and achieved some research results m sakaide s mizutani h matsumoto et al 2013 analyze background human factors on collision and aground accidents of fishing boats and recreational fishing boats in three major bays in japan tokyo bay ise bay osaka bay these background human factors are analyzed on the basis of the m shel model using this analysis it is found that these three major bays have background human factors which are significantly different from each other this paper proposes useful analyze results to discuss for prevention marine accidents and marine safety management system arsham mazaheri et al 2015 present study of accident reports and incident databases the objective was to find the type of knowledge that can be extracted from such sources and discuss the usability of accident and incident reports for evidence based risk modeling a new version of human factors analysis and classification system hfacs is introduced as a framework to review the accident reports accident reports are shown as a reliable source of evidence to extract the most significant contributing factors in the events liu gang 2012 puts human error and human ship management and environment into the relationship between the shel model and in order to make a detailed analysis of human errors in the maritime accident 128 cases of typical human errors caused ship collision accidents were analyzed and the bayesian network structure of accident cause was built according to driver s cognitive behavior formation process apriori algorithm and java program were employed to identify frequent occurrence human error and the accident causation chain was formed li et al 2014 in summary the present study on ship accidents caused by human factors is mostly focused on the analysis of relationship between people and the four aspects of people ship environment and software in the meantime few attentions are paid to the formation process of accidents affecting human factors which is difficult to fundamentally find the root cause of the accident therefore this paper is devoted to finding the causation chain consisting of human factors in ship accident describing the forming process of accident and defining the human factors accident causal chain means an accident occurs when multiple factors are linked together like a chain this paper will construct an accident causal chain describe the accident formation process and define the human factors in each process as long as the prevention of accidents is focused on preventing the formation of causal chains that is taking appropriate preventive measures for human factors at a certain stage the chain can be cut off and the accident rate can be effectively reduced firstly a human causation factor index for ship accident was established and forming process of existing ship accident was defined on the basis of which an initial ship accident dataset was built secondly a multidimensional association rules algorithm incorporated with reason model and the classic association rules algorithm was proposed based on the new algorithm datamining was conducted on the accident record to find the causation chain of human factors of ship accident the result of this research can be reference for the maritime safety authorities to take measures on certain human factors to improve navigation safety with satisfactory efficiency and efficacy 2 human factors index system of ship navigation risk based on reason shel model 2 1 reason model reason model was first proposed by james reason 1990 in human error in 1990 the inherent logic is that accident promoting factors and defects of the organization are longstanding and self evolving these factors and defects do not certainly lead to unsafe events but only when multiple levels of defects in an accident are triggered by a promoting factor simultaneously or sequentially which results in occurrence of unsafe events due to the failure of multi level blocking barriers the model divides accident into five levels which are organizational factors organizational prevention and supervision the premise of unsafe acts unsafe acts and inadequate defense respectively as fig 1 illustrates 2 2 shel model the shel model was first proposed by edwards in 1972 and then modified by hawkins frank 1993 the name of the model is composed of the first letter of the four elements software hardware environment and liveware liveware is the core element liveware software liveware hardware liveware environment and liveware liveware are four working interface of the model fig 2 shel model considers that liveware is the center of the model and the interactions between liveware and other liveware in the system system s software system s internal and external environment as well as system s hardware constitute a system the model emphasizes that the cause of the accident should be obtained on the basis of investigation on the relationships between human and other elements at present the shel model is widely used in many fields and it is a classic framework for researching human factors 2 3 establish the human factors index system of ship accident to establish the human factor index system this paper incorporates the two models aforementioned above the defects in reason model is defined and classified according to the interfaces of shel model in order to analyze accident systematically and comprehensive based on the idea a reason shel human causation factor model was proposed as fig 3 indicates obviously the reason shel model inherits the advantages of the reason model and the shel model which can classify and manage human factors and hierarchically manage the relationship between human factors reason model has two functions in accident analysis prevention respectively firstly in accident analysis reason model can be applied to perform systematic analysis on accident to acquire an insight of accident cause secondly it can also be introduced in accident prevention to obtain defects in different stages of accident prevention which can be of great value to take precise accident precautions to reduce accident rate due to the importance of human factors in the cause of maritime accidents the international maritime organization adopted resolution a884 21 at the 21st congress supplemented and revised a849 20 resolution added a guide to investigating human factors in maritime accidents and defined the meaning of the factors of human error the imo human factors and classifications are based on the reason s general error model gems the hawkins shel model and the reason s hybrid model hybridmodel the model not only gives the mechanism of human error but also gives the way to collect and organize human factors drawing on the well known maritime analysis database system jmaia and taic and referring to the imo recommended human error classification method consider the coordination relationship between people hardware software and environment emphasized by the shel model the human factors of ship accidents are defined and classified according to the reason shel model the results are shown in table 1 3 human causation factors chain of ship accidents the main content of this section is to combine reason model and the classic association rules algorithm to design multidimensional association rules algorithm and apply it to mine the human causation factors chain of ship accidents 3 1 multidimensional association rules algorithm association rule algorithm was first proposed by r agrawal et al 1993 in 1993 in order to investigate the relationships among items in the customer transaction data this association rules algorithm belongs to a single dimension single layer and boolean association rules and the apriori algorithm is one of the classical algorithms assuming item set i i 1 i 2 i m and data and database transactions are represented as d and t respectively the t i and d t 1 t 2 t n according to the above definition the related concepts and definitions of the apriori algorithm are given as follows zheng 2011 1 support of the item set assuming x is an item set sup x represents the number of x contained in d the support of the item set can be defined as follow 1 s u p p o r t x p x s u p x d 2 association rules assuming two item sets x and y association rules between x and y can be described by x y where the x i y i and x y x is known as left hand side and y is known as right hand side the strength of association rules is represented by the support and confidence level 3 the support of association rules 2 s u p p o r t x y p x y s u p x y d minimum support represents the lowest importance of the data set in a statistical sense this value is a threshold value of the support measure defined by the user 4 frequent itemset and infrequent itemset if support x minimum support then x is fequent itemset on the other hand x is infrequent itemset apriori algorithm is widely used in many disciplines it is mainly used to mine the correlations between data items and to explore the value of information in the decision making process apriori algorithm flowchart is shown in fig 4 according to the dimension of the correlation rule the association rules can be classified into single dimension and multi dimensions rules li 2010 the single dimension association rule contains only one kind of data items such like sport basketball fx only contains the dimension of sport multidimensional association rules contain two kinds or more of data items such as height 180 190 sport basketball contains dimensions height and sport in this paper multidimensioonal association rules algorithm was introduce and incorporated with reason model since the concept of multidimensional association rules algorithm dimension is represented by four levels of reason model the dimension of multidimensional association rules algorithm used in this paper is 4 the item sets of multidimensional association rule algorithm are shown in table 2 the reason model not only contains the reaction chain of the accident itself but also points out that all levels exist defects that can cause accidents therefore the essence of the data mining of association rules of ship accidents is to find out the relationship between the four pieces of cheese and vulnerability therefore we use inter dimensional association rules algorithm which is a kind of multidimensional association rules to analyze the causes of the accidents and the causation chain obtained should contain the four dimensions of the reason model here a flowchart of the designed multidimensional association rules algorithm is illustrated and the minimum support is set as 0 2 the flowchart is shown in fig 5 according to the fig 5 the maximal frequent item set of the example is a 1 b 1 c 1 d 2 3 2 ship accidents database the human factors index set of ship navigation risk is coded by using 0 1 binary coding method each human factors are coded according to formula 3 and shown in table 1 3 u i code 2 n i n is the total number i is serial number whether or not a cause occurred can be described by using formula 4 the causes of an accident can be described by formula 5 4 u i 1 s t a n d s f o r t h e h u m a n f a c t o r o c c u r 0 s t a n d s f o r t h e h u m a n f a c t o r n o t o c c u r 5 a c o d e i 1 n u i 2 n i according to the above analysis methods the authors can obtain the causes of the ship accidents by reviewing the investigation report on water traffic accident of maritime safety administration maritime safety administration of the people s republic of china 2016 shen zhen maritime safety administration shen zhen maritime safety administration of the people s republic of china 2015 and xia men maritime safety administration xia men maritime safety administration of the people s republic of china 2014 the causes of the ship accident are coded to obtain the accident causing code on the basis of which the initial database of ship accidents is finally established table 3 indicates the partial content of the database 3 3 human factors causation chain of ship accidents the c language programming is used to accomplish the designed multidimensional association rules algorithm which is used to analyze the accidents database to obtain the maximal frequent item sets the authors set the minimum support 0 225 through trial and interviews with expert in the field then the multi dimensional association rule algorithm is applied to mine the human factors of ship accidents to get the maximal frequent item sets the outcome of which is human factors causation chain of ship accidents the result of maximal frequent item sets of human factors is shown in fig 6 in fig 6 the four levels of the reason model are represented on the horizontal axis meanwhile four interfaces of the shel model which are l l l s l h and l e are represented on the vertical axis the authors use lines to link up each causation chain which can be very intuitive to present the results in fig 6 which contains 25 human factor causation chains of ship accidents the figured out causes in fig 6 are the ones that should be focused on prevention which can effectively prevent the occurrence of accidents according to fig 6 the authors also can find that the causes are more concentrated in l l and l s therefore these two interfaces should be paid more attention when perform accident prevention 3 4 correctness verification of the cause chain based on jaccard coefficient jaccard coefficient is mainly used to calculate the similarity between the boolean type individuals the coefficient is shown in formula 6 6 j a c c a r d x y x y x y the paper sets the causation chains of ship accidents as x x 1 x 2 x n where x i stands for one of the cause chain i 1 2 n and x i a a b b c c d d and this paper also set the causes of ship accidents as z z 1 z 2 z m where z k stands for the causes of an accident k 1 2 m therefore z k can be represented by formula 7 and u a u b u c u d are represented by formula 4 7 z k a 1 m u a a a b 1 n u b b b c 1 p u c c c d 1 q u d d d the authors use formula 6 to verify the correctness of the causation chain the verification algorithm flowchart is shown in fig 7 and the specific verification algorithm steps are as follows 1 standardization of z k 8 y i z k x i 2 use formula 6 to calculate the jaccard similarity coefficient j i of x i and y i 3 then set i i 1 if i n repeat steps 1 2 repeat traversing x 1 x 2 x n 4 if i n end j j 1 j 2 j n and i 1 2 n 5 repeat traversing j i if there is any j i 1 the causation chains are proved to be correct the authors can use the above algorithm to verify the correctness of the causation chain the specific verification examples are as follows the paper set oriental star ferry capsized incident on behalf of the chinese inland river ship accident as an example the causes coding of the incident is 111100000010000010000110100010111010 and z k a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 b 1 b 7 c 5 c 6 c 8 d 2 d 4 d 5 d 6 d 8 is obtained by formula 7 according to the specific verification algorithm j j 1 j 2 j 25 is obtained for example the intersection of z k and x 2 a 2 b 1 c 6 d 7 is calculated by formula 8 the intersection is shown as follows y 2 z k x 2 a 2 b 1 c 6 the jaccard similarity coefficient of x 2 and y 2 is calculated by formula 6 the similarity coefficient is shown as follows j a c c a r d x 2 y 2 3 4 0 75 according to the result human factors causes of oriental star ferry capsized accident and the human factors causation chains of ship accidents have seven perfectly matched results which are shown in table 4 according to the characteristics of reason model the accident causes can be analyzed from the level of inadequate defense to the level of organizational factors according to the table 5 the causes of the east star passenger liner accident are as follows 1 at the stage of the unsafe acts the main causes are loss the awareness of hazardous environments improper equipment condition monitoring miscalculations and improper command execution 2 at the stage of the premise of unsafe acts the main causes are lack of skill in using equipment and not familiar with the environment 3 at the stage of the organizational prevention and supervision the main causes is improper regulation and supervision 4 at the stage of the organizational factors the main causes are low administrative efficiency and improper selection and training of employees the paper set shenzhen 4 12 jinlong 81 stranding accident which represents a ship accident in a coastal port as an example the container ship accident occurred in the western waters of shenzhen city and the causes coding of the incident is 010000110010000000001000100000110010 and z k a 2 a 7 a 8 b 1 c 4 c 8 d 4 d 5 d 8 is obtained by formula 9 according to the specific verification algorithm j j 1 j 2 j 25 is obtained for example the intersection of z k and x 2 a 2 b 1 c 6 d 7 is calculated by formula 10 the intersection is shown as follows y 2 z k x 2 a 2 b 1 the jaccard similarity coefficient of x 2 and y 2 is calculated by formula 6 the similarity coefficient is shown as follows j a c c a r d x 2 y 2 2

21314,in recent years caisson foundations are being increasingly used as alternative foundations for supporting offshore renewable energy structures in general caisson foundations for offshore wind turbines owts are subjected to combined loadings including lateral vertical and overturning moments to guarantee the normal operation of owts and reduce uncertainty in the design of owt foundations the response to horizontal loading must be accurately estimated this paper presents a closed form model to estimate the lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations for owts to understand the behaviour of caisson foundations under lateral loading and to derive the necessary parameters and relationships to build the closed form model a series of laboratory tests both 1g and centrifuge as well as numerical simulations were conducted field and laboratory data from the published literature were used to validate the proposed model the proposed solution has shown to provide a better estimate of the lateral bearing capacity of caissons compared to existing models the model is capable of predicting the lateral bearing capacity of caissons with aspect ratios less than or equal to 1 0 in both sandy and silty soils additionally the method takes into account the effect of vertical loading on the lateral bearing capacity keywords caisson foundations lateral load physical modelling numerical simulations 1 introduction caisson foundations often referred to as skirted or bucket foundations are novel and cost effective foundations that have been recently considered for supporting offshore wind turbines in a number of projects oh et al 2018 byrne and houlsby 2003 klinkvort et al 2019 these foundations can be described as upturned circular skirted foundations embedded into the seabed using a pressure difference within the caisson cavity generated by creating suction at the top to drive the caisson into the seabed harireche et al 2013 2014 tran et al 2007 mehravar et al 2017 caissons with aspect ratios i e length l to diameter d or l d ratios as high as 5 are often designed for use as anchors for clay sites houlsby and byrne 2005 whereas lower aspect ratios are appropriate for installations in sand villalobos et al 2004 due to their easy installation process shallow caisson foundations with small aspect ratios i e l d 1 are already being used or considered for supporting offshore structures houlsby et al 2005 chen 2013 in general foundations for offshore wind turbines including caissons are subjected to a variety of loading arrangements vertical horizontal and moment loads or combinations of all these mehravar et al 2016 caisson foundations when used as mono buckets to support offshore wind turbine experience significant lateral loading and overturning moments chen 2013 a key factor to ensure safe operation of offshore wind turbines is to predict the bearing capacity of the supporting caisson foundations under lateral loading mehravar et al 2016 existing methods for predicting the lateral load resistance of caisson foundations in sand are mainly based on analytical models developed using data from experiments byrne and houlsby 2003 villalobos 2007 or finite element fe analysis zhu et al 2014 achmus et al 2013 fe analysis has been used to predict the bearing capacity of caisson foundations in sandy soils achmus et al 2013 bagheri et al 2017 ahmed and hawlader 2015 deb and singh 2018 however the application of fe to estimate the behaviour of a foundation is difficult due to the large number of influencing parameters which often results in computationally expensive models xiao et al 2011 on the other hand analytical models were developed to evaluate the lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations byrne and houlsby 2003 zhu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 villalobos 2006 however these models suffer from a number of restrictions e g they are valid for a limited range of l d ratios or they do not provide accurate predictions when the caissons are subjected to vertical loading therefore in this paper an analytical solution to estimate the lateral bearing capacity of caissons as monopod foundations for owts in sandy soils assuming fully drained conditions is proposed to overcome the above limitations to develop and assess the validity of the proposed solution a series of laboratory tests and numerical simulations using three dimensional 3d fe under monotonic loading conditions were carried out the proposed model was calibrated based on the results of physical tests obtained from a series of 1g small scale laboratory experiments as well as centrifuge tests the predictions of the proposed model were compared against published data for large scale experiments as well as other existing analytical models the paper initially summarises existing analytical methods and presents a novel analytical model for predicting the ultimate lateral capacity of caisson foundations in sand subsequently the physical model tests and numerical analyses used to infer the pressure distribution along the caisson skirt and to identify the location of the rotational point are presented the proposed analytical method is then validated against both lab and field test results and its predictions are compared against those analytical models proposed by byrne and houlsby 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 finally the proposed model is used to identify the effect of vertical load on the lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations in cohesionless soils 2 analytical solution 2 1 existing analytical solutions analytical models to determine the ultimate lateral capacity of caisson foundations installed in sand are provided by byrne and houlsby 2003 villalobos villalobos jara 2006 zhu et al 2014 and achmus et al 2013 among others of these four models the first two are in the form of practical equations which can be readily adopted by practitioners for a quick estimation of the capacity the works by zhu et al 2014 and achmus et al 2013 however require determination of a relatively large number of parameters and involve tedious calculations therefore in this paper we will only directly compare our models to those presented by byrne and houlsby 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 these models are based on best fit results from small scale laboratory model tests the equations derived by byrne and houlsby 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 are detailed below for a caisson with l d 1 the ultimate lateral load capacity h u with a force eccentricity e is estimated by byrne and houlsby 2003 as 1 h u f 1 f 2 k 1 v f 3 w d e where w is the buoyant weight of the soil plug inside the caisson v is the vertical load on the caisson which is taken as the total buoyant weight of the caisson foundation f 1 3 26 f 2 1 073 and f 3 0 71 are empirical factors obtained by fitting the ultimate capacity results of caissons in small scale 1g model tests and k is equal to e d villalobos villalobos jara 2006 proposed the following equation to estimate the lateral load capacity of a caisson foundation with l d 1 2 h u 2 r γ k 3 l 3 2 z m 3 f h l f f v r e where r is the caisson radius k is the difference between the passive and active lateral earth pressure coefficients i e k k p k a e is the force eccentricity z m is the depth of the point of rotation measured from seabed level and 3 f h σ v tan φ π r 2 4 f f v k a k p l z m 2 z m 2 l k 2 z m l f v 5 f v 2 r γ l tan δ k 2 z m l where σ v is the vertical effective stress and k a and k p are rankine s active and passive lateral earth pressure coefficients respectively it is worth mentioning that the method proposed by villalobos villalobos jara 2006 does not consider the vertical load directly whereas the vertical load is embedded in the equation proposed by byrne and houlsby 2003 2 2 proposed method taking advantage of force equilibrium the proposed analytical method determines the ultimate limit state uls of caisson foundations rankine s theory for lateral earth pressure in active and passive conditions was used in the analyses the developed relationships are simple easy to use and do not require lengthy calculations the force equilibrium model for embedded caissons has been established in previous studies zhu et al 2014 villalobos 2006 yang et al 2018 based on the distribution of the lateral earth pressure along the skirt the distributed forces adopted by the above studies are graphically shown in fig 1 in all of these studies earth pressure acting on the skirt included both active and passive pressure the studies showed that the pressure in the left hand side fig 1a b and 1c increases with increasing depth and reaches a maximum pressure in the skirt tip on the other hand the maximum pressure in the right hand side fig 1a b and 1c is zero at the ground level and increases with increasing depth until a maximum value is reached at a point on the same level as the rotation point the lateral soil pressure acting on the inner surface of the skirt was neglected by villalobos villalobos jara 2006 fig 1a and zhu et al 2014 fig 1b but was considered by yang et al 2018 fig 1c fig 2 depicts the external forces considered in this study applied to both the inner and outer surfaces of a caisson due to lateral earth pressure it can be seen that the passive earth pressure acting on the left hand side inner surface as well as that acting on the lower part of the right hand side outer surface of the caisson have been ignored due to their relatively small contributions to the overall lateral resistance of the foundation in addition similar to the above studies a rotating point rp has been assumed as shown in fig 2 to calculate the earth pressure numerical analyses reported later on in this paper were used to validate the above assumptions and determine the position of the rp see fig 11 for now the vertical distance between the rp and the caisson lid will be referred to as x as shown in fig 2 the pressure distributions acting on the outer surface of the caisson were based on the studies mentioned above and confirmed by numerical modelling results see figs 12 and 13 usually caisson foundations have large diameters and the weight of the soil inside the caissons has a significant effect on their stability under lateral loading therefore the weight of the soil was considered in the proposed model zhu et al 2014 assumed that 80 of the enclosed soil plug moves with the caisson and as a result does not interact with the caisson the end bearing stresses around the caisson rim are not included in the total stresses similar to previous studies the caisson is considered to be rigid under lateral loading lombardi et al 2017 the proposed model in this study is fundamentally determined by the angle of internal friction φ soil unit weight γ caisson diameter d and caisson length l according to prasad and chari 1999 the passive soil pressure p z at a depth z below the ground level is given by 6 p z s f φ γ z the shape factor s proposed by prasad and chari 1999 is adopted in this study the function f φ represents rankine s passive earth pressure coefficient k p if l o g p z γ z is plotted against tan φ it can be seen that the relationship is linear as shown in fig 3 the straight line equation is given by 7 l o g p z γ z α tan φ β equation 7 can be re arranged to give the maximum passive earth pressure at a depth of λ x see fig 2 8 p z 10 α tan φ β γ λ x where α and β are coefficients obtained from fig 3 a series of fe simulations see section 5 were conducted for caissons with l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 and the results were used to generate the necessary data to determine the coefficients the obtained values of α and β are 1 3 and 0 3 respectively the ultimate bearing capacity of the rigid caisson can be obtained based on moment equilibrium if the moment of all forces is taken about the point of rotation in fig 2 the maximum lateral load h m a x can be obtained as 9 h m a x k n 1 e x p 1 x 1 2 3 λ p 2 2 3 x 1 λ 2 p 3 l x 2 2 3 p 4 l x d w d 2 v d 2 where 10 w w s 2 3 of the buoyant weight of the soil plug inside the caisson w t buoyant weight of the tower w c buoyant weight of the caisson 11 p 1 1 2 p z λ x 12 p 2 1 2 p z x p 1 13 p 3 p z l x 14 p 4 0 4 p 3 where x ω l and λ is a coefficient as shown in fig 2 the coefficient of 0 4 in eq 14 is based on the results of the fe simulations detailed in section 5 based on the experimental and numerical results presented later on in this paper the ultimate lateral load may be considered as 80 of the maximum lateral load i e h u 0 8 h m a x 3 physical modelling 3 1 description of the models and the soil two sets of experiments 1g and centrifuge tests were conducted to generate the necessary evidence and data to calibrate and validate the proposed analytical model both sets of experiments had common aspects in terms of the geometry of the model caisson and some specific characteristics which are outlined in the following paragraphs the caisson specimens were fabricated from a smooth stainless steel tube with a wall thickness t of 1 2 mm in the 1 g tests and 1 5 mm in the centrifuge tests the external diameter d of the caisson shaft was 75 mm a factor of 70 was chosen to scale the dimensions of the caissons based on the size of the test rig and the capacity of the loading system in the 1 g tests in order to model the tower a vertical rod with a total height of 230 mm and a diameter of 25 mm was connected to a 5 mm thick circular cap attached to the top surface of the caisson on the other hand a square section stainless steel bar 225 mm long 20 mm 20 mm section was used in the centrifuge tests two embedment length to caisson diameter ratios l d of 0 5 and 1 0 were studied under 1g conditions the centrifuge test was performed only on a model with an l d ratio of 1 0 table 1 two types of sand were used in the tests silica sand redhill sand and hst95 congleton sand redhill sand was used in the 1g tests with two relative densities of 25 and 50 hst95 with a relative density of 50 was used in the centrifuge test the particle size distributions for the two sands are shown in fig 4 a summary of the sand properties are shown in table 2 all tests were carried out in dry sand conditions 3 2 test rig preparation and loading system for 1g experiments tests were conducted under 1g in a strong cylindrical container made of acrylic glass the container which had an inner diameter d of 550 mm a thickness of 30 mm and a height h of 400 mm was filled with redhill 110 sand fig 5 a 100 mm thick layer of gravel was placed uniformly on the base of the tank to provide a stiff layer underneath the sand layer for the experiments with loose sand d r 25 the soil was placed in layers of 50 mm thickness up to a height of 400 mm from the base of the container the medium dense sand was also placed in layers of 50 mm thickness but a vibration compactor was used to achieve a relative density of 50 the model caissons were installed in dry sand by pushing rather than by suction at a rate of 0 1 mm s until the lid made complete contact with the soil the pushing process was carried out very gently to avoid any major disruption to the soil density it is inconclusive whether the installation process affects capacity villalobos jara 2006 zhu et al 2012 further research is required to clearly understand the effect of suction on the short and long term performance similar to other studies zhu et al 2012 cox et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 installation by pushing was used in this study for simplicity to create a moment m in all models a horizontal load h was applied using an electric actuator at the height of 220 mm above the cap of the caisson this gave an eccentricity ratio i e m h d equal to 2 9 which corresponds to tall wind turbine towers 100 m a load cell was attached to the actuator to measure the applied force the rotation of the foundation was recorded by an inclinometer sensor placed on the top of the tower as shown in fig 5 it is important to keep the testing conditions especially the relative densities of the sand consistent in order to make the results as comparable as possible bang et al 2011 faizi et al 2019 therefore prior to each test the cylindrical container was emptied and refilled using the pluviation system 3 3 test rig preparation and loading system for the centrifuge experiment a strong cylindrical container with d h 500 mm was filled with sand up to a height of 440 mm fig 5 a centrifuge test was conducted using hst95 congleton sand with a relative density of approximately 50 a number of scaling criteria were applied for the physical model to represent the prototype based on the basic scaling law of centrifuge modelling a uniform acceleration field is assumed to be applied to the model by selecting an effective centrifuge radius which helps to minimise the scaling errors due to the nonlinear stress distribution and the difficulty of representing sufficient detail in the model a caisson model with an aspect ratio of approximately 1 0 was used in the test which was performed at 70g i e an acceleration scaling factor n 70 a horizontal load was applied at a rate of 0 1 mm s and at an eccentricity e of 212 mm two linear variable differential transformers lvdts were used to measure the tilt of the caisson in the centrifuge test it should be noted that the model represents a caisson with a diameter of 5 25 m and a length of 5 1 m 4 test results for both the experimental and fe results the ultimate lateral load was determined using the tangent intersection method mansur and kaufman 1958 as shown in fig 6 using this method two lines are drawn tangential to the initial and final parts of the load rotation curve and the load corresponding to the intersection point of these two lines is taken as h u in fig 6 θ u and θ m a x are the rotations corresponding to h u and h m a x respectively only the results of the 1g tests are presented in this section the centrifuge test results are presented and compared with the fe results in section 5 figs 7 and 8 present the load rotation curves for tests c1 c2 and c3 the caisson performance under lateral loading was found to be dependent on soil density and caisson aspect ratio as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 the ultimate lateral capacities obtained by model caissons c1 and c2 which were both installed in loose sand but had aspect ratios of 0 5 and 1 0 respectively were 0 85 and 3 7 n respectively this result was to be expected because model caisson c2 had longer caisson length and consequently the passive resistance was mobilised on a larger area of the foundation fig 8 shows that increasing the soil density from 25 to 50 results in a significant increase from 3 7 to 5 5 n in the lateral bearing capacity this occurs because of the increase in both the caisson surface to sand interface friction and the soil shear resistance as the two factors increase with the increase in soil density due to the larger internal friction angle φ see table 3 the strength and stiffness of the surrounding soil and thereby the lateral bearing capacity are all expected to increase 5 numerical modelling in order to identify the position of the rotation point and validate the lateral pressure distribution used in the proposed analytical model a 3d fe model of the caisson was developed using the commercial software abaqus an fe domain with the dimensions 9 d 4 5 d 4 d length width and height respectively was used to avoid boundary effects to model the sand behaviour a drucker prager material model assuming an elastic perfectly plastic behaviour was used together with the material parameters β and d the terms β and d represent the parameters of the material model which can be calculated indirectly using the parameters of the mohr coulomb model derived from ciampi ciampi and ma 1997 an associated flow rule assuming the collapse load is same as the limit load was assumed in the fe modelling to replicate as closely as possible the limit equilibrium analysis zouain et al 2007 taking advantage of symmetry only one half of the problem was modelled fig 9 shows a semi cylindrical section through a diametrical plane of model caisson c4 a relatively fine mesh was used in the regions near the caisson soil interface whereas a coarser mesh was used further away in the fe analyses the foundations were modelled as wished in place assuming that installation effects have a negligible impact on the bearing capacity the initial stress in the soil prior to loading was generated using a lateral earth pressure coefficient k 0 1 sin φ to simulate the behaviour of the caisson under lateral loading a force controlled fe model was created careful attention was paid to modelling the interaction of the caisson elements with the surrounding soil a contact pair interface captures the nonlinear behaviour in the soil caisson interface in the radial direction allow separation contact behaviour was assumed the small sliding tracking approach in abaqus was employed for the contact between the soil and the caisson the soil and the caisson were modelled using the c3d8r solid homogeneous elements available in abaqus standard element library these are 8 noded linear brick elements with reduced integration and hourglass control the caisson outer surface was chosen as a master surface and the soil surface in contact with the caisson was chosen as a slave surface the frictional force between these surfaces is dependent on a coefficient of friction μ in the numerical simulations presented here the friction coefficient was calculated using μ tan δ where δ is the interface friction angle which was assumed to be δ 2 3 φ ahmed and hawlader 2016 nasr 2013 the caissons were considered as linear elastic materials e 200 gpa a constant elastic modulus was considered for the sand e 10 mpa in the 1 g tests and e 33 mpa for the centrifuge tests to validate the fe model the centrifuge experiment was simulated using the above assumptions fig 10 compares the experimental and fe load rotation curves of the caisson the rotation was measured at the centre of the lid it can be seen that the fe model accurately captured the behaviour of the caisson and the supporting ground under lateral loading using the results of the validated fe model the depth of the rotation point rp at ultimate load was determined to be at approximately 0 8 of the skirt length 0 8 corresponds to ω in fig 2 this is shown in fig 11 it is worth mentioning that at the early stages of loading the caisson rp was located at the centre line of the caisson as the horizontal load was increased the rp moved to the right until it reached the right hand side of the caisson at the ultimate load see fig 11 this was also observed by zhu et al 2011 the fe results were also used to validate the proposed lateral earth pressure distribution acting on the caisson at ultimate lateral load fig 12 shows the contour lines of horizontal stresses s 11 acting on the caisson body it can be seen that the fe predicted soil pressure distribution surrounding the caisson matches that proposed in fig 2 from fig 12 it can be observed that the maximum soil pressure takes place close to the skirt tip inner surface right side the pressure at this point is 40 higher than the pressure surrounding the caisson tip outer surface left side the outer surfaces of the caisson were examined numerically to quantify the magnitude of the stresses acting along the caisson shaft fig 13 depicts the evolution of the passive horizontal stress at failure acting on the outer surface of the caisson it can be observed from fig 13 that the position of the maximum passive horizontal stress moves downwards with increased loading fig 13 shows that the passive soil pressure acting on the outer surface of the caisson increases with increasing depth up to 0 85 x where x the depth of the rotation point and 0 85 corresponds to λ in fig 2 the passive pressure then decreases approximately linearly until it reduces to approximately zero at the level of the rotation point below that level the passive soil pressure is neglected due to its small impact on the other hand the soil pressure around the caisson s left hand side outer surface increases approximately linearly from zero to a maximum value at the tip of the caisson at failure the maximum pressure around the caisson s left hand side outer surface is almost equal to the maximum pressure around the caisson s right hand side outer surface 6 comparison of ultimate capacities many existing analytical models were validated using test results of small scale caissons with a limited range of aspect ratios the proposed analytical model was validated using the experimental results reported in this study as well as field and laboratory results from the published literature see table 3 the field tests used to validate the proposed analytical model were conducted at sandy haven houlsby and byrne 2000 and frederikshavn houlsby et al 2005 table 3 gives the test parameters for the two sites which comprised predominantly sandy soil the caisson at the sandy haven site had a diameter of 4 m and a skirt length of 2 5 m and was installed in medium to dense sand the horizontal load was applied at a height of 14 5 m above the ground surface the caisson tested at the frederikshavn site which had a diameter of 2 m and a skirt length of 2 m was installed in dense sand the foundation was subjected to horizontal loading at a height of 17 4 m above the ground surface together with a constant vertical load of 37 3 kn the ultimate capacities for the two field tests see table 3 were obtained from the moment rotation curves using the tangent method described in fig 6 table 3 also gives details of the lab tests reported by foglia et al foglia 2011 zhu et al 2011 zhu et al 2012 and zhang et al 2010 which were all used to validate the proposed analytical model and compare its predictions with those of the models proposed by byrne and houlsby byrne et al 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 from table 3 it can be seen that the proposed model provides a good estimate of the lateral bearing capacity for caissons with different embedment depths and soil densities the proposed analytical model is statistically the best model among the three evaluated models with a mean experimental to predicted ratio of 0 98 and a standard deviation of 0 17 byrne and houlsby s byrne et al 2003 model significantly overestimated the lateral bearing capacity with a mean experimental to predicted ratio of 0 72 moreover byrne and houlsby s byrne et al 2003 model had a standard deviation of 0 36 reflecting a significant scatter of the model predictions villalobos villalobos jara 2006 model gave conservative predictions with a mean experimental to predicted ratio of 1 17 however with a standard deviation of 0 36 this model also had a significant scatter of its predictions from the results presented in table 3 and the above statistical analysis the benefits of using the proposed analytical model to predict the lateral capacity of caisson foundations in sandy soil with the assumption of drained conditions are evident byrne and houlsby s byrne and houlsby 2003 model provides satisfactory predictions for caissons with l d 1 similarly the model proposed by villalobos villalobos jara 2006 performs satisfactorily when no vertical load is applied on the caisson however the proposed analytical model provides accurate estimates for a range of loading conditions and aspect ratios for future work it is recommended that the accuracy of the proposed model be further evaluated using different site conditions e g layered soils and undrained conditions having established the accuracy of the proposed analytical model it is used in the following section to quantify the effect of vertical load on horizontal bearing capacity 7 effect of vertical load on the horizontal response of caissons from eq 9 it is evident that the horizontal bearing capacity of a caisson foundation depends on the vertical load applied on the caisson therefore an equation can be extracted from eq 9 to express the maximum horizontal capacity as follows 15 h m a x k n h 0 d 2 e x v where h 0 is the maximum horizontal capacity without vertical loading given by 16 h 0 k n 1 e x p 1 x 1 2 3 λ p 2 2 3 x 1 λ 2 p 3 l x 2 2 3 p 4 l x d w d 2 to identify the impact of vertical load on the horizontal bearing capacity of a caisson foundation data from model c2 table 1 with a relative density of 25 were used the ultimate capacity values for caisson model c2 derived from eq 15 for load eccentricities of 0 1 2 and 3 were plotted versus vertical load the normalized values are presented in fig 14 as expected the results show that the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity of caissons increases with increasing vertical load it is worth mentioning that increased vertical load on site could be achieved by using ballast byrne and houlsby 2003 however the effect of vertical load is variable for different load eccentricity m h u d values the contribution of vertical loading to the horizontal bearing capacity is more pronounced at lower eccentricity values e 0 8 conclusions this paper presents a mechanics based analytical model to predict the ultimate horizontal capacity of caissons in sand the derived equations consider the angle of internal friction soil unit weight caisson diameter and length load eccentricity vertical load applied on the caisson as well as the distribution of the lateral earth pressure along the caisson a series of physical tests and numerical simulations on caissons installed in sand were conducted to understand their behaviour under monotonic lateral loading the test results showed that the relative density of sand and the aspect ratio of the caisson have a significant effect on the ultimate horizontal capacity the validated numerical results were used to confirm the assumptions made in developing the analytical model utilising the results of the physical model tests as well as results from the published literature the proposed analytical model was validated and its predictions were compared with those of two existing models the results showed that the proposed model outperforms existing models in predicting the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations in sand the proposed analytical model was used to investigate the effect of vertical load on the horizontal load capacity of a caisson foundation embedded in cohesionless soil the analysis showed that there was a substantial increase in horizontal load capacity with increasing vertical load increasing the vertical load is particularly effective at increasing the ultimate horizontal load capacity of caissons if the eccentricity of the horizontal load is equal or close to zero credit authorship contribution statement koohyar faizi methodology software writing original draft asaad faramarzi supervision writing

turbines owts are subjected to combined loadings including lateral vertical and overturning moments to guarantee the normal operation of owts and reduce uncertainty in the design of owt foundations the response to horizontal loading must be accurately estimated this paper presents a closed form model to estimate the lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations for owts to understand the behaviour of caisson foundations under lateral loading and to derive the necessary parameters and relationships to build the closed form model a series of laboratory tests both 1g and centrifuge as well as numerical simulations were conducted field and laboratory data from the published literature were used to validate the proposed model the proposed solution has shown to provide a better estimate of the lateral bearing capacity of caissons compared to existing models the model is capable of predicting the lateral bearing capacity of caissons with aspect ratios less than or equal to 1 0 in both sandy and silty soils additionally the method takes into account the effect of vertical loading on the lateral bearing capacity keywords caisson foundations lateral load physical modelling numerical simulations 1 introduction caisson foundations often referred to as skirted or bucket foundations are novel and cost effective foundations that have been recently considered for supporting offshore wind turbines in a number of projects oh et al 2018 byrne and houlsby 2003 klinkvort et al 2019 these foundations can be described as upturned circular skirted foundations embedded into the seabed using a pressure difference within the caisson cavity generated by creating suction at the top to drive the caisson into the seabed harireche et al 2013 2014 tran et al 2007 mehravar et al 2017 caissons with aspect ratios i e length l to diameter d or l d ratios as high as 5 are often designed for use as anchors for clay sites houlsby and byrne 2005 whereas lower aspect ratios are appropriate for installations in sand villalobos et al 2004 due to their easy installation process shallow caisson foundations with small aspect ratios i e l d 1 are already being used or considered for supporting offshore structures houlsby et al 2005 chen 2013 in general foundations for offshore wind turbines including caissons are subjected to a variety of loading arrangements vertical horizontal and moment loads or combinations of all these mehravar et al 2016 caisson foundations when used as mono buckets to support offshore wind turbine experience significant lateral loading and overturning moments chen 2013 a key factor to ensure safe operation of offshore wind turbines is to predict the bearing capacity of the supporting caisson foundations under lateral loading mehravar et al 2016 existing methods for predicting the lateral load resistance of caisson foundations in sand are mainly based on analytical models developed using data from experiments byrne and houlsby 2003 villalobos 2007 or finite element fe analysis zhu et al 2014 achmus et al 2013 fe analysis has been used to predict the bearing capacity of caisson foundations in sandy soils achmus et al 2013 bagheri et al 2017 ahmed and hawlader 2015 deb and singh 2018 however the application of fe to estimate the behaviour of a foundation is difficult due to the large number of influencing parameters which often results in computationally expensive models xiao et al 2011 on the other hand analytical models were developed to evaluate the lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations byrne and houlsby 2003 zhu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 villalobos 2006 however these models suffer from a number of restrictions e g they are valid for a limited range of l d ratios or they do not provide accurate predictions when the caissons are subjected to vertical loading therefore in this paper an analytical solution to estimate the lateral bearing capacity of caissons as monopod foundations for owts in sandy soils assuming fully drained conditions is proposed to overcome the above limitations to develop and assess the validity of the proposed solution a series of laboratory tests and numerical simulations using three dimensional 3d fe under monotonic loading conditions were carried out the proposed model was calibrated based on the results of physical tests obtained from a series of 1g small scale laboratory experiments as well as centrifuge tests the predictions of the proposed model were compared against published data for large scale experiments as well as other existing analytical models the paper initially summarises existing analytical methods and presents a novel analytical model for predicting the ultimate lateral capacity of caisson foundations in sand subsequently the physical model tests and numerical analyses used to infer the pressure distribution along the caisson skirt and to identify the location of the rotational point are presented the proposed analytical method is then validated against both lab and field test results and its predictions are compared against those analytical models proposed by byrne and houlsby 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 finally the proposed model is used to identify the effect of vertical load on the lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations in cohesionless soils 2 analytical solution 2 1 existing analytical solutions analytical models to determine the ultimate lateral capacity of caisson foundations installed in sand are provided by byrne and houlsby 2003 villalobos villalobos jara 2006 zhu et al 2014 and achmus et al 2013 among others of these four models the first two are in the form of practical equations which can be readily adopted by practitioners for a quick estimation of the capacity the works by zhu et al 2014 and achmus et al 2013 however require determination of a relatively large number of parameters and involve tedious calculations therefore in this paper we will only directly compare our models to those presented by byrne and houlsby 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 these models are based on best fit results from small scale laboratory model tests the equations derived by byrne and houlsby 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 are detailed below for a caisson with l d 1 the ultimate lateral load capacity h u with a force eccentricity e is estimated by byrne and houlsby 2003 as 1 h u f 1 f 2 k 1 v f 3 w d e where w is the buoyant weight of the soil plug inside the caisson v is the vertical load on the caisson which is taken as the total buoyant weight of the caisson foundation f 1 3 26 f 2 1 073 and f 3 0 71 are empirical factors obtained by fitting the ultimate capacity results of caissons in small scale 1g model tests and k is equal to e d villalobos villalobos jara 2006 proposed the following equation to estimate the lateral load capacity of a caisson foundation with l d 1 2 h u 2 r γ k 3 l 3 2 z m 3 f h l f f v r e where r is the caisson radius k is the difference between the passive and active lateral earth pressure coefficients i e k k p k a e is the force eccentricity z m is the depth of the point of rotation measured from seabed level and 3 f h σ v tan φ π r 2 4 f f v k a k p l z m 2 z m 2 l k 2 z m l f v 5 f v 2 r γ l tan δ k 2 z m l where σ v is the vertical effective stress and k a and k p are rankine s active and passive lateral earth pressure coefficients respectively it is worth mentioning that the method proposed by villalobos villalobos jara 2006 does not consider the vertical load directly whereas the vertical load is embedded in the equation proposed by byrne and houlsby 2003 2 2 proposed method taking advantage of force equilibrium the proposed analytical method determines the ultimate limit state uls of caisson foundations rankine s theory for lateral earth pressure in active and passive conditions was used in the analyses the developed relationships are simple easy to use and do not require lengthy calculations the force equilibrium model for embedded caissons has been established in previous studies zhu et al 2014 villalobos 2006 yang et al 2018 based on the distribution of the lateral earth pressure along the skirt the distributed forces adopted by the above studies are graphically shown in fig 1 in all of these studies earth pressure acting on the skirt included both active and passive pressure the studies showed that the pressure in the left hand side fig 1a b and 1c increases with increasing depth and reaches a maximum pressure in the skirt tip on the other hand the maximum pressure in the right hand side fig 1a b and 1c is zero at the ground level and increases with increasing depth until a maximum value is reached at a point on the same level as the rotation point the lateral soil pressure acting on the inner surface of the skirt was neglected by villalobos villalobos jara 2006 fig 1a and zhu et al 2014 fig 1b but was considered by yang et al 2018 fig 1c fig 2 depicts the external forces considered in this study applied to both the inner and outer surfaces of a caisson due to lateral earth pressure it can be seen that the passive earth pressure acting on the left hand side inner surface as well as that acting on the lower part of the right hand side outer surface of the caisson have been ignored due to their relatively small contributions to the overall lateral resistance of the foundation in addition similar to the above studies a rotating point rp has been assumed as shown in fig 2 to calculate the earth pressure numerical analyses reported later on in this paper were used to validate the above assumptions and determine the position of the rp see fig 11 for now the vertical distance between the rp and the caisson lid will be referred to as x as shown in fig 2 the pressure distributions acting on the outer surface of the caisson were based on the studies mentioned above and confirmed by numerical modelling results see figs 12 and 13 usually caisson foundations have large diameters and the weight of the soil inside the caissons has a significant effect on their stability under lateral loading therefore the weight of the soil was considered in the proposed model zhu et al 2014 assumed that 80 of the enclosed soil plug moves with the caisson and as a result does not interact with the caisson the end bearing stresses around the caisson rim are not included in the total stresses similar to previous studies the caisson is considered to be rigid under lateral loading lombardi et al 2017 the proposed model in this study is fundamentally determined by the angle of internal friction φ soil unit weight γ caisson diameter d and caisson length l according to prasad and chari 1999 the passive soil pressure p z at a depth z below the ground level is given by 6 p z s f φ γ z the shape factor s proposed by prasad and chari 1999 is adopted in this study the function f φ represents rankine s passive earth pressure coefficient k p if l o g p z γ z is plotted against tan φ it can be seen that the relationship is linear as shown in fig 3 the straight line equation is given by 7 l o g p z γ z α tan φ β equation 7 can be re arranged to give the maximum passive earth pressure at a depth of λ x see fig 2 8 p z 10 α tan φ β γ λ x where α and β are coefficients obtained from fig 3 a series of fe simulations see section 5 were conducted for caissons with l d ratios of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 and the results were used to generate the necessary data to determine the coefficients the obtained values of α and β are 1 3 and 0 3 respectively the ultimate bearing capacity of the rigid caisson can be obtained based on moment equilibrium if the moment of all forces is taken about the point of rotation in fig 2 the maximum lateral load h m a x can be obtained as 9 h m a x k n 1 e x p 1 x 1 2 3 λ p 2 2 3 x 1 λ 2 p 3 l x 2 2 3 p 4 l x d w d 2 v d 2 where 10 w w s 2 3 of the buoyant weight of the soil plug inside the caisson w t buoyant weight of the tower w c buoyant weight of the caisson 11 p 1 1 2 p z λ x 12 p 2 1 2 p z x p 1 13 p 3 p z l x 14 p 4 0 4 p 3 where x ω l and λ is a coefficient as shown in fig 2 the coefficient of 0 4 in eq 14 is based on the results of the fe simulations detailed in section 5 based on the experimental and numerical results presented later on in this paper the ultimate lateral load may be considered as 80 of the maximum lateral load i e h u 0 8 h m a x 3 physical modelling 3 1 description of the models and the soil two sets of experiments 1g and centrifuge tests were conducted to generate the necessary evidence and data to calibrate and validate the proposed analytical model both sets of experiments had common aspects in terms of the geometry of the model caisson and some specific characteristics which are outlined in the following paragraphs the caisson specimens were fabricated from a smooth stainless steel tube with a wall thickness t of 1 2 mm in the 1 g tests and 1 5 mm in the centrifuge tests the external diameter d of the caisson shaft was 75 mm a factor of 70 was chosen to scale the dimensions of the caissons based on the size of the test rig and the capacity of the loading system in the 1 g tests in order to model the tower a vertical rod with a total height of 230 mm and a diameter of 25 mm was connected to a 5 mm thick circular cap attached to the top surface of the caisson on the other hand a square section stainless steel bar 225 mm long 20 mm 20 mm section was used in the centrifuge tests two embedment length to caisson diameter ratios l d of 0 5 and 1 0 were studied under 1g conditions the centrifuge test was performed only on a model with an l d ratio of 1 0 table 1 two types of sand were used in the tests silica sand redhill sand and hst95 congleton sand redhill sand was used in the 1g tests with two relative densities of 25 and 50 hst95 with a relative density of 50 was used in the centrifuge test the particle size distributions for the two sands are shown in fig 4 a summary of the sand properties are shown in table 2 all tests were carried out in dry sand conditions 3 2 test rig preparation and loading system for 1g experiments tests were conducted under 1g in a strong cylindrical container made of acrylic glass the container which had an inner diameter d of 550 mm a thickness of 30 mm and a height h of 400 mm was filled with redhill 110 sand fig 5 a 100 mm thick layer of gravel was placed uniformly on the base of the tank to provide a stiff layer underneath the sand layer for the experiments with loose sand d r 25 the soil was placed in layers of 50 mm thickness up to a height of 400 mm from the base of the container the medium dense sand was also placed in layers of 50 mm thickness but a vibration compactor was used to achieve a relative density of 50 the model caissons were installed in dry sand by pushing rather than by suction at a rate of 0 1 mm s until the lid made complete contact with the soil the pushing process was carried out very gently to avoid any major disruption to the soil density it is inconclusive whether the installation process affects capacity villalobos jara 2006 zhu et al 2012 further research is required to clearly understand the effect of suction on the short and long term performance similar to other studies zhu et al 2012 cox et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 installation by pushing was used in this study for simplicity to create a moment m in all models a horizontal load h was applied using an electric actuator at the height of 220 mm above the cap of the caisson this gave an eccentricity ratio i e m h d equal to 2 9 which corresponds to tall wind turbine towers 100 m a load cell was attached to the actuator to measure the applied force the rotation of the foundation was recorded by an inclinometer sensor placed on the top of the tower as shown in fig 5 it is important to keep the testing conditions especially the relative densities of the sand consistent in order to make the results as comparable as possible bang et al 2011 faizi et al 2019 therefore prior to each test the cylindrical container was emptied and refilled using the pluviation system 3 3 test rig preparation and loading system for the centrifuge experiment a strong cylindrical container with d h 500 mm was filled with sand up to a height of 440 mm fig 5 a centrifuge test was conducted using hst95 congleton sand with a relative density of approximately 50 a number of scaling criteria were applied for the physical model to represent the prototype based on the basic scaling law of centrifuge modelling a uniform acceleration field is assumed to be applied to the model by selecting an effective centrifuge radius which helps to minimise the scaling errors due to the nonlinear stress distribution and the difficulty of representing sufficient detail in the model a caisson model with an aspect ratio of approximately 1 0 was used in the test which was performed at 70g i e an acceleration scaling factor n 70 a horizontal load was applied at a rate of 0 1 mm s and at an eccentricity e of 212 mm two linear variable differential transformers lvdts were used to measure the tilt of the caisson in the centrifuge test it should be noted that the model represents a caisson with a diameter of 5 25 m and a length of 5 1 m 4 test results for both the experimental and fe results the ultimate lateral load was determined using the tangent intersection method mansur and kaufman 1958 as shown in fig 6 using this method two lines are drawn tangential to the initial and final parts of the load rotation curve and the load corresponding to the intersection point of these two lines is taken as h u in fig 6 θ u and θ m a x are the rotations corresponding to h u and h m a x respectively only the results of the 1g tests are presented in this section the centrifuge test results are presented and compared with the fe results in section 5 figs 7 and 8 present the load rotation curves for tests c1 c2 and c3 the caisson performance under lateral loading was found to be dependent on soil density and caisson aspect ratio as can be seen in figs 7 and 8 the ultimate lateral capacities obtained by model caissons c1 and c2 which were both installed in loose sand but had aspect ratios of 0 5 and 1 0 respectively were 0 85 and 3 7 n respectively this result was to be expected because model caisson c2 had longer caisson length and consequently the passive resistance was mobilised on a larger area of the foundation fig 8 shows that increasing the soil density from 25 to 50 results in a significant increase from 3 7 to 5 5 n in the lateral bearing capacity this occurs because of the increase in both the caisson surface to sand interface friction and the soil shear resistance as the two factors increase with the increase in soil density due to the larger internal friction angle φ see table 3 the strength and stiffness of the surrounding soil and thereby the lateral bearing capacity are all expected to increase 5 numerical modelling in order to identify the position of the rotation point and validate the lateral pressure distribution used in the proposed analytical model a 3d fe model of the caisson was developed using the commercial software abaqus an fe domain with the dimensions 9 d 4 5 d 4 d length width and height respectively was used to avoid boundary effects to model the sand behaviour a drucker prager material model assuming an elastic perfectly plastic behaviour was used together with the material parameters β and d the terms β and d represent the parameters of the material model which can be calculated indirectly using the parameters of the mohr coulomb model derived from ciampi ciampi and ma 1997 an associated flow rule assuming the collapse load is same as the limit load was assumed in the fe modelling to replicate as closely as possible the limit equilibrium analysis zouain et al 2007 taking advantage of symmetry only one half of the problem was modelled fig 9 shows a semi cylindrical section through a diametrical plane of model caisson c4 a relatively fine mesh was used in the regions near the caisson soil interface whereas a coarser mesh was used further away in the fe analyses the foundations were modelled as wished in place assuming that installation effects have a negligible impact on the bearing capacity the initial stress in the soil prior to loading was generated using a lateral earth pressure coefficient k 0 1 sin φ to simulate the behaviour of the caisson under lateral loading a force controlled fe model was created careful attention was paid to modelling the interaction of the caisson elements with the surrounding soil a contact pair interface captures the nonlinear behaviour in the soil caisson interface in the radial direction allow separation contact behaviour was assumed the small sliding tracking approach in abaqus was employed for the contact between the soil and the caisson the soil and the caisson were modelled using the c3d8r solid homogeneous elements available in abaqus standard element library these are 8 noded linear brick elements with reduced integration and hourglass control the caisson outer surface was chosen as a master surface and the soil surface in contact with the caisson was chosen as a slave surface the frictional force between these surfaces is dependent on a coefficient of friction μ in the numerical simulations presented here the friction coefficient was calculated using μ tan δ where δ is the interface friction angle which was assumed to be δ 2 3 φ ahmed and hawlader 2016 nasr 2013 the caissons were considered as linear elastic materials e 200 gpa a constant elastic modulus was considered for the sand e 10 mpa in the 1 g tests and e 33 mpa for the centrifuge tests to validate the fe model the centrifuge experiment was simulated using the above assumptions fig 10 compares the experimental and fe load rotation curves of the caisson the rotation was measured at the centre of the lid it can be seen that the fe model accurately captured the behaviour of the caisson and the supporting ground under lateral loading using the results of the validated fe model the depth of the rotation point rp at ultimate load was determined to be at approximately 0 8 of the skirt length 0 8 corresponds to ω in fig 2 this is shown in fig 11 it is worth mentioning that at the early stages of loading the caisson rp was located at the centre line of the caisson as the horizontal load was increased the rp moved to the right until it reached the right hand side of the caisson at the ultimate load see fig 11 this was also observed by zhu et al 2011 the fe results were also used to validate the proposed lateral earth pressure distribution acting on the caisson at ultimate lateral load fig 12 shows the contour lines of horizontal stresses s 11 acting on the caisson body it can be seen that the fe predicted soil pressure distribution surrounding the caisson matches that proposed in fig 2 from fig 12 it can be observed that the maximum soil pressure takes place close to the skirt tip inner surface right side the pressure at this point is 40 higher than the pressure surrounding the caisson tip outer surface left side the outer surfaces of the caisson were examined numerically to quantify the magnitude of the stresses acting along the caisson shaft fig 13 depicts the evolution of the passive horizontal stress at failure acting on the outer surface of the caisson it can be observed from fig 13 that the position of the maximum passive horizontal stress moves downwards with increased loading fig 13 shows that the passive soil pressure acting on the outer surface of the caisson increases with increasing depth up to 0 85 x where x the depth of the rotation point and 0 85 corresponds to λ in fig 2 the passive pressure then decreases approximately linearly until it reduces to approximately zero at the level of the rotation point below that level the passive soil pressure is neglected due to its small impact on the other hand the soil pressure around the caisson s left hand side outer surface increases approximately linearly from zero to a maximum value at the tip of the caisson at failure the maximum pressure around the caisson s left hand side outer surface is almost equal to the maximum pressure around the caisson s right hand side outer surface 6 comparison of ultimate capacities many existing analytical models were validated using test results of small scale caissons with a limited range of aspect ratios the proposed analytical model was validated using the experimental results reported in this study as well as field and laboratory results from the published literature see table 3 the field tests used to validate the proposed analytical model were conducted at sandy haven houlsby and byrne 2000 and frederikshavn houlsby et al 2005 table 3 gives the test parameters for the two sites which comprised predominantly sandy soil the caisson at the sandy haven site had a diameter of 4 m and a skirt length of 2 5 m and was installed in medium to dense sand the horizontal load was applied at a height of 14 5 m above the ground surface the caisson tested at the frederikshavn site which had a diameter of 2 m and a skirt length of 2 m was installed in dense sand the foundation was subjected to horizontal loading at a height of 17 4 m above the ground surface together with a constant vertical load of 37 3 kn the ultimate capacities for the two field tests see table 3 were obtained from the moment rotation curves using the tangent method described in fig 6 table 3 also gives details of the lab tests reported by foglia et al foglia 2011 zhu et al 2011 zhu et al 2012 and zhang et al 2010 which were all used to validate the proposed analytical model and compare its predictions with those of the models proposed by byrne and houlsby byrne et al 2003 and villalobos villalobos jara 2006 from table 3 it can be seen that the proposed model provides a good estimate of the lateral bearing capacity for caissons with different embedment depths and soil densities the proposed analytical model is statistically the best model among the three evaluated models with a mean experimental to predicted ratio of 0 98 and a standard deviation of 0 17 byrne and houlsby s byrne et al 2003 model significantly overestimated the lateral bearing capacity with a mean experimental to predicted ratio of 0 72 moreover byrne and houlsby s byrne et al 2003 model had a standard deviation of 0 36 reflecting a significant scatter of the model predictions villalobos villalobos jara 2006 model gave conservative predictions with a mean experimental to predicted ratio of 1 17 however with a standard deviation of 0 36 this model also had a significant scatter of its predictions from the results presented in table 3 and the above statistical analysis the benefits of using the proposed analytical model to predict the lateral capacity of caisson foundations in sandy soil with the assumption of drained conditions are evident byrne and houlsby s byrne and houlsby 2003 model provides satisfactory predictions for caissons with l d 1 similarly the model proposed by villalobos villalobos jara 2006 performs satisfactorily when no vertical load is applied on the caisson however the proposed analytical model provides accurate estimates for a range of loading conditions and aspect ratios for future work it is recommended that the accuracy of the proposed model be further evaluated using different site conditions e g layered soils and undrained conditions having established the accuracy of the proposed analytical model it is used in the following section to quantify the effect of vertical load on horizontal bearing capacity 7 effect of vertical load on the horizontal response of caissons from eq 9 it is evident that the horizontal bearing capacity of a caisson foundation depends on the vertical load applied on the caisson therefore an equation can be extracted from eq 9 to express the maximum horizontal capacity as follows 15 h m a x k n h 0 d 2 e x v where h 0 is the maximum horizontal capacity without vertical loading given by 16 h 0 k n 1 e x p 1 x 1 2 3 λ p 2 2 3 x 1 λ 2 p 3 l x 2 2 3 p 4 l x d w d 2 to identify the impact of vertical load on the horizontal bearing capacity of a caisson foundation data from model c2 table 1 with a relative density of 25 were used the ultimate capacity values for caisson model c2 derived from eq 15 for load eccentricities of 0 1 2 and 3 were plotted versus vertical load the normalized values are presented in fig 14 as expected the results show that the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity of caissons increases with increasing vertical load it is worth mentioning that increased vertical load on site could be achieved by using ballast byrne and houlsby 2003 however the effect of vertical load is variable for different load eccentricity m h u d values the contribution of vertical loading to the horizontal bearing capacity is more pronounced at lower eccentricity values e 0 8 conclusions this paper presents a mechanics based analytical model to predict the ultimate horizontal capacity of caissons in sand the derived equations consider the angle of internal friction soil unit weight caisson diameter and length load eccentricity vertical load applied on the caisson as well as the distribution of the lateral earth pressure along the caisson a series of physical tests and numerical simulations on caissons installed in sand were conducted to understand their behaviour under monotonic lateral loading the test results showed that the relative density of sand and the aspect ratio of the caisson have a significant effect on the ultimate horizontal capacity the validated numerical results were used to confirm the assumptions made in developing the analytical model utilising the results of the physical model tests as well as results from the published literature the proposed analytical model was validated and its predictions were compared with those of two existing models the results showed that the proposed model outperforms existing models in predicting the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of caisson foundations in sand the proposed analytical model was used to investigate the effect of vertical load on the horizontal load capacity of a caisson foundation embedded in cohesionless soil the analysis showed that there was a substantial increase in horizontal load capacity with increasing vertical load increasing the vertical load is particularly effective at increasing the ultimate horizontal load capacity of caissons if the eccentricity of the horizontal load is equal or close to zero credit authorship contribution statement koohyar faizi methodology software writing original draft asaad faramarzi supervision writing
