19605,increasingly technologies that use sulfide as an electron donor are being considered for nitrogen removal however our understanding of how sulfide affects microbial communities in nitrifying treatment processes is limited in this study we used batch experiments to quantify sulfide inhibition of both ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob using activated sludge from two full scale treatment plants with distinct treatment processes the batch experiments showed that nob were more vulnerable to sulfide inhibition than aob and that inhibition constants ki for nob were distinct between the two treatment plants which also had distinct nitrite oxidizing microbial communities a nitrospira rich less diverse nob community was inhibited more by sulfide than a more diverse community rich in nitrotoga and nitrobacter therefore sulfide induced nitritation may be more successful in less diverse nitrospira rich communities additionally sulfide significantly influenced the activity of non nitrifying microbial community members as measured by 16s rrna cdna sequencing overall these results indicate that sulfide has a strong impact on both nitrification and the activity of the underlying microbial communities and that the response is community specific graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrification sulfide nitritation wastewater treatment 1 introduction as our understanding of the environmental and human health impacts of eutrophication grows increasingly stringent effluent nitrogen regulations are being implemented worldwide conventional biological nitrogen removal consists of first converting the ammonium in wastewater to nitrate using nitrifying microorganisms then converting the nitrate to nitrogen gas using denitrifying microorganisms amidst a move within the water industry toward resource efficiency there is a growing interest in technologies that promote and maintain nitritation the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob while preventing further oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitritation reduces aeration costs by 25 based on stoichiometry offers an alternative to nitrate as an electron acceptor for denitrification which reduces electron donor requirements and can significantly reduce the overall energy cost of operating a treatment plant rosso et al 2008 however sustaining nitritation processes in low strength wastewater systems is challenging and while various methods have been proposed blackburne et al 2008 gilbert et al 2014 regmi et al 2014 shannon et al 2015 vadivelu et al 2006 villaverde et al 1997 to date there is no consensus on the most effective strategy in addition to nitritation processes there is growing interest in harnessing hydrogen sulfide as an alternative electron donor for nitrogen removal although toxic and corrosive hydrogen sulfide can be used as an electron donor for denitrification in natural environments e g canfield et al 2010 and during wastewater treatment lu et al 2012 sabba et al 2016 hydrogen sulfide is frequently produced biologically from sulfate in sewers e g zhang et al 2008 and by anaerobic processes within treatment plants e g isa et al 1986 the amount of hydrogen sulfide produced is a function of the sulfate content in wastewater which is variable and depends on factors such as industrial wastewater discharges drinking water source water and the coagulant used for drinking water treatment in coastal regions sulfate concentrations in wastewater increase due to seawater infiltration into both groundwater reservoirs used as drinking water sources and wastewater collection systems a phenomenon that will be magnified by global climate change sea level rise and projected population growth along coasts these increases all lead to increased sulfide loads to wastewater treatment plants the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process incorporates sulfur driven denitrification to achieve nitrogen removal and is now deployed at the demonstration scale wang et al 2009 wu et al 2016 the sani process takes advantage of increased wastewater sulfide concentrations that are present due to the practice of using seawater for toilet flushing it has lower space requirements wu et al 2016 lower sludge production wu et al 2016 and reduced nitrous oxide emissions yang et al 2016 compared to conventional nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification however despite the progress with sulfur driven denitrification more research is needed to understand how sulfide impacts nitrification and more specifically nitritation sulfide is a known inhibitor of nitrification and has specifically been shown to differentially inhibit ammonium oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria bejarano ortiz et al 2015 erguder et al 2008 kouba et al 2017 however estimates of inhibition constants vary significantly in this study we associate the variability in experimentally determined sulfide inhibition with microbial community dynamics specifically we evaluated the impact of sulfide on the kinetics of nitrite oxidation and ammonium oxidation independently using biomass from two full scale treatment plants that use different treatment processes and compared our kinetic observations with the differences we found in the underlying microbial community ecology our results suggest that sulfide may be a useful selective inhibitor of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for treatment systems but this depends on the composition and diversity of the nob communities 2 methods 2 1 batch experimental design eight hour batch experiments were performed on freshly collected activated sludge april june 2016 from two local wastewater treatment plants wwtps an extended aeration process novi michigan usa and an a2o anaerobic anoxic aerobic ann arbor michigan usa process with process and performance characteristics shown in table 1 both treatment plants have experienced sulfide induced corrosion in either the collection system lift station or grit chamber activated sludge was collected from the aerobic tank in the same location at approximately the same time of day 1 h for each experiment batch experiments were conducted at five target sulfide concentrations for each wwtp 2 4 8 15 and 35 mg l as s for the a2o process and 2 5 10 15 and 35 mg l as s for the extended aeration process these concentrations are consistent with baseline sulfur levels typically found in domestic wastewater 6 17 mg l as s burton et al 2014 each batch experiment had ten flasks duplicate sulfide free controls with ammonium duplicate sulfide free controls with nitrite triplicate sulfide and ammonium amended cultures and triplicate sulfide and nitrite amended cultures flasks were covered with aluminium foil and maintained in the dark in a shaking water bath set to 25 c at a shaking speed which had been determined to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 mg l to initiate batch experiments 1 2 l of activated sludge was washed using three centrifugation 7500 g and resuspension steps in a 0 12 m phosphate buffer 3 2 g l kh2po4 13 7 g l na2hpo4 ph 7 5 batch media was prepared ahead of time and left in an anaerobic chamber overnight it was prepared using 1000x dilutions of four separate stock solutions in the following order acidic trace metal basic trace metal chelating and divalent cation the acidic trace metal stock solution consisted of per liter cocl2 6h2o 280 mg znso4 7h2o 340 mg h3bo3 37 mg

stock solution consisted of 10 g l naedta and the divalent cation stock solution consisted of per liter cacl2 2h2o 5 0 g mgcl2 6h2o 33 g sufficient ammonium bicarbonate was added to the ammonium amended batches to achieve an initial concentration of 50 mg n l and sodium nitrite was added to the nitrite amended batches to achieve an initial concentration of 20 mg n l nitrite n concentrations and ammonium n concentrations were chosen to be representative of mainstream wastewater treatment plants using nitritation processes at the ph measured across all samples and experiments average 7 71 0 10 free nitrous acid concentrations were calculated to be 5 10 7 mg hno2 n l at most well below inhibitory free nitrous acid concentrations for nitrite oxidizers 0 023 mg hno2 n l vadivelu et al 2006 similarly the maximum free ammonia concentration was calculated to be 1 3 mg nh3 n l which is below the inhibitory free ammonia concentration for ammonia oxidizers 10 100 mg nh3 n l anthonisen et al 1976 sulfide was added to each flask individually using a 5 g s l stock the sulfide stock was made in the glove box using a sodium sulfide nonahydrate salt following sulfide addition flasks were quickly moved from the anaerobic chamber to a fume hood to reduce the available reaction time between sulfide and iron which can cause sulfide precipitation iron was added separately from the other trace metals just prior 2 min to initiating batch experiments iron iii stock concentration 6 5 g l fecl3 6h2o was added 100 Î¼l to each flask and followed immediately by sampling to determine the initial sulfide concentration we found that between adding the sulfide in the glove box and the initial sulfide measurement we lost an average of 14 19 of the sulfide added supplementary information tables s2 and s3 possibly due to abiotic losses such as precipitation alvarez et al 2007 and or stripping suleimenov and krupp 1994 experiments were initiated by adding thirty ml of the washed biomass to each flask to make a final batch volume of 100 ml 2 2 sample collection and analysis all samples were collected by first moving the flask from the water bath to the stir plate to ensure samples were taken from a completely mixed system ten milliliter samples were collected for nitrogen analysis at 2 min 30 min 2 h 4 h and 8 h into the experiment samples were pelleted at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 c and the supernatant was filtered using a washed 0 45 Î¼m nitrocellulose filter fisher scientific an aliquot of each filtered sample was acidified to a ph of 3 using 1 n hcl for ammonium analysis via the phenate method 4500 nh3 f apha et al 2005 nitrite was determined using the colorimetric method 4200 no2 b and nitrate and sulfate were measured using the ion chromatography method 4110 b apha et al 2005 samples for sulfide analysis were collected separate from the samples taken for nitrogen analyses at the following time points immediately after iron addition at 2 min 30 min 2 h and 4 h into the experiment all samples were collected stored and analysed according to method 4500 s2 g apha et al 2005 samples were collected into a syringe containing 2 ml of sulfide antioxidant buffer 2x final sample dilution immediately transferred to the anaerobic chamber filtered using a washed 0 45 Î¼m nitrocellulose filter fisher scientific and preserved in the dark until analysis within 24 h the sulfide antioxidant buffer was stored in the anaerobic chamber in an amber bottle and prepared as described in standard methods by combining 67 g of disodium edta 35 g of ascorbic acid and 200 ml of 1 n sodium hydroxide into deoxygenated milli q water to 1 l final volume apha et al 2005 sulfide was analysed using a silver sulfide electrode thermo scientific orion that was calibrated with a 3 w v sodium sulfide stock solution ricca chemical company method 4500 s2 g apha et al 2005 two biomass samples one for dna analysis one for cdna analysis 1 ml each were collected for microbial community analysis from each flask between 2 5 h and 3 75 h into the experiment to represent a time point when nitrogenous substrates had not been depleted samples were collected by moving the flask to a stir plate and pipetting the samples into nuclease free microcentrifuge tubes samples were immediately pelleted at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and one sample was resuspended in rnalater qiagen valencia ca all samples were stored at 80 c until nucleic acids were extracted volatile suspended solids vss were analysed at the end of the experiment supplementary information table s4 and used to normalize rates of oxidation rates of nitrification Î¼ were determined by taking the slope of the linear range of nitrate concentrations for nitrite amended cultures or the sum of nitrite and nitrate concentrations for ammonium amended cultures data used to take rates of nitrification are shown in supplementary information figs s2 and s3 the linear range was between the 34 18 min and 7 0 1 0 h sample points r 2 0 97 0 04 2 3 estimation of inhibition parameters we modeled inhibition of aob and nob using a noncompetitive inhibition model previous studies on nitrification inhibition showed that volatile sulfur compounds inhibit ammonia monooxygenase noncompetitively hyman et al 1990 and this model was used for sulfide inhibition of both aob and nob kouba et al 2017 consequently there is prior evidence that this model form with sulfide inhibition is reasonable under the noncompetitive inhibition model the rate of growth under inhibited conditions Î¼inh is 1 Î¼ i n h Î¼ m a x s 1 i k i k s s where Î¼max is the uninhibited maximum specific growth rate s is the concentration of electron donor which in this case is ammonium or nitrite i is the concentration of inhibitor which for this study was the measured sulfide concentration just prior to biomass addition ki is the inhibition constant and ks is the half saturation constant in the absence of an inhibitor the rate of growth in the controls Î¼cont simplifies to conventional monod kinetics 2 Î¼ c o n t Î¼ m a x s k s s therefore the rate in the sulfide amended cultures normalized to the controls reduces to 3 Î¼ i n h Î¼ c o n t 1 1 i k i sulfide is a reactive inhibitor therefore the nitrifying populations were exposed to lower concentrations of sulfide on average than the concentrations used in our model supplementary information tables s2 and s3 thus by using measured sulfide concentration at the beginning of the experiment for i our ki estimates represent conservative estimates of nitrification inhibition equation 3 was fit to our data using the nonlinear squares function in the r environment r core team 2016 and the line of best fit was used for the estimate 2 4 estimation of biological and abiotic rates of sulfide oxidation to estimate the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic sulfide oxidation in the batch experiments we applied a model developed by nielsen ah et al 2004 2006 for sewer networks the model accounts for the effect of ph and temperature on chemical and biological sulfide oxidation biological oxidation was best described using a power equation the authors developed calibration constants from two separate sewer systems we applied this model along with the parameters they estimated for the dissolved oxygen temperature and ph used for our batch experiments 2 5 nucleic acid extractions and qpcr dna and rna were extracted from biomass collected during batch experiments exposed to three different levels of sulfide below the inhibition constant for nob inhibition between the nob and aob inhibition constants and above the aob inhibition constant nucleic acid extractions were performed using three bead beading steps followed by extraction with a maxwell 16 lev automated nucleic acid extractor promega madison wi with the dna blood and simply rna tissue kits respectively extractions were performed following manufacturer s instructions with a few modifications the manufacturer s lysis buffer was replaced with qiagen lysis buffer rlt to increase the buffer volume 600 Î¼l total volume for the rna extraction the dnase 1 solution volume was doubled to 10 Î¼l to remove contaminating dna total dna and rna concentrations in all samples were quantified by nanodrop thermoscientific waltham ma and verified by qubit invitrogen waltham ma rna extracts were treated with a second dnase step using a dna free dna removal kit ambion foster city ca to further remove contaminating dna two approaches were used to confirm no dna contamination of rna extracts i the absence of amplifiable dna was confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr of the 16s rrna gene methods described in the supplementary information section 3 and ii qubit was used to confirm that dna was below detection limits lastly rna was reverse transcribed to produce complimentary dna cdna using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit according to the manufacturer s instructions life technologies grand island ny 2 6 qpcr sequencing and microbial community analysis bacterial ammonia monooxygenase amoa 16s rrna and nitrospira nitrite oxidoreductase nxrb genes were quantified from cdna and dna using qpcr standards for the qpcr reaction were obtained using purified products from pcr reactions for each wastewater treatment plant samples and standards were analyzed in triplicate and each qpcr plate had a positive control dna extracts from a nitrifying enrichment culture for amoa and nxrb stadler and love 2016 or genomic dna from pseudomonas aeruginosa culture for 16s and duplicate no template controls details on qpcr standard preparation and qpcr conditions are given in the supplementary information section 3 1 amplicon sequencing of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was performed with dna and cdna using the illumina miseq miseq reagent kit v2 500 cycles illumina inc san diego ca platform and the previously developed dual indexing sequencing strategy kozich et al 2013 twenty Î¼l pcr reactions were performed using the following conditions 1 Î¼l template 5 Î¼l primers at a concentration of 4 Î¼m 0 15 Î¼l accuprime hifi polymerase 2 Î¼l accuprime pcr buffer ii 11 85 Î¼l molecular grade water illumina sequencing results were analyzed using mothur version 1 38 1 following the miseq sop kozich et al 2013 schloss et al 2009 with two exceptions data were rarefied only for ordination analysis and archaea were included in the analysis in addition to aligning sequences to the silva database release 123 sequences were aligned to a custom 16s rrna sequence database of known nitrifiers created from the ncbi database using blast the database was created march 14th 2016 and has been uploaded as a supplementary file this additional step was used to identify nitrifier otus that are unclassified or unknown based on the silva database all hits had over 230 base pair alignment lengths e values below 4e 115 and bit scores above 405 in addition hits were compared with the entire non redundant ncbi database using blast to ensure that the nitrifying taxonomic assignment was the best available assignment from this analysis no ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were identified in either treatment plant therefore only aob are considered 2 7 prediction of precipitates formed precipitation reactions were predicted using the sweep function in visual minteq version 3 1 gustafsson 2012 a tableau was created for the media used for the batch cultures and possible chemical precipitates were identified and include iron sulfide molybdenum disulfide wurtzite covellite manganese ii sulfide cobalt sulfide nickel sulfide acanthite chalcocite galena pyrite spharelite chalcopyrite the species tableau is available in supplementary information table s1 equilibrium was determined across 100 concentrations of hs between 0 and 32 mg l as s 2 8 statistical analysis data analysis was conducted in the r environment r core team 2016 statistical comparisons between inhibition model coefficients were done using a two sided t test differences between copy numbers from qpcr data were tested using spearman s rank coefficient to evaluate differences in microbial community structure due to the presence of sulfide relative abundances of samples were standardized to median sequencing depth across all the samples sparse data were removed by pruning otus with fewer than 5 reads across all the samples following this sulfide amended cdna relative abundances were normalized to the average cdna relative abundance in the sulfide free controls for each batch experiment principal coordinate analysis on the bray curtis similarity matrix was plotted using the phyloseq package in r mcmurdie and holmes 2013 overall changes in the microbial community structure under different sulfide concentrations were tested using permutational manova 999 permutations based on the bray curtis similarity index using the vegan package in r oksanen et al 2007 following this exploratory data analysis a subsequent analysis was conducted using the deseq2 package love et al 2014 mcmurdie and holmes 2014 for this analysis instead of normalizing to the sulfide free controls or median sequencing depth 16s rrna cdna abundances were normalized using the negative binomial model which accounts for differences in library sizes mcmurdie and holmes 2014 the wald parametric test was used to find significant associations between taxa cdna abundances and sulfide love et al 2014 mcmurdie and holmes 2014 the otus that were determined to be statistically significant and were unclassified otus were compared against the ncbi database however more resolution on the taxonomic assignment could not be obtained all p values given were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the benjamani hochberg correction 3 results and discussion 3 1 nob from full scale treatment systems show different levels of sulfide inhibition sulfide undergoes many abiotic and biological transformations that can occur very rapidly and the loss of sulfide influences how inhibition is modeled when applying the model developed by nielson et al at minimum and maximum sulfide concentrations 2004 2006 we found that abiotic 1 2 and 16 mg s l hr and biotic 2 1 and 37 mg s l hr rates of sulfide oxidation are within the same order of magnitude and can thus simultaneously drive sulfide oxidation inhibition of nitrification was maintained throughout the experiment even after sulfide was lost i e the slopes of lines were constant supplementary information figs s2 and s3 and tables s2 and s3 experimentally determining kinetic rates for reactive inhibitors such as sulfide can be tricky as inhibition constants are impacted by the startup procedure and how sulfide is defined in the inhibition model due to the rapid reactivity and subsequent loss of sulfide it is important to underscore that the sulfide concentrations used to fit our inhibition model were measured at the beginning of each batch experiment which captures any immediate losses due to precipitation or aerobic oxidation between adding sulfide and the time zero measurement therefore our estimated inhibition constants are conservative estimates of nitrification inhibition all previous studies of nitrifier inhibition use the concentrations of sulfide they applied rather than measuring sulfide at time zero as we did and therefore do not account for rapid sulfide loss bejarano ortiz et al 2015 bejarano ortiz et al 2013 kouba et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 consequently these studies tend to overestimate inhibition constants we conclude that our estimates are reasonable and offer a realistic estimate of relative inhibition differences between aob and nob cultures nitrification in both plants was inhibited by sulfide and is characterized in fig 1 based on the initial bulk liquid sulfide concentration present when biomass was first exposed the range 95 confidence intervals of ki estimates across both treatment plants for aob was between 7 8 and 14 mg l as s while the ki for nob was between 2 4 and 6 7 mg l as s the lower ki value for nob compared to aob in both treatment plants p t test 0 05 indicates that nob were more sensitive to sulfide than aob our results are consistent with previous studies that showed nob to be more sensitive to sulfide than aob erguder et al 2008 bejarano ortiz et al 2015 found lower inhibition constants 0 22 mg l as s for nob and 2 54 mg l as s for aob using biomass from an enrichment culture real wastewater microbial communities may be better adapted to sulfide resulting in higher sulfide inhibition constants another study obtained inhibition parameters almost an order of magnitude higher than the parameters we estimated 10 mg l as s for nob and 150 mg l as s for aob kouba et al 2017 perhaps reflecting either a more sulfide resistant nitrifying community or overestimation due to the use of applied rather than measured sulfide concentrations in their inhibition model other studies using lab scale nitrifying cultures beristain cardoso et al 2010 or activated sludge zhou et al 2014 have only quantified inhibition of complete nitrification and obtained similar inhibition parameters 10 13 mg s l to those we have obtained for aob while the extent of inhibition is variable differential inhibition of aob and nob in reactors is consistent across processes with different redox environments and microbial communities given the variability in the parameter values calibration and validation are needed before applying inhibition constants from one community to another community in modeling efforts overall these comparisons show that the response of nitrifying communities to sulfide is community specific by pairing the analysis of inhibition with an analysis of the microbial community we can infer how different nitrifying populations respond to sulfide understanding the direct and indirect mechanisms of sulfide inhibition can help elucidate whether sulfide inhibition can be harnessed over the long term we first consider possible indirect mechanisms of nitrification inhibition such as precipitation of sulfide with trace metals and oxygen deficiencies due to sulfide oxidation using equilibrium speciation modeling we evaluated the possibility that sulfide induced precipitative loss of trace metals that are enzymatic cofactors for ammonia monooxygenase copper zinc and iron gilch et al 2009 zahn et al 1996 and nitrite oxidoreductase iron and molybdenum meincke et al 1992 contributed to the inhibition we observed in the media used for the batch experiments the model predicts that ammonia monooxygenase cofactors copper and zinc precipitate at lower sulfide concentrations than the nitrite oxidoreductase cofactor molybdenum fig s1 while precipitation did occur and could have contributed to the inhibition patterns observed our model predictions suggest that if precipitation was controlling inhibition then aob would have been inhibited at lower sulfide concentrations than nob consequently abiotic precipitation does not appear to be the primary mechanism of differential inhibition between ammonium oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers next we looked at the oxygen demand that sulfide exerts and asked if it could have limited growth of nitrifying bacteria by causing a deficiency in dissolved oxygen supplementary information section 4 table s6 based on stoichiometric estimates the oxygen demands of sulfide oxidation are significant at a maximum the oxygen diverted to sulfide could have oxidized 2 5 times the total amount of ammonium that was oxidized in the 25 mg s l for the extended aeration process on the other hand nitrite oxidation was more affected by the loss of oxygen at a maximum the oxygen diverted to sulfide could have oxidized 8 times the total amount of nitrite that was oxidized in the 15 mg s l batch for the a2o process however this analysis assumes all sulfide was oxidized by oxygen and none precipitated or went to the gas phase furthermore sulfide was oxidized very rapidly supplementary information tables s2 and s3 and therefore this stochiometric effect should have been short lived we did not observe a change in nitrification rate once sulfide was lost indicating this is probably not the primary inhibition mechanism lastly we consider direct enzymatic inhibition by quantifying the expression of the ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase genes using rt qpcr we did not observe statistically significant associations between cdna gene copy numbers and sulfide concentration supplementary information fig s4 section 3 the relationship between transcriptional activity and protein abundances is complex and transcriptional activity may not correlate with enzymatic activity moran et al 2013 for example the inhibitor may change the conformation of the enzyme baumann et al 1997 a mechanism proposed previously for the inhibition of the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme by carbon disulfide and thiourea hyman et al 1990 wood et al 1981 an enzyme conformation change could explain why inhibition was maintained after sulfide was no longer detected in the batch reactors the time to recover from a conformational change may be particularly slow for nitrifiers because of their slow growth rates while we cannot decipher the exact mechanism of sulfide inhibition our results support the need for more in depth pure culture and proteomic for example experiments to further elucidate sulfide induced inhibition mechanisms between different aob and nob taxa 3 2 the nob communities from the two treatment plants had distinct structures the observation that nob inhibition by sulfide differed among the two full scale treatment processes p t test 0 05 whereas aob inhibition kinetics were not different p t test 0 9 may be due to differences in the composition of the nitrite oxidizing communities between the two plants fig 2 shows aob and nob activity levels in both source biomasses based on cdna generated from rrna it reveals that while transcriptionally active ammonium oxidizers in both plants are dominated by nitrosomonas the a2o process has more diverse transcriptionally active nitrite oxidizers and was therefore more functionally redundant with respect to nitrite oxidation than the extended aeration process increased functional redundancy within microbial communities can lead to more resilient communities girvan et al 2005 our work is consistent with this notion since the culture from the a2o system had greater resistance to sulfide inhibition than the extended aeration process ki nob a2o ki nob ea while enhanced microbial diversity in wastewater treatment plants has been explored as a strategy to improve process performance johnson et al 2014 our results suggest that increasing diversity of nob may have undesirable effects on nitritation systems the more sulfide resistant nob community in the a2o process may be due to differences in the active nob populations between the two treatment plants while both plants reported a history of sulfide related corrosion in their collection systems the a2o process has temporal changes in redox conditions that create environments favorable for sustaining sulfide for extended time periods zhou et al 2014 possibly exerting a selective pressure on the nitrite oxidizers in the a2o process the extended aeration treatment plant is dominated by the nob family nitrospira that appears to be more sensitive to sulfide than the nitrotoga that dominate the a2o plant and possibly the nitrobacter nob also present in the a2o biomass it is worth noting that some nitrospira species uniquely possess the genetic inventory for sulfur oxidation lÃ¼cker et al 2013 though no studies have found metabolic evidence for this function nitrite oxidation by nitrospira may be inherently more sensitive to inhibitors blackburne et al 2007 found nitrospira to be more sensitive to free ammonia and free nitrous acid than nitrobacter this difference in inhibition characteristics between nitrospira and nitrobacter could potentially be explained by the location of the substrate binding unit of the nitrite oxidoreductase enzyme nxr within the cell in nitrospira the nxr is periplasmic while in nitrobacter the nxr is cytoplasmic therefore the cell membrane may protect nitrobacter since the charged hs molecule must first enter the cell this explanation does not hold for nitrotoga which also has a periplasmic nxr nowka et al 2015 and dominates the a2o nitrite oxidizer microbial community our results suggest that not all nob are equal with respect to sulfide inhibition the differing metabolic capacities physiologies and ecological niches of nob leads to different sulfide inhibition characteristics and unraveling these differences between nob is an important area of future research 3 3 sulfide impacted the activity of non nitrifying microorganisms within the community considering inhibition of nitrifying populations without considering the effect of the inhibitor on the overall microbial community may miss important interdependencies between nitrifiers and associated populations sulfide is both an energetically favorable electron donor and inhibits some microbial processes consequently it can have complex effects on the overall microbial community while sulfide did not significantly change the composition of the microbial community over the course of the batch tests based on sequencing of 16s rrna genes permutational manova on bray curtis similarity p 0 07 r 2 0 05 fig s5 the active microbial community based on sequencing of 16s rrna cdna shifted due to sulfide fig s6 the active microbial communities had statistically significant correlations with sulfide concentration based on the permutational manova on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix p 0 001 r 2 0 12 stratified by the wastewater treatment plant the small effect size r 2 indicates that only a small proportion of the otus in the studied communities were affected by the initial sulfide concentration since we found that sulfide affects microbial community activity 16s rrna and not composition 16s rrna gene over the time scales of these experiments we focused on the cdna data to evaluate which otus were associated with sulfide using the deseq2 package we found 55 otus with normalized cdna abundances that statistically significantly correlated with initial sulfide concentration wald test p 0 05 the changes in relative activity of these otus due to sulfide are shown in fig 3 interestingly despite a loss of nitrifying activity none of the nitrifying otus had statistically significant associations between 16s rrna relative activity and sulfide and are therefore absent from fig 3 based on both spearmans rank and wald test p 0 05 a lack of association between 16s rrna and activity has previously been observed in pure cultures of aob under stressed conditions bollmann et al 2005 chandran and love 2008 but we know of no similar studies with nob the lack of association between the expression of the ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase genes observed in this study is an independent measurement that is consistent with the absence of nitrifying otus in fig 3 in contrast many otus that were positively associated with sulfide have been implicated in sulfur cycling such as desulfonema and desulfovibrio members of the desulfovibrio family have also been shown to oxidize sulfide fuseler et al 1996 and have been implicated in sulfide oxidation using dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra thorup and schramm 2017 similarly members of the planctomycetacaea family are involved in sulfur cycling elshahed et al 2007 the rhodocyclacaea otu with a positive association with initial sulfide concentration was categorized at the genus level to be dechloromonas which also may contain sulfur oxidation genes salinero et al 2009 many more statistically significantly associated otus p wald 0 05 were negatively associated 48 otus with initial sulfide concentration than were positively associated 7 otus suggesting sulfide inhibition the changes in activity we observed indicate that sulfide induced microbial community shifts however there is additional research to be done on the relationship if any between the community shifts and nitrification inhibition 4 summary and potential applications as the population in coastal cities increases and nitrogen regulations become more stringent innovations that lead to more energy efficient nitrogen management will be increasingly valuable sulfide in wastewater can be harnessed to implement nitritation processes via the differential inhibition of aob and nob existing treatment processes that use varying redox environments including anoxic and anaerobic zones or that maintain low do conditions will also support environments where nitrifiers could be inhibited by sulfide mainstream nitritation due to sulfide could also be supported in emerging technologies such as the sani process mainstream anammox or mainstream anaerobic processes mccarty et al 2011 that are known to produce variable and sometimes high concentrations of sulfide delgado vela et al 2015 additionally amid water stress more densely populated coastal communities may consider seawater toilet flushing and harnessing sulfide during wastewater treatment liu et al 2016 as nitrogen regulations become more stringent and energy conservation in wastewater treatment systems becomes a priority sulfide may help reduce energy requirements of nitrogen removal by suppressing nob and supporting shortcut nitrogen removal technologies future research is needed to understand if nitritation can be maintained in a continuously fed system since long term feeding of sulfide could lead to both physiological adaptation or selection for sulfide resistant nitrifying populations we showed that applying sulfide for the support of nob suppression requires knowledge of the underlying nitrite oxidizing community by linking inhibition parameters to the nitrifying community our results show that a more diverse nitrite oxidizing community is more resistant to sulfide inhibition and that nitrospira rich communities are more sensitive to sulfide inhibition further we found that sulfide impacts the activity of the microbial community suggesting that sulfide has impacts on the wastewater treatment processes that have yet to be identified 5 conclusions nitrite oxidizing bacteria are more sensitive to sulfide than ammonia oxidizing microorganisms in the two processes considered distinct communities of nitrite oxidizing bacteria showed different responses to sulfide consistent with nitrospira being more sensitive to sulfide than nitrobacter and nitrotoga sulfide affects microbial community activity and many otus had

19605,increasingly technologies that use sulfide as an electron donor are being considered for nitrogen removal however our understanding of how sulfide affects microbial communities in nitrifying treatment processes is limited in this study we used batch experiments to quantify sulfide inhibition of both ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob using activated sludge from two full scale treatment plants with distinct treatment processes the batch experiments showed that nob were more vulnerable to sulfide inhibition than aob and that inhibition constants ki for nob were distinct between the two treatment plants which also had distinct nitrite oxidizing microbial communities a nitrospira rich less diverse nob community was inhibited more by sulfide than a more diverse community rich in nitrotoga and nitrobacter therefore sulfide induced nitritation may be more successful in less diverse nitrospira rich communities additionally sulfide significantly influenced the activity of non nitrifying microbial community members as measured by 16s rrna cdna sequencing overall these results indicate that sulfide has a strong impact on both nitrification and the activity of the underlying microbial communities and that the response is community specific graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrification sulfide nitritation wastewater treatment 1 introduction as our understanding of the environmental and human health impacts of eutrophication grows increasingly stringent effluent nitrogen regulations are being implemented worldwide conventional biological nitrogen removal consists of first converting the ammonium in wastewater to nitrate using nitrifying microorganisms then converting the nitrate to nitrogen gas using denitrifying microorganisms amidst a move within the water industry toward resource efficiency there is a growing interest in technologies that promote and maintain nitritation the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob while preventing further oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitritation reduces aeration costs by 25 based on stoichiometry offers an alternative to nitrate as an electron acceptor for denitrification which reduces electron donor requirements and can significantly reduce the overall energy cost of operating a treatment plant rosso et al 2008 however sustaining nitritation processes in low strength wastewater systems is challenging and while various methods have been proposed blackburne et al 2008 gilbert et al 2014 regmi et al 2014 shannon et al 2015 vadivelu et al 2006 villaverde et al 1997 to date there is no consensus on the most effective strategy in addition to nitritation processes there is growing interest in harnessing hydrogen sulfide as an alternative electron donor for nitrogen removal although toxic and corrosive hydrogen sulfide can be used as an electron donor for denitrification in natural environments e g canfield et al 2010 and during wastewater treatment lu et al 2012 sabba et al 2016 hydrogen sulfide is frequently produced biologically from sulfate in sewers e g zhang et al 2008 and by anaerobic processes within treatment plants e g isa et al 1986 the amount of hydrogen sulfide produced is a function of the sulfate content in wastewater which is variable and depends on factors such as industrial wastewater discharges drinking water source water and the coagulant used for drinking water treatment in coastal regions sulfate concentrations in wastewater increase due to seawater infiltration into both groundwater reservoirs used as drinking water sources and wastewater collection systems a phenomenon that will be magnified by global climate change sea level rise and projected population growth along coasts these increases all lead to increased sulfide loads to wastewater treatment plants the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process incorporates sulfur driven denitrification to achieve nitrogen removal and is now deployed at the demonstration scale wang et al 2009 wu et al 2016 the sani process takes advantage of increased wastewater sulfide concentrations that are present due to the practice of using seawater for toilet flushing it has lower space requirements wu et al 2016 lower sludge production wu et al 2016 and reduced nitrous oxide emissions yang et al 2016 compared to conventional nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification however despite the progress with sulfur driven denitrification more research is needed to understand how sulfide impacts nitrification and more specifically nitritation sulfide is a known inhibitor of nitrification and has specifically been shown to differentially inhibit ammonium oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria bejarano ortiz et al 2015 erguder et al 2008 kouba et al 2017 however estimates of inhibition constants vary significantly in this study we associate the variability in experimentally determined sulfide inhibition with microbial community dynamics specifically we evaluated the impact of sulfide on the kinetics of nitrite oxidation and ammonium oxidation independently using biomass from two full scale treatment plants that use different treatment processes and compared our kinetic observations with the differences we found in the underlying microbial community ecology our results suggest that sulfide may be a useful selective inhibitor of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for treatment systems but this depends on the composition and diversity of the nob communities 2 methods 2 1 batch experimental design eight hour batch experiments were performed on freshly collected activated sludge april june 2016 from two local wastewater treatment plants wwtps an extended aeration process novi michigan usa and an a2o anaerobic anoxic aerobic ann arbor michigan usa process with process and performance characteristics shown in table 1 both treatment plants have experienced sulfide induced corrosion in either the collection system lift station or grit chamber activated sludge was collected from the aerobic tank in the same location at approximately the same time of day 1 h for each experiment batch experiments were conducted at five target sulfide concentrations for each wwtp 2 4 8 15 and 35 mg l as s for the a2o process and 2 5 10 15 and 35 mg l as s for the extended aeration process these concentrations are consistent with baseline sulfur levels typically found in domestic wastewater 6 17 mg l as s burton et al 2014 each batch experiment had ten flasks duplicate sulfide free controls with ammonium duplicate sulfide free controls with nitrite triplicate sulfide and ammonium amended cultures and triplicate sulfide and nitrite amended cultures flasks were covered with aluminium foil and maintained in the dark in a shaking water bath set to 25 c at a shaking speed which had been determined to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations above 2 mg l to initiate batch experiments 1 2 l of activated sludge was washed using three centrifugation 7500 g and resuspension steps in a 0 12 m phosphate buffer 3 2 g l kh2po4 13 7 g l na2hpo4 ph 7 5 batch media was prepared ahead of time and left in an anaerobic chamber overnight it was prepared using 1000x dilutions of four separate stock solutions

stock solution consisted of 10 g l naedta and the divalent cation stock solution consisted of per liter cacl2 2h2o 5 0 g mgcl2 6h2o 33 g sufficient ammonium bicarbonate was added to the ammonium amended batches to achieve an initial concentration of 50 mg n l and sodium nitrite was added to the nitrite amended batches to achieve an initial concentration of 20 mg n l nitrite n concentrations and ammonium n concentrations were chosen to be representative of mainstream wastewater treatment plants using nitritation processes at the ph measured across all samples and experiments average 7 71 0 10 free nitrous acid concentrations were calculated to be 5 10 7 mg hno2 n l at most well below inhibitory free nitrous acid concentrations for nitrite oxidizers 0 023 mg hno2 n l vadivelu et al 2006 similarly the maximum free ammonia concentration was calculated to be 1 3 mg nh3 n l which is below the inhibitory free ammonia concentration for ammonia oxidizers 10 100 mg nh3 n l anthonisen et al 1976 sulfide was added to each flask individually using a 5 g s l stock the sulfide stock was made in the glove box using a sodium sulfide nonahydrate salt following sulfide addition flasks were quickly moved from the anaerobic chamber to a fume hood to reduce the available reaction time between sulfide and iron which can cause sulfide precipitation iron was added separately from the other trace metals just prior 2 min to initiating batch experiments iron iii stock concentration 6 5 g l fecl3 6h2o was added 100 Î¼l to each flask and followed immediately by sampling to determine the initial sulfide concentration we found that between adding the sulfide in the glove box and the initial sulfide measurement we lost an average of 14 19 of the sulfide added supplementary information tables s2 and s3 possibly due to abiotic losses such as precipitation alvarez et al 2007 and or stripping suleimenov and krupp 1994 experiments were initiated by adding thirty ml of the washed biomass to each flask to make a final batch volume of 100 ml 2 2 sample collection and analysis all samples were collected by first moving the flask from the water bath to the stir plate to ensure samples were taken from a completely mixed system ten milliliter samples were collected for nitrogen analysis at 2 min 30 min 2 h 4 h and 8 h into the experiment samples were pelleted at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 c and the supernatant was filtered using a washed 0 45 Î¼m nitrocellulose filter fisher scientific an aliquot of each filtered sample was acidified to a ph of 3 using 1 n hcl for ammonium analysis via the phenate method 4500 nh3 f apha et al 2005 nitrite was determined using the colorimetric method 4200 no2 b and nitrate and sulfate were measured using the ion chromatography method 4110 b apha et al 2005 samples for sulfide analysis were collected separate from the samples taken for nitrogen analyses at the following time points immediately after iron addition at 2 min 30 min 2 h and 4 h into the experiment all samples were collected stored and analysed according to method 4500 s2 g apha et al 2005 samples were collected into a syringe containing 2 ml of sulfide antioxidant buffer 2x final sample dilution immediately transferred to the anaerobic chamber filtered using a washed 0 45 Î¼m nitrocellulose filter fisher scientific and preserved in the dark until analysis within 24 h the sulfide antioxidant buffer was stored in the anaerobic chamber in an amber bottle and prepared as described in standard methods by combining 67 g of disodium edta 35 g of ascorbic acid and 200 ml of 1 n sodium hydroxide into deoxygenated milli q water to 1 l final volume apha et al 2005 sulfide was analysed using a silver sulfide electrode thermo scientific orion that was calibrated with a 3 w v sodium sulfide stock solution ricca chemical company method 4500 s2 g apha et al 2005 two biomass samples one for dna analysis one for cdna analysis 1 ml each were collected for microbial community analysis from each flask between 2 5 h and 3 75 h into the experiment to represent a time point when nitrogenous substrates had not been depleted samples were collected by moving the flask to a stir plate and pipetting the samples into nuclease free microcentrifuge tubes samples were immediately pelleted at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 c the supernatant was discarded and one sample was resuspended in rnalater qiagen valencia ca all samples were stored at 80 c until nucleic acids were extracted volatile suspended solids vss were analysed at the end of the experiment supplementary information table s4 and used to normalize rates of oxidation rates of nitrification Î¼ were determined by taking the slope of the linear range of nitrate concentrations for nitrite amended cultures or the sum of nitrite and nitrate concentrations for ammonium amended cultures data used to take rates of nitrification are shown in supplementary information figs s2 and s3 the linear range was between the 34 18 min and 7 0 1 0 h sample points r 2 0 97 0 04 2 3 estimation of inhibition parameters we modeled inhibition of aob and nob using a noncompetitive inhibition model previous studies on nitrification inhibition showed that volatile sulfur compounds inhibit ammonia monooxygenase noncompetitively hyman et al 1990 and this model was used for sulfide inhibition of both aob and nob kouba et al 2017 consequently there is prior evidence that this model form with sulfide inhibition is reasonable under the noncompetitive inhibition model the rate of growth under inhibited conditions Î¼inh is 1 Î¼ i n h Î¼ m a x s 1 i k i k s s where Î¼max is the uninhibited maximum specific growth rate s is the concentration of electron donor which in this case is ammonium or nitrite i is the concentration of inhibitor which for this study was the measured sulfide concentration just prior to biomass addition ki is the inhibition constant and ks is the half saturation constant in the absence of an inhibitor the rate of growth in the controls Î¼cont simplifies to conventional monod kinetics 2 Î¼ c o n t Î¼ m a x s k s s therefore the rate in the sulfide amended cultures normalized to the controls reduces to 3 Î¼ i n h Î¼ c o n t 1 1 i k i sulfide is a reactive inhibitor therefore the nitrifying populations were exposed to lower concentrations of sulfide on average than the concentrations used in our model supplementary information tables s2 and s3 thus by using measured sulfide concentration at the beginning of the experiment for i our ki estimates represent conservative estimates of nitrification inhibition equation 3 was fit to our data using the nonlinear squares function in the r environment r core team 2016 and the line of best fit was used for the estimate 2 4 estimation of biological and abiotic rates of sulfide oxidation to estimate the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic sulfide oxidation in the batch experiments we applied a model developed by nielsen ah et al 2004 2006 for sewer networks the model accounts for the effect of ph and temperature on chemical and biological sulfide oxidation biological oxidation was best described using a power equation the authors developed calibration constants from two separate sewer systems we applied this model along with the parameters they estimated for the dissolved oxygen temperature and ph used for our batch experiments 2 5 nucleic acid extractions and qpcr dna and rna were extracted from biomass collected during batch experiments exposed to three different levels of sulfide below the inhibition constant for nob inhibition between the nob and aob inhibition constants and above the aob inhibition constant nucleic acid extractions were performed using three bead beading steps followed by extraction with a maxwell 16 lev automated nucleic acid extractor promega madison wi with the dna blood and simply rna tissue kits respectively extractions were performed following manufacturer s instructions with a few modifications the manufacturer s lysis buffer was replaced with qiagen lysis buffer rlt to increase the buffer volume 600 Î¼l total volume for the rna extraction the dnase 1 solution volume was doubled to 10 Î¼l to remove contaminating dna total dna and rna concentrations in all samples were quantified by nanodrop thermoscientific waltham ma and verified by qubit invitrogen waltham ma rna extracts were treated with a second dnase step using a dna free dna removal kit ambion foster city ca to further remove contaminating dna two approaches were used to confirm no dna contamination of rna extracts i the absence of amplifiable dna was confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr of the 16s rrna gene methods described in the supplementary information section 3 and ii qubit was used to confirm that dna was below detection limits lastly rna was reverse transcribed to produce complimentary dna cdna using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit according to the manufacturer s instructions life technologies grand island ny 2 6 qpcr sequencing and microbial community analysis bacterial ammonia monooxygenase amoa 16s rrna and nitrospira nitrite oxidoreductase nxrb genes were quantified from cdna and dna using qpcr standards for the qpcr reaction were obtained using purified products from pcr reactions for each wastewater treatment plant samples and standards were analyzed in triplicate and each qpcr plate had a positive control dna extracts from a nitrifying enrichment culture for amoa and nxrb stadler and love 2016 or genomic dna from pseudomonas aeruginosa culture for 16s and duplicate no template controls details on qpcr standard preparation and qpcr conditions are given in the supplementary information section 3 1 amplicon sequencing of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was performed with dna and cdna using the illumina miseq miseq reagent kit v2 500 cycles illumina inc san diego ca platform and the previously developed dual indexing sequencing strategy kozich et al 2013 twenty Î¼l pcr reactions were performed using the following conditions 1 Î¼l template 5 Î¼l primers at a concentration of 4 Î¼m 0 15 Î¼l accuprime hifi polymerase 2 Î¼l accuprime pcr buffer ii 11 85 Î¼l molecular grade water illumina sequencing results were analyzed using mothur version 1 38 1 following the miseq sop kozich et al 2013 schloss et al 2009 with two exceptions data were rarefied only for ordination analysis and archaea were included in the analysis in addition to aligning sequences to the silva database release 123 sequences were aligned to a custom 16s rrna sequence database of known nitrifiers created from the ncbi database using blast the database was created march 14th 2016 and has been uploaded as a supplementary file this additional step was used to identify nitrifier otus that are unclassified or unknown based on the silva database all hits had over 230 base pair alignment lengths e values below 4e 115 and bit scores above 405 in addition hits were compared with the entire non redundant ncbi database using blast to ensure that the nitrifying taxonomic assignment was the best available assignment from this analysis no ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were identified in either treatment plant therefore only aob are considered 2 7 prediction of precipitates formed precipitation reactions were predicted using the sweep function in visual minteq version 3 1 gustafsson 2012 a tableau was created for the media used for the batch cultures and possible chemical precipitates were identified and include iron sulfide molybdenum disulfide wurtzite covellite manganese ii sulfide cobalt sulfide nickel sulfide acanthite chalcocite galena pyrite spharelite chalcopyrite the species tableau is available in supplementary information table s1 equilibrium was determined across 100 concentrations of hs between 0 and 32 mg l as s 2 8 statistical analysis data analysis was conducted in the r environment r core team 2016 statistical comparisons between inhibition model coefficients were done using a two sided t test differences between copy numbers from qpcr data were tested using spearman s rank coefficient to evaluate differences in microbial community structure due to the presence of sulfide relative abundances of samples were standardized to median sequencing depth across all the samples sparse data were removed by pruning otus with fewer than 5 reads across all the samples following this sulfide amended cdna relative abundances were normalized to the average cdna relative abundance in the sulfide free controls for each batch experiment principal coordinate analysis on the bray curtis similarity matrix was plotted using the phyloseq package in r mcmurdie and holmes 2013 overall changes in the microbial community structure under different sulfide concentrations were tested using permutational manova 999 permutations based on the bray curtis similarity index using the vegan package in r oksanen et al 2007 following this exploratory data analysis a subsequent analysis was conducted using the deseq2 package love et al 2014 mcmurdie and holmes 2014 for this analysis instead of normalizing to the sulfide free controls or median sequencing depth 16s rrna cdna abundances were normalized using the negative binomial model which accounts for differences in library sizes mcmurdie and holmes 2014 the wald parametric test was used to find significant associations between taxa cdna abundances and sulfide love et al 2014 mcmurdie and holmes 2014 the otus that were determined to be statistically significant and were unclassified otus were compared against the ncbi database however more resolution on the taxonomic assignment could not be obtained all p values given were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the benjamani hochberg correction 3 results and discussion 3 1 nob from full scale treatment systems show different levels of sulfide inhibition sulfide undergoes many abiotic and biological transformations that can occur very rapidly and the loss of sulfide influences how inhibition is modeled when applying the model developed by nielson et al at minimum and maximum sulfide concentrations 2004 2006 we found that abiotic 1 2 and 16 mg s l hr and biotic 2 1 and 37 mg s l hr rates of sulfide oxidation are within the same order of magnitude and can thus simultaneously drive sulfide oxidation inhibition of nitrification was maintained throughout the experiment even after sulfide was lost i e the slopes of lines were constant supplementary information figs s2 and s3 and tables s2 and s3 experimentally determining kinetic rates for reactive inhibitors such as sulfide can be tricky as inhibition constants are impacted by the startup procedure and how sulfide is defined in the inhibition model due to the rapid reactivity and subsequent loss of sulfide it is important to underscore that the sulfide concentrations used to fit our inhibition model were measured at the beginning of each batch experiment which captures any immediate losses due to precipitation or aerobic oxidation between adding sulfide and the time zero measurement therefore our estimated inhibition constants are conservative estimates of nitrification inhibition all previous studies of nitrifier inhibition use the concentrations of sulfide they applied rather than measuring sulfide at time zero as we did and therefore do not account for rapid sulfide loss bejarano ortiz et al 2015 bejarano ortiz et al 2013 kouba et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 consequently these studies tend to overestimate inhibition constants we conclude that our estimates are reasonable and offer a realistic estimate of relative inhibition differences between aob and nob cultures nitrification in both plants was inhibited by sulfide and is characterized in fig 1 based on the initial bulk liquid sulfide concentration present when biomass was first exposed the range 95 confidence intervals of ki estimates across both treatment plants for aob was between 7 8 and 14 mg l as s while the ki for nob was between 2 4 and 6 7 mg l as s the lower ki value for nob compared to aob in both treatment plants p t test 0 05 indicates that nob were more sensitive to sulfide than aob our results are consistent with previous studies that showed nob to be more sensitive to sulfide than aob erguder et al 2008 bejarano ortiz et al 2015 found lower inhibition constants 0 22 mg l as s for nob and 2 54 mg l as s for aob using biomass from an enrichment culture real wastewater microbial communities may be better adapted to sulfide resulting in higher sulfide inhibition constants another study obtained inhibition parameters almost an order of magnitude higher than the parameters we estimated 10 mg l as s for nob and 150 mg l as s for aob kouba et al 2017 perhaps reflecting either a more sulfide resistant nitrifying community or overestimation due to the use of applied rather than measured sulfide concentrations in their inhibition model other studies using lab scale nitrifying cultures beristain cardoso et al 2010 or activated sludge zhou et al 2014 have only quantified inhibition of complete nitrification and obtained similar inhibition parameters 10 13 mg s l to those we have obtained for aob while the extent of inhibition is variable differential inhibition of aob and nob in reactors is consistent across processes with different redox environments and microbial communities given the variability in the parameter values calibration and validation are needed before applying inhibition constants from one community to another community in modeling efforts overall these comparisons show that the response of nitrifying communities to sulfide is community specific by pairing the analysis of inhibition with an analysis of the microbial community we can infer how different nitrifying populations respond to sulfide understanding the direct and indirect mechanisms of sulfide inhibition can help elucidate whether sulfide inhibition can be harnessed over the long term we first consider possible indirect mechanisms of nitrification inhibition such as precipitation of sulfide with trace metals and oxygen deficiencies due to sulfide oxidation using equilibrium speciation modeling we evaluated the possibility that sulfide induced precipitative loss of trace metals that are enzymatic cofactors for ammonia monooxygenase copper zinc and iron gilch et al 2009 zahn et al 1996 and nitrite oxidoreductase iron and molybdenum meincke et al 1992 contributed to the inhibition we observed in the media used for the batch experiments the model predicts that ammonia monooxygenase cofactors copper and zinc precipitate at lower sulfide concentrations than the nitrite oxidoreductase cofactor molybdenum fig s1 while precipitation did occur and could have contributed to the inhibition patterns observed our model predictions suggest that if precipitation was controlling inhibition then aob would have been inhibited at lower sulfide concentrations than nob consequently abiotic precipitation does not appear to be the primary mechanism of differential inhibition between ammonium oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers next we looked at the oxygen demand that sulfide exerts and asked if it could have limited growth of nitrifying bacteria by causing a deficiency in dissolved oxygen supplementary information section 4 table s6 based on stoichiometric estimates the oxygen demands of sulfide oxidation are significant at a maximum the oxygen diverted to sulfide could have oxidized 2 5 times the total amount of ammonium that was oxidized in the 25 mg s l for the extended aeration process on the other hand nitrite oxidation was more affected by the loss of oxygen at a maximum the oxygen diverted to sulfide could have oxidized 8 times the total amount of nitrite that was oxidized in the 15 mg s l batch for the a2o process however this analysis assumes all sulfide was oxidized by oxygen and none precipitated or went to the gas phase furthermore sulfide was oxidized very rapidly supplementary information tables s2 and s3 and therefore this stochiometric effect should have been short lived we did not observe a change in nitrification rate once sulfide was lost indicating this is probably not the primary inhibition mechanism lastly we consider direct enzymatic inhibition by quantifying the expression of the ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase genes using rt qpcr we did not observe statistically significant associations between cdna gene copy numbers and sulfide concentration supplementary information fig s4 section 3 the relationship between transcriptional activity and protein abundances is complex and transcriptional activity may not correlate with enzymatic activity moran et al 2013 for example the inhibitor may change the conformation of the enzyme baumann et al 1997 a mechanism proposed previously for the inhibition of the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme by carbon disulfide and thiourea hyman et al 1990 wood et al 1981 an enzyme conformation change could explain why inhibition was maintained after sulfide was no longer detected in the batch reactors the time to recover from a conformational change may be particularly slow for nitrifiers because of their slow growth rates while we cannot decipher the exact mechanism of sulfide inhibition our results support the need for more in depth pure culture and proteomic for example experiments to further elucidate sulfide induced inhibition mechanisms between different aob and nob taxa 3 2 the nob communities from the two treatment plants had distinct structures the observation that nob inhibition by sulfide differed among the two full scale treatment processes p t test 0 05 whereas aob inhibition kinetics were not different p t test 0 9 may be due to differences in the composition of the nitrite oxidizing communities between the two plants fig 2 shows aob and nob activity levels in both source biomasses based on cdna generated from rrna it reveals that while transcriptionally active ammonium oxidizers in both plants are dominated by nitrosomonas the a2o process has more diverse transcriptionally active nitrite oxidizers and was therefore more functionally redundant with respect to nitrite oxidation than the extended aeration process increased functional redundancy within microbial communities can lead to more resilient communities girvan et al 2005 our work is consistent with this notion since the culture from the a2o system had greater resistance to sulfide inhibition than the extended aeration process ki nob a2o ki nob ea while enhanced microbial diversity in wastewater treatment plants has been explored as a strategy to improve process performance johnson et al 2014 our results suggest that increasing diversity of nob may have undesirable effects on nitritation systems the more sulfide resistant nob community in the a2o process may be due to differences in the active nob populations between the two treatment plants while both plants reported a history of sulfide related corrosion in their collection systems the a2o process has temporal changes in redox conditions that create environments favorable for sustaining sulfide for extended time periods zhou et al 2014 possibly exerting a selective pressure on the nitrite oxidizers in the a2o process the extended aeration treatment plant is dominated by the nob family nitrospira that appears to be more sensitive to sulfide than the nitrotoga that dominate the a2o plant and possibly the nitrobacter nob also present in the a2o biomass it is worth noting that some nitrospira species uniquely possess the genetic inventory for sulfur oxidation lÃ¼cker et al 2013 though no studies have found metabolic evidence for this function nitrite oxidation by nitrospira may be inherently more sensitive to inhibitors blackburne et al 2007 found nitrospira to be more sensitive to free ammonia and free nitrous acid than nitrobacter this difference in inhibition characteristics between nitrospira and nitrobacter could potentially be explained by the location of the substrate binding unit of the nitrite oxidoreductase enzyme nxr within the cell in nitrospira the nxr is periplasmic while in nitrobacter the nxr is cytoplasmic therefore the cell membrane may protect nitrobacter since the charged hs molecule must first enter the cell this explanation does not hold for nitrotoga which also has a periplasmic nxr nowka et al 2015 and dominates the a2o nitrite oxidizer microbial community our results suggest that not all nob are equal with respect to sulfide inhibition the differing metabolic capacities physiologies and ecological niches of nob leads to different sulfide inhibition characteristics and unraveling these differences between nob is an important area of future research 3 3 sulfide impacted the activity of non nitrifying microorganisms within the community considering inhibition of nitrifying populations without considering the effect of the inhibitor on the overall microbial community may miss important interdependencies between nitrifiers and associated populations sulfide is both an energetically favorable electron donor and inhibits some microbial processes consequently it can have complex effects on the overall microbial community while sulfide did not significantly change the composition of the microbial community over the course of the batch tests based on sequencing of 16s rrna genes permutational manova on bray curtis similarity p 0 07 r 2 0 05 fig s5 the active microbial community based on sequencing of 16s rrna cdna shifted due to sulfide fig s6 the active microbial communities had statistically significant correlations with sulfide concentration based on the permutational manova on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix p 0 001 r 2 0 12 stratified by the wastewater treatment plant the small effect size r 2 indicates that only a small proportion of the otus in the studied communities were affected by the initial sulfide concentration since we found that sulfide affects microbial community activity 16s rrna and not composition 16s rrna gene over the time scales of these experiments we focused on the cdna data to evaluate which otus were associated with sulfide using the deseq2 package we found 55 otus with normalized cdna abundances that statistically significantly correlated with initial sulfide concentration wald test p 0 05 the changes in relative activity of these otus due to sulfide are shown in fig 3 interestingly despite a loss of nitrifying activity none of the nitrifying otus had statistically significant associations between 16s rrna relative activity and sulfide and are therefore absent from fig 3 based on both spearmans rank and wald test p 0 05 a lack of association between 16s rrna and activity has previously been observed in pure cultures of aob under stressed conditions bollmann et al 2005 chandran and love 2008 but we know of no similar studies with nob the lack of association between the expression of the ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase genes observed in this study is an independent measurement that is consistent with the absence of nitrifying otus in fig 3 in contrast many otus that were positively associated with sulfide have been implicated in sulfur cycling such as desulfonema and desulfovibrio members of the desulfovibrio family have also been shown to oxidize sulfide fuseler et al 1996 and have been implicated in sulfide oxidation using dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra thorup and schramm 2017 similarly members of the planctomycetacaea family are involved in sulfur cycling elshahed et al 2007 the rhodocyclacaea otu with a positive association with initial sulfide concentration was categorized at the genus level to be dechloromonas which also may contain sulfur oxidation genes salinero et al 2009 many more statistically significantly associated otus p wald 0 05 were negatively associated 48 otus with initial sulfide concentration than were positively associated 7 otus suggesting sulfide inhibition the changes in activity we observed indicate that sulfide induced microbial community shifts however there is additional research to be done on the relationship if any between the community shifts and nitrification inhibition 4 summary and potential applications as the population in coastal cities increases and nitrogen regulations become more stringent innovations that lead to more energy efficient nitrogen management will be increasingly valuable sulfide in wastewater can be harnessed to implement nitritation processes via the differential inhibition of aob and nob existing treatment processes that use varying redox environments including anoxic and anaerobic zones or that maintain low do conditions will also support environments where nitrifiers could be inhibited by sulfide mainstream nitritation due to sulfide could also be supported in emerging technologies such as the sani process mainstream anammox or mainstream anaerobic processes mccarty et al 2011 that are known to produce variable and sometimes high concentrations of sulfide delgado vela et al 2015 additionally amid water stress more densely populated coastal communities may consider seawater toilet flushing and harnessing sulfide during wastewater treatment liu et al 2016 as nitrogen regulations become more stringent and energy conservation in wastewater treatment systems becomes a priority sulfide may help reduce energy requirements of nitrogen removal by suppressing nob and supporting shortcut nitrogen removal technologies future research is needed to understand if nitritation can be maintained in a continuously fed system since long term feeding of sulfide could lead to both physiological adaptation or selection for sulfide resistant nitrifying populations we showed that applying sulfide for the support of nob suppression requires knowledge of the underlying nitrite oxidizing community by linking inhibition parameters to the nitrifying community our results show that a more diverse nitrite oxidizing community is more resistant to sulfide inhibition and that nitrospira rich communities are more sensitive to sulfide inhibition further we found that sulfide impacts the activity of the microbial community suggesting that sulfide has impacts on the wastewater treatment processes that have yet to be identified 5 conclusions nitrite oxidizing bacteria are more sensitive to sulfide than ammonia oxidizing microorganisms in the two processes considered distinct communities of nitrite oxidizing bacteria showed different responses to sulfide consistent with nitrospira being more sensitive to sulfide than nitrobacter and nitrotoga sulfide affects microbial community activity and many otus had

19606,the feasibility of using spent coffee ground scg as a new bulking agent for biodrying of dewatered sludge ds was investigated in comparison with two other frequently used bulking agents air dried sludge as and sawdust sd results showed that the moisture contents mc of 16 day ds biodrying with as trial a scg trial b and sd trial c decreased from 70 14 wt 68 25 wt and 71 63 wt to 59 12 wt 41 35 wt and 57 69 wt respectively in case of trial b the mc rapidly decreased to 46 16 wt with the highest water removal 70 87 within 8 days because of the longest high temperature period 5 8 days further studies indicated that the abundant biodegradable volatile solids bvs and high dissolved organic matter dom contents in scg were the main driving forces for water removal according to pyrosequencing data firmicutes most of which were recognized as thermophiles was rapidly enriched on day 8 and became the dominant phylum in trial b four thermophilic genera bacillus ureibacillus geobacillus and thermobifida which can produce thermostable hydrolytic extracellular enzymes were the most abundant in trial b indicating that these thermophilic bacteria evolved during the long high temperature period enhanced the biodegradation of bvs in scg the 8 day biodried product of trial b was demonstrated to be an excellent solid fuel with low heating value lhv of 9284 kj kg 1 which was 2 1 and 1 8 times those of biodried products with as and sd respectively thus scg was found to be an excellent bulking agent accelerating ds biodrying and producing a solid fuel with a high calorific

shifted from traditional disposal to energy recovery ma et al 2016 in wastewater treatment plants wwtp thickened sludge is in general mechanically dewatered however this dewatered sludge ds still contains much water with typical moisture contents mc of 80 85 wt and thus cannot be directly used as a solid fuel cai et al 2016b recently biodrying has been emerged as a pretreatment method for lowering mc of organic wastes even so it does not seem that direct biodrying of ds is technically feasible because not only mc is too high but also biodegradable volatile solids bvs content and porosity are low zhao et al 2011 to address these problems bulking agents are commonly mixed with ds to enhance free air space fas and to adjust the initial mc into optimal ranges because it is easy and inexpensive to obtain in large quantities straw zhao et al 2011 sawdust sd yang et al 2014 wheat residues li et al 2015 rice husks zhang et al 2015 and wood shavings huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 villegas and huiliÃ±ir 2014 have frequently been used as bulking agents for sewage sludge biodrying however uses of these bulking agents have resulted in insufficient heat production accompanying low temperature profiles and or short high temperature periods these lignocellulosic bulking agents are sparingly soluble in water and consequently concentrations of dissolved organic matters dom contributed by the bulking agents are low thus diverse nutrients required for microbial metabolism are not sufficiently provided by these bulking agents zhang et al 2015 it also needs to notice that mixtures of ds and these less soluble materials are not homogenous zhao et al 2011 furthermore lignocellulose is resistant to microbial degradation huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 zhao et al 2011 therefore efforts for finding new bulking agents exhibiting high biodegradation potentials high dom contents appropriate fas and good degrees of homogeneity have been continued zhao et al 2011 reported that straw performed better than sd as a bulking agent for ds biodrying because of its high biodegradation potential in the aerobic process however the final mc was high 50 55 wt despite that the biodrying continued as long as for two weeks yang et al 2014 achieved high water removal 55 1 by using air dried sludge as as a bulking agent however the preparation of as is time consuming at least 2 weeks in ambient atmosphere which brings difficulties for large scale ds biodrying yang and jahng 2015 yang et al 2014 besides the as contains 20 50 wt of inorganic materials such as sand and metal oxides han et al 2015 huang et al 2015 which may cause problems in process operation and produce low energy biodried products spent coffee ground scg is a solid residue generated during the production of espresso or hydro soluble coffees murthy and naidu 2012 according to the international coffee organization ico around 9 1 million tons of coffee bean were consumed in 2016 ico 2017 generally 550 670 kg of scg are produced from 1 ton of coffee bean park et al 2016 therefore over 5 8 million tons of scg are generated every year although scg is abundant in nutrients it is barely used for feeding domestic animals because polyphenols tannins and caffeine are contained in it ulloa rojas et al 2003 therefore most of scg has been discarded as a valueless waste without any treatment because efficient methods to handle the enormous amount have not been available park et al 2016 recently several attempts have been made to compost hachicha et al 2012 sÃ¡nchez et al 1999 and co compost with scg for horticultural use without phytotoxic effects of direct application of scg to soils hardgrove and livesley 2016 santos et al 2017 in addition it was found that scg accelerated process rates and augmented microorganisms in composting emmanuel et al 2017 zhang and sun 2017 besides scg was also used as a feedstock for production of various biofuels by anaerobic digestion kim et al 2017 biodiesel trans esterification park et al 2016 combustion chen et al 2017 and pyrolysis li et al 2014 attention is being increasingly paid to scg management to meet its ever increasing production nonetheless few studies have focused on scg as a bulking agent for biodrying considering its availability biodegradability and high calorific value 21 mj kg 1 chen et al 2017 scg is thought to be a good candidate for a bulking agent in biodrying targeting solid fuel production in this study the feasibility of using scg as a bulking agent for ds biodrying was investigated and its performance was compared with two other bulking agents as and sd temperature co2 concentration in exit gas water removal vs consumption and dom variations were monitored for further comparison mass and heat balances of ds biodrying with these three bulking agents were established additionally bacterial communities developed during biodrying were analyzed by pyrosequencing high heating value hhv and low heating value lhv were also measured in order to examine the fuel characteristics of biodried products based on these investigations it was concluded that scg was an excellent bulking agent for ds biodrying 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the raw materials the ds was obtained from a belt press facility at a wwtp in yongin korea three bulking agents were prepared and used in this study the sd was purchased from a traditional market in yongin korea and used without any further treatment as was prepared by spreading the ds under the ambient atmosphere and dried for a couple of weeks until the mc became constant yang et al 2014 scg was collected from local coffee shops and thermally dried until the mc reduced lower than 10 wt which was close to those of as and sd particle sizes of bulking agents were 0 05 10 mm in diameter the characteristics of the raw materials are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental equipment and process operation the laboratory biodrying reactor fig 1 used in this study was an air tight 28 3 l cylindrical vessel inner diameter of 300 mm height of 450 mm made of pmma polymethyl methacrylate insulated with 100 mm thick cotton headspace of the reactor was also filled with cotton for preventing heat loss and absorbing condensed water a perforated plate was located at the bottom of the reactor for supporting the sludge matrix and distributing air dehumidified ambient air was supplied to the bottom of the reactor the outlet gas exhausted from the top of the reactor passed through a condenser to condense the water vapor carried by the air stream prior to reaching a gas analyzer multi master sensoronic co korea a thermocouple was installed in the middle of the sludge pile and the temperature was recorded every 1 h onto a data recorder biodrying was conducted in the described reactor filled with 10 kg of feedstock for preparing the feedstock for biodrying ds and each bulking agent were thoroughly mixed manually with the mixing ratio of 4 1 w w wet basis for 60 min ds mixed with bulking agents of as scg and sd were labeled as trial a trial b and trial c the working volumes were 15 0 l 17 0 l and 23 5 l for trials a b and c due to the density differences of the bulking agents the airflow rate was kept at 4 l min 0 075m3 kg 1 total solids ts h 1 during biodrying the biodrying pile was manually turned every four days and the samples were taken after turning for analyzing mc vs dom and bacterial community 2 3 pyrosequencing and data processing genomic dna was extracted from 100 to 200 mg of wet sample by using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions for efficient polymerase chain reaction pcr the extracted dna was purified with the mo bio powerclean dna clean up kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa fusion primers with different barcodes and amplification procedure for the v1 v3 region of the 16s bacterial rrna gene were described previously yang and jahng 2015 the pcr products were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen gmbh germany and the concentration of pcr amplicon was quantified by using a spectrophotometer nanodrop nd 1000 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the pyrosequencing was carried out by the chunlab inc seoul korea using the 454 gs junior sequencing system 454 life science branford ct usa the obtained sequence data were analyzed using the clcommunity software chunlab inc korea to reveal bacterial community structures the amplicons were subjected to a filtering process by which the sequences shorter than 300 bp and of average quality value less than 25 were removed eztaxon e database and a robust global pairwise sequence alignment coupled with blastn were used for the taxonomic assignment of sequencing reads following de gannes et al 2013 the sequences were assigned to operational taxonomic unit otus with 97 identity as cai et al 2016a did the alpha diversity indices community richness index of chao1 and diversity index of shannon and coverage estimate were calculated based on the mothur program wang et al 2017 de gannes et al 2013 2 4 sample collection and analytical methods mc and vs content of the raw materials and mixtures during biodrying were determined according to yang and jahng 2015 by collecting triplicates of 20 g samples the calorific values or hhv were measured using an oxygen bomb calorimeter parr 6400 parr instrument co moline il usa and low heating values lhv was calculated according to he 2011 bulk density was measured by weighing the mass of the sample with known volume yang et al 2014 and fas was calculated by the reported method zhao et al 2011 elemental compositions of c n h s and o were analyzed using an elemental analyzer flash ea1112 thermo finnigan ce instruments italy after the samples were ground with a grinder to less than 0 2 mm ma et al 2016 for determining concentrations of dom including dissolved organic carbon doc and polymeric substances polysaccharides and proteins a 2 g sample was extracted using 20 ml of deionized water for 2 h in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm at room temperature chefet et al 1997 the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m nylon syringe filter ge healthcare life sciences little chalfont uk the doc concentration in the filtrate was analyzed using a toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan the polysaccharide and protein contents were measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as a reference material and by the modified bradford method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard respectively zhang et al 2015 he 2011 2 5 mass and heat balances factors and parameters used in heat and mass balances are listed in the nomenclature for the mass balance the weight changes of the mixtures and their water and vs contents were determined following the reported methods ma et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the water removal m h 2 o and the vs consumption m vs were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 the biodrying index bi which was defined as the ratio of water removal to vs consumption was calculated by eq 3 huiliÃ±ir

the entire heat flow was written as eq 4 given that the produced heat was equal to the consumed heat in the biodrying system for simplicity and accuracy of calculations the difference between biological heat generation and consumption by air stream water evaporation and matrix temperature increase was regarded as heat loss due to conduction radiation and turning q loss table 2 4 q bio q dryair q watvap q water q solid q evapo q condu q radi q turning 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the raw materials as which was prepared by air drying the ds showed different dom characteristics compared to ds table 1 its polysaccharide content increased whereas protein content decreased it was reported that the structure and composition of dissolved polymeric substances were changed during the air drying of foodstuff tian et al 2016 similarly it was speculated that the sludge floc and hydration layer of ds were shrunken and broken down as the water was evaporated during the long air drying period then the polysaccharides embedded in the floc were released and dissolved in water resulting in a higher polysaccharide content it was also suggested that the soluble proteins in the sludge were hydrolyzed by the microorganisms during air drying causing a decrease of protein content as table 1 shows the vs contents hhvs and c contents of scg and sd were much higher than those of ds and as protein was the main dom of ds and its concentration was almost twice the polysaccharide concentration this was similar to the dom characteristics of ds reported by zhang et al 2015 who conducted ds biodrying in a sludge treatment plant in case of three bulking agents polysaccharides occupied more than 80 of the total dom among three bulking agents scg showed the highest contents of doc and polysaccharides sd which has frequently been used as a bulking agent for ds biodrying showed low dom contents with a negligible content of proteins the dom contents of as were moderate among these three bulking agents dom is considered to be more easily utilized by microorganisms than solid phase organics zhang et al 2015 thus it was expected that scg might accelerate the ds biodrying when used as a bulking agent in addition the high contents of c 51 62 wt dry basis and vs 97 98 wt dry basis and hhv 22 843 kj kg 1 of scg would be beneficial for the subsequent combustion of biodried products 3 2 temperature and co2 evolution temperature is important for the biodrying process because it affects water evaporation and vs degradation to illustrate the biodrying process more clearly the 16 day biodrying was divided into four stages as the matrix was turned three times during this period although temperatures rapidly increased without lag phases the temperature profiles of biodrying with different bulking agents were quite different fig 2 a when as was used as a bulking agent trial a temperature reached the peak of 68 1 c after 34 h and high temperature period 45 c continued for about 2 5 days then the temperature gradually decreased to a low level of around 35 c before the first turning after the first turning temperature rebounded 32 3 c slightly it was thought that biodrying of trial a ceased on day 8 because temperature no longer increased even after the second turning in trial b with scg as a bulking agent the two temperature peaks 63 3 c and 64 1 c in stage 1 were lower than that of trial a however the high temperature period of trial b lasted for 5 8 days which was much longer than trial a several studies on composting also found that adding scg prolonged the high temperature period sÃ¡nchez et al 1999 santos et al 2017 after the second temperature peak of 68 3 c on day 4 5 the temperature of trial b gradually decreased to room temperature before the second turning similar to trial a biodrying of trial b seemed to be also completed on day 8 because the second turning exerted no noticeable influence on the temperature profile the operation periods of trials a and b were much shorter than other studies cai et al 2016a yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 trial c with sd as the bulking agent showed the lowest temperature peak 61 7 c and the shortest high temperature period in stage 1 1 8 days however the matrix temperature of trial c rebounded after the first turning on day 4 and reached the peak temperature of 50 6 c on day 11 then the temperature decreased more slowly than other trials to reach around 30 c at the end of biodrying temperature cumulation tc c day defined as the sum of temperature difference between the biodrying pile and ambient temperature was calculated by eq 5 zhao et al 2010 and shown in fig 2b in stages 1 and 2 the tc was larger in the order of trial b trial a and trial c on day 8 the tcs were 162 7 249 8 and 155 7 c day for trials a b and c respectively in stages 3 and 4 tc of trial a increased slowly to 192 3 c day on day 16 while that of trial b did not increase and the tc of trial c after day 6 increased steadily and reached 319 7 c day 5 tc i 1 n t m t a Î´ t the rapid increases of the temperature at the beginning of biodrying for all trials were thought to be caused by the microbial degradation of the bvs and the concomitant release of the metabolic heat trials a and b showed longer high temperature periods in stage 1 than trial c probably because compared to sd as and scg contained more readily bvs with that the microbial activity remained at a high level biodrying was terminated on day 8 for trials a and b since bvs was exhausted after the long high temperature periods the high temperature period of trial b was much longer than trial a indicating that more bvs for bio heat production was supplied by scg for trial c the high temperature period in stage 1 was thought to be contributed by bvs in ds because lignocellulose contained in sd was not readily biodegradable a second temperature peak of trial c might be due to that the microbial activity for cellulose degradation was slowly developed zhao et al 2010 a long lag phase was needed for the evolution of cellulose degrading bacteria ma et al 2016 resulting in the longer biodrying period for trial c fig 2 similar biodrying process with a lag phase after the first temperature peak and long lasting biodrying 14 18 days were observed by zhao et al 2010 and ma et al 2016 who conducted ds biodrying with a mixed bulking agent straw and sd mass ratio 1 1 and corncob respectively after the third turning stage 4 the matrix temperature decreased indicating that bvs was exhausted in the biodrying system of trial c yang et al 2014 as illustrated by the tc curves fig 2b it was obvious that the tc of trial b reached a high level in a shorter time than others it took at least 12 days for trial c to reach close to tc of trial b from these results it was concluded that ds biodrying was greatly accelerated by using scg as a bulking agent owing to a long high temperature period and a high tc achieved in a short time in addition to temperature co2 concentrations in the exit gas from biodrying reactors were also measured in order to monitor respiration activities of microorganisms during biodrying fig 2c in the beginning of biodrying co2 concentrations in the exit gases from all trails were 4 5 vol and then rapidly increased in trial a the co2 concentration reached the peak of 7 85 vol at 16 h in case that scg was used as a bulking agent trial b three co2 peaks emerged in the first 4 days with peak concentrations of 7 54 vol 7 76 vol and 6 25 vol on day 0 3 0 7 and 2 3 respectively the co2 concentration after day 8 was lower than 0 5 vol the first co2 concentration peak of trial c 7 28 vol appeared at around 16 h after the first turning concentration of co2 in the exit gas bounded from 0 92 vol on day 4 4 24 vol on day 11 the high co2 concentrations in the beginning of biodrying was thought to be due to the vigorous microbial degradation activity on the fresh ds increase of co2 concentrations after the first turning indicated that turning enhanced the microbial activity by eliminating the gradients of bvs moisture dissolved oxygen etc formed in the biodrying reactors in addition to the temperature the co2 fig 2c profiles confirmed that the biodrying of trials a and b was completed on day 8 in trial c the co2 profiles in stages 3 and 4 indicated that microorganisms exploited bvs from sd during this period 3 3 water removal vs consumption and fas variation variations of mc and vs were also monitored during biodrying and it was found that the bulking agents strongly influenced these parameters fig 3 after 16 days of biodrying mcs of trials a b and c decreased from 70 14 wt 68 25 wt and 71 63 wt to 59 12 wt 41 35 wt and 57 69 wt respectively in case of trial b with scg as the bulking agent the matrix temperature sharply increased to the second peak after the first turning on day 4 fig 2a and mc of the mixture decreased rapidly from 62 56 wt on day 4 46 16 wt on day 8 several studies also indicated that adding scg in composting enhanced mc reduction rolz et al 2010 zhang and sun 2017 as already mentioned above biodrying of trials a and b appeared completed on day 8 because temperature and co2 concentration returned back to basal levels fig 2 in case of trial c mc decreased steadily during the 16 days of biodrying as biodrying pile was kept warm fig 2a the vs contents of trials a b and c decreased gradually throughout the 16 days of biodrying from 75 11 90 11 and 88 58 69 06 86 17 and 82 78 respectively in trial a although the feedstock had a low vs content it was obvious that vs decreased faster in stage 1 from 75 11 to 71 23 than other stages in case of trial b sharp decrease of vs lasted longer from 90 11 on day 0 85 89 on day 8 than that of trial a on the contrary trial c did not show remarkable changes in vs during stages 1 and 2 from 88 58 on day 0 87 90 on day 8 during this period temperature kept high for a short time thereafter vs decreased rapidly during stages 3 and 4 from 87 90 on day 8 82 78 on day 16 during which moderate temperature period lasted long this might be due to that the moderate temperature sustained the active degradation of bvs in sd mainly cellulose and vice versa a similar vs consumption was also observed by zhao et al 2010 nonetheless vs content reduction fig 3b and consumption table 3 were not linearly related to temperature increase fig 2a and co2 production fig 2c because evolution of heat and co2 were determined by biodegradability and heat content of organic materials and metabolic capability of microorganisms while vs was a proximate parameter as shown in fig 3c fas in three trials increased during biodrying because a large amount of water was removed although the initial fas of trial b was obviously lower its mc decreased much more rapidly than trial c fig 3a indicating that the fas of trial b was already enough for water and air transfer while that of trial c was excessive and adverse to biodrying in a more diluted and fluffy matrix the contact between microorganism mainly in ds and bvs in sd was poor in trial c gea et al 2007 resulting in a long lag phase after the first turning fig 2a trial a with lower fas also performed efficiently in stage 1 but the limited bvs caused a short high temperature period and low water removal these results indicated that when fas was adequate the readily bvs was more important for efficient biodrying than porosity biodrying with low fas but high water removal rate would be advantageous to a real biodrying plant because the handling capacity is large while energy consumption could be reduced winkler et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 weight changes of biodrying piles during 16 day biodrying are shown in table 3 the total weight loss ratios of trials a b and c were 51 25 66 71 and 55 58 respectively the water removal ratios the mass ratios of removed water to the initial water contained in the biodrying feedstock of trials a b and c were 58 91 79 66 and 64 24 respectively trial a only removed 58 91 of the initial water with a vs consumption ratio of 38 62 most of which were accomplished in stage 1 it was suspected that water removal after day 8 was mainly caused by convective drying since the temperature was lower than 30 c fig 2a with such low temperature only 21 61 of water 0 916 kg was evaporated from day 9 to day 16 in trial a among three bulking agents scg achieved the highest water removal and vs consumption ratio was also the highest 43 45 of the initial vs from the high vs consumption it was considered that the scg supplied abundant readily bvs to the biodrying pile in trial b more than 85 of the total water removal were accomplished during 0 8 day with a high drying rate 0 61 kg d 1 similar to trial a a small amount of water 0 599 kg removed in stages 3 and 4 11 05 of total water removal was thought to be brought mainly by convective drying the water removal profiles of trial b also made it clear that biodrying removed much more water than convective drying and the high temperature was crucial for efficient drying the water removal ratio of trial c 64 24 was higher than trial a but lower than trial b and the drying rate of trial c was low only 0 29 kg d 1 because biodrying continued for 16 days low water removal of trial a indicated that the bvs contained in the as might be insufficient for biodrying low bvs was also demonstrated by the relatively low vs consumption during the entire biodrying period of trial a table 3 a relatively short high temperature period of trial a fig 2a also supported this explanation in trial c although the drying rate was stable throughout the entire period 34 43 of the total water removal was achieved in stage 1 table 3 during which temperature peak value was high the water removal and vs consumption in trial c were higher than those of trial a but not distinguished because the vs in sd was mainly slowly bvs zhao et al 2011 compared to as and sd water removal achieved for 16 days of biodrying with scg was 27 94 and 17 89 higher respectively if water removal was compared for initial 8 days trial b removed 4 825 kg of water with water removal ratio of 70 87 overwhelming trials a 3 323 kg and c 2 519 kg with water removal ratios of 46 18 and 35 14 respectively in other words scg in trial b gave rise to a high drying rate and consequently biodrying process was greatly accelerated completed on day 8 all these results proved that scg was an excellent bulking agent enabling efficient drying of ds in a short time bi the mass ratio of removed water to removed vs was also calculated in this study ma et al 2016 reported that bi values obtained from co biodrying of ds and food waste were 3 11 4 86 while zhao et al 2010 obtained bi around 6 bi could be affected by airflow rate initial mc bulking agent and biodrying feedstock huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 yang et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 as shown in table 3 for trial b with scg as a bulking agent bi of the 16 day biodrying was 4 37 which was slightly lower than those of trials a and c however bi of trial b for first 8 days 5 09 was higher than other two trials huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 reported bi of 7 10 in their study however extremely high airflow rate 0 18 m3 kg 1 ts h 1 was likely to be the main reason for the low organic loss and frequent turning once a day also gave rise to a higher water elimination results of ds biodrying obtained in this study were compared with those of other literature table 4 lignocellulosic biomass e g sd straw rice husks wood shavings and woodchips were frequently used as bulking agents for ds biodrying both in lab scale reactors and biodrying plants huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 winkler et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 biodrying periods were typically 2 3 weeks and water removals of 25 9 68 2 were achieved in those studies huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 biodried ds only for 8 days but the water removal was also only 7 6 26 4 zhao et al 2010 and li et al 2015 reported the highest water removal 68 2 and 66 4 respectively among the previously reported studies however their biodrying continued much longer 18 20 days than others trial b in this study removed 70 87 of initial water in 8 days of biodrying this water removal was utmost high among all studies in table 4 in the present study using scg as the bulking agent the final mc of the biodried product 46 16 wt was also obviously lower than other studies although the final mcs of zhang et al 2015 and winkler et al 2013 were below 50 wt their initial mcs were also low 50 55 wt it should be noted that the airflow rate in this study was moderate while the initial mcs were relatively high compared to other studies thus it was possible to claim that trial b achieved high water removal with short operation period and low energy consumption comprising all these speculations it was clear that scg showed outstanding performances in ds biodrying in a biodrying plant treatment capacity is important for both economic and environmental considerations more sludge can be loaded when the density of bulking agent is high as shown in table 1 density of scg 0 43 g cm 3 was higher than that of sd 0 18 g cm 3 the most frequently used bulking agent therefore biodrying feedstock prepared by mixing ds and scg would occupy less volume which enables a higher ds loading than feedstocks with other light bulking agents 3 4 dom evolutions as mentioned above temperature and co2 profiles were evidently different among three bulking agents fig 2 it was postulated that these differences were caused by not only bvs content but also dom evolution during biodrying because dom is known to serve as a direct nutritional source for microbes during biodrying zhang et al 2015 in this study the concentrations of doc and polymeric substances polysaccharides and proteins in the water extracts of the biodrying piles were analyzed as shown in fig 4 the contents of doc and polymeric substances increased in all trials after the high temperature period in stage 1 then contents of doc and polymeric substances of trials a and b kept high until day 16 in case of trial c the doc and the content of dissolved proteins varied along with the temperature and polysaccharide content continuously decreased after day 8 it was also obvious that the contents of doc and dissolved polymeric substances of trial c were lower than those of trials a and b during the entire biodrying period however large amounts of polymeric substances especially polysaccharides released after the first high temperature period of trial c fig 4b as shown in table 1 concentrations of doc and dissolved carbohydrates contained in as were higher than those in sd but lower than scg maximum temperature and high temperature period of trial a in stage 1 were also in the middle among 3 trials after the second turning on day 8 the temperature of trial a did not increase again fig 2a indicating that bvs of trial a was exhausted interestingly however fig 4 shows that doc and polymeric substances contents were high in the biodrying pile of trial a the high contents of dom after day 4 in trial a might be a result of microbial cell lysis during the high temperature period in stage 1 in trial c contents of doc dissolved polysaccharides and proteins were lower than the other two trials and temperature increased persistently but slowly after the first turning it was thought that microorganisms utilized cellulose and hemicellulose of sd after the first turning as the polysaccharides content was high from day 4 to day 12 the biodegradation of cellulose and hemicellulose is known to be time consuming because most cellulose and hemicellulose decomposing microorganisms grow slowly lÃ³pez mondÃ©jar et al 2016 different from trial a the dom variation of trial c was coincident with the temperature profile figs 2a and 4 scg is known to contain high vs most of which is readily biodegradable substances e g carbohydrates proteins and lipids ulloa rojas et al 2003 when scg was supplied for ds biodrying high contents of doc and polymeric substances instantaneously increased the temperature of biodrying pile and abundant bvs in scg kept the high temperature period long fig 2a as a result a large amount of water was removed in the initial 8 days table 3 after day 8 it seemed that the low mc of biodrying pile inhibited microbial activity and thus dom was not consumed in summary scg was an excellent material with high contents of doc and polymeric substances by mixing scg with ds it was possible to maintain the high temperature period long and remove water from the biodrying matrix in a short time 3 5 heat generation and utilization during biodrying the heat generation and utilization during biodrying with three bulking agents were calculated using equations in table 2 and summarized in table 5 many studies used an estimated value of 21 000 kj kg 1 vs determined by zhao et al 2010 for the average combustion heat of ds biodrying mixture although this number has widely been used for establishing heat balance huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2013 it is also clear that the combustion heat of biodrying mixture varies according to chemical composition of the biodrying pile winkler et al 2013 thus an average value may not be appropriate for the biodrying with various bulking agents in this study in order to calculate the biological heat accurately the calorific values of the biodrying mixtures were measured table 2 and used for calculating q bio during biodrying 16 033 21 582 and 18 585 kj of biological heat q bio were produced from trials a b and c respectively the q bio which is defined as the metabolic heat produced by the microorganisms depends greatly on the bvs quality and content in the biodrying pile due to high calorific value and high bvs content of scg q bio of trial b was the highest produced q bio was consumed mainly for evaporating water q evap increasing temperature of water q water and dried solid q solid contained in the biodrying matrices and heating water vapor q watervap and dry air q dryair in airflow q evap q water and q solid accounted for 57 20 65 31 8 23 12 37 and 1 23 2 12 of q bio respectively the drying efficiencies the ratio of q evapo to q bio of trials a and c were in the range of those of zhao et al 2010 and ma et al 2016 60 6 72 6 and were slightly higher than that 54 64 of li et al 2015 meanwhile more energy was consumed for water evaporation in trial b than in trials a and c but drying efficiency 57 20 of trial b was somewhat low because 23 65 of q bio were lost by radiation conduction and turning as well known heat transfer by radiation and conduction is governed by temperature of a heat body zhao et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 temperature of trial b was the highest and therefore much heat was thought to be lost by these energy transfer mechanisms if insulation of a biodrying reactor could be improved heat loss would be reduced and more energy might be utilized for water evaporation 3 6 bacterial communities biodrying is a highly dynamic process in which microorganisms play vital roles although fungi were demonstrated to be able to degrade recalcitrant substrates cai et al 2017 and lignocellulose even during the thermophilic phase only bacterial communities were analyzed because it was observed that the fungal abundance was as low as 0 05 of the total microorganisms in biodrying piles cai et al 2017 in this study the phylogenetic compositions of bacterial communities during ds biodrying with three bulking agents were analyzed through pyrosequencing first obtained sequences were used to calculate diversity indices of chao 1 and shannon as shown in table 6 valid reads of samples taken from ds and three bulking agents were in the range of 50 000 to 74 000 the most valid reads were obtained from sd and scg generated the least reads accordingly chao 1 and shannon indices of scg were extraordinarily low among raw materials of biodrying feedstock in addition number of otus with 97 identity was the highest for ds and the lowest for scg although individual components of biodrying feedstocks exhibited widely varying community characteristics otus chao 1 and shannon of fresh refer to day 0 in table 6 biodrying feedstocks of all trials even trial b containing scg were similar each other individual components this similarity indicated that ds was the main source of microorganisms in fresh biodrying feedstocks as biodrying proceeded bacterial community structures of all trials became simple as indicated by lowered diversity indices in particular the trial b showed the simplest bacterial community structure on day 8 perhaps because the biodrying pile had experienced a long period of high temperature in case of trial a the diversity indices decreased slightly because the high temperature period was short on day 4 trial c showed a higher diversity than day 0 possibly because the bacterial diversity was recovered during the long cooling phase from day 1 to day 4 even so the biodiversity of trial c decreased after the second temperature peak indicating that high temperature period raised the thermophilic bacteria but decreased bacterial diversity similar results were also observed during the biodrying processes conducted by cai et al 2016a and zhang et al 2015 fig 5 shows the phylogenetic closeness of the bacterial communities as expected from ecological indices in table 6 the bacterial community structures of three bulking agents and ds were very different while fresh biodrying mixtures and ds were clustered very closely on the dendrogram indicating again that ds was the main source of microorganisms during biodrying the bacterial communities changed as microorganisms were subject to changes of temperature nutritional conditions competitors etc on day 4 the dendrogramatic distance of trial b was the farthest to the initial feedstocks because the abundant bvs contained in scg induced the most rapid changes of bacterial community during the initial four days from these results it was inferred that scg was an excellent bulking agent for the developments of some specific microorganisms e g thermophiles which were thought to be favorable to accelerated biodrying in order to better understand bacterial communities during ds biodrying the obtained sequences were identified at phylum and genus levels as shown in fig 6 proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes were the most dominant phyla present in the biodrying matrices during the initial 4 days of biodrying the percentages of chloroflexi obviously decreased in all trials from 20 06 to 7 93 in trial a from 20 20 to 4 21 in trial b and from 23 98 to 14 73 in trial c in trials a and b the percentages of proteobacteria also decreased from 27 56 to 27 29 on day 0 10 55 and 4 99 on day 4 respectively while that in trial c remained almost constant during the entire biodrying process on the contrary firmicutes obviously increased in trials a 10 70 56 40 and b 9 99 71 96 during initial 4 days but did not change much in trial c actinobacteria did not show noticeable changes in both trials a and b but increased from 15 33 on day 0 45 28 on day 12 in trial c firmicutes enriched in trials a and b and actinobacteria enriched in trial c have been recognized as thermophiles cai et al 2016a considering temperature rise in biodrying piles evolution of thermophilic communities was not surprising however it was interesting that trial c exhibited evolution of different bacterial community the differences in phyla between trials a and b and trial c were thought to be brought by two factors firstly the biodrying mixtures with different bulking agents provided different nutrients for microbial growth zhao et al 2011 another possibility might be related with temperature of biodrying matrix as shown in fig 2 temperature of trial c varied differently from trials a and b maximum temperature and high temperature period of trial c were lower and shorter than trials a and b due to these differences in temperature environment different bacterial communities were induced for a deeper analysis of the bacterial community structures genera with abundance higher than 1 were selected as shown in fig 7 the bacterial community structures of ds and the initial mixtures on day 0 were almost identical as biodrying continued bacillus was enriched from 0 09 on day 0 36 56 on day 4 in trial a becoming the most abundant genus meanwhile other thermophilic genera including cerasibacillus sinibacillus tepidimicrobium and pseudogracilibacillus which were barely found in the fresh biodrying feedstocks also increased to relative abundances of 1 44 3 17 2 52 and 3 84 similar to trial a bacillus in trial b with scg as the bulking agent increased from 0 1 on day 0 35 94 on day 4 and remained at a high level until the high temperature period ceased on day 8 ureibacillus 6 94 geobacillus 5 51 thermobifida 4 62 symbiobacterium 4 28 planifilum 2 42 and streptomyces 2 19 were also enriched during stage 1 bacillus the dominant genus in the high temperature stages of trials a and b and ureibacillus and geobacillus enriched in trial b are known to thrive in moderately thermal environments 50 60 c and secrets various thermostable enzymes rastogi et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 other thermophilic bacteria such as thermobifida which is reportedly capable of degrading plant cell wall wilson 2004 was also enriched in trial b because scg contained a high proportion of plant cell wall polysaccharides murthy and naidu 2012 in trial c although the high temperature period continued for initial 1 8 days the bacterial community structure did not undergo dramatic changes on day 4 only a few genera including comamonas aeromonas and flavobacterium were enriched with relative abundances of 2 39 3 55 in stage 1 however bacterial community structure changed in a great extent on day 12 four genera streptomyces 27 05 chitinophaga 7 80 actinomadura 6 59 and pseudoxanthnomonas 5 51 became dominant on day 12 in the biodrying pile of trial c streptomyces is known to produce high levels of thermostable and or alkali tolerant xylanases and cellulases budihal et al 2016 pradeep et al 2013 implying that streptomyces might play important roles in the metabolism of the hemicellulose and cellulose these results demonstrated that the thermophilic bacteria in trials a and b evolved much faster than that of trial c meanwhile compared to trial a trial b enriched more thermophilic genera indicating that scg was more effective than as for developing thermophilic bacteria all these results indicated that organic substances contained in bulking agents caused the differences of bacterial community structures it was suspected that scg performed better than the other two bulking agents because various thermophilic bacteria with thermostable enzymatic activities were well developed in trial b 3 7 calorific values of biodried products biodrying aims to remove water and increase the heat content of the waste zhao et al 2010 in this context the hhv and lhv of the biodrying mixtures were measured during biodrying as shown in table 7 the lhv of trails a b and c increased by 36 3 96 8 and 73 9 respectively after 16 days of biodrying the lhv of the final product of trial b with scg was 10 162 kj kg 1 which was much higher than those of trials a and c similarly the lhv of trial b on day 8 mc 46 16 wt was 9284 kj kg 1 2 1 and 1 8 times as large as those of trials a and c respectively during biodrying hhv decreased due to vs consumption whereas lhv increased because water was removed the hhv of initial feedstock in trial a was lower than the other two because as contained less vs compared to scg and sd table 1 since solids other than vs in biomass are thought to be incombustibles huang et al 2015 vs content is important for heat contents of biodried products nonetheless biodried products for all trials were sufficient for self sustaining combustion because the biodried products contained lhv higher than 4000 kj kg 1 which was regarded as the limit for self sustaining combustion spliethoff 2010 although hhv was high lhv of biodried product of trial c was low because mc was still high fig 3a in case of trial b lhv of biodried product was high because mc was lowed more greatly than those of trials a and c fig 3a therefore it was clear that use of scg in ds biodrying resulted not only in accelerated biodrying and low final mc of biodrying pile but also in a high energy biodried product 4 conclusions in this study scg was noticed for the first time as an aid to biodrying of ds through various chemical analyses scg was characterized as an organic waste with high bvs and heat contents when scg was used as a bulking agent for ds biodrying a long high temperature period 5 8 days and a high microbial activity represented by a higher co2 concentration in outlet gas were observed as a result biodrying of ds was enhanced in terms of a high water removal 70 87 and a distinctly short operation period 8 days compared to frequently used bulking agents as and sd these excellent features were attributed to the high dom concentrations and the fast developments of thermophilic bacteria which were thought to be brought by abundant bvs contained in scg the lhv of the biodried product with scg was 9284 kj kg 1 which was 2 1 and 1 8 times as large as those of biodried products with as and sd respectively these findings suggested that scg was a promising bulking agent for ds biodrying enabling not only efficient water removal but also production of a high energy solid fuel acknowledgements this study was

19606,the feasibility of using spent coffee ground scg as a new bulking agent for biodrying of dewatered sludge ds was investigated in comparison with two other frequently used bulking agents air dried sludge as and sawdust sd results showed that the moisture contents mc of 16 day ds biodrying with as trial a scg trial b and sd trial c decreased from 70 14 wt 68 25 wt and 71 63 wt to 59 12 wt 41 35 wt and 57 69 wt respectively in case of trial b the mc rapidly decreased to 46 16 wt with the highest water removal 70 87 within 8 days because of the longest high temperature period 5 8 days further studies indicated that the abundant biodegradable volatile solids bvs and high dissolved organic matter dom contents in scg were the main driving forces for water removal according to pyrosequencing data firmicutes most of which were recognized as thermophiles was rapidly enriched on day 8 and became the dominant phylum in trial b four thermophilic genera bacillus ureibacillus geobacillus and thermobifida which can produce thermostable hydrolytic extracellular enzymes were the most abundant in trial b indicating that these thermophilic bacteria evolved during the long high temperature period enhanced the biodegradation of bvs in scg the 8 day biodried product of trial b was demonstrated to be an excellent solid fuel with low heating value lhv of 9284 kj kg 1 which was 2 1 and 1 8 times those of biodried products with as and sd respectively thus scg was found to be an excellent bulking agent accelerating ds biodrying and producing a solid fuel with a high calorific

shifted from traditional disposal to energy recovery ma et al 2016 in wastewater treatment plants wwtp thickened sludge is in general mechanically dewatered however this dewatered sludge ds still contains much water with typical moisture contents mc of 80 85 wt and thus cannot be directly used as a solid fuel cai et al 2016b recently biodrying has been emerged as a pretreatment method for lowering mc of organic wastes even so it does not seem that direct biodrying of ds is technically feasible because not only mc is too high but also biodegradable volatile solids bvs content and porosity are low zhao et al 2011 to address these problems bulking agents are commonly mixed with ds to enhance free air space fas and to adjust the initial mc into optimal ranges because it is easy and inexpensive to obtain in large quantities straw zhao et al 2011 sawdust sd yang et al 2014 wheat residues li et al 2015 rice husks zhang et al 2015 and wood shavings huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 villegas and huiliÃ±ir 2014 have frequently been used as bulking agents for sewage sludge biodrying however uses of these bulking agents have resulted in insufficient heat production accompanying low temperature profiles and or short high temperature periods these lignocellulosic bulking agents are sparingly soluble in water and consequently concentrations of dissolved organic matters dom contributed by the bulking agents are low thus diverse nutrients required for microbial metabolism are not sufficiently provided by these bulking agents zhang et al 2015 it also needs to notice that mixtures of ds and these less soluble materials are not homogenous zhao et al 2011 furthermore lignocellulose is resistant to microbial degradation huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 zhao et al 2011 therefore efforts for finding new bulking agents exhibiting high biodegradation potentials high dom contents appropriate fas and good degrees of homogeneity have been continued zhao et al 2011 reported that straw performed better than sd as a bulking agent for ds biodrying because of its high biodegradation potential in the aerobic process however the final mc was high 50 55 wt despite that the biodrying continued as long as for two weeks yang et al 2014 achieved high water removal 55 1 by using air dried sludge as as a bulking agent however the preparation of as is time consuming at least 2 weeks in ambient atmosphere which brings difficulties for large scale ds biodrying yang and jahng 2015 yang et al 2014 besides the as contains 20 50 wt of inorganic materials such as sand and metal oxides han et al 2015 huang et al 2015 which may cause problems in process operation and produce low energy biodried products spent coffee ground scg is a solid residue generated during the production of espresso or hydro soluble coffees murthy and naidu 2012 according to the international coffee organization ico around 9 1 million tons of coffee bean were consumed in 2016 ico 2017 generally 550 670 kg of scg are produced from 1 ton of coffee bean park et al 2016 therefore over 5 8 million tons of scg are generated every year although scg is abundant in nutrients it is barely used for feeding domestic animals because polyphenols tannins and caffeine are contained in it ulloa rojas et al 2003 therefore most of scg has been discarded as a valueless waste without any treatment because efficient methods to handle the enormous amount have not been available park et al 2016 recently several attempts have been made to compost hachicha et al 2012 sÃ¡nchez et al 1999 and co compost with scg for horticultural use without phytotoxic effects of direct application of scg to soils hardgrove and livesley 2016 santos et al 2017 in addition it was found that scg accelerated process rates and augmented microorganisms in composting emmanuel et al 2017 zhang and sun 2017 besides scg was also used as a feedstock for production of various biofuels by anaerobic digestion kim et al 2017 biodiesel trans esterification park et al 2016 combustion chen et al 2017 and pyrolysis li et al 2014 attention is being increasingly paid to scg management to meet its ever increasing production nonetheless few studies have focused on scg as a bulking agent for biodrying considering its availability biodegradability and high calorific value 21 mj kg 1 chen et al 2017 scg is thought to be a good candidate for a bulking agent in biodrying targeting solid fuel production in this study the feasibility of using scg as a bulking agent for ds biodrying was investigated and its performance was compared with two other bulking agents as and sd temperature co2 concentration in exit gas water removal vs consumption and dom variations were monitored for further comparison mass and heat balances of ds biodrying with these three bulking agents were established additionally bacterial communities developed during biodrying were analyzed by pyrosequencing high heating value hhv and low heating value lhv were also measured in order to examine the fuel characteristics of biodried products based on these investigations it was concluded that scg was an excellent bulking agent for ds biodrying 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the raw materials the ds was obtained from a belt press facility at a wwtp in yongin korea three bulking agents were prepared and used in this study the sd was purchased from a traditional market in yongin korea and used without any further treatment as was prepared by spreading the ds under the ambient atmosphere and dried for a couple of weeks until the mc became constant yang et al 2014 scg was collected from local coffee shops and thermally dried until the mc reduced lower than 10 wt which was close to those of as and sd particle sizes of bulking agents were 0 05 10 mm in diameter the characteristics of the raw materials are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental equipment and process operation the laboratory biodrying reactor fig 1 used in this study was an air tight 28 3 l cylindrical vessel inner diameter of 300 mm height of 450 mm made of pmma polymethyl methacrylate insulated with 100 mm thick cotton headspace of the reactor was also filled with cotton for preventing heat loss and absorbing condensed water a perforated plate was located at the bottom of the reactor for supporting the sludge matrix and distributing air dehumidified ambient air was supplied to the bottom of the reactor the outlet gas exhausted from the top of the reactor passed through a condenser to condense the water vapor carried by the air stream prior to reaching a gas analyzer multi master sensoronic co korea a thermocouple was installed in the middle of the sludge pile and the temperature was recorded every 1 h onto a data recorder biodrying was conducted in the described reactor filled with 10 kg of feedstock for preparing the feedstock for biodrying ds and each bulking agent were thoroughly mixed manually with the mixing ratio of 4 1 w w wet basis for 60 min ds mixed with bulking agents of as scg and sd were labeled as trial a trial b and trial c the working volumes were 15 0 l 17 0 l and 23 5 l for trials a b and c due to the density differences of the bulking agents the airflow rate was kept at 4 l min 0 075m3 kg 1 total solids ts h 1 during biodrying the biodrying pile was manually turned every four days and the samples were taken after turning for analyzing mc vs dom and bacterial community 2 3 pyrosequencing and data processing genomic dna was extracted from 100 to 200 mg of wet sample by using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions for efficient polymerase chain reaction pcr the extracted dna was purified with the mo bio powerclean

branford ct usa the obtained sequence data were analyzed using the clcommunity software chunlab inc korea to reveal bacterial community structures the amplicons were subjected to a filtering process by which the sequences shorter than 300 bp and of average quality value less than 25 were removed eztaxon e database and a robust global pairwise sequence alignment coupled with blastn were used for the taxonomic assignment of sequencing reads following de gannes et al 2013 the sequences were assigned to operational taxonomic unit otus with 97 identity as cai et al 2016a did the alpha diversity indices community richness index of chao1 and diversity index of shannon and coverage estimate were calculated based on the mothur program wang et al 2017 de gannes et al 2013 2 4 sample collection and analytical methods mc and vs content of the raw materials and mixtures during biodrying were determined according to yang and jahng 2015 by collecting triplicates of 20 g samples the calorific values or hhv were measured using an oxygen bomb calorimeter parr 6400 parr instrument co moline il usa and low heating values lhv was calculated according to he 2011 bulk density was measured by weighing the mass of the sample with known volume yang et al 2014 and fas was calculated by the reported method zhao et al 2011 elemental compositions of c n h s and o were analyzed using an elemental analyzer flash ea1112 thermo finnigan ce instruments italy after the samples were ground with a grinder to less than 0 2 mm ma et al 2016 for determining concentrations of dom including dissolved organic carbon doc and polymeric substances polysaccharides and proteins a 2 g sample was extracted using 20 ml of deionized water for 2 h in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm at room temperature chefet et al 1997 the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min filtered through a 0 45 Î¼m nylon syringe filter ge healthcare life sciences little chalfont uk the doc concentration in the filtrate was analyzed using a toc analyzer toc v cph shimadzu japan the polysaccharide and protein contents were measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as a reference material and by the modified bradford method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard respectively zhang et al 2015 he 2011 2 5 mass and heat balances factors and parameters used in heat and mass balances are listed in the nomenclature for the mass balance the weight changes of the mixtures and their water and vs contents were determined following the reported methods ma et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the water removal m h 2 o and the vs consumption m vs were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 the biodrying index bi which was defined as the ratio of water removal to vs consumption was calculated by eq 3 huiliÃ±ir

the entire heat flow was written as eq 4 given that the produced heat was equal to the consumed heat in the biodrying system for simplicity and accuracy of calculations the difference between biological heat generation and consumption by air stream water evaporation and matrix temperature increase was regarded as heat loss due to conduction radiation and turning q loss table 2 4 q bio q dryair q watvap q water q solid q evapo q condu q radi q turning 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the raw materials as which was prepared by air drying the ds showed different dom characteristics compared to ds table 1 its polysaccharide content increased whereas protein content decreased it was reported that the structure and composition of dissolved polymeric substances were changed during the air drying of foodstuff tian et al 2016 similarly it was speculated that the sludge floc and hydration layer of ds were shrunken and broken down as the water was evaporated during the long air drying period then the polysaccharides embedded in the floc were released and dissolved in water resulting in a higher polysaccharide content it was also suggested that the soluble proteins in the sludge were hydrolyzed by the microorganisms during air drying causing a decrease of protein content as table 1 shows the vs contents hhvs and c contents of scg and sd were much higher than those of ds and as protein was the main dom of ds and its concentration was almost twice the polysaccharide concentration this was similar to the dom characteristics of ds reported by zhang et al 2015 who conducted ds biodrying in a sludge treatment plant in case of three bulking agents polysaccharides occupied more than 80 of the total dom among three bulking agents scg showed the highest contents of doc and polysaccharides sd which has frequently been used as a bulking agent for ds biodrying showed low dom contents with a negligible content of proteins the dom contents of as were moderate among these three bulking agents dom is considered to be more easily utilized by microorganisms than solid phase organics zhang et al 2015 thus it was expected that scg might accelerate the ds biodrying when used as a bulking agent in addition the high contents of c 51 62 wt dry basis and vs 97 98 wt dry basis and hhv 22 843 kj kg 1 of scg would be beneficial for the subsequent combustion of biodried products 3 2 temperature and co2 evolution temperature is important for the biodrying process because it affects water evaporation and vs degradation to illustrate the biodrying process more clearly the 16 day biodrying was divided into four stages as the matrix was turned three times during this period although temperatures rapidly increased without lag phases the temperature profiles of biodrying with different bulking agents were quite different fig 2 a when as was used as a bulking agent trial a temperature reached the peak of 68 1 c after 34 h and high temperature period 45 c continued for about 2 5 days then the temperature gradually decreased to a low level of around 35 c before the first turning after the first turning temperature rebounded 32 3 c slightly it was thought that biodrying of trial a ceased on day 8 because temperature no longer increased even after the second turning in trial b with scg as a bulking agent the two temperature peaks 63 3 c and 64 1 c in stage 1 were lower than that of trial a however the high temperature period of trial b lasted for 5 8 days which was much longer than trial a several studies on composting also found that adding scg prolonged the high temperature period sÃ¡nchez et al 1999 santos et al 2017 after the second temperature peak of 68 3 c on day 4 5 the temperature of trial b gradually decreased to room temperature before the second turning similar to trial a biodrying of trial b seemed to be also completed on day 8 because the second turning exerted no noticeable influence on the temperature profile the operation periods of trials a and b were much shorter than other studies cai et al 2016a yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 trial c with sd as the bulking agent showed the lowest temperature peak 61 7 c and the shortest high temperature period in stage 1 1 8 days however the matrix temperature of trial c rebounded after the first turning on day 4 and reached the peak temperature of 50 6 c on day 11 then the temperature decreased more slowly than other trials to reach around 30 c at the end of biodrying temperature cumulation tc c day defined as the sum of temperature difference between the biodrying pile and ambient temperature was calculated by eq 5 zhao et al 2010 and shown in fig 2b in stages 1 and 2 the tc was larger in the order of trial b trial a and trial c on day 8 the tcs were 162 7 249 8 and 155 7 c day for trials a b and c respectively in stages 3 and 4 tc of trial a increased slowly to 192 3 c day on day 16 while that of trial b did not increase and the tc of trial c after day 6 increased steadily and reached 319 7 c day 5 tc i 1 n t m t a Î´ t the rapid increases of the temperature at the beginning of biodrying for all trials were thought to be caused by the microbial degradation of the bvs and the concomitant release of the metabolic heat trials a and b showed longer high temperature periods in stage 1 than trial c probably because compared to sd as and scg contained more readily bvs with that the microbial activity remained at a high level biodrying was terminated on day 8 for trials a and b since bvs was exhausted after the long high temperature periods the high temperature period of trial b was much longer than trial a indicating that more bvs for bio heat production was supplied by scg for trial c the high temperature period in stage 1 was thought to be contributed by bvs in ds because lignocellulose contained in sd was not readily biodegradable a second temperature peak of trial c might be due to that the microbial activity for cellulose degradation was slowly developed zhao et al 2010 a long lag phase was needed for the evolution of cellulose degrading bacteria ma et al 2016 resulting in the longer biodrying period for trial c fig 2 similar biodrying process with a lag phase after the first temperature peak and long lasting biodrying 14 18 days were observed by zhao et al 2010 and ma et al 2016 who conducted ds biodrying with a mixed bulking agent straw and sd mass ratio 1 1 and corncob respectively after the third turning stage 4 the matrix temperature decreased indicating that bvs was exhausted in the biodrying system of trial c yang et al 2014 as illustrated by the tc curves fig 2b it was obvious that the tc of trial b reached a high level in a shorter time than others it took at least 12 days for trial c to reach close to tc of trial b from these results it was concluded that ds biodrying was greatly accelerated by using scg as a bulking agent owing to a long high temperature period and a high tc achieved in a short time in addition to temperature co2 concentrations in the exit gas from biodrying reactors were also measured in order to monitor respiration activities of microorganisms during biodrying fig 2c in the beginning of biodrying co2 concentrations in the exit gases from all trails were 4 5 vol and then rapidly increased in trial a the co2 concentration reached the peak of 7 85 vol at 16 h in case that scg was used as a bulking agent trial b three co2 peaks emerged in the first 4 days with peak concentrations of 7 54 vol 7 76 vol and 6 25 vol on day 0 3 0 7 and 2 3 respectively the co2 concentration after day 8 was lower than 0 5 vol the first co2 concentration peak of trial c 7 28 vol appeared at around 16 h after the first turning concentration of co2 in the exit gas bounded from 0 92 vol on day 4 4 24 vol on day 11 the high co2 concentrations in the beginning of biodrying was thought to be due to the vigorous microbial degradation activity on the fresh ds increase of co2 concentrations after the first turning indicated that turning enhanced the microbial activity by eliminating the gradients of bvs moisture dissolved oxygen etc formed in the biodrying reactors in addition to the temperature the co2 fig 2c profiles confirmed that the biodrying of trials a and b was completed on day 8 in trial c the co2 profiles in stages 3 and 4 indicated that microorganisms exploited bvs from sd during this period 3 3 water removal vs consumption and fas variation variations of mc and vs were also monitored during biodrying and it was found that the bulking agents strongly influenced these parameters fig 3 after 16 days of biodrying mcs of trials a b and c decreased from 70 14 wt 68 25 wt and 71 63 wt to 59 12 wt 41 35 wt and 57 69 wt respectively in case of trial b with scg as the bulking agent the matrix temperature sharply increased to the second peak after the first turning on day 4 fig 2a and mc of the mixture decreased rapidly from 62 56 wt on day 4 46 16 wt on day 8 several studies also indicated that adding scg in composting enhanced mc reduction rolz et al 2010 zhang and sun 2017 as already mentioned above biodrying of trials a and b appeared completed on day 8 because temperature and co2 concentration returned back to basal levels fig 2 in case of trial c mc decreased steadily during the 16 days of biodrying as biodrying pile was kept warm fig 2a the vs contents of trials a b and c decreased gradually throughout the 16 days of biodrying from 75 11 90 11 and 88 58 69 06 86 17 and 82 78 respectively in trial a although the feedstock had a low vs content it was obvious that vs decreased faster in stage 1 from 75 11 to 71 23 than other stages in case of trial b sharp decrease of vs lasted longer from 90 11 on day 0 85 89 on day 8 than that of trial a on the contrary trial c did not show remarkable changes in vs during stages 1 and 2 from 88 58 on day 0 87 90 on day 8 during this period temperature kept high for a short time thereafter vs decreased rapidly during stages 3 and 4 from 87 90 on day 8 82 78 on day 16 during which moderate temperature period lasted long this might be due to that the moderate temperature sustained the active degradation of bvs in sd mainly cellulose and vice versa a similar vs consumption was also observed by zhao et al 2010 nonetheless vs content reduction fig 3b and consumption table 3 were not linearly related to temperature increase fig 2a and co2 production fig 2c because evolution of heat and co2 were determined by biodegradability and heat content of organic materials and metabolic capability of microorganisms while vs was a proximate parameter as shown in fig 3c fas in three trials increased during biodrying because a large amount of water was removed although the initial fas of trial b was obviously lower its mc decreased much more rapidly than trial c fig 3a indicating that the fas of trial b was already enough for water and air transfer while that of trial c was excessive and adverse to biodrying in a more diluted and fluffy matrix the contact between microorganism mainly in ds and bvs in sd was poor in trial c gea et al 2007 resulting in a long lag phase after the first turning fig 2a trial a with lower fas also performed efficiently in stage 1 but the limited bvs caused a short high temperature period and low water removal these results indicated that when fas was adequate the readily bvs was more important for efficient biodrying than porosity biodrying with low fas but high water removal rate would be advantageous to a real biodrying plant because the handling capacity is large while energy consumption could be reduced winkler et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 weight changes of biodrying piles during 16 day biodrying are shown in table 3 the total weight loss ratios of trials a b and c were 51 25 66 71 and 55 58 respectively the water removal ratios the mass ratios of removed water to the initial water contained in the biodrying feedstock of trials a b and c were 58 91 79 66 and 64 24 respectively trial a only removed 58 91 of the initial water with a vs consumption ratio of 38 62 most of which were accomplished in stage 1 it was suspected that water removal after day 8 was mainly caused by convective drying since the temperature was lower than 30 c fig 2a with such low temperature only 21 61 of water 0 916 kg was evaporated from day 9 to day 16 in trial a among three bulking agents scg achieved the highest water removal and vs consumption ratio was also the highest 43 45 of the initial vs from the high vs consumption it was considered that the scg supplied abundant readily bvs to the biodrying pile in trial b more than 85 of the total water removal were accomplished during 0 8 day with a high drying rate 0 61 kg d 1 similar to trial a a small amount of water 0 599 kg removed in stages 3 and 4 11 05 of total water removal was thought to be brought mainly by convective drying the water removal profiles of trial b also made it clear that biodrying removed much more water than convective drying and the high temperature was crucial for efficient drying the water removal ratio of trial c 64 24 was higher than trial a but lower than trial b and the drying rate of trial c was low only 0 29 kg d 1 because biodrying continued for 16 days low water removal of trial a indicated that the bvs contained in the as might be insufficient for biodrying low bvs was also demonstrated by the relatively low vs consumption during the entire biodrying period of trial a table 3 a relatively short high temperature period of trial a fig 2a also supported this explanation in trial c although the drying rate was stable throughout the entire period 34 43 of the total water removal was achieved in stage 1 table 3 during which temperature peak value was high the water removal and vs consumption in trial c were higher than those of trial a but not distinguished because the vs in sd was mainly slowly bvs zhao et al 2011 compared to as and sd water removal achieved for 16 days of biodrying with scg was 27 94 and 17 89 higher respectively if water removal was compared for initial 8 days trial b removed 4 825 kg of water with water removal ratio of 70 87 overwhelming trials a 3 323 kg and c 2 519 kg with water removal ratios of 46 18 and 35 14 respectively in other words scg in trial b gave rise to a high drying rate and consequently biodrying process was greatly accelerated completed on day 8 all these results proved that scg was an excellent bulking agent enabling efficient drying of ds in a short time bi the mass ratio of removed water to removed vs was also calculated in this study ma et al 2016 reported that bi values obtained from co biodrying of ds and food waste were 3 11 4 86 while zhao et al 2010 obtained bi around 6 bi could be affected by airflow rate initial mc bulking agent and biodrying feedstock huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 yang et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 as shown in table 3 for trial b with scg as a bulking agent bi of the 16 day biodrying was 4 37 which was slightly lower than those of trials a and c however bi of trial b for first 8 days 5 09 was higher than other two trials huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 reported bi of 7 10 in their study however extremely high airflow rate 0 18 m3 kg 1 ts h 1 was likely to be the main reason for the low organic loss and frequent turning once a day also gave rise to a higher water elimination results of ds biodrying obtained in this study were compared with those of other literature table 4 lignocellulosic biomass e g sd straw rice husks wood shavings and woodchips were frequently used as bulking agents for ds biodrying both in lab scale reactors and biodrying plants huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 winkler et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 biodrying periods were typically 2 3 weeks and water removals of 25 9 68 2 were achieved in those studies huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 biodried ds only for 8 days but the water removal was also only 7 6 26 4 zhao et al 2010 and li et al 2015 reported the highest water removal 68 2 and 66 4 respectively among the previously reported studies however their biodrying continued much longer 18 20 days than others trial b in this study removed 70 87 of initial water in 8 days of biodrying this water removal was utmost high among all studies in table 4 in the present study using scg as the bulking agent the final mc of the biodried product 46 16 wt was also obviously lower than other studies although the final mcs of zhang et al 2015 and winkler et al 2013 were below 50 wt their initial mcs were also low 50 55 wt it should be noted that the airflow rate in this study was moderate while the initial mcs were relatively high compared to other studies thus it was possible to claim that trial b achieved high water removal with short operation period and low energy consumption comprising all these speculations it was clear that scg showed outstanding performances in ds biodrying in a biodrying plant treatment capacity is important for both economic and environmental considerations more sludge can be loaded when the density of bulking agent is high as shown in table 1 density of scg 0 43 g cm 3 was higher than that of sd 0 18 g cm 3 the most frequently used bulking agent therefore biodrying feedstock prepared by mixing ds and scg would occupy less volume which enables a higher ds loading than feedstocks with other light bulking agents 3 4 dom evolutions as mentioned above temperature and co2 profiles were evidently different among three bulking agents fig 2 it was postulated that these differences were caused by not only bvs content but also dom evolution during biodrying because dom is known to serve as a direct nutritional source for microbes during biodrying zhang et al 2015 in this study the concentrations of doc and polymeric substances polysaccharides and proteins in the water extracts of the biodrying piles were analyzed as shown in fig 4 the contents of doc and polymeric substances increased in all trials after the high temperature period in stage 1 then contents of doc and polymeric substances of trials a and b kept high until day 16 in case of trial c the doc and the content of dissolved proteins varied along with the temperature and polysaccharide content continuously decreased after day 8 it was also obvious that the contents of doc and dissolved polymeric substances of trial c were lower than those of trials a and b during the entire biodrying period however large amounts of polymeric substances especially polysaccharides released after the first high temperature period of trial c fig 4b as shown in table 1 concentrations of doc and dissolved carbohydrates contained in as were higher than those in sd but lower than scg maximum temperature and high temperature period of trial a in stage 1 were also in the middle among 3 trials after the second turning on day 8 the temperature of trial a did not increase again fig 2a indicating that bvs of trial a was exhausted interestingly however fig 4 shows that doc and polymeric substances contents were high in the biodrying pile of trial a the high contents of dom after day 4 in trial a might be a result of microbial cell lysis during the high temperature period in stage 1 in trial c contents of doc dissolved polysaccharides and proteins were lower than the other two trials and temperature increased persistently but slowly after the first turning it was thought that microorganisms utilized cellulose and hemicellulose of sd after the first turning as the polysaccharides content was high from day 4 to day 12 the biodegradation of cellulose and hemicellulose is known to be time consuming because most cellulose and hemicellulose decomposing microorganisms grow slowly lÃ³pez mondÃ©jar et al 2016 different from trial a the dom variation of trial c was coincident with the temperature profile figs 2a and 4 scg is known to contain high vs most of which is readily biodegradable substances e g carbohydrates proteins and lipids ulloa rojas et al 2003 when scg was supplied for ds biodrying high contents of doc and polymeric substances instantaneously increased the temperature of biodrying pile and abundant bvs in scg kept the high temperature period long fig 2a as a result a large amount of water was removed in the initial 8 days table 3 after day 8 it seemed that the low mc of biodrying pile inhibited microbial activity and thus dom was not consumed in summary scg was an excellent material with high contents of doc and polymeric substances by mixing scg with ds it was possible to maintain the high temperature period long and remove water from the biodrying matrix in a short time 3 5 heat generation and utilization during biodrying the heat generation and utilization during biodrying with three bulking agents were calculated using equations in table 2 and summarized in table 5 many studies used an estimated value of 21 000 kj kg 1 vs determined by zhao et al 2010 for the average combustion heat of ds biodrying mixture although this number has widely been used for establishing heat balance huiliÃ±ir and villegas 2015 ma et al 2016 yang et al 2013 it is also clear that the combustion heat of biodrying mixture varies according to chemical composition of the biodrying pile winkler et al 2013 thus an average value may not be appropriate for the biodrying with various bulking agents in this study in order to calculate the biological heat accurately the calorific values of the biodrying mixtures were measured table 2 and used for calculating q bio during biodrying 16 033 21 582 and 18 585 kj of biological heat q bio were produced from trials a b and c respectively the q bio which is defined as the metabolic heat produced by the microorganisms depends greatly on the bvs quality and content in the biodrying pile due to high calorific value and high bvs content of scg q bio of trial b was the highest produced q bio was consumed mainly for evaporating water q evap increasing temperature of water q water and dried solid q solid contained in the biodrying matrices and heating water vapor q watervap and dry air q dryair in airflow q evap q water and q solid accounted for 57 20 65 31 8 23 12 37 and 1 23 2 12 of q bio respectively the drying efficiencies the ratio of q evapo to q bio of trials a and c were in the range of those of zhao et al 2010 and ma et al 2016 60 6 72 6 and were slightly higher than that 54 64 of li et al 2015 meanwhile more energy was consumed for water evaporation in trial b than in trials a and c but drying efficiency 57 20 of trial b was somewhat low because 23 65 of q bio were lost by radiation conduction and turning as well known heat transfer by radiation and conduction is governed by temperature of a heat body zhao et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 temperature of trial b was the highest and therefore much heat was thought to be lost by these energy transfer mechanisms if insulation of a biodrying reactor could be improved heat loss would be reduced and more energy might be utilized for water evaporation 3 6 bacterial communities biodrying is a highly dynamic process in which microorganisms play vital roles although fungi were demonstrated to be able to degrade recalcitrant substrates cai et al 2017 and lignocellulose even during the thermophilic phase only bacterial communities were analyzed because it was observed that the fungal abundance was as low as 0 05 of the total microorganisms in biodrying piles cai et al 2017 in this study the phylogenetic compositions of bacterial communities during ds biodrying with three bulking agents were analyzed through pyrosequencing first obtained sequences were used to calculate diversity indices of chao 1 and shannon as shown in table 6 valid reads of samples taken from ds and three bulking agents were in the range of 50 000 to 74 000 the most valid reads were obtained from sd and scg generated the least reads accordingly chao 1 and shannon indices of scg were extraordinarily low among raw materials of biodrying feedstock in addition number of otus with 97 identity was the highest for ds and the lowest for scg although individual components of biodrying feedstocks exhibited widely varying community characteristics otus chao 1 and shannon of fresh refer to day 0 in table 6 biodrying feedstocks of all trials even trial b containing scg were similar each other individual components this similarity indicated that ds was the main source of microorganisms in fresh biodrying feedstocks as biodrying proceeded bacterial community structures of all trials became simple as indicated by lowered diversity indices in particular the trial b showed the simplest bacterial community structure on day 8 perhaps because the biodrying pile had experienced a long period of high temperature in case of trial a the diversity indices decreased slightly because the high temperature period was short on day 4 trial c showed a higher diversity than day 0 possibly because the bacterial diversity was recovered during the long cooling phase from day 1 to day 4 even so the biodiversity of trial c decreased after the second temperature peak indicating that high temperature period raised the thermophilic bacteria but decreased bacterial diversity similar results were also observed during the biodrying processes conducted by cai et al 2016a and zhang et al 2015 fig 5 shows the phylogenetic closeness of the bacterial communities as expected from ecological indices in table 6 the bacterial community structures of three bulking agents and ds were very different while fresh biodrying mixtures and ds were clustered very closely on the dendrogram indicating again that ds was the main source of microorganisms during biodrying the bacterial communities changed as microorganisms were subject to changes of temperature nutritional conditions competitors etc on day 4 the dendrogramatic distance of trial b was the farthest to the initial feedstocks because the abundant bvs contained in scg induced the most rapid changes of bacterial community during the initial four days from these results it was inferred that scg was an excellent bulking agent for the developments of some specific microorganisms e g thermophiles which were thought to be favorable to accelerated biodrying in order to better understand bacterial communities during ds biodrying the obtained sequences were identified at phylum and genus levels as shown in fig 6 proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes were the most dominant phyla present in the biodrying matrices during the initial 4 days of biodrying the percentages of chloroflexi obviously decreased in all trials from 20 06 to 7 93 in trial a from 20 20 to 4 21 in trial b and from 23 98 to 14 73 in trial c in trials a and b the percentages of proteobacteria also decreased from 27 56 to 27 29 on day 0 10 55 and 4 99 on day 4 respectively while that in trial c remained almost constant during the entire biodrying process on the contrary firmicutes obviously increased in trials a 10 70 56 40 and b 9 99 71 96 during initial 4 days but did not change much in trial c actinobacteria did not show noticeable changes in both trials a and b but increased from 15 33 on day 0 45 28 on day 12 in trial c firmicutes enriched in trials a and b and actinobacteria enriched in trial c have been recognized as thermophiles cai et al 2016a considering temperature rise in biodrying piles evolution of thermophilic communities was not surprising however it was interesting that trial c exhibited evolution of different bacterial community the differences in phyla between trials a and b and trial c were thought to be brought by two factors firstly the biodrying mixtures with different bulking agents provided different nutrients for microbial growth zhao et al 2011 another possibility might be related with temperature of biodrying matrix as shown in fig 2 temperature of trial c varied differently from trials a and b maximum temperature and high temperature period of trial c were lower and shorter than trials a and b due to these differences in temperature environment different bacterial communities were induced for a deeper analysis of the bacterial community structures genera with abundance higher than 1 were selected as shown in fig 7 the bacterial community structures of ds and the initial mixtures on day 0 were almost identical as biodrying continued bacillus was enriched from 0 09 on day 0 36 56 on day 4 in trial a becoming the most abundant genus meanwhile other thermophilic genera including cerasibacillus sinibacillus tepidimicrobium and pseudogracilibacillus which were barely found in the fresh biodrying feedstocks also increased to relative abundances of 1 44 3 17 2 52 and 3 84 similar to trial a bacillus in trial b with scg as the bulking agent increased from 0 1 on day 0 35 94 on day 4 and remained at a high level until the high temperature period ceased on day 8 ureibacillus 6 94 geobacillus 5 51 thermobifida 4 62 symbiobacterium 4 28 planifilum 2 42 and streptomyces 2 19 were also enriched during stage 1 bacillus the dominant genus in the high temperature stages of trials a and b and ureibacillus and geobacillus enriched in trial b are known to thrive in moderately thermal environments 50 60 c and secrets various thermostable enzymes rastogi et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 other thermophilic bacteria such as thermobifida which is reportedly capable of degrading plant cell wall wilson 2004 was also enriched in trial b because scg contained a high proportion of plant cell wall polysaccharides murthy and naidu 2012 in trial c although the high temperature period continued for initial 1 8 days the bacterial community structure did not undergo dramatic changes on day 4 only a few genera including comamonas aeromonas and flavobacterium were enriched with relative abundances of 2 39 3 55 in stage 1 however bacterial community structure changed in a great extent on day 12 four genera streptomyces 27 05 chitinophaga 7 80 actinomadura 6 59 and pseudoxanthnomonas 5 51 became dominant on day 12 in the biodrying pile of trial c streptomyces is known to produce high levels of thermostable and or alkali tolerant xylanases and cellulases budihal et al 2016 pradeep et al 2013 implying that streptomyces might play important roles in the metabolism of the hemicellulose and cellulose these results demonstrated that the thermophilic bacteria in trials a and b evolved much faster than that of trial c meanwhile compared to trial a trial b enriched more thermophilic genera indicating that scg was more effective than as for developing thermophilic bacteria all these results indicated that organic substances contained in bulking agents caused the differences of bacterial community structures it was suspected that scg performed better than the other two bulking agents because various thermophilic bacteria with thermostable enzymatic activities were well developed in trial b 3 7 calorific values of biodried products biodrying aims to remove water and increase the heat content of the waste zhao et al 2010 in this context the hhv and lhv of the biodrying mixtures were measured during biodrying as shown in table 7 the lhv of trails a b and c increased by 36 3 96 8 and 73 9 respectively after 16 days of biodrying the lhv of the final product of trial b with scg was 10 162 kj kg 1 which was much higher than those of trials a and c similarly the lhv of trial b on day 8 mc 46 16 wt was 9284 kj kg 1 2 1 and 1 8 times as large as those of trials a and c respectively during biodrying hhv decreased due to vs consumption whereas lhv increased because water was removed the hhv of initial feedstock in trial a was lower than the other two because as contained less vs compared to scg and sd table 1 since solids other than vs in biomass are thought to be incombustibles huang et al 2015 vs content is important for heat contents of biodried products nonetheless biodried products for all trials were sufficient for self sustaining combustion because the biodried products contained lhv higher than 4000 kj kg 1 which was regarded as the limit for self sustaining combustion spliethoff 2010 although hhv was high lhv of biodried product of trial c was low because mc was still high fig 3a in case of trial b lhv of biodried product was high because mc was lowed more greatly than those of trials a and c fig 3a therefore it was clear that use of scg in ds biodrying resulted not only in accelerated biodrying and low final mc of biodrying pile but also in a high energy biodried product 4 conclusions in this study scg was noticed for the first time as an aid to biodrying of ds through various chemical analyses scg was characterized as an organic waste with high bvs and heat contents when scg was used as a bulking agent for ds biodrying a long high temperature period 5 8 days and a high microbial activity represented by a higher co2 concentration in outlet gas were observed as a result biodrying of ds was enhanced in terms of a high water removal 70 87 and a distinctly short operation period 8 days compared to frequently used bulking agents as and sd these excellent features were attributed to the high dom concentrations and the fast developments of thermophilic bacteria which were thought to be brought by abundant bvs contained in scg the lhv of the biodried product with scg was 9284 kj kg 1 which was 2 1 and 1 8 times as large as those of biodried products with as and sd respectively these findings suggested that scg was a promising bulking agent for ds biodrying enabling not only efficient water removal but also production of a high energy solid fuel acknowledgements this study was

19607,photodegradation is the main depletion pathway for methylmercury mehg in surface water the formation of mehg dissolved organic matter dom complexes has been found to be a key step in mehg photodegradation however the major functional groups involved in the dom mediated process have yet to be clearly resolved in this work we systematically investigated the effects of dom molecular structures on mehg photodegradation by using a variety of organic ligands with different functional groups e g thiosalicylate thiophenol and thioaniline the results showed that thiol and phenyl groups may be the major functional groups governing dom mediated mehg photodegradation with photodegradation rates also dependent on the type carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and position ortho meta and para of other chemical substituents the addition of non photochemically active thiol ligands e g mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol and high concentrations of cl can significantly inhibit the o thiosalicylate induced mehg photodegradation indicating that complexation of mehg with these ligands is necessary for mehg photodegradation sparging with o2 had a negligible effect on mehg photodegradation while sparging with n2 significantly enhanced mehg photodegradation this finding suggests that mehg photodegradation may be a reductive process which was further supported by identification of the degradation products of mehg a possible protonolysis mechanism of mehg photodegradation in the presence of o thiosalicylate was then proposed based on the findings of this study

indirect pathways mediated by reactive oxygen species ros and free radicals fr hammerschmidt and fitzgerald 2006 zhang and hsu kim 2010 kim and zoh 2013 were previously thought to play a crucial role in mehg photodegradation in recent years direct photodegradation of mehg dom has been reported to be the dominant pathway for mehg photodegradation in an increasing number of aquatic systems tai et al 2014 qian et al 2014 han et al 2017 even for systems in which mehg photodegradation is dominated by the fr ros mediated pathway complexation of mehg with dom was reported to be necessary for this process to occur fernandez gomez et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 zhang and hsu kim 2010 these previous studies have highlighted the importance of dom in mehg photodegradation dom composition has been deemed to be the key factor controlling the photodegradation of mehg sun et al 2015 fernandez gomez et al 2015 jeremiason et al 2015 reduced dom was found to be more effective than oxidized dom in enhancing mehg photodegradation qian et al 2014 thiol has been suggested to be the dom functional group governing mehg photodegradation zhang and hsu kim 2010 qian et al 2014 chandan et al 2015 while phenyl groups may also be involved in the mehg photodegradation but through an indirect pathway qian et al 2014 in addition the role of major functional groups e g phenolic and amino group in dom mediated mehg photodegradation has yet to be clearly determined moreover the type and position of other chemical substituents may also have a significant effect on dom mediated mehg photodegradation by altering the bond energy of c hg however such effects remain poorly understood the major objective of this study was to probe the mechanism of dom mediated photodegradation of methylmercury by using organic ligands with different molecular structures as the dom model we examined 1 the importance of the thiol and phenyl groups 2 the role of the type carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and position ortho meta and para of substituent functional groups 3 the role of co occurrence ligand non photochemically active thiol ligands and cl and 4 the effect of o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation based on the results of these experiments a possible mechanism for dom mediated photodegradation of mehg was proposed the results of this study will be useful for understanding the controlling factors and mechanism of dom mediated mehg photodegradation 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents enriched 198hgcl2 and 201hgcl2 were purchased from trace sciences international ontario canada me198hg and me201hg were synthesized by using methylcobalamin li et al 2010 martin doimeadios et al 2002 thirteen organic ligands were adopted as dom analogues including o m and p thiosalicylate o thioaniline o thiophenol cysteine dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid 2 mercaptoethylamine o phthalic acid catechol and o phenylenediamine all reagents were prepared freshly with deoxygenated water in an anaerobic chamber to prevent the oxidation of thiol compounds hu et al 2013 2 2 measurement of mehg photodegradation rates under various treatments me198hg was spiked into 100 ml deionized water in quartz bottles to achieve a final concentration of 10 ng l 1 five milliliters of phosphate buffer 0 2 mol l 1 was then added to achieve a solution ph of 7 0 the photodegradation experiment was carried out using a solar simulator equipped with three air cooled xe lamps 2500 w with the light intensity and temperature setting to 550 w m 2 and 35 c respectively the spectrum of the simulated sunlight was the same as that reported in our previous study yin et al 2014 next a 5 ml solution was sampled from each bottle following 0 3 6 9 15 22 30 and 40 h of incubation then 5 ng l 1 me201hg was added into the samples as an isotope dilution reagent for calculating the me198hg concentration the samples were then stored at 4 c until analysis aqueous ethylation and purge and trap pre concentration followed by gas chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for detecting the mehg content in samples detailed instrumentation and procedures for the analysis can be found in our previously published study ma et al 2014 for quality assurance and quality control qa qc purpose isotope dilution method was adopted to improve the accuracy and precision of the mehg analysis triplicate analyses were employed for each treatment the relative standard deviations rsd of triplicate samples ranged from 0 7 to 5 2 which were within the acceptable ranges of the epa 1630 method for mehg analysis 15 the method blank was approximate 0 05 ng l 1 within the acceptable value of epa 1630 method 0 1 ng l 1 the absolute method detection limit for mehg analysis was 0 75 pg 2 3 mehg photodegradation in the presence of non thiol aromatic thiol and nonaromatic thiol ligands to investigate the effect of thiol and phenyl groups on mehg photodegradation certain amounts of various dom analogues including three aromatic thiols o thiosalicylate o thioaniline and o thiophenol five nonaromatic thiols cysteine dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid and 2 mercaptoethylamine and three non thiol ligands o phthalic acid catechol and o phenylenediamine were added to 10 ng l 1 me198hg solution to achieve a final concentration of 1000 nmol l 1 respectively mehg photodegradation rates under these treatments were measured using the same method described above section 2 2 trials for mehg degradation by these dom analogues in the dark and mehg photodegradation without addition of any dom analogues were also included as controls 2 4 mehg photodegradation in the presence of aromatic thiol ligands with various substituents carboxyl hydroxyl and amino at different positions ortho meta and para to determine the influence of substituent carboxyl hydroxyl and amino on mehg photodegradation certain amounts of o m and p thiosalicylate o thiophenol or o thioaniline aromatic carboxyl hydroxyl and amino ligands were added to a 10 ng l 1 mehg solution to achieve a final concentration of 0 1 10000 nmol l 1 and 10 10000 nmol l 1 for o thiosalicylate and all the other ligands respectively mehg photodegradation under these treatments was measured using the same method described above section 2 2 2 5 effect of non photochemically active thiol ligands cl ph and o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation in the presence of thiosalicylate to investigate the role of mehg thiol complexation on mehg photodegradation mehg photodegradation rates were measured in trials involving the addition of both o thiosalicylate 1000 nmol l 1 and non photochemically active ligands dithiothreitol mercaptoethanol 10 Î¼mol l 1 or cl 0 1000 mmol l 1 using the same method described above section 2 2 the mehg photodegradation rates obtained were compared with those determined by the addition of only o thiosalicylate 1000 nmol l 1 to evaluate the importance of mehg thiol complexation in mehg photodegradation the effects of ph on mehg photodegradation in 1000 nmol l 1 thiosalicylate solution were also examined by measuring mehg photodegradation rates at ph of 5 4 7 0 and 8 4 adjusted using 10 mmol l 1 phosphate buffer to investigate the effects of the redox condition on mehg photodegradation mehg photodegradation rates in a 1000 nmol l 1 o thiosalicylate solution ph 7 0 10 mmol l 1 phosphate buffer were measured under sparging with o2 or n2 the solutions were sparged with o2 or n2 for 2 h first and then incubated in a quartz bubbler irradiated by three air cooled xe lamps 2500 w under 30 ml min 1 o2 or n2 the me198hg concentrations were determined using the isotope dilution method section 2 2 and used to calculate the photodegradation rates 199hg2 10 ng l 1 was also added to simultaneously trace the photoreduction of hg2 to hg0 hg0 released from the bubbler was collected using a gold trap 198hg0 and 199hg0 in the traps were then quantified by a thermal desorption icp ms system song et al 2017 to identify the major hg products for mehg photodegradation 2 6 data analysis the pseudo first order rate constant k d of mehg photodegradation was determined using eq 1 li et al 2010 tai et al 2014 k d for all treatments are provided in table s1 1 ln mehg t ln mehg 0 k d t where mehg 0 is the initial mehg concentration mehg t is the mehg concentration at time t and k d is the rate constant for mehg photodegradation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of various dom functional groups on mehg photodegradation to investigate the role of various dom functional groups in mehg photodegradation the photodegradation of mehg in a solution containing molecules with thiol aromatic moieties carboxyl amino or hydroxyl functional groups was examined as shown in fig 1 negligible mehg degradation was observed in deionized water under simulated sunlight ruling out the direct photodegradation of mehg in deionized water dom model molecules with both thiol and aromatic moieties o thioaniline o thiophenol and o thiosalicylate showed the highest mehg photodegradation rates hereafter denoted as k d k d 36 29 5 37 10 2 h 1 14 13 2 41 10 2 h 1 and 10 15 0 35 10 2 h 1 with only minor degradation observed for molecules with aromatic and non thiol moieties k d 0 10 h 1 e g carboxyl k d 0 60 0 13 10 2 h 1 hydroxyl k d 0 62 0 15 10 2 h 1 and amino k d 0 69 0 10 10 2 h 1 these results suggested that the thiol moiety in dom models may play a critical role in mehg photodegradation dom model molecules with thiol and nonaromatic moieties e g cysteine dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid and 2 mercaptoethylamine showed a much lower cysteine with k d as 0 77 0 12 10 2 h 1 or negligible dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid and 2 mercaptoethylamine mehg photodegradation compared with that of aromatic thiols o thioaniline o thiophenol and o thiosalicylate t test p 0 05 fig 1a indicating that the coexistence of aromatic moieties and the thiol group may be necessary for mehg photodegradation k d in suwannee river natural organic matter srnom was measured under the same incubation conditions in our previous study zhang et al 2017 k d in srnom was lower than that in organic ligand solutions with both thiol and phenyl groups and quicker than that in organic ligand solutions with only thiol or phenyl group supporting our conclusion that thiol and phenyl groups may be the major functional groups governing dom dominated mehg photodegradation in addition negligible k d was observed in the presence of thiosalicylate under dark conditions indicating the negligible contribution of non photochemical processes zhang and hsu kim 2010 qian et al 2014 k d in limited dom model moiety solutions including cysteine glutathione salicylate thiosalicylate and 6 thioguanine was previously tested and thiosalicylate was found to have the highest k d qian et al 2014 which is consistent with the results of this study thiols as soft lewis bases have high affinity for mehg melnick and parkin 2007 the binding of thiol with mehg can lower the singlet triplet excitation energies of c hg which enable the degradation of mehg thiol complexation under solar irradiation tossell 1998 strong absorption of light across the solar spectrum was observed in aromatic ligand solutions fig s1 which may facilitate the photosensitization of mehg thiol complexes and subsequently enhance mehg photodegradation melnick and parkin 2007 ni et al 2006 the aromaticity of dom has been widely found to play an important role in the sunlight mediated transformation of pollutants wenk et al 2011 boreen et al 2008 theoretically dom involved photochemical reactions may be controlled not only by the dominant functional groups but also by the type of substituents carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and their relative position against the dominant functional groups here the thiol and phenyl moieties as shown in fig 1a k d in aromatic thiols with different substituents followed in the order of o thioaniline o thiophenol o thiosalicylate the effects of the substituents carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and their relative position against thiols in the aromatic thiols on k d were further comprehensively investigated to elucidate the major moieties that dominate mehg photodegradation in dom 3 2 effects of substituent types and position in aromatic thiols on mehg photodegradation to elucidate the potential roles of the carboxyl hydroxyl and amino moieties attached to the aromatic skeleton we investigated mehg photodegradation in various concentrations of o thiosalicylate o thioaniline and o thiophenol solution as shown in fig 2 a k d increased rapidly as the o thiosalicylate concentration was increased from 1 0 1 38 0 18 10 2 h 1 to 10 nmol l 1 6 88 0 99 10 2 h 1 followed by a slight increase from 10 to 10000 nmol l 1 10 15 0 46 10 2 h 1 however for o thioaniline and o thiophenol k d showed a significant increase from 10 to 1000 nmol l 1 followed by a decrease from 1000 to 10000 nmol l 1 at a ligand concentration of 10 nmol l 1 the k d for o thiosalicylate o thioaniline and o thiophenol were determined to follow the order of o thiosalicylate 6 88 0 99 10 2 h 1 o thioaniline 1 78 0 44 10 2 h 1 o thiophenol 1 44 0 58 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 01 while at 1000 nmol l 1 a sequence of o thioaniline 36 29 5 37 10 2 h 1 o thiophenol 14 13 2 41 10 2 h 1 o thiosalicylate 10 15 0 35 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 01 was observed from the time dependent mehg photodegradation data fig s2 we can see that after a period of irradiation under simulated sunlight mehg photodegradation slowed down and deviated from linearity in the presence of o thioaniline and o thiophenol which could be caused by insufficient complexation due to ligand photolysis this inhibition for o thioaniline and o thiophenol at high concentrations 10000 nmol l 1 could be mainly due to ligand induced light attenuation li et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 which is expected to decrease the number of photons available to be absorbed by the mehg thiol complex the importance of substituent position in mehg photodegradation was further investigated by using o m and p thiosalicylate as models at a ligand concentration of 10 nmol l 1 the k d for o thiosalicylate was found to be approximately 3 3 and 5 0 times higher than that for m and p thiosalicylate while similar rates were observed for o m p thiosalicylate at ligand concentrations of 100 and 1000 nmol l 1 k d with m thiosalicylate 17 94 1 20 10 2 h 1 and p thiosalicylate 16 59 1 54 10 2 h 1 was significantly higher than that with o thiosalicylate 10 15 0 46 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 05 at a ligand concentration of 10000 nmol l 1 these results suggest that the effect of the substitution position in the aromatic thiol on mehg photodegradation depends on the model concentration at low concentrations o thiosalicylate shows the highest enhancing effects on mehg photodegradation while the opposite was observed at high concentrations m thiosalicylate p thiosalicylate o thiosalicylate the significantly enhanced mehg photodegradation observed for m and p thiosalicylate at higher ligand concentrations can be due to the formation of a secondary complexation of mehg with the other thiol of a neighbouring m p thiosalicylate which could further weaken the c hg bond and facilitate mehg degradation melnick and parkin 2007 ni et al 2006 zukerman schpector et al 1991 however due to the steric hindrance effect the formation of secondary complexation between mehg and o thiosalicylate is more difficult compared to that of m p thiosalicylate which is not favorable for the enhancement of mehg photodegradation 3 3 effects of ph and the co existing ligand on mehg photodegradation the effect of ph on mehg photodegradation in the presence of o thiosalicylate was investigated by adjusting the ph to 5 4 7 0 and 8 4 as shown in fig 3 a k d was significantly decreased with increasing ph from 11 80 0 90 10 2 h 1 at ph 5 4 to 7 50 0 79 10 2 h 1 at ph 7 0 and 2 40 0 13 10 2 h 1 at ph 8 4 one way anova p 0 01 ph have been reported to affect mehg photodegradation via two possible pathways skyllberg et al 2006 karlsson and skyllberg 2003 amirbahman et al 2002 on one hand high ph can enhance the dissociation of thiol skyllberg et al 2006 karlsson and skyllberg 2003 which is expected to enhance the photodegradation of mehg by forming mehg thiol complexes amirbahman et al 2002 since contrary results were observed in this study low k d at high ph ph should not affect mehg photodegradation in o thiosalicylate solutions by influencing the dissociation of thiol on the other hand higher ph and oh concentration can facilitate the formation of mehgoh whose degradation is theoretically difficult under solar irradiation due to the high singlet triplet excitation energies involved tai et al 2014 however theoretical calculations for mehg speciation table s2 s3 suggested that even at ph 8 4 the mehg thiol complex accounted for over 99 94 of the total mehg at an o thiosalicylate concentration of 1000 nmol l 1 indicating that the decrease in k d with increasing ph cannot be explained by a change in mehg speciation here we proposed a possible mechanism of protonolysis of the hg c bond to explain the observed effect of ph on mehg photodegradation similar to organomercurial lyase merb ni et al 2006 parks et al 2009 the coordination of mehg with thiol in thiosalicylate similar to the role of cys96 and cys159 thiols in merb leads to increased negative charge on the methyl group consequently the cooh in thiosalicylate similar to the role of asp99 carboxylate in merb facilitates the protonolysis of the hg c bond and releasing the hydrocarbon product ch4 high ph could enhance the dissociation of carboxylate in thiosalicylate table s4 and inhibit the protonolysis of the hg c bond in mehg this mechanism could also partly explain the higher k d of o thiosalicylate in comparison to that of m and p thiosalicylate compared with meta and para carboxylate a carboxylate at the ortho position is more effective as a proton donor to nearby mehg and thus facilitates photodegradation of mehg as described above the complexation of mehg with thiosalicylate may play a key role in mehg photodegradation section 3 1 non photochemically active thiol ligands were added to validate the importance of mehg thiosalicylate complexation in mehg photodegradation as shown in fig 3b mehg photodegradation induced by thiosalicylate was significantly inhibited following the addition of 2 mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol indicating the necessity of forming mehg dom in mehg photodegradation t test p 0 01 since these non photochemically active thiol ligands e g mercaptoethanol thioglycolic acid and mercaptopropionic acid are also widely present in surface water zhang et al 2004 the competitive complexation between photochemically active and non photochemically active thiols for mehg can significantly affect mehg photodegradation in natural waters and this should be taken into account in any future study for the cycling and fate of mehg chloride ions cl can also complex with mehg association constants 105 45 brown and zweifel 2002 and subsequently influence its photodegradation the concentration of cl in natural water ranges from less than 1 mmol l 1 in freshwater to over 1000 mmol l 1 in hypersaline seawater the effect of cl on thiosalicylate induced mehg photodegradation was further investigated as shown in fig 3c the addition of cl at 100 mmol l 1 showed negligible influence on mehg photodegradation one way anova p 0 1 however at a cl concentration of 1000 mmol l 1 approximately 37 9 of mehg photodegradation was inhibited in the presence of 1000 mmol l 1 of cl and 1000 nmol l 1of thiosalicylate approximately 2 74 of mehg was calculated to exist in the form of mehgcl table s5 suggesting that this inhibition effect may operate via the breakdown of mehg thiosalicylate complexes this effect depends on the ratio of cl to thiol in natural water high cl concentrations in seawater could result in slow mehg photodegradation compared to fresh water zhang and hsu kim 2010 while the minor influence of cl on mehg photodegradation reported for water samples from the florida everglades may be due to low cl thiol ratio tai et al 2014 it should also be noted that the percentage of mehg complexed with cl was calculated to be lower than the reduction in mehg photodegradation observed upon addition of cl since there is a lack of data for the mehg o thiosalicylate complexation constant previously reported logk values of mehg sh 13 15 were used in our calculations amirbahman et al 2002 hintelmann et al 1997 karlsson and skyllberg 2003 therefore these results indicate that the complexation constant for mehg with thiol in thiosalicylate may be lower than the reported values 3 4 effect of o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation k d in o thiosalicylate solution under o2 or n2 sparging was further measured and compared to investigate the importance of redox conditions on mehg photodegradation as shown in fig 4 a and b o2 sparging k d 3 84 0 25 10 2 h 1 had a negligible effect on mehg photodegradation in comparison to the non sparging control k d 3 64 0 26 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 1 since the production of reactive oxygen species is expected to be enhanced under oxic conditions tai et al 2014 this result indicates that reactive oxygen species may not play an important role in o thiosalicylate induced mehg photodegradation in contrast mehg photodegradation was significantly enhanced by n2 sparging t test p 0 01 k d under n2 treatment 18 36 0 65 10 2 h 1 were approximately 4 8 times higher than that of sparging with o2 and control however such an enhancement effect was not observed to be significant during the first 10 h fig 4a under n2 treatment o thiosalicylate can dimerize into dithiosalicylic acid reader and lines 1983 yepsen et al 2015 and the bipodal complexation of dithiol in dithiosalicylic acid with mehg may facilitate protolytic cleavage of the c hg bond melnick and parkin 2007 parks et al 2009 miller 2007 the formation of the highly photochemically active substance under n2 sparging and light irradiation may take some time explaining the minor effects of n2 sparging for the first 10 h it should also be noted here that the observed effect of o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation in o thiosalicylate solution is consistent with that found in natural waters and solutions of dom isolated from natural waters tai et al 2014 2016 suggesting o thiosalicylate could be a suitable model moiety for investigating the role of dom in mehg photodegradation once the photodegradation experiment was completed 198hg0 was analyzed to identify the major product of the mehg degradation with the results shown in fig 4c under n2 treatment nearly all of the me198hg added was transformed into 198hg0 101 6 22 0 while 87 2 12 0 of me198hg was converted into 198hg0 under o2 treatment when comparing the sum of me198hg and 198hg0 with me198hg at 40 h and 0 h under n2 o2 treatment respectively a good recovery 102 0 111 7 was obtained this result demonstrated that hg0 can be the main mehg photodegradation product consistent with previous studies chandan et al 2015 bergquist and blum 2007 hg0 was also observed as the main product in photolysis of ethylmercury and o thiosalicylate complexes thimerosal reader and lines 1983 yepsen et al 2015 the hg0 produced may come from the direct photoreduction of mehg chandan et al 2015 bergquist and blum 2007 or the photoreduction of hg2 generated from mehg photodegradation since only approximately 80 of the spiked 199hg2 used for tracing hg2 photoreduction was photochemically reduced into 199hg0 in the same reactor fig 4d if the hg0 is produced by the reduction of hg2 the amount of 198hg0 detected in the reactor should be lower than 80 of the degraded me198hg however we measured this value to be 100 indicating that hg0 may be the direct product of mehg photodegradation 3 5 possible mechanism of mehg photodegradation in the presence of o thiosalicylate based on the above results we proposed a possible protonolysis mechanism of mehg in the presence of o thiosalicylate as shown in fig 5 mehg can form a hg s bond with the thiol in o thiosalicylate leading to increased negative charge on the methyl group in mehg then the cooh in thiosalicylate transfers the proton to the methyl group resulting in the protonolysis of the hg c bond and the release of ch4 the formation of secondary complexation of mehg with the other thiol of a neighbouring o thiosalicylate could further weaken the c hg bond and facilitate mehg degradation melnick and parkin 2007 ni et al 2006 zukerman schpector et al 1991 in addition the dimerized dithiosalicylic acid could form a bipodal complexation of the dithiol with mehg which may further facilitate protolytic cleavage of the c hg bond melnick and parkin 2007 parks et al 2009 miller 2007 4 conclusion we systematically investigated the effects of dom molecular structures on mehg photodegradation by using a variety of organic ligands with different functional groups e g thiosalicylate thiophenol and thioaniline the results showed that thiol and phenyl groups may be the major dom functional groups for controlling mehg photodegradation with photodegradation rates also dependent on the type carboxyl hydroxyl amino group and position ortho meta para of other substituents moreover the addition of non photochemically active thiol ligands e g mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol and high concentrations of cl can significantly inhibit the o thiosalicylate acid induced mehg photodegradation indicating that complexation of mehg with photochemically active ligands is necessary for mehg photodegradation sparging with o2 shows negligible effect on mehg photodegradation while sparging with n2 significantly enhances mehg photodegradation this finding suggests that mehg photodegradation may be a reductive process which was further supported by the production of hg0 rather than hg2 following mehg photodegradation based on the above results we proposed a possible protonolysis mechanism for the photodegradation of mehg in the presence of o thiosalicylate mehg can form a hg s bond with the thiol in o thiosalicylate leading to increased negative charge on the methyl group in mehg then the cooh in thiosalicylate transfers a proton to the methyl group resulting in the protonolysis of the hg c bond and the release of ch4 however it should be noted that composition of dom in natural waters is complex and varies greatly in different systems to validate the conclusion of this study obtained in the laboratory relations of mehg photodegradation with thiol and phenyl groups in dom in natural waters should be investigated in future work acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21522705

19607,photodegradation is the main depletion pathway for methylmercury mehg in surface water the formation of mehg dissolved organic matter dom complexes has been found to be a key step in mehg photodegradation however the major functional groups involved in the dom mediated process have yet to be clearly resolved in this work we systematically investigated the effects of dom molecular structures on mehg photodegradation by using a variety of organic ligands with different functional groups e g thiosalicylate thiophenol and thioaniline the results showed that thiol and phenyl groups may be the major functional groups governing dom mediated mehg photodegradation with photodegradation rates also dependent on the type carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and position ortho meta and para of other chemical substituents the addition of non photochemically active thiol ligands e g mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol and high concentrations of cl can significantly inhibit the o thiosalicylate induced mehg photodegradation indicating that complexation of mehg with these ligands is necessary for mehg photodegradation sparging with o2 had a negligible effect on mehg photodegradation while sparging with n2 significantly enhanced mehg photodegradation this finding suggests that mehg photodegradation may be a reductive process which was further supported by identification of the degradation products of mehg a possible protonolysis mechanism of mehg photodegradation in the presence of o thiosalicylate was then proposed based on the findings of this study

enhancing mehg photodegradation qian et al 2014 thiol has been suggested to be the dom functional group governing mehg photodegradation zhang and hsu kim 2010 qian et al 2014 chandan et al 2015 while phenyl groups may also be involved in the mehg photodegradation but through an indirect pathway qian et al 2014 in addition the role of major functional groups e g phenolic and amino group in dom mediated mehg photodegradation has yet to be clearly determined moreover the type and position of other chemical substituents may also have a significant effect on dom mediated mehg photodegradation by altering the bond energy of c hg however such effects remain poorly understood the major objective of this study was to probe the mechanism of dom mediated photodegradation of methylmercury by using organic ligands with different molecular structures as the dom model we examined 1 the importance of the thiol and phenyl groups 2 the role of the type carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and position ortho meta and para of substituent functional groups 3 the role of co occurrence ligand non photochemically active thiol ligands and cl and 4 the effect of o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation based on the results of these experiments a possible mechanism for dom mediated photodegradation of mehg was proposed the results of this study will be useful for understanding the controlling factors and mechanism of dom mediated mehg photodegradation 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents enriched 198hgcl2 and 201hgcl2 were purchased from trace sciences international ontario canada me198hg and me201hg were synthesized by using methylcobalamin li et al 2010 martin doimeadios et al 2002 thirteen organic ligands were adopted as dom analogues including o m and p thiosalicylate o thioaniline o thiophenol cysteine dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid 2 mercaptoethylamine o phthalic acid catechol and o phenylenediamine all reagents were prepared freshly with deoxygenated water in an anaerobic chamber to prevent the oxidation of thiol compounds hu et al 2013 2 2 measurement of mehg photodegradation rates under various treatments me198hg was spiked into 100 ml deionized water in quartz bottles to achieve a final concentration of 10 ng l 1 five milliliters of phosphate buffer 0 2 mol l 1 was then added to achieve a solution ph of 7 0 the photodegradation experiment was carried out using a solar simulator equipped with three air cooled xe lamps 2500 w with the light intensity and temperature setting to 550 w m 2 and 35 c respectively the spectrum of the simulated sunlight was the same as that reported in our previous study yin et al 2014 next a 5 ml solution was sampled from each bottle following 0 3 6 9 15 22 30 and 40 h of incubation then 5 ng l 1 me201hg was added into the samples as an isotope dilution reagent for calculating the me198hg concentration the samples were then stored at 4 c until analysis aqueous ethylation and purge and trap pre concentration followed by gas chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for detecting the mehg content in samples detailed instrumentation and procedures for the analysis can be found in our previously published study ma et al 2014 for quality assurance and quality control qa qc purpose isotope dilution method was adopted to improve the accuracy and precision of the mehg analysis triplicate analyses were employed for each treatment the relative standard deviations rsd of triplicate samples ranged from 0 7 to 5 2 which were within the acceptable ranges of the epa 1630 method for mehg analysis 15 the method blank was approximate 0 05 ng l 1 within the acceptable value of epa 1630 method 0 1 ng l 1 the absolute method detection limit for mehg analysis was 0 75 pg 2 3 mehg photodegradation in the presence of non thiol aromatic thiol and nonaromatic thiol ligands to investigate the effect of thiol and phenyl groups on mehg photodegradation certain amounts of various dom analogues including three aromatic thiols o thiosalicylate o thioaniline and o thiophenol five nonaromatic thiols cysteine dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid and 2 mercaptoethylamine and three non thiol ligands o phthalic acid catechol and o phenylenediamine were added to 10 ng l 1 me198hg solution to achieve a final concentration of 1000 nmol l 1 respectively mehg photodegradation rates under these treatments were measured using the same method described above section 2 2 trials for mehg degradation by these dom analogues in the dark and mehg photodegradation without addition of any dom analogues were also included as controls 2 4 mehg photodegradation in the presence of aromatic thiol ligands with various substituents carboxyl hydroxyl and amino at different positions ortho meta and para to determine the influence of substituent carboxyl hydroxyl and amino on mehg photodegradation certain amounts of o m and p thiosalicylate o thiophenol or o thioaniline aromatic carboxyl hydroxyl and amino ligands were added to a 10 ng l 1 mehg solution to achieve a final concentration of 0 1 10000 nmol l 1 and 10 10000 nmol l 1 for o thiosalicylate and all the other ligands respectively mehg photodegradation under these treatments was measured using the same method described above section 2 2 2 5 effect of non photochemically active thiol ligands cl ph and o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation in the presence of thiosalicylate to investigate the role of mehg thiol complexation on mehg photodegradation mehg photodegradation rates were measured in trials involving the addition of both o thiosalicylate 1000 nmol l 1 and non photochemically active ligands dithiothreitol mercaptoethanol 10 Î¼mol l 1 or cl 0 1000 mmol l 1 using the same method described above section 2 2 the mehg photodegradation rates obtained were compared with those determined by the addition of only o thiosalicylate 1000 nmol l 1 to evaluate the importance of mehg thiol complexation in mehg photodegradation the effects of ph on mehg photodegradation in 1000 nmol l 1 thiosalicylate solution were also examined by measuring mehg photodegradation rates at ph of 5 4 7 0 and 8 4 adjusted using 10 mmol l 1 phosphate buffer to investigate the effects of the redox condition on mehg photodegradation mehg photodegradation rates in a 1000 nmol l 1 o thiosalicylate solution ph 7 0 10 mmol l 1 phosphate buffer were measured under sparging with o2 or n2 the solutions were sparged with o2 or n2 for 2 h first and then incubated in a quartz bubbler irradiated by three air cooled xe lamps 2500 w under 30 ml min 1 o2 or n2 the me198hg concentrations were determined using the isotope dilution method section 2 2 and used to calculate the photodegradation rates 199hg2 10 ng l 1 was also added to simultaneously trace the photoreduction of hg2 to hg0 hg0 released from the bubbler was collected using a gold trap 198hg0 and 199hg0 in the traps were then quantified by a thermal desorption icp ms system song et al 2017 to identify the major hg products for mehg photodegradation 2 6 data analysis the pseudo first order rate constant k d of mehg photodegradation was determined using eq 1 li et al 2010 tai et al 2014 k d for all treatments are provided in table s1 1 ln mehg t ln mehg 0 k d t where mehg 0 is the initial mehg concentration mehg t is the mehg concentration at time t and k d is the rate constant for mehg photodegradation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of various dom functional groups on mehg photodegradation to investigate the role of various dom functional groups in mehg photodegradation the photodegradation of mehg in a solution containing molecules with thiol aromatic moieties carboxyl amino or hydroxyl functional groups was examined as shown in fig 1 negligible mehg degradation was observed in deionized water under simulated sunlight ruling out the direct photodegradation of mehg in deionized water dom model molecules with both thiol and aromatic moieties o thioaniline o thiophenol and o thiosalicylate showed the highest mehg photodegradation rates hereafter denoted as k d k d 36 29 5 37 10 2 h 1 14 13 2 41 10 2 h 1 and 10 15 0 35 10 2 h 1 with only minor degradation observed for molecules with aromatic and non thiol moieties k d 0 10 h 1 e g carboxyl k d 0 60 0 13 10 2 h 1 hydroxyl k d 0 62 0 15 10 2 h 1 and amino k d 0 69 0 10 10 2 h 1 these results suggested that the thiol moiety in dom models may play a critical role in mehg photodegradation dom model molecules with thiol and nonaromatic moieties e g cysteine dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid and 2 mercaptoethylamine showed a much lower cysteine with k d as 0 77 0 12 10 2 h 1 or negligible dithiothreitol 2 mercaptoethanol 2 mercaptoacetic acid and 2 mercaptoethylamine mehg photodegradation compared with that of aromatic thiols o thioaniline o thiophenol and o thiosalicylate t test p 0 05 fig 1a indicating that the coexistence of aromatic moieties and the thiol group may be necessary for mehg photodegradation k d in suwannee river natural organic matter srnom was measured under the same incubation conditions in our previous study zhang et al 2017 k d in srnom was lower than that in organic ligand solutions with both thiol and phenyl groups and quicker than that in organic ligand solutions with only thiol or phenyl group supporting our conclusion that thiol and phenyl groups may be the major functional groups governing dom dominated mehg photodegradation in addition negligible k d was observed in the presence of thiosalicylate under dark conditions indicating the negligible contribution of non photochemical processes zhang and hsu kim 2010 qian et al 2014 k d in limited dom model moiety solutions including cysteine glutathione salicylate thiosalicylate and 6 thioguanine was previously tested and thiosalicylate was found to have the highest k d qian et al 2014 which is consistent with the results of this study thiols as soft lewis bases have high affinity for mehg melnick and parkin 2007 the binding of thiol with mehg can lower the singlet triplet excitation energies of c hg which enable the degradation of mehg thiol complexation under solar irradiation tossell 1998 strong absorption of light across the solar spectrum was observed in aromatic ligand solutions fig s1 which may facilitate the photosensitization of mehg thiol complexes and subsequently enhance mehg photodegradation melnick and parkin 2007 ni et al 2006 the aromaticity of dom has been widely found to play an important role in the sunlight mediated transformation of pollutants wenk et al 2011 boreen et al 2008 theoretically dom involved photochemical reactions may be controlled not only by the dominant functional groups but also by the type of substituents carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and their relative position against the dominant functional groups here the thiol and phenyl moieties as shown in fig 1a k d in aromatic thiols with different substituents followed in the order of o thioaniline o thiophenol o thiosalicylate the effects of the substituents carboxyl hydroxyl and amino group and their relative position against thiols in the aromatic thiols on k d were further comprehensively investigated to elucidate the major moieties that dominate mehg photodegradation in dom 3 2 effects of substituent types and position in aromatic thiols on mehg photodegradation to elucidate the potential roles of the carboxyl hydroxyl and amino moieties attached to the aromatic skeleton we investigated mehg photodegradation in various concentrations of o thiosalicylate o thioaniline and o thiophenol solution as shown in fig 2 a k d increased rapidly as the o thiosalicylate concentration was increased from 1 0 1 38 0 18 10 2 h 1 to 10 nmol l 1 6 88 0 99 10 2 h 1 followed by a slight increase from 10 to 10000 nmol l 1 10 15 0 46 10 2 h 1 however for o thioaniline and o thiophenol k d showed a significant increase from 10 to 1000 nmol l 1 followed by a decrease from 1000 to 10000 nmol l 1 at a ligand concentration of 10 nmol l 1 the k d for o thiosalicylate o thioaniline and o thiophenol were determined to follow the order of o thiosalicylate 6 88 0 99 10 2 h 1 o thioaniline 1 78 0 44 10 2 h 1 o thiophenol 1 44 0 58 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 01 while at 1000 nmol l 1 a sequence of o thioaniline 36 29 5 37 10 2 h 1 o thiophenol 14 13 2 41 10 2 h 1 o thiosalicylate 10 15 0 35 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 01 was observed from the time dependent mehg photodegradation data fig s2 we can see that after a period of irradiation under simulated sunlight mehg photodegradation slowed down and deviated from linearity in the presence of o thioaniline and o thiophenol which could be caused by insufficient complexation due to ligand photolysis this inhibition for o thioaniline and o thiophenol at high concentrations 10000 nmol l 1 could be mainly due to ligand induced light attenuation li et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 which is expected to decrease the number of photons available to be absorbed by the mehg thiol complex the importance of substituent position in mehg photodegradation was further investigated by using o m and p thiosalicylate as models at a ligand concentration of 10 nmol l 1 the k d for o thiosalicylate was found to be approximately 3 3 and 5 0 times higher than that for m and p thiosalicylate while similar rates were observed for o m p thiosalicylate at ligand concentrations of 100 and 1000 nmol l 1 k d with m thiosalicylate 17 94 1 20 10 2 h 1 and p thiosalicylate 16 59 1 54 10 2 h 1 was significantly higher than that with o thiosalicylate 10 15 0 46 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 05 at a ligand concentration of 10000 nmol l 1 these results suggest that the effect of the substitution position in the aromatic thiol on mehg photodegradation depends on the model concentration at low concentrations o thiosalicylate shows the highest enhancing effects on mehg photodegradation while the opposite was observed at high concentrations m thiosalicylate p thiosalicylate o thiosalicylate the significantly enhanced mehg photodegradation observed for m and p thiosalicylate at higher ligand concentrations can be due to the formation of a secondary complexation of mehg with the other thiol of a neighbouring m p thiosalicylate which could further weaken the c hg bond and facilitate mehg degradation melnick and parkin 2007 ni et al 2006 zukerman schpector et al 1991 however due to the steric hindrance effect the formation of secondary complexation between mehg and o thiosalicylate is more difficult compared to that of m p thiosalicylate which is not favorable for the enhancement of mehg photodegradation 3 3 effects of ph and the co existing ligand on mehg photodegradation the effect of ph on mehg photodegradation in the presence of o thiosalicylate was investigated by adjusting the ph to 5 4 7 0 and 8 4 as shown in fig 3 a k d was significantly decreased with increasing ph from 11 80 0 90 10 2 h 1 at ph 5 4 to 7 50 0 79 10 2 h 1 at ph 7 0 and 2 40 0 13 10 2 h 1 at ph 8 4 one way anova p 0 01 ph have been reported to affect mehg photodegradation via two possible pathways skyllberg et al 2006 karlsson and skyllberg 2003 amirbahman et al 2002 on one hand high ph can enhance the dissociation of thiol skyllberg et al 2006 karlsson and skyllberg 2003 which is expected to enhance the photodegradation of mehg by forming mehg thiol complexes amirbahman et al 2002 since contrary results were observed in this study low k d at high ph ph should not affect mehg photodegradation in o thiosalicylate solutions by influencing the dissociation of thiol on the other hand higher ph and oh concentration can facilitate the formation of mehgoh whose degradation is theoretically difficult under solar irradiation due to the high singlet triplet excitation energies involved tai et al 2014 however theoretical calculations for mehg speciation table s2 s3 suggested that even at ph 8 4 the mehg thiol complex accounted for over 99 94 of the total mehg at an o thiosalicylate concentration of 1000 nmol l 1 indicating that the decrease in k d with increasing ph cannot be explained by a change in mehg speciation here we proposed a possible mechanism of protonolysis of the hg c bond to explain the observed effect of ph on mehg photodegradation similar to organomercurial lyase merb ni et al 2006 parks et al 2009 the coordination of mehg with thiol in thiosalicylate similar to the role of cys96 and cys159 thiols in merb leads to increased negative charge on the methyl group consequently the cooh in thiosalicylate similar to the role of asp99 carboxylate in merb facilitates the protonolysis of the hg c bond and releasing the hydrocarbon product ch4 high ph could enhance the dissociation of carboxylate in thiosalicylate table s4 and inhibit the protonolysis of the hg c bond in mehg this mechanism could also partly explain the higher k d of o thiosalicylate in comparison to that of m and p thiosalicylate compared with meta and para carboxylate a carboxylate at the ortho position is more effective as a proton donor to nearby mehg and thus facilitates photodegradation of mehg as described above the complexation of mehg with thiosalicylate may play a key role in mehg photodegradation section 3 1 non photochemically active thiol ligands were added to validate the importance of mehg thiosalicylate complexation in mehg photodegradation as shown in fig 3b mehg photodegradation induced by thiosalicylate was significantly inhibited following the addition of 2 mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol indicating the necessity of forming mehg dom in mehg photodegradation t test p 0 01 since these non photochemically active thiol ligands e g mercaptoethanol thioglycolic acid and mercaptopropionic acid are also widely present in surface water zhang et al 2004 the competitive complexation between photochemically active and non photochemically active thiols for mehg can significantly affect mehg photodegradation in natural waters and this should be taken into account in any future study for the cycling and fate of mehg chloride ions cl can also complex with mehg association constants 105 45 brown and zweifel 2002 and subsequently influence its photodegradation the concentration of cl in natural water ranges from less than 1 mmol l 1 in freshwater to over 1000 mmol l 1 in hypersaline seawater the effect of cl on thiosalicylate induced mehg photodegradation was further investigated as shown in fig 3c the addition of cl at 100 mmol l 1 showed negligible influence on mehg photodegradation one way anova p 0 1 however at a cl concentration of 1000 mmol l 1 approximately 37 9 of mehg photodegradation was inhibited in the presence of 1000 mmol l 1 of cl and 1000 nmol l 1of thiosalicylate approximately 2 74 of mehg was calculated to exist in the form of mehgcl table s5 suggesting that this inhibition effect may operate via the breakdown of mehg thiosalicylate complexes this effect depends on the ratio of cl to thiol in natural water high cl concentrations in seawater could result in slow mehg photodegradation compared to fresh water zhang and hsu kim 2010 while the minor influence of cl on mehg photodegradation reported for water samples from the florida everglades may be due to low cl thiol ratio tai et al 2014 it should also be noted that the percentage of mehg complexed with cl was calculated to be lower than the reduction in mehg photodegradation observed upon addition of cl since there is a lack of data for the mehg o thiosalicylate complexation constant previously reported logk values of mehg sh 13 15 were used in our calculations amirbahman et al 2002 hintelmann et al 1997 karlsson and skyllberg 2003 therefore these results indicate that the complexation constant for mehg with thiol in thiosalicylate may be lower than the reported values 3 4 effect of o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation k d in o thiosalicylate solution under o2 or n2 sparging was further measured and compared to investigate the importance of redox conditions on mehg photodegradation as shown in fig 4 a and b o2 sparging k d 3 84 0 25 10 2 h 1 had a negligible effect on mehg photodegradation in comparison to the non sparging control k d 3 64 0 26 10 2 h 1 t test p 0 1 since the production of reactive oxygen species is expected to be enhanced under oxic conditions tai et al 2014 this result indicates that reactive oxygen species may not play an important role in o thiosalicylate induced mehg photodegradation in contrast mehg photodegradation was significantly enhanced by n2 sparging t test p 0 01 k d under n2 treatment 18 36 0 65 10 2 h 1 were approximately 4 8 times higher than that of sparging with o2 and control however such an enhancement effect was not observed to be significant during the first 10 h fig 4a under n2 treatment o thiosalicylate can dimerize into dithiosalicylic acid reader and lines 1983 yepsen et al 2015 and the bipodal complexation of dithiol in dithiosalicylic acid with mehg may facilitate protolytic cleavage of the c hg bond melnick and parkin 2007 parks et al 2009 miller 2007 the formation of the highly photochemically active substance under n2 sparging and light irradiation may take some time explaining the minor effects of n2 sparging for the first 10 h it should also be noted here that the observed effect of o2 n2 sparging on mehg photodegradation in o thiosalicylate solution is consistent with that found in natural waters and solutions of dom isolated from natural waters tai et al 2014 2016 suggesting o thiosalicylate could be a suitable model moiety for investigating the role of dom in mehg photodegradation once the photodegradation experiment was completed 198hg0 was analyzed to identify the major product of the mehg degradation with the results shown in fig 4c under n2 treatment nearly all of the me198hg added was transformed into 198hg0 101 6 22 0 while 87 2 12 0 of me198hg was converted into 198hg0 under o2 treatment when comparing the sum of me198hg and 198hg0 with me198hg at 40 h and 0 h under n2 o2 treatment respectively a good recovery 102 0 111 7 was obtained this result demonstrated that hg0 can be the main mehg photodegradation product consistent with previous studies chandan et al 2015 bergquist and blum 2007 hg0 was also observed as the main product in photolysis of ethylmercury and o thiosalicylate complexes thimerosal reader and lines 1983 yepsen et al 2015 the hg0 produced may come from the direct photoreduction of mehg chandan et al 2015 bergquist and blum 2007 or the photoreduction of hg2 generated from mehg photodegradation since only approximately 80 of the spiked 199hg2 used for tracing hg2 photoreduction was photochemically reduced into 199hg0 in the same reactor fig 4d if the hg0 is produced by the reduction of hg2 the amount of 198hg0 detected in the reactor should be lower than 80 of the degraded me198hg however we measured this value to be 100 indicating that hg0 may be the direct product of mehg photodegradation 3 5 possible mechanism of mehg photodegradation in the presence of o thiosalicylate based on the above results we proposed a possible protonolysis mechanism of mehg in the presence of o thiosalicylate as shown in fig 5 mehg can form a hg s bond with the thiol in o thiosalicylate leading to increased negative charge on the methyl group in mehg then the cooh in thiosalicylate transfers the proton to the methyl group resulting in the protonolysis of the hg c bond and the release of ch4 the formation of secondary complexation of mehg with the other thiol of a neighbouring o thiosalicylate could further weaken the c hg bond and facilitate mehg degradation melnick and parkin 2007 ni et al 2006 zukerman schpector et al 1991 in addition the dimerized dithiosalicylic acid could form a bipodal complexation of the dithiol with mehg which may further facilitate protolytic cleavage of the c hg bond melnick and parkin 2007 parks et al 2009 miller 2007 4 conclusion we systematically investigated the effects of dom molecular structures on mehg photodegradation by using a variety of organic ligands with different functional groups e g thiosalicylate thiophenol and thioaniline the results showed that thiol and phenyl groups may be the major dom functional groups for controlling mehg photodegradation with photodegradation rates also dependent on the type carboxyl hydroxyl amino group and position ortho meta para of other substituents moreover the addition of non photochemically active thiol ligands e g mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol and high concentrations of cl can significantly inhibit the o thiosalicylate acid induced mehg photodegradation indicating that complexation of mehg with photochemically active ligands is necessary for mehg photodegradation sparging with o2 shows negligible effect on mehg photodegradation while sparging with n2 significantly enhances mehg photodegradation this finding suggests that mehg photodegradation may be a reductive process which was further supported by the production of hg0 rather than hg2 following mehg photodegradation based on the above results we proposed a possible protonolysis mechanism for the photodegradation of mehg in the presence of o thiosalicylate mehg can form a hg s bond with the thiol in o thiosalicylate leading to increased negative charge on the methyl group in mehg then the cooh in thiosalicylate transfers a proton to the methyl group resulting in the protonolysis of the hg c bond and the release of ch4 however it should be noted that composition of dom in natural waters is complex and varies greatly in different systems to validate the conclusion of this study obtained in the laboratory relations of mehg photodegradation with thiol and phenyl groups in dom in natural waters should be investigated in future work acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 21522705

19608,treating drinking water appropriately depends in part on the robustness of source water quality risk assessments however quantifying the proportion of infectious human pathogenic cryptosporidium oocysts remains a significant challenge we analysed 962 source water samples across nine locations to profile the occurrence rate and timing of infectious human pathogenic cryptosporidium in surface waters entering drinking water reservoirs during rainfall runoff conditions at the catchment level average infectivity over the four year study period reached 18 however most locations averaged 5 the maximum recorded infectivity fraction within a single rainfall runoff event was 65 4 and was dominated by c parvum twenty two cryptosporidium species and genotypes were identified using pcr based molecular techniques the most common being c parvum detected in 23 of water samples associations between landuse and livestock stocking characteristics with cryptosporidium were determined using a linear mixed effects model the concentration of pathogens in water were significantly influenced by flow and dominance of land use by commercial grazing properties as opposed to lifestyle properties in the catchment p 0 01 inclusion of measured infectivity and human pathogenicity data into a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra could reduce the source water treatment requirements by up to 2 67 log removal values depending on the catchment and demonstrated the potential benefit of collating such data for qmras keywords surface water infectivity assay 18s gp60 pathogen quantitative microbial risk assessment 1 introduction cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus cryptosporidium and is a major treatment issue for drinking water utilities in both industrialised and developing countries a recent review of waterborne disease outbreaks suggested cryptosporidium spp was the responsible agent for 63 of the reported epidemics between 2011 and 2016 efstratiou et al 2017 while commonly contracted via person to person transmission contact with infected animals or ingestion of recreational water feltus et al 2006 widespread disease outbreaks have been attributed to contamination of drinking water supplies baldursson and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017 this partnered by the pathogen s ability to persist in the environment king and monis 2007 difficulty to remove via conventional treatment processes and resistance to chlorine disinfection peeters et al 1989 results in cryptosporidium risk mitigation remaining a key focus area for water utilities globally understanding risk to humans requires an appreciation of the diversity within the cryptosporidium genus the 29 species and 50 genotypes xiao 2010 ruecker et al 2012 zahedi et al 2016 vary markedly in their host specificity and subsequently virulence to human health cryptosporidium hominis and c parvum are responsible for the majority of human infections xiao 2010 while species such as c bovis or c ryanae generally associated with adult cattle or c fayeri generally associated with wildlife are of a lesser concern to humans zahedi et al 2016 generalising cryptosporidium spp host specificity enables to some degree the use of the pathogen to track contaminant sources within the catchment yang et al 2008 wilkes et al 2013a different land uses such as those found in mixed use surface water catchments will often reflect the microbial pollution present from livestock wildlife or human faecal material yang et al 2008 robinson et al 2011 ruecker et al 2007 2012 wilkes et al 2013a swaffer et al 2014 surface water runoff from areas where development is low or negligible tend to contain cryptosporidium shed from wildlife wilkes et al 2013a swaffer et al 2014 whereas streams from dairy and beef farms stocked with mature cattle often have a higher frequency of species such as c andersoni ruecker et al 2007 ryan and power 2012 adding to the complexity of pathogen dynamics it is generally understood that the quantity and source of cryptosporidium has a temporal in addition to spatial trend within a landscape lapen et al 2016 this is partly due to the seasonality of rainfall resulting in surface water runoff delivering pathogens into streams kistemann et al 2002 robinson et al 2011 swaffer et al 2014 but also further influenced by the breeding cycle of hosts within the catchment cryptosporidium parvum prevalence varies markedly by the age and species of its host especially in cattle young 1 month beef and dairy calves often exhibit high rates of infection coklin et al 2007 rieux et al 2014 that are almost exclusively caused by c parvum santÃ¬n et al 2004 rieux et al 2014 however as individuals age the frequency of infection decreases santÃ¬n et al 2004 2008 and the cryptosporidium species shifts to favour c bovis c ryanae and or c andersoni dominance fayer et al 2007 2010a robinson et al 2011 ryan and power 2012 sheep also demonstrate age related differences in pathogen prevalence with lambs having higher rates of infection than adults sweeny et al 2011 yang et al 2014 however importantly c parvum is less common and infections tend to be attributed to c xiaoi and c ubiquitum regardless of age sweeny et al 2011 ryan and power 2012 yang et al 2014 cryptosporidium in sheep has therefore been suggested to present less of a concern to human health ryan et al 2005 sweeny et al 2011 although recent reports suggest c ubiquitum is an emerging pathogen of significance to humans li et al 2014 water utilities are continually seeking to improve their understanding of pathogen related human health risk driven by tighter regulatory controls on microbial thresholds for potable water and a desire to untangle the complex interactions between landuse human wildlife seasonal and or climatic influences that result in source water contamination cryptosporidium in particular are notorious for presenting a planning challenge to water suppliers due to their irregular fate and transport mechanisms within the catchments as well as uncertainties in relation to their human infectious characteristics especially when drinking water supply catchments are open to human activities quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra are being increasingly used to assess the effect of human exposure to cryptosporidium however it can over estimate human health risk if based on concentration data alone either ifa ve or dapi confirmed with preference given to dapi confirmed when available without considering the human infective proportion lapen et al 2016 petterson et al 2015 an increasing body of evidence demonstrates the value of refining qmra approaches by quantifying the human pathogenic proportion and or the infectious fraction of oocysts both wilkes et al 2013b and lapen et al 2016 found that average risk values were approximately an order of magnitude lower when considering the proportion of c hominis and c parvum detections using molecular approaches compared to assuming all oocysts were human pathogenic polymerase chain reaction pcr approaches have been commonly used to refine qmras by identifying the prevalence of c hominis and c parvum in raw water samples boyer and kuczynska 2003 yang et al 2008 chalmers et al 2010 wilkes et al 2013b swaffer et al 2014 however data regarding oocyst infectivity capacity to infect if ingested by a suitable host is not widely available the ability to measure oocyst infectivity has been impeded by a number of logistical and methodological issues hijjawi 2010 recent improvements in cell culture immunofluorescence assays king et al 2015 have started to generate data on oocyst infectivity in both surface water swaffer et al 2014 and wastewater sources king et al 2015 2017 incorporating both species genotyping and infectivity data into qmra approaches offers a vastly improved assessment of human health risk in source water used for drinking water supplies 1 1 objectives the objectives of this study were to quantify the occurrence and infectious fraction including identification of the infective oocyst of cryptosporidium in source water used for drinking water supplies using water samples collected across nine locations from five catchments for up to four years in addition we profiled the range of cryptosporidium in the water using molecular approaches to identify species genotypes present independently from their infective nature both infectivity and species genotyping data were compared to the land use variables within the catchment to evaluate the linkage between catchment characteristics and the magnitude and timing of infection risk in source water finally the source water pathogen challenge in the catchment was calculated using a qmra refined by the infectivity and genotyping data to highlight the benefit of including such data when quantifying source water treatment requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 location description the study sites were located within the northern zone of the mount lofty ranges watershed 34 7834 138 8515 a multi use region comprised of open catchments and 90 private ownership epa 2017 the mount lofty ranges watershed provides on average 60 of the source water epa 2017 used to supply drinking water to approximately 1 700

usage codes were used to partition livestock grazing into commercial or lifestyle orientated properties government of south australia 2015 climate is classified as temperate with a dry and warm summer has an average annual rainfall of 830 mm and annual average potential evapotranspiration of 1300 mm bureau of meteorology 2017 the annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration rates received during the study period compared to the long term average is shown in fig 2 the water quality characteristics of five surface water catchments supplying two reservoirs were quantified during this investigation 1 little para reservoir via little para river lpr and gould creek gc catchments and 2 millbrook reservoir via millbrook creek mc kersbrook creek kc and the torrens river tr an additional four sub catchments were also monitored upstream of kersbrook creek in a nested design sub catchment 2 sc2 sub catchment 3 sc3 sub catchment 4 sc4 and sub catchment 5 sc5 the catchment area ha and dominant landuse occurring upstream of the monitored locations is described in table 1 nine telemetered automatic sampling and water quality monitoring stations were modified to collect a maximum of 24 10 l flow proportional samples model 3700 isco inc nebraska usa per runoff event while simultaneously measuring flow model cs541 campbell scientific inc usa and turbidity sonde ms 600 series ysi australia every five minutes five sites were established in 2013 and a further four sites in 2014 the duration that each station was operational is described in table 2 2 2 cryptosporidium sample collection and preparation water samples were lodged for cryptosporidium analyses based on their alignment at or close to the hydrograph peak which was assumed to coincide with maximum pathogen concentrations samples were analysed using one of two analysis streams 1 infectivity testing of oocysts and identification of infectious foci by a cell culture assay or 2 identification of species present using polymerase chain reaction pcr and dna sequencing table 2 initially all water samples were concentrated using calcium carbonate precipitation vesey et al 1993 followed by oocyst purification using a dynal cryptosporidium immunomagnetic separation ims kit using the manufacturer s instructions by the australian water quality centre adelaide south australia 2 3 infectivity testing of oocysts and identification of infectious foci a single format in vitro cell culture infectivity assay was used to obtain oocyst counts the number and identity of infectious oocysts and oocyst recovery data following king et al 2015 briefly oocysts were exposed to excystation triggers including glucose bovine bile and acids and centrifuged onto the cell culture monolayer to ensure contact with the host hct 8 cells after four hours oocysts were recovered from monolayers by washing stained with easystain btf sydney australia and both colorseed and environmental oocysts were enumerated plate controls determined the plate recovery efficiency the environmental oocyst count combined with the plate recovery efficiency was used to estimate the number of environmental oocysts applied to cell culture the conditions of the cell culture and detection of foci is described in king et al 2011 the overall sample recovery rate was determined using the colorseed count which allowed the total environmental oocyst concentration to be presented per 10 l in the absence of characterisation by dapi or dic as the oocysts have been excysted this represents a presumptive count the dna from infectious foci was recovered by a crude cell lysis method using trypsin followed by boiling with pcr based identification as described in section 2 4 2 4 identification of species using pcr and dna sequencing detection of cryptosporidium species in the water sample used dna analysis following the method of xiao et al 2006 and was extracted using qiaamp dna mini extraction kits qiagen germany to summarise ims pellets were resuspended in 180 Î¼l of atl buffer freeze thawed five times using liquid nitrogen and a heating block warmed to 56 c following this 200 Î¼l of al buffer was added to each sample and incubated for 10 min at 70 c cell debris and ims beads were removed using maximum centrifugation and the concentrate processed using qiagen dneasy extraction kit following the manufacturer s instruction the pcr assays applied to the purified dna targeted the 18s rrna gene and 60 kda glycoprotein gene gp60 and assessed by dna melt curve analysis webber et al 2013 the gp60 pcr assay amplifies dna from a limited number of intestinal cryptosporidium species including c parvum c hominis and c cuniculus which present a human health concern alves et al 2003 while the 18s rrna gene is capable of amplifying dna from all cryptosporidium species including those not of human health concern xiao et al 1999 the amplicons were purified using qiagen pcr purification kits and submitted to the australian genome research facility for sanger sequencing using big dye terminator version 3 1 chemistry on either applied biosystems 3730 and 3730xl capillary sequencers sequences were then analysed using geneious version 6 biomatter ltd with raw sequences processed using de novo assembly the resulting sequences were individually identified by nucleotide blast search https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi using blast and default general parameters except that max target sequences was set to 500 the resulting blast output was then visualised using the distance tree of results with default settings fast minimum evolution 0 75 max seq difference sequence labels showing sequence title identification was made on the basis of close association with known species or genotypes of cryptosporidium ensuring that the reference sequence used as the basis of the identification was from a credible published source if a sequence could not be clearly assigned it was reported as cryptosporidium spp 2 5 statistical analyses and model development the relationships between landuse and stocking characteristics grazing commercial or grazing lifestyle and pathogen data were investigated using linear mixed effects models the data were prepared by removing outliers that resulted in discontinuous distributions and applying the yeo johnson transformation to improve normality and homoscedasticity yeo and johnson 2000 outlier removal resulted in the exclusion of 6 of 566 data and post hoc testing resulted in only minor changes to the effect estimates and no changes to the resulting model structure correlation and fixed effects error was nested by sub catchment within a catchment as appropriate the best of a range of temporal correlation structures auto regressive and continuous auto regressive was identified using analysis of variance comparisons between models with different auto regressive periods with the fixed effects set to the null model by this method an auto regressive model structure with period 7 was selected the most parsimonious fixed effects were determined using stepwise model selection stepaic mass package venables and ripley 2002 model coefficients were estimated using maximum likelihood to allow stepwise model comparisons by akaike s an information criterion aic and updated to residual maximum likelihood reml estimates following fixed effects model selection the scope of the model selection procedure included continuous factors of the areal flow mm the proportions of commercial and lifestyle grazing and boolean factors representing the dominance of commercial cattle stock properties 50 of the catchment and the dominance of breeding stock inclusive of cattle and sheep the model therefore explored the possibility of linear relationships between the transformed continuous variables or the simpler model that the characteristics of the catchments determine the relationship of the response oocysts with another environmental variable i e flow confidence intervals of the model predictions 95 were estimated using 1000 multivariate normal samples from the parameter and variance covariance matrix estimates 2 6 quantitative microbial risk assessment a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been developed by the australian water industry to characterise the level of source water impairment from pathogens and assist with demonstrating compliance with an anticipated microbial product water threshold of one micro daly disability adjusted life year per person per year wsaa 2015 based on the world health organisation s guidelines for drinking water quality who 2011 complying with the one micro daly threshold relies on the quantifying the source water challenge in log10 values lrv and is calculated using information about pathogen concentrations and infectivity rates with dose response models to estimate the probability of infection within a population exposed to the drinking water which can then be used to estimate disease burden to the community the calculations and input assumptions are presented in table 3 with further information available in chapter 7 of who 2011 appendix c the australian manual wsaa 2015 petterson et al 2015 and monis et al 2017 importantly we have used event runoff data only to estimate the average number of pathogens per litre of source water without routine or baseline inputs this results in the source water challenge estimating peak rather than annualised risk but is considered appropriate for this region as these systems are highly ephemeral with negligible baseflow almost all of the water entering these reservoirs are delivered during runoff events therefore the source water challenge estimates are more reflective of the volumetric delivery mechanism for these systems the qmra s presented here have applied default infectivity 30 and human pathogenicity 100 assumptions as scenario 1 and used measured infectivity and human pathogenicity prevalence as scenario 2 where no infectious oocysts were detected 1 was used as the infectivity assay provides a presumptive oocyst count only we estimated the concentrations of confirmed oocysts containing internal structures that confirm them to be cryptosporidium oocysts using a regression derived from independent water samples where both presumptive and confirmed oocyst data was available data not shown n 781 r 2 0 93 f x 0 644x input assumptions for each scenario are defined in table 3 3 results a total of 637 water samples were analysed for cryptosporidium count and infectivity rates and another 325 water samples for cryptosporidium species genotypes across 31 rainfall runoff events june 2013 until september 2016 from nine sampling locations table 4 using the infectivity assay sample recovery rates averaged 29 std dev 14 and any result where recovery was 10 was removed from further analysis n 59 plate wash controls averaged 88 std dev 10 oocyst infectivity controls averaged 41 std dev 19 3 1 presence of cryptosporidium during runoff events source water cryptosporidium concentrations varied markedly by event and location average confirmed concentrations for little para river was 43 per 10 l max 306 gould creek was 38 per 10 l max 54 kersbrook creek was 148 per 10 l max 825 sub catchment 2 was 181 per 10 l max 991 sub catchment 3 was 18 per 10 l max 135 sub catchment 4 was 130 per 10 l max 258 sub catchment 5 was 187 per 10 l max 2176 millbrook creek was 12 per 10 l max 108 and torrens river averaged 135 per 10 l max 801 3 2 cryptosporidium infectivity and identification of foci a total of 14 976 environmental oocysts were analysed by the cell culture infectivity assay for detection of infectious cryptosporidium table 4 from this 1162 foci were detected with the majority found in water samples collected from sub catchment 2 69 the torrens river 13 and kersbrook creek 11 for each of the nine locations average infectivity ranged from 0 in gould creek and millbrook creek no foci detected to 18 in sub catchment 2 maximum infectivity rates recorded during a single runoff event average of four samples varied from 0 millbrook creek to 65 4 sub catchment 2 other locations with high infectivity fractions in a single runoff event were torrens river 48 4 and kersbrook creek 20 7 the majority 84 of the foci were attributed to infectious c parvum with a further 13 of foci attributed to c cuniculus 1 1 to c tyzzeri 0 6 to c ubiquitum and 0 3 to c ryanae identification of species through pcr and dna sequencing failed on 13 foci and are presented as no result table 4 3 3 cryptosporidium species genotype prevalence a total of 22 species and genotypes were detected from 475 positive pcr results highlighting the diversity of cryptosporidium in the source water table 5 cryptosporidium parvum was the most commonly detected species n 107 followed by c ubiquitum n 65 c tyzzeri n 57 c muris n 55 and c bovis n 55 the ten most commonly detected species genotypes accounting for 90 of the detections 429 475 by year and location are shown in fig 3 cryptosporidium detected at little para river were dominated by species most likely derived from rodents in 2014 53 of detections which dropped to 23 of detections in 2016 with c ubiquitum now accounting for 31 of detections similarly a shift in cryptosporidium dominance was evident for sub catchment 2 in 2013 100 of the detections were positive for c ryanae or c bovis most likely originating from adult cattle however from 2014 c parvum dominance increased and comprised 74 of the detection in 2016 the majority of species detected in sub catchment 3 also appeared to be livestock derived however c bovis and c ryanae were detected more frequently than c parvum or c ubiquitum millbrook creek had relatively low rates of livestock derived species across the entire study period with 66 of detections attributed to rodent and wildlife derived cryptosporidium 3 4 linear mixed effects model the most parsimonious model identified by stepwise model selection 2 5 included the continuous factors flow and the boolean factor commercial stocking and their interaction table 6 the model can be interpreted as a linear regression between transformed variables where the slope of the relationship is the same within levels of commercial stocking while the intercepts vary between the different sub catchments the behaviour and overall fit of the model predicting oocyst concentration is illustrated by the agreement between the observed values and those predicted by the linear mixed effects model fig 4 the influence of the commercial grazing classification is demonstrated by the steeper slope of the regression with flow c f kersbrook creek and torrens river to little para river and millbrook creek catchments dominated by lifestyle properties i e less likely to have significant numbers of breeding livestock have lower peak oocyst density in the runoff water 3 5 quantitative microbial risk assessment the qmra highlights the spatial variability in cryptosporidium risk across catchments driven by the benefit of gathering human pathogenicity and oocyst infectivity data table 7 scenario 1 default assumptions estimated the level of treatment expressed as a log10 removal values or lrv during event conditions to range between 4 65 lrv mc and 5 85 lrv sc5 however scenario 2 measured c parvum c hominis prevalence and maximum infectivity measured during a single runoff event significantly lowered the treatment required for most of the sub catchments for millbrook creek the lrv required for source water treatment dropped from 4 65 scenario 1 to 1 97 scenario 2 equating to a gain of 2 67 lrv credits similarly sub catchment 3 and little para river lrv estimates also decreased markedly with the inclusion of more refined data with a gain of 1 87 and 1 62 lrv respectively however for sub catchment 2 and torrens river the measured maximum infectious fraction exceeded the default assumption of 30 which in the case of sub catchment 2 increased the treatment required for the source water quality by 0 26 lrv 5 84 6 10 lrv table 7 4 discussion quantifying oocyst infectivity and the proportion of human pathogenic species present provides a major opportunity to improve estimates of human health risk from cryptosporidium in surface water sources we used 578 water samples to measure the infectious fraction of 14 796 oocysts resulting in 1162 cell culture foci as far as we are aware this is the most comprehensive assessment of oocyst infectivity in raw water samples using cell culture and has demonstrated the spatial and temporal variability of infectious oocysts in the catchment during the study period overall infectivity rates varied markedly 3 for little para river gould creek millbrook creek and sub catchment 3 4 and 5 which was similar to the 3 1 reported by swaffer et al 2014 higher infectivity rates were recorded for kersbrook creek sub catchment 2 and the torrens river 4 3 18 0 and 9 6 respectively for individual runoff events however infectivity fractions greatly increased in some locations and reached 20 7 in kersbrook creek 65 4 in sub catchment 2 and 48 4 in the torrens river these infections occurred in may and june and were dominated by the presence c parvum which coincided with the presence of newborn livestock in the catchment sub catchment 2 provided the greatest opportunity to track the host of the infectious c parvum due to its small catchment size and limited number of properties a landholder survey undertaken for sub catchment 2 3 and 5 data not shown confirmed that the infectious c parvum in sub catchment 2 most likely originated from juvenile cattle within the catchment interestingly sub catchment 5 was dominated by breeding sheep and infectious c parvum was not detected from this catchment at any stage sub catchment 3 was stocked with non breeding cattle and again infectious c parvum was not detected in any water sample but c bovis and c ryanae were commonly detected using genotyping methods similar to coklin et al 2007 rieux et al 2014 and santÃ¬n et al 2004 2008 these data supports the age related distribution of infectious c parvum with very young livestock and in this case was associated with properties with breeding cattle but not associated with properties with breeding sheep therefore the data here suggest that the highest rates of infectious c parvum may be more likely to originate from properties with cattle breeding programs rather than sheep properties or those lacking breeding stock while sheep appeared to present a lower risk in terms of c parvum prevalence we caution against underestimating the potential of sheep hosting human pathogenic cryptosporidium due to recent suggestions that c ubiquitum may present a higher human health risk than previously assumed li et al 2014 furthermore it is important to recognise that the cell culture infectivity assay was optimised and validated for c parvum and c hominis and while some foci were attributed to other species the method was not validated for the detection of infectious oocysts from other species of cryptosporidium it is possible that higher numbers of infectious c ubiquitum were being exported out of sub catchment 5 but the cell culture assay failed to support the development of these foci of the 22 species detected using molecular approaches 13 have been detected in humans either commonly i e c parvum sporadically i e c cuniculus c ubiquitum c meleagridis c canis or in isolated instances i e c tyzzeri c muris c bovis c fayeri c andersoni c viatorum c suis c baileyi furthermore the dominant species associated with a particular location varied throughout the study period cryptosporidium ubiquitum increased in its rate of detection notably associated with sub catchment 5 this species has emerged as having the greatest number of known host species including humans is most often detected in industrialised nations and covers the broadest geographical area of any cryptosporidium species fayer et al 2010b xiao et al 2014 sub catchment 2 also demonstrated a marked change c bovis and c ryanae became less common and c parvum increased in its rate of detection a similar change was also reported by rieux et al 2014 who studied successive cohorts of calves 3 days 1 month across three years in a single beef cattle herd and reported a dominance of c bovis in the first year which changed to c parvum dominance in the third year as demonstrated by the model the highest concentrations of oocysts were linked to catchments which contained a greater proportion of commercial orientated grazing properties as opposed to lifestyle properties this finding is a significant advance on the previous public health risk assumption that the rate of cryptosporidium export was likely to be consistent across any land parcel associated with agricultural grazing notwithstanding the possibility that poorly managed livestock on lifestyle properties could still contribute cryptosporidium into streams the strong linkage between commercial properties and cryptosporidium occurrence identified through this study now provides a new mechanism to begin to target areas within broad acre grazing zones for mitigation measures which are likely to be contributing runoff with a higher pathogen risk profile recognising landuse traits which generate high numbers of human infectious species can direct the efficient use of resources should water utilities seek to refine estimates of human health risk beyond default assumptions the inclusion of infectivity and genotyping information into the qmra in all but one of the study catchments decreased the treatment required to comply with a product water target of 1 microdaly per person per year the greatest reductions were located where the infectious fraction was low and molecular techniques did not identify c parvum frequently four of the seven catchments where the qmra was applied decreased their treatment requirement by more than 1 lrv 2 67 1 87 1 62 1 11 which can represent significant treatment savings for water utilities conversely where infectivity rates were high and genotyping methods commonly detected c parvum as was the case for sub catchment 2 the qmra suggested the default assumptions would have resulted in a treatment shortfall it is important to recognise that sub catchment 2 occurred upstream of the kersbrook creek station and that both sub catchment 3 and 5 would have contributed to diluting the microbial contamination emanating from sub catchment 2 prior to millbrook reservoir regardless the example demonstrates that the inclusion of infectivity and genotyping data does not guarantee a reduction in the source water challenge estimate and that vigilance in monitoring risk within catchments remains a necessary practice on a regular basis to ensure that water quality concerns are identified importantly the seasonality of cryptosporidium in the catchment autumn winter prevalence dominated by c parvum does not appear to match the seasonality of reportable infections in the region summer prevalence dominated by c hominis king et al 2017 suggesting that water treatment plants are effective in preventing infection from catchment derived pathogens and that the majority of human infections are more likely caused through alternative transmission pathways i e person to person and swimming pools 5 conclusion this research has provided a thorough assessment of the elevated source water challenge present during rainfall runoff conditions which has demonstrated the maximum risk to human health appears to be linked to catchment runoff coinciding with host breeding cycles particularly cattle contributing to the temporal and spatial diversity exhibited in source water oocyst concentrations and infectivity rates many catchments contain nil to low levels of infectious c parvum depending on the nature of the landholdings present which highlights the need for water utilities to remain vigilant in understanding their source water environment the benefit of refining default infectivity assumptions in assessments of annualised risk is clearly shown using the qmra where the data suggest that adoption of the default

19608,treating drinking water appropriately depends in part on the robustness of source water quality risk assessments however quantifying the proportion of infectious human pathogenic cryptosporidium oocysts remains a significant challenge we analysed 962 source water samples across nine locations to profile the occurrence rate and timing of infectious human pathogenic cryptosporidium in surface waters entering drinking water reservoirs during rainfall runoff conditions at the catchment level average infectivity over the four year study period reached 18 however most locations averaged 5 the maximum recorded infectivity fraction within a single rainfall runoff event was 65 4 and was dominated by c parvum twenty two cryptosporidium species and genotypes were identified using pcr based molecular techniques the most common being c parvum detected in 23 of water samples associations between landuse and livestock stocking characteristics with cryptosporidium were determined using a linear mixed effects model the concentration of pathogens in water were significantly influenced by flow and dominance of land use by commercial grazing properties as opposed to lifestyle properties in the catchment p 0 01 inclusion of measured infectivity and human pathogenicity data into a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra could reduce the source water treatment requirements by up to 2 67 log removal values depending on the catchment and demonstrated the potential benefit of collating such data for qmras keywords surface water infectivity assay 18s gp60 pathogen quantitative microbial risk assessment 1 introduction cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus cryptosporidium and is a major treatment issue for drinking water utilities in both industrialised and developing countries a recent review of waterborne disease outbreaks suggested cryptosporidium spp was the responsible agent for 63 of the reported epidemics between 2011 and 2016 efstratiou et al 2017 while commonly contracted via person to person transmission contact with infected animals or ingestion of recreational water feltus et al 2006 widespread disease outbreaks have been attributed to contamination of drinking water supplies baldursson and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017 this partnered by the pathogen s ability to persist in the environment king and monis 2007 difficulty to remove via conventional treatment processes and resistance to chlorine disinfection peeters et al 1989 results in cryptosporidium risk mitigation remaining a key focus area for water utilities globally understanding risk to humans requires an appreciation of the diversity within the cryptosporidium genus the 29 species and 50 genotypes xiao 2010 ruecker et al 2012 zahedi et al 2016 vary markedly in their host specificity and subsequently virulence to human health cryptosporidium hominis and c parvum are responsible for the majority of human infections xiao 2010 while species such as c bovis or c ryanae generally associated with adult cattle or c fayeri generally associated with wildlife are of a lesser concern to humans zahedi et al 2016 generalising cryptosporidium spp host specificity enables to some degree the use of the pathogen to track contaminant sources within the catchment yang et al 2008 wilkes et al 2013a different land uses such as those found in mixed use surface water catchments will often reflect the microbial pollution present from livestock wildlife or human faecal material yang et al 2008 robinson et al 2011 ruecker et al 2007 2012 wilkes et al 2013a swaffer et al 2014 surface water runoff from areas where development is low or negligible tend to contain cryptosporidium shed from wildlife wilkes et al 2013a swaffer et al 2014 whereas streams from dairy and beef farms stocked with mature cattle often have a higher frequency of species such as c andersoni ruecker et al 2007 ryan and power 2012 adding to the complexity of pathogen dynamics it is generally understood that the quantity and source of cryptosporidium has a temporal in addition to spatial trend within a landscape lapen et al 2016 this is partly due to the seasonality of rainfall resulting in surface water runoff delivering pathogens into streams kistemann et al 2002 robinson et al 2011 swaffer et al 2014 but also further influenced by the breeding cycle of hosts within the catchment cryptosporidium parvum prevalence varies markedly by the age and species of its host especially in cattle young 1 month beef and dairy calves often exhibit high rates of infection coklin et al 2007 rieux et al 2014 that are almost exclusively caused by c parvum santÃ¬n et al 2004 rieux et al 2014 however as individuals age the frequency of infection decreases santÃ¬n et al 2004 2008 and the cryptosporidium species shifts to favour c bovis c ryanae and or c andersoni dominance fayer et al 2007 2010a robinson et al 2011 ryan and power 2012 sheep also demonstrate age related differences in pathogen prevalence with lambs having higher rates of infection than adults sweeny et al 2011 yang et al 2014 however importantly c parvum is less common and infections tend to be attributed to c xiaoi and c ubiquitum regardless of age sweeny et al 2011 ryan and power 2012 yang et al 2014 cryptosporidium in sheep has therefore been suggested to present less of a concern to human health ryan et al 2005 sweeny et al 2011 although recent reports suggest c ubiquitum is an emerging pathogen of significance to humans li et al 2014 water utilities are continually seeking to improve their understanding of pathogen related human health risk driven by tighter regulatory controls on microbial thresholds for potable water and a desire to untangle the complex interactions between landuse human wildlife seasonal and or climatic influences that result in source water contamination cryptosporidium in particular are notorious for presenting a planning challenge to water suppliers due to their irregular fate and transport mechanisms within the catchments as well as uncertainties in relation to their human infectious characteristics especially when drinking water supply catchments are open to human activities quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra are being increasingly used to assess the effect of human exposure to cryptosporidium however it can over estimate human health risk if based on concentration data alone either ifa ve or dapi confirmed with preference given to dapi confirmed when available without considering the human infective proportion lapen et al 2016 petterson et al 2015 an increasing body of evidence demonstrates the value of refining qmra approaches by quantifying the human pathogenic proportion and or the infectious fraction of oocysts both wilkes et al 2013b and lapen et al 2016 found that average risk values were approximately an order of magnitude lower when considering the proportion of c hominis and c parvum detections using molecular approaches compared to assuming all oocysts were human pathogenic polymerase chain reaction pcr approaches have been commonly used to refine qmras by identifying the prevalence of c hominis and c parvum in raw water samples boyer and kuczynska 2003 yang et al 2008 chalmers et al 2010 wilkes et al 2013b swaffer et al 2014 however data regarding oocyst infectivity capacity to infect if ingested by a suitable host is not widely available the ability to measure oocyst infectivity has been impeded by a number of logistical and methodological issues hijjawi 2010 recent improvements in cell culture immunofluorescence assays king et al 2015 have started to generate data on oocyst infectivity in both surface water swaffer et al 2014 and wastewater sources king et al 2015 2017 incorporating both species genotyping and infectivity data into qmra approaches offers a vastly improved assessment of human health risk in source water used for drinking water supplies 1 1 objectives the objectives of this study were to quantify the occurrence and infectious fraction including identification of the infective oocyst of cryptosporidium in source water used for drinking water supplies using water samples collected across nine locations from five catchments for up to four years in addition we profiled the range of cryptosporidium in the water using molecular approaches to identify species genotypes present independently from their infective nature both infectivity and species genotyping data were compared to the land use variables within the catchment to evaluate the linkage between catchment characteristics and the magnitude and timing of infection risk in source water finally the source water pathogen challenge in the catchment was calculated using a qmra refined by the infectivity and genotyping data to highlight the benefit of including such data when quantifying source water treatment requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 location description the study sites were located within the northern zone of the mount lofty ranges watershed 34 7834 138 8515 a multi use region

dominant landuse occurring upstream of the monitored locations is described in table 1 nine telemetered automatic sampling and water quality monitoring stations were modified to collect a maximum of 24 10 l flow proportional samples model 3700 isco inc nebraska usa per runoff event while simultaneously measuring flow model cs541 campbell scientific inc usa and turbidity sonde ms 600 series ysi australia every five minutes five sites were established in 2013 and a further four sites in 2014 the duration that each station was operational is described in table 2 2 2 cryptosporidium sample collection and preparation water samples were lodged for cryptosporidium analyses based on their alignment at or close to the hydrograph peak which was assumed to coincide with maximum pathogen concentrations samples were analysed using one of two analysis streams 1 infectivity testing of oocysts and identification of infectious foci by a cell culture assay or 2 identification of species present using polymerase chain reaction pcr and dna sequencing table 2 initially all water samples were concentrated using calcium carbonate precipitation vesey et al 1993 followed by oocyst purification using a dynal cryptosporidium immunomagnetic separation ims kit using the manufacturer s instructions by the australian water quality centre adelaide south australia 2 3 infectivity testing of oocysts and identification of infectious foci a single format in vitro cell culture infectivity assay was used to obtain oocyst counts the number and identity of infectious oocysts and oocyst recovery data following king et al 2015 briefly oocysts were exposed to excystation triggers including glucose bovine bile and acids and centrifuged onto the cell culture monolayer to ensure contact with the host hct 8 cells after four hours oocysts were recovered from monolayers by washing stained with easystain btf sydney australia and both colorseed and environmental oocysts were enumerated plate controls determined the plate recovery efficiency the environmental oocyst count combined with the plate recovery efficiency was used to estimate the number of environmental oocysts applied to cell culture the conditions of the cell culture and detection of foci is described in king et al 2011 the overall sample recovery rate was determined using the colorseed count which allowed the total environmental oocyst concentration to be presented per 10 l in the absence of characterisation by dapi or dic as the oocysts have been excysted this represents a presumptive count the dna from infectious foci was recovered by a crude cell lysis method using trypsin followed by boiling with pcr based identification as described in section 2 4 2 4 identification of species using pcr and dna sequencing detection of cryptosporidium species in the water sample used dna analysis following the method of xiao et al 2006 and was extracted using qiaamp dna mini extraction kits qiagen germany to summarise ims pellets were resuspended in 180 Î¼l of atl buffer freeze thawed five times using liquid nitrogen and a heating block warmed to 56 c following this 200 Î¼l of al buffer was added to each sample and incubated for 10 min at 70 c cell debris and ims beads were removed using maximum centrifugation and the concentrate processed using qiagen dneasy extraction kit following the manufacturer s instruction the pcr assays applied to the purified dna targeted the 18s rrna gene and 60 kda glycoprotein gene gp60 and assessed by dna melt curve analysis webber et al 2013 the gp60 pcr assay amplifies dna from a limited number of intestinal cryptosporidium species including c parvum c hominis and c cuniculus which present a human health concern alves et al 2003 while the 18s rrna gene is capable of amplifying dna from all cryptosporidium species including those not of human health concern xiao et al 1999 the amplicons were purified using qiagen pcr purification kits and submitted to the australian genome research facility for sanger sequencing using big dye terminator version 3 1 chemistry on either applied biosystems 3730 and 3730xl capillary sequencers sequences were then analysed using geneious version 6 biomatter ltd with raw sequences processed using de novo assembly the resulting sequences were individually identified by nucleotide blast search https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi using blast and default general parameters except that max target sequences was set to 500 the resulting blast output was then visualised using the distance tree of results with default settings fast minimum evolution 0 75 max seq difference sequence labels showing sequence title identification was made on the basis of close association with known species or genotypes of cryptosporidium ensuring that the reference sequence used as the basis of the identification was from a credible published source if a sequence could not be clearly assigned it was reported as cryptosporidium spp 2 5 statistical analyses and model development the relationships between landuse and stocking characteristics grazing commercial or grazing lifestyle and pathogen data were investigated using linear mixed effects models the data were prepared by removing outliers that resulted in discontinuous distributions and applying the yeo johnson transformation to improve normality and homoscedasticity yeo and johnson 2000 outlier removal resulted in the exclusion of 6 of 566 data and post hoc testing resulted in only minor changes to the effect estimates and no changes to the resulting model structure correlation and fixed effects error was nested by sub catchment within a catchment as appropriate the best of a range of temporal correlation structures auto regressive and continuous auto regressive was identified using analysis of variance comparisons between models with different auto regressive periods with the fixed effects set to the null model by this method an auto regressive model structure with period 7 was selected the most parsimonious fixed effects were determined using stepwise model selection stepaic mass package venables and ripley 2002 model coefficients were estimated using maximum likelihood to allow stepwise model comparisons by akaike s an information criterion aic and updated to residual maximum likelihood reml estimates following fixed effects model selection the scope of the model selection procedure included continuous factors of the areal flow mm the proportions of commercial and lifestyle grazing and boolean factors representing the dominance of commercial cattle stock properties 50 of the catchment and the dominance of breeding stock inclusive of cattle and sheep the model therefore explored the possibility of linear relationships between the transformed continuous variables or the simpler model that the characteristics of the catchments determine the relationship of the response oocysts with another environmental variable i e flow confidence intervals of the model predictions 95 were estimated using 1000 multivariate normal samples from the parameter and variance covariance matrix estimates 2 6 quantitative microbial risk assessment a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been developed by the australian water industry to characterise the level of source water impairment from pathogens and assist with demonstrating compliance with an anticipated microbial product water threshold of one micro daly disability adjusted life year per person per year wsaa 2015 based on the world health organisation s guidelines for drinking water quality who 2011 complying with the one micro daly threshold relies on the quantifying the source water challenge in log10 values lrv and is calculated using information about pathogen concentrations and infectivity rates with dose response models to estimate the probability of infection within a population exposed to the drinking water which can then be used to estimate disease burden to the community the calculations and input assumptions are presented in table 3 with further information available in chapter 7 of who 2011 appendix c the australian manual wsaa 2015 petterson et al 2015 and monis et al 2017 importantly we have used event runoff data only to estimate the average number of pathogens per litre of source water without routine or baseline inputs this results in the source water challenge estimating peak rather than annualised risk but is considered appropriate for this region as these systems are highly ephemeral with negligible baseflow almost all of the water entering these reservoirs are delivered during runoff events therefore the source water challenge estimates are more reflective of the volumetric delivery mechanism for these systems the qmra s presented here have applied default infectivity 30 and human pathogenicity 100 assumptions as scenario 1 and used measured infectivity and human pathogenicity prevalence as scenario 2 where no infectious oocysts were detected 1 was used as the infectivity assay provides a presumptive oocyst count only we estimated the concentrations of confirmed oocysts containing internal structures that confirm them to be cryptosporidium oocysts using a regression derived from independent water samples where both presumptive and confirmed oocyst data was available data not shown n 781 r 2 0 93 f x 0 644x input assumptions for each scenario are defined in table 3 3 results a total of 637 water samples were analysed for cryptosporidium count and infectivity rates and another 325 water samples for cryptosporidium species genotypes across 31 rainfall runoff events june 2013 until september 2016 from nine sampling locations table 4 using the infectivity assay sample recovery rates averaged 29 std dev 14 and any result where recovery was 10 was removed from further analysis n 59 plate wash controls averaged 88 std dev 10 oocyst infectivity controls averaged 41 std dev 19 3 1 presence of cryptosporidium during runoff events source water cryptosporidium concentrations varied markedly by event and location average confirmed concentrations for little para river was 43 per 10 l max 306 gould creek was 38 per 10 l max 54 kersbrook creek was 148 per 10 l max 825 sub catchment 2 was 181 per 10 l max 991 sub catchment 3 was 18 per 10 l max 135 sub catchment 4 was 130 per 10 l max 258 sub catchment 5 was 187 per 10 l max 2176 millbrook creek was 12 per 10 l max 108 and torrens river averaged 135 per 10 l max 801 3 2 cryptosporidium infectivity and identification of foci a total of 14 976 environmental oocysts were analysed by the cell culture infectivity assay for detection of infectious cryptosporidium table 4 from this 1162 foci were detected with the majority found in water samples collected from sub catchment 2 69 the torrens river 13 and kersbrook creek 11 for each of the nine locations average infectivity ranged from 0 in gould creek and millbrook creek no foci detected to 18 in sub catchment 2 maximum infectivity rates recorded during a single runoff event average of four samples varied from 0 millbrook creek to 65 4 sub catchment 2 other locations with high infectivity fractions in a single runoff event were torrens river 48 4 and kersbrook creek 20 7 the majority 84 of the foci were attributed to infectious c parvum with a further 13 of foci attributed to c cuniculus 1 1 to c tyzzeri 0 6 to c ubiquitum and 0 3 to c ryanae identification of species through pcr and dna sequencing failed on 13 foci and are presented as no result table 4 3 3 cryptosporidium species genotype prevalence a total of 22 species and genotypes were detected from 475 positive pcr results highlighting the diversity of cryptosporidium in the source water table 5 cryptosporidium parvum was the most commonly detected species n 107 followed by c ubiquitum n 65 c tyzzeri n 57 c muris n 55 and c bovis n 55 the ten most commonly detected species genotypes accounting for 90 of the detections 429 475 by year and location are shown in fig 3 cryptosporidium detected at little para river were dominated by species most likely derived from rodents in 2014 53 of detections which dropped to 23 of detections in 2016 with c ubiquitum now accounting for 31 of detections similarly a shift in cryptosporidium dominance was evident for sub catchment 2 in 2013 100 of the detections were positive for c ryanae or c bovis most likely originating from adult cattle however from 2014 c parvum dominance increased and comprised 74 of the detection in 2016 the majority of species detected in sub catchment 3 also appeared to be livestock derived however c bovis and c ryanae were detected more frequently than c parvum or c ubiquitum millbrook creek had relatively low rates of livestock derived species across the entire study period with 66 of detections attributed to rodent and wildlife derived cryptosporidium 3 4 linear mixed effects model the most parsimonious model identified by stepwise model selection 2 5 included the continuous factors flow and the boolean factor commercial stocking and their interaction table 6 the model can be interpreted as a linear regression between transformed variables where the slope of the relationship is the same within levels of commercial stocking while the intercepts vary between the different sub catchments the behaviour and overall fit of the model predicting oocyst concentration is illustrated by the agreement between the observed values and those predicted by the linear mixed effects model fig 4 the influence of the commercial grazing classification is demonstrated by the steeper slope of the regression with flow c f kersbrook creek and torrens river to little para river and millbrook creek catchments dominated by lifestyle properties i e less likely to have significant numbers of breeding livestock have lower peak oocyst density in the runoff water 3 5 quantitative microbial risk assessment the qmra highlights the spatial variability in cryptosporidium risk across catchments driven by the benefit of gathering human pathogenicity and oocyst infectivity data table 7 scenario 1 default assumptions estimated the level of treatment expressed as a log10 removal values or lrv during event conditions to range between 4 65 lrv mc and 5 85 lrv sc5 however scenario 2 measured c parvum c hominis prevalence and maximum infectivity measured during a single runoff event significantly lowered the treatment required for most of the sub catchments for millbrook creek the lrv required for source water treatment dropped from 4 65 scenario 1 to 1 97 scenario 2 equating to a gain of 2 67 lrv credits similarly sub catchment 3 and little para river lrv estimates also decreased markedly with the inclusion of more refined data with a gain of 1 87 and 1 62 lrv respectively however for sub catchment 2 and torrens river the measured maximum infectious fraction exceeded the default assumption of 30 which in the case of sub catchment 2 increased the treatment required for the source water quality by 0 26 lrv 5 84 6 10 lrv table 7 4 discussion quantifying oocyst infectivity and the proportion of human pathogenic species present provides a major opportunity to improve estimates of human health risk from cryptosporidium in surface water sources we used 578 water samples to measure the infectious fraction of 14 796 oocysts resulting in 1162 cell culture foci as far as we are aware this is the most comprehensive assessment of oocyst infectivity in raw water samples using cell culture and has demonstrated the spatial and temporal variability of infectious oocysts in the catchment during the study period overall infectivity rates varied markedly 3 for little para river gould creek millbrook creek and sub catchment 3 4 and 5 which was similar to the 3 1 reported by swaffer et al 2014 higher infectivity rates were recorded for kersbrook creek sub catchment 2 and the torrens river 4 3 18 0 and 9 6 respectively for individual runoff events however infectivity fractions greatly increased in some locations and reached 20 7 in kersbrook creek 65 4 in sub catchment 2 and 48 4 in the torrens river these infections occurred in may and june and were dominated by the presence c parvum which coincided with the presence of newborn livestock in the catchment sub catchment 2 provided the greatest opportunity to track the host of the infectious c parvum due to its small catchment size and limited number of properties a landholder survey undertaken for sub catchment 2 3 and 5 data not shown confirmed that the infectious c parvum in sub catchment 2 most likely originated from juvenile cattle within the catchment interestingly sub catchment 5 was dominated by breeding sheep and infectious c parvum was not detected from this catchment at any stage sub catchment 3 was stocked with non breeding cattle and again infectious c parvum was not detected in any water sample but c bovis and c ryanae were commonly detected using genotyping methods similar to coklin et al 2007 rieux et al 2014 and santÃ¬n et al 2004 2008 these data supports the age related distribution of infectious c parvum with very young livestock and in this case was associated with properties with breeding cattle but not associated with properties with breeding sheep therefore the data here suggest that the highest rates of infectious c parvum may be more likely to originate from properties with cattle breeding programs rather than sheep properties or those lacking breeding stock while sheep appeared to present a lower risk in terms of c parvum prevalence we caution against underestimating the potential of sheep hosting human pathogenic cryptosporidium due to recent suggestions that c ubiquitum may present a higher human health risk than previously assumed li et al 2014 furthermore it is important to recognise that the cell culture infectivity assay was optimised and validated for c parvum and c hominis and while some foci were attributed to other species the method was not validated for the detection of infectious oocysts from other species of cryptosporidium it is possible that higher numbers of infectious c ubiquitum were being exported out of sub catchment 5 but the cell culture assay failed to support the development of these foci of the 22 species detected using molecular approaches 13 have been detected in humans either commonly i e c parvum sporadically i e c cuniculus c ubiquitum c meleagridis c canis or in isolated instances i e c tyzzeri c muris c bovis c fayeri c andersoni c viatorum c suis c baileyi furthermore the dominant species associated with a particular location varied throughout the study period cryptosporidium ubiquitum increased in its rate of detection notably associated with sub catchment 5 this species has emerged as having the greatest number of known host species including humans is most often detected in industrialised nations and covers the broadest geographical area of any cryptosporidium species fayer et al 2010b xiao et al 2014 sub catchment 2 also demonstrated a marked change c bovis and c ryanae became less common and c parvum increased in its rate of detection a similar change was also reported by rieux et al 2014 who studied successive cohorts of calves 3 days 1 month across three years in a single beef cattle herd and reported a dominance of c bovis in the first year which changed to c parvum dominance in the third year as demonstrated by the model the highest concentrations of oocysts were linked to catchments which contained a greater proportion of commercial orientated grazing properties as opposed to lifestyle properties this finding is a significant advance on the previous public health risk assumption that the rate of cryptosporidium export was likely to be consistent across any land parcel associated with agricultural grazing notwithstanding the possibility that poorly managed livestock on lifestyle properties could still contribute cryptosporidium into streams the strong linkage between commercial properties and cryptosporidium occurrence identified through this study now provides a new mechanism to begin to target areas within broad acre grazing zones for mitigation measures which are likely to be contributing runoff with a higher pathogen risk profile recognising landuse traits which generate high numbers of human infectious species can direct the efficient use of resources should water utilities seek to refine estimates of human health risk beyond default assumptions the inclusion of infectivity and genotyping information into the qmra in all but one of the study catchments decreased the treatment required to comply with a product water target of 1 microdaly per person per year the greatest reductions were located where the infectious fraction was low and molecular techniques did not identify c parvum frequently four of the seven catchments where the qmra was applied decreased their treatment requirement by more than 1 lrv 2 67 1 87 1 62 1 11 which can represent significant treatment savings for water utilities conversely where infectivity rates were high and genotyping methods commonly detected c parvum as was the case for sub catchment 2 the qmra suggested the default assumptions would have resulted in a treatment shortfall it is important to recognise that sub catchment 2 occurred upstream of the kersbrook creek station and that both sub catchment 3 and 5 would have contributed to diluting the microbial contamination emanating from sub catchment 2 prior to millbrook reservoir regardless the example demonstrates that the inclusion of infectivity and genotyping data does not guarantee a reduction in the source water challenge estimate and that vigilance in monitoring risk within catchments remains a necessary practice on a regular basis to ensure that water quality concerns are identified importantly the seasonality of cryptosporidium in the catchment autumn winter prevalence dominated by c parvum does not appear to match the seasonality of reportable infections in the region summer prevalence dominated by c hominis king et al 2017 suggesting that water treatment plants are effective in preventing infection from catchment derived pathogens and that the majority of human infections are more likely caused through alternative transmission pathways i e person to person and swimming pools 5 conclusion this research has provided a thorough assessment of the elevated source water challenge present during rainfall runoff conditions which has demonstrated the maximum risk to human health appears to be linked to catchment runoff coinciding with host breeding cycles particularly cattle contributing to the temporal and spatial diversity exhibited in source water oocyst concentrations and infectivity rates many catchments contain nil to low levels of infectious c parvum depending on the nature of the landholdings present which highlights the need for water utilities to remain vigilant in understanding their source water environment the benefit of refining default infectivity assumptions in assessments of annualised risk is clearly shown using the qmra where the data suggest that adoption of the default 30 infectivity assumption is a conservative estimate at the annualised timescale acknowledgements this study was funded by the south australian water corporation the authors gratefully acknowledge the

electron densities calculations the structure of cp was optimized at the b3lyp 6 311g level to calculate the frontier electron densities feds using gaussian 09 program frisch et al 2009 the bulk solvent effect of water was considered using the integral equation formalism polarized continuum model iefpcm within the self consistent reaction field scrf theory tomasi et al 2005 the feds of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo were obtained from gaussian output files the values of 2fed2 homo were calculated to predict the possible reaction sites of cp and its ops for electron extraction fukui et al 1952 1954 wiberg bond order was also obtained from gaussian output files to compare the strength of each bond in the primary product of cp 2 7 toxicity tests the bio toxicity of the reaction solutions were assessed using the luminescent bacteria p phosphoreum as the test organism the lyophilized powder of p phosphoreum was provided by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china the acute toxicity test was performed according to the national standard water quality determination of the acute toxicity luminescent bacteria test gb t 15441 1995 specific experimental steps were described in our previous studies liu et al 2015 shi et al 2012 after activation and incubation the bacteria were exposed to the reaction solutions for 15 min at 25 c and the bioluminescence was measured on a tecan infinite 200 pro multimode microplate reader tecan switzerland the toxicity data were recorded as the inhibition percentage versus the control preliminary experimental results show that the toxicity of mn vii and na2s2o3 to p phosphoreum was negligible data not shown seven replicates were set for the toxicity tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics study at different ph initially the kinetics of cp oxidation by mn vii was determined at ph 7 0 the concentrations of cp and mn vii were monitored as a function of reaction time and results were shown in fig sm 2 the data were analyzed using a second order kinetics model eq 2 and the second order rate constants k m 1 s 1 were then calculated by using eq 3 2 d c p d t k m n v i i c p 3 l n c p t c p 0 m n v i i t m n v i i 0 k c p 0 m n v i i 0 t y where mn vii 0 and cp 0 are the initial concentrations of mn vii and cp respectively mn vii t and cp t are the concentrations of mn vii and cp at time t a plot to evaluate the value of k is shown in the inset of fig 1 and the k is estimated from the slope as 2 05 0 05 101 m 1 s 1 next the kinetics of the reaction between mn vii and cp were investigated at other ph values concentration changes of mn vii and cp with respect to time are given in fig sm 2 plots similar to the inset of fig 1 were constructed to obtain the values of k table sm 2 fig 1 depicts the change of k with the solution ph the decreased k values with an increase in solution ph were observed in the ph range of 5 0 7 0 at higher ph the values of k increased with increasing ph the k value reached up to 1 95 0 37 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 10 0 fig 1 the redox potential of mn vii decreased with the increasing ph from 1 7 v versus nhe in acidic condition to 0 59 v versus nhe under neutral ph eq 4 and 5 yan and schwartz 1999 4 mno4 3e 4h mno2 2h2o e 0 1 7 v 5 mno4 3e 2h2o mno2 4oh e 0 0 59 v due to the high redox potential mn vii has higher oxidation ability at ph 5 0 than at ph 7 0 another factor that may contribute to the observed trend of k with ph was the generation of in situ mno2 which could accelerate the oxidation of cp in the range of 300 700 nm where cp has no absorption fig sm 3 we recorded the uv vis spectra of the reaction solutions fig sm 4 the nonspecific absorbance at 500 nm and the linear correlation between the absorbance at 418 and 526 nm r 2 0 9 fig sm 5 indicated the formation of colloidal mno2 during the process freeman and kappos 1985 jiang et al 2010 according to the absorbance at 300 400 nm the reaction produced more in situ mno2 at ph 5 0 than at ph 7 0 fig sm 4a c sun et al 2013 revealed that the in situ formed mno2 during mn vii oxidation process was more reactive under acidic conditions resulting in a larger k value at ph 5 0 the increase in k at ph 7 0 may be explained by considering acid base equilibrium of cp pk a 9 81 benitez et al 2013a the basic form of cp i e phenolate species would react faster than the acidic form i e phenol species the proportion of phenolate species would increase with an increase in ph du et al 2012 thus accelerating the oxidation of cp by mn vii see fig 1 3 2 effect of coexisting constituents the effect of colloidal mno2 60 0 Î¼m fe3 60 0 Î¼m and ha 1 mg l 1 as doc on the oxidation of cp by mn vii was investigated at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 degradation of cp with time under different conditions is shown in fig 2 values of k were evaluated from the plots in fig sm 6 table 1 gives the values of k in the presence of mno2 fe3 and ha at three ph the addition of colloidal mno2 to the reaction solution enhanced the degradation of cp by mn vii fig 2a c we note that the colloidal mno2 alone could also lead to the removal of cp and this effect became weaker with ph increasing from 5 0 to 9 0 also the reaction between mn vii and cp resulted in the formation of in situ mno2 see fig sm 4d f colloidal mno2 increased the values of k to 2 3 times that in the mixed solution of mn vii and cp table 1 however the removal of cp by mn vii in the presence of colloidal mno2 was similar to or slightly slower than the sum of cp removal by individual mn vii and mno2 fig sm 7 thus colloidal mno2 mainly worked as an oxidant during the reaction process jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2013 effect of fe3 ions on the oxidation of cp by mn vii is related to solution ph fig 2d f when only fe3 was added into cp solution no decrease in cp concentration was observed fe3 enhanced the degradation of cp by mn vii at ph 7 0 and 9 0 while no obvious effect was observed at ph 5 0 increase in k values at ph 7 0 and 9 0 corresponded to 3 4 and 9 7 folds respectively as compared to no addition of fe3 table 1 due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyl moiety phenolic compounds have a strong tendency to complex with metal ions soloway and wilen 1952 wang et al 2015 in aqueous medium fe3 mainly exists in the form of fe h2o 6 3 according to eq 6 or 7 dissolved fe3 can complex with phenols roh to form the fe or 6 3 soloway and wilen 1952 moreover the generation of fe or 6 3 complex become easier with the increase of ph in this work the target compound cp that contains a hydroxyl group would complex with fe3 to form the fe cp complex previous studies have revealed that ru3 could catalyze the oxidation of organic compounds by mn vii which was attributed to the formation of metal organic complex and its subsequent reaction with mn vii kini et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 based on the similar electronic structures of fe3 and ru3 it is concluded that the generation of fe cp complex contributed mainly to the catalytic effect of fe3 on cp removal by mn vii luo et al 2006 6 fe3 6 ho r fe o r 6 3 6 h 7 fe h2o 6 3 6 ho r fe o r 6 3 6 h3o ha has a mild effect in promoting oxidation of cp by mn vii fig 2g i the calculated values of k in presence of ha at different ph values are given in table 1 the formation of Ï Ï interactions between the monoaromatic ring of substrates and aromatic components of ha may increase the electron density of cp he et al 2009 nanny and maza 2001 Å¡mejkalovÃ¡ et al 2009 which was favorable to the oxidation reaction however ha can also compete with target compound for permanganate sun et al 2013 and the consumption of oxidants by ha would inhibit the degradation of cp moreover ha has a low ability to induce the in situ formation of mno2 fig sm 4j l which may also contribute to the slight effect of ha on cp oxidation 3 3 oxidation products and reaction pathways a total of fourteen ops p1 p14 were identified by lc q tof ms structural identification was based mainly on the extracted ion chromatograms xic chromatographic retention time and ms ms spectra proposed structures and fragmentation pathways of these products were shown in fig sm 8 the detailed ms information is listed in table sm 3 and the accurate mass measurements 3 ppm error provide a high reliability in structural assignments representatively as an intermediate product of high ms intensity p3 was selected for detailed analysis fig sm 8d p3 was eluted at 17 2 min in the lc ms chromatogram and it has a molecular mass of 229 0501 the fragment ion peaks at m z 201 0562 145 0662 and 117 0726 correspond to sequential losses of co 28 da from the precursor ion m z 229 0501 demonstrating the inclusion of four carbonyl groups in p3 thus p3 was assumed to have the structure shown in fig sm 8d similarly the individual structure of other reaction products was identified according to the ms ms fragments in fig sm 8 based on the identified ops the reaction pathways of cp by mn vii were proposed in fig 3 the first step of cp degradation was the oxidative attack by mno4 on the c cl bond which resulted in the formation of the hydroxyl substitution product 2 benzyl hydroquinone p1 as shown in fig 4 the homo is located in the substituted aromatic ring of cp due to the high values of 2fed2 homo the position of c10 and cl15 is electron rich thus the c cl bond is most likely to be attacked by the oxidant to give the corresponding product p1 the largest 2fed2 homo values in p1 was distributed at o15 0 203 o14 0 194 c13 0 182 c10 0 163 c11 0 111 and c12 0 085 fig 4 suggesting these locations are electron rich and thus are easily attacked by oxidants this was confirmed by the subsequent transformation of p1 first the oxidative attack on the c11 c12 aromatic bond hu et al 2011 of the p hydroquinone ring in p1 leads to the ring opening product p5 which was further oxidized into p6 and then p7 p1 p5 p6 p7 another main reaction for p1 involves direct oxidation of the p hydroquinone moiety c13 o14 and c10 o15 via two electron transfer to form 2 benzyl p benzoquinone p2 it is worth noting that p1 and p2 were also reported as the initially formed ops of cp during other oxidation processes such as manganese oxides zhang and huang 2003 ozonation benitez et al 2013a and laccase catalyzed reaction shi et al 2016 then a 3 2 addition occurred at the c11 c12 double bond of the p benzoquinone ring in p2 yielding the corresponding ring opening product p3 which was subsequently oxidized into p4 and p7 similar reactions were also observed in the permanganate oxidation of drugs rodrÃ­guez Ã¡lvarez et al 2013 2015 p7 could undergo sequential decarboxylation and oxdiation resulting in the formation of p8 and p9 p2 p3 p4 p7 p8 p9 the p1 can also directly generate the ring opening product p9 via the oxidative attack on the c10 and c13 site of the p hydroquinone ring chen et al 2016 similar ring opening reaction could occur on p2 leading to the formation of p9 then the phenyl ring of p9 opened to yield the corresponding product p10 p1 p2 p9 p10 in addition mno4 could attack the c5 c7 bond and c7 c8 bond of p1 molecule with the formation of bond cleavage products according to mayer 2006 wiberg bond order is a key indicator of bond strength and bond cleavage for chemical bonds of the same type a small bond order always implies a low bond energy and favorable cleavage as shown in table sm 4 the c5 c7 bond and c7 c8 bond has the smallest bond order 1 0120 and 1 0066 respectively demonstrating that the two bonds are easily broken thus benzoic acid p11 and 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid p12 were observed as reaction products similarly the c c bond cleavage in p2 yielded p13 which were subsequently oxidized into maleic acid p14 further oxidation of p12 could also lead to the formation of p13 finally the intermediates p10 and p14 were transformed into formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid fig sm 9 which were completely mineralized into co2 and h2o in short the degradation of cp by mn vii mainly include direct oxidation ring opening and decarboxylation 3 4 acute toxicity to p phosphoreum in order to evaluate the potential ecological risk of cp and its products the toxicity changes of reaction solutions were assessed using p phosphoreum as shown in fig 5 the relative toxicity was sharply decreased at the initial reaction stage followed by a slight change to be specific the inhibition rate decreased from 31 4 at 0 min to 6 8 at 10 min as the reaction time extended to 60 min the bioluminescence was determined as 6 4 suggesting that the intermediate products did have some toxicity overall the degradation of cp can reduce the potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms therefore mn vii can be used as an environmental friendly oxidant in water and wastewater treatment 3 5 removal of cp in real waters the effectiveness of this mn vii oxidative technique for cp removal in real waters was investigated at ph 7 0 complete removal of cp from sce and rw were observed in 10 min and 30 min respectively fig 6 a in the sww the degradation of cp occurred primarily in the first 5 min and extending the reaction time did not improve the removal significantly the removal efficiency was 74 2 after 60 min of reaction fig 6a the reason may be that sww contains a high amount of organic matter and salts see table sm 1 which would compete with cp to consume mn vii largely fig 6b levels of toc during mn vii oxidation were shown in fig 6c and the toc removal followed the order of sww 15 2 sce 23 8 rw 34 9 thus a much higher oxidant dosage of mn vii is needed for complete mineralization of cp in water treatment 4 conclusions the reaction between mn vii and cp was successfully determined by the second order kinetics model the ph dependence of the second order rate constants k could be described by considering the ph related oxidation power of mn vii the oxidative effect of generated in situ mno2 and the acid base equilibrium of cp i e phenol versus phenolate the addition of colloidal mno2 promoted the degradation of cp by mn vii while ha has little influence on the reaction effect of fe3 ions on the cp removal is related to solution ph significant promotion was observed at ph 7 0 and 9 0 but no effect was found at ph 5 0 the reaction pathways of cp mainly involve direct oxidation ring opening and decarboxylation which were supported by the identified ops and dft calculations toxicity tests by p phosphoreum revealed that mn vii oxidation could reduce the toxicity of cp leading to relatively low ecological risk effectiveness of this mn vii oxidation method was demonstrated by degrading cp in wastewater effluent and river water acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 21577063 21607073

19609,this paper evaluates the oxidation of an antibacterial agent chlorophene 4 chloro 2 phenylmethyl phenol cp by permanganate mn vii in water second order rate constant k for the reaction between

toxicity luminescent bacteria test gb t 15441 1995 specific experimental steps were described in our previous studies liu et al 2015 shi et al 2012 after activation and incubation the bacteria were exposed to the reaction solutions for 15 min at 25 c and the bioluminescence was measured on a tecan infinite 200 pro multimode microplate reader tecan switzerland the toxicity data were recorded as the inhibition percentage versus the control preliminary experimental results show that the toxicity of mn vii and na2s2o3 to p phosphoreum was negligible data not shown seven replicates were set for the toxicity tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics study at different ph initially the kinetics of cp oxidation by mn vii was determined at ph 7 0 the concentrations of cp and mn vii were monitored as a function of reaction time and results were shown in fig sm 2 the data were analyzed using a second order kinetics model eq 2 and the second order rate constants k m 1 s 1 were then calculated by using eq 3 2 d c p d t k m n v i i c p 3 l n c p t c p 0 m n v i i t m n v i i 0 k c p 0 m n v i i 0 t y where mn vii 0 and cp 0 are the initial concentrations of mn vii and cp respectively mn vii t and cp t are the concentrations of mn vii and cp at time t a plot to evaluate the value of k is shown in the inset of fig 1 and the k is estimated from the slope as 2 05 0 05 101 m 1 s 1 next the kinetics of the reaction between mn vii and cp were investigated at other ph values concentration changes of mn vii and cp with respect to time are given in fig sm 2 plots similar to the inset of fig 1 were constructed to obtain the values of k table sm 2 fig 1 depicts the change of k with the solution ph the decreased k values with an increase in solution ph were observed in the ph range of 5 0 7 0 at higher ph the values of k increased with increasing ph the k value reached up to 1 95 0 37 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 10 0 fig 1 the redox potential of mn vii decreased with the increasing ph from 1 7 v versus nhe in acidic condition to 0 59 v versus nhe under neutral ph eq 4 and 5 yan and schwartz 1999 4 mno4 3e 4h mno2 2h2o e 0 1 7 v 5 mno4 3e 2h2o mno2 4oh e 0 0 59 v due to the high redox potential mn vii has higher oxidation ability at ph 5 0 than at ph 7 0 another factor that may contribute to the observed trend of k with ph was the generation of in situ mno2 which could accelerate the oxidation of cp in the range of 300 700 nm where cp has no absorption fig sm 3 we recorded the uv vis spectra of the reaction solutions fig sm 4 the nonspecific absorbance at 500 nm and the linear correlation between the absorbance at 418 and 526 nm r 2 0 9 fig sm 5 indicated the formation of colloidal mno2 during the process freeman and kappos 1985 jiang et al 2010 according to the absorbance at 300 400 nm the reaction produced more in situ mno2 at ph 5 0 than at ph 7 0 fig sm 4a c sun et al 2013 revealed that the in situ formed mno2 during mn vii oxidation process was more reactive under acidic conditions resulting in a larger k value at ph 5 0 the increase in k at ph 7 0 may be explained by considering acid base equilibrium of cp pk a 9 81 benitez et al 2013a the basic form of cp i e phenolate species would react faster than the acidic form i e phenol species the proportion of phenolate species would increase with an increase in ph du et al 2012 thus accelerating the oxidation of cp by mn vii see fig 1 3 2 effect of coexisting constituents the effect of colloidal mno2 60 0 Î¼m fe3 60 0 Î¼m and ha 1 mg l 1 as doc on the oxidation of cp by mn vii was investigated at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 degradation of cp with time under different conditions is shown in fig 2 values of k were evaluated from the plots in fig sm 6 table 1 gives the values of k in the presence of mno2 fe3 and ha at three ph the addition of colloidal mno2 to the reaction solution enhanced the degradation of cp by mn vii fig 2a c we note that the colloidal mno2 alone could also lead to the removal of cp and this effect became weaker with ph increasing from 5 0 to 9 0 also the reaction between mn vii and cp resulted in the formation of in situ mno2 see fig sm 4d f colloidal mno2 increased the values of k to 2 3 times that in the mixed solution of mn vii and cp table 1 however the removal of cp by mn vii in the presence of colloidal mno2 was similar to or slightly slower than the sum of cp removal by individual mn vii and mno2 fig sm 7 thus colloidal mno2 mainly worked as an oxidant during the reaction process jiang et al 2015 sun et al 2013 effect of fe3 ions on the oxidation of cp by mn vii is related to solution ph fig 2d f when only fe3 was added into cp solution no decrease in cp concentration was observed fe3 enhanced the degradation of cp by mn vii at ph 7 0 and 9 0 while no obvious effect was observed at ph 5 0 increase in k values at ph 7 0 and 9 0 corresponded to 3 4 and 9 7 folds respectively as compared to no addition of fe3 table 1 due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyl moiety phenolic compounds have a strong tendency to complex with metal ions soloway and wilen 1952 wang et al 2015 in aqueous medium fe3 mainly exists in the form of fe h2o 6 3 according to eq 6 or 7 dissolved fe3 can complex with phenols roh to form the fe or 6 3 soloway and wilen 1952 moreover the generation of fe or 6 3 complex become easier with the increase of ph in this work the target compound cp that contains a hydroxyl group would complex with fe3 to form the fe cp complex previous studies have revealed that ru3 could catalyze the oxidation of organic compounds by mn vii which was attributed to the formation of metal organic complex and its subsequent reaction with mn vii kini et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 based on the similar electronic structures of fe3 and ru3 it is concluded that the generation of fe cp complex contributed mainly to the catalytic effect of fe3 on cp removal by mn vii luo et al 2006 6 fe3 6 ho r fe o r 6 3 6 h 7 fe h2o 6 3 6 ho r fe o r 6 3 6 h3o ha has a mild effect in promoting oxidation of cp by mn vii fig 2g i the calculated values of k in presence of ha at different ph values are given in table 1 the formation of Ï Ï interactions between the monoaromatic ring of substrates and aromatic components of ha may increase the electron density of cp he et al 2009 nanny and maza 2001 Å¡mejkalovÃ¡ et al 2009 which was favorable to the oxidation reaction however ha can also compete with target compound for permanganate sun et al 2013 and the consumption of oxidants by ha would inhibit the degradation of cp moreover ha has a low ability to induce the in situ formation of mno2 fig sm 4j l which may also contribute to the slight effect of ha on cp oxidation 3 3 oxidation products and reaction pathways a total of fourteen ops p1 p14 were identified by lc q tof ms structural identification was based mainly on the extracted ion chromatograms xic chromatographic retention time and ms ms spectra proposed structures and fragmentation pathways of these products were shown in fig sm 8 the detailed ms information is listed in table sm 3 and the accurate mass measurements 3 ppm error provide a high reliability in structural assignments representatively as an intermediate product of high ms intensity p3 was selected for detailed analysis fig sm 8d p3 was eluted at 17 2 min in the lc ms chromatogram and it has a molecular mass of 229 0501 the fragment ion peaks at m z 201 0562 145 0662 and 117 0726 correspond to sequential losses of co 28 da from the precursor ion m z 229 0501 demonstrating the inclusion of four carbonyl groups in p3 thus p3 was assumed to have the structure shown in fig sm 8d similarly the individual structure of other reaction products was identified according to the ms ms fragments in fig sm 8 based on the identified ops the reaction pathways of cp by mn vii were proposed in fig 3 the first step of cp degradation was the oxidative attack by mno4 on the c cl bond which resulted in the formation of the hydroxyl substitution product 2 benzyl hydroquinone p1 as shown in fig 4 the homo is located in the substituted aromatic ring of cp due to the high values of 2fed2 homo the position of c10 and cl15 is electron rich thus the c cl bond is most likely to be attacked by the oxidant to give the corresponding product p1 the largest 2fed2 homo values in p1 was distributed at o15 0 203 o14 0 194 c13 0 182 c10 0 163 c11 0 111 and c12 0 085 fig 4 suggesting these locations are electron rich and thus are easily attacked by oxidants this was confirmed by the subsequent transformation of p1 first the oxidative attack on the c11 c12 aromatic bond hu et al 2011 of the p hydroquinone ring in p1 leads to the ring opening product p5 which was further oxidized into p6 and then p7 p1 p5 p6 p7 another main reaction for p1 involves direct oxidation of the p hydroquinone moiety c13 o14 and c10 o15 via two electron transfer to form 2 benzyl p benzoquinone p2 it is worth noting that p1 and p2 were also reported as the initially formed ops of cp during other oxidation processes such as manganese oxides zhang and huang 2003 ozonation benitez et al 2013a and laccase catalyzed reaction shi et al 2016 then a 3 2 addition occurred at the c11 c12 double bond of the p benzoquinone ring in p2 yielding the corresponding ring opening product p3 which was subsequently oxidized into p4 and p7 similar reactions were also observed in the permanganate oxidation of drugs rodrÃ­guez Ã¡lvarez et al 2013 2015 p7 could undergo sequential decarboxylation and oxdiation resulting in the formation of p8 and p9 p2 p3 p4 p7 p8 p9 the p1 can also directly generate the ring opening product p9 via the oxidative attack on the c10 and c13 site of the p hydroquinone ring chen et al 2016 similar ring opening reaction could occur on p2 leading to the formation of p9 then the phenyl ring of p9 opened to yield the corresponding product p10 p1 p2 p9 p10 in addition mno4 could attack the c5 c7 bond and c7 c8 bond of p1 molecule with the formation of bond cleavage products according to mayer 2006 wiberg bond order is a key indicator of bond strength and bond cleavage for chemical bonds of the same type a small bond order always implies a low bond energy and favorable cleavage as shown in table sm 4 the c5 c7 bond and c7 c8 bond has the smallest bond order 1 0120 and 1 0066 respectively demonstrating that the two bonds are easily broken thus benzoic acid p11 and 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid p12 were observed as reaction products similarly the c c bond cleavage in p2 yielded p13 which were subsequently oxidized into maleic acid p14 further oxidation of p12 could also lead to the formation of p13 finally the intermediates p10 and p14 were transformed into formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid fig sm 9 which were completely mineralized into co2 and h2o in short the degradation of cp by mn vii mainly include direct oxidation ring opening and decarboxylation 3 4 acute toxicity to p phosphoreum in order to evaluate the potential ecological risk of cp and its products the toxicity changes of reaction solutions were assessed using p phosphoreum as shown in fig 5 the relative toxicity was sharply decreased at the initial reaction stage followed by a slight change to be specific the inhibition rate decreased from 31 4 at 0 min to 6 8 at 10 min as the reaction time extended to 60 min the bioluminescence was determined as 6 4 suggesting that the intermediate products did have some toxicity overall the degradation of cp can reduce the potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms therefore mn vii can be used as an environmental friendly oxidant in water and wastewater treatment 3 5 removal of cp in real waters the effectiveness of this mn vii oxidative technique for cp removal in real waters was investigated at ph 7 0 complete removal of cp from sce and rw were observed in 10 min and 30 min respectively fig 6 a in the sww the degradation of cp occurred primarily in the first 5 min and extending the reaction time did not improve the removal significantly the removal efficiency was 74 2 after 60 min of reaction fig 6a the reason may be that sww contains a high amount of organic matter and salts see table sm 1 which would compete with cp to consume mn vii largely fig 6b levels of toc during mn vii oxidation were shown in fig 6c and the toc removal followed the order of sww 15 2 sce 23 8 rw 34 9 thus a much higher oxidant dosage of mn vii is needed for complete mineralization of cp in water treatment 4 conclusions the reaction between mn vii and cp was successfully determined by the second order kinetics model the ph dependence of the second order rate constants k could be described by considering the ph related oxidation power of mn vii the oxidative effect of generated in situ mno2 and the acid base equilibrium of cp i e phenol versus phenolate the addition of colloidal mno2 promoted the degradation of cp by mn vii while ha has little influence on the reaction effect of fe3 ions on the cp removal is related to solution ph significant promotion was observed at ph 7 0 and 9 0 but no effect was found at ph 5 0 the reaction pathways of cp mainly involve direct oxidation ring opening and decarboxylation which were supported by the identified ops and dft calculations toxicity tests by p phosphoreum revealed that mn vii oxidation could reduce the toxicity of cp leading to relatively low ecological risk effectiveness of this mn vii oxidation method was demonstrated by degrading cp in wastewater effluent and river water acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 21577063 21607073
