18550,recent investigations verified that calcium peroxide cao2 could be used to pretreat waste activated sludge to promote methane yield from anaerobic digestion however the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment promotes methane production is unclear this work therefore aims to provide insights into such systems experimental results showed that with an increase of cao2 dosage from 0 to 0 14 g g vss volatile suspended solids the methane yield increased linearly from 146 3 to 215 9 ml g vss further increases of cao2 resulted in decreases in methane yield cao2 pretreatment promoted the disintegration of sludge and the degradation of sludge recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose thereby providing more substrates for subsequent methane production ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy indicated that cao2 enhanced the cleavage of unsaturated conjugated bonds and reduced the aromaticity of humus and lignocellulose fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that cao2 changed the structures and functional groups of humus and lignocellulose making them transform to be biodegradable gc ms analyses exhibited that the degradation products of humus and lignocellulose included several types of small molecular organics such as ester like acid like and alcohol like substances further investigation demonstrated that substantial methane could be produced from these degradation products it was also found that the presence of recalcitrant organics was detrimental to anaerobes relevant to anaerobic digestion and the degradation of such recalcitrant organics mitigated their inhibitions to the anaerobes model based analysis suggested that cao2 pretreatment increased the maximum methane yield and methane production rate which were consistent with the analysis above graphical abstract image 1 keywords calcium peroxide waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion humus lignocellulose 1 introduction waste activated sludge was which is an extremely complex byproduct in wastewater treatment plants wwtps contains heterogeneous substances such as bacteria pathogens inorganic particles colloids heavy metals and persistent organic substances without being effectively treated it is easy to cause secondary pollution to natural waterbodies groundwater and soil thereby threatening environmental safety and public health since was contains a large number of organics such as proteins and carbohydrates it is also considered a renewable bioenergy resource li et al 2018 xu et al 2018b as an effective technology for pollution control and energy recovery anaerobic digestion of was attracts much attention by which biodegradable organics are degraded was is stabilized and reduced pathogens are killed and biogas methane is also produced li et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 in general there are two major factors that restrict methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was one is disintegration degrees of sludge flocs limited by protection of extracellular polymeric substances and cell wall and or membrane the other is the substantial recalcitrant organics such as humus lignocellulose triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and loxosone present in was li et al 2019b wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 it was reported that humus accounted for 15 28 of the total organics in was while the amount of lignocellulose reached 14 44 of the total was organic matters li et al 2014 hu et al 2016 these recalcitrant organics are usually not used to produce methane in ordinary anaerobic digestion process moreover some of them e g humic acid triclocarban and roxarsone are demonstrated to inhibit the activities of microbes relevant to anaerobic digestion which thereby decrease methane yield bartoszek et al 2008 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 for example jiang et al 2017 pointed out that 5 μg l diclofenac damaged the microbial cell walls using acetate as the model substrate zhang et al 2014 found that the specific methanogenic activity was only 74 2 of blank in the presence of 20 mg l roxarsone to date however most efforts to increase methane production have focused on the former for instance with 24 h pretreatment of thickened was at an free nitrous acid concentration of 6 1 mg n l the hydraulic retention time hrt of the experimental anaerobic digester decreased from 15 0 to 7 5 days and the methane production rate increased by 165 compared to the control zhang et al 2019 kuglarz et al 2013 indicated that the sludge pretreated at 60 70 c by microwaves of 900 w gave 35 more methane which was more energetically sustainable compared to untreated sludge apart from acceleration of was disintegration enhancing the degradation of recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose in was may be an alternative method for promotion of methane production however little attention has been paid to this point so far cao2 a white or light yellow crystalline peroxide is considered a solid form of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 cassidy and irvine 1999 in hydrous media cao2 is decomposed slowly to form h2o2 o2 and ca oh 2 at a controlled rate due to this property cao2 is widely used as a bactericide preservative antacid oil bleach or oxidant in agriculture aquiculture medicine manufacturing and environmental protection cassidy and irvine 1999 kaewdee et al 2016 qian et al 2016 apart from these applications wang and li 2016 recently attempted another new direction being an additive for was pretreatment to enhance methane production it was found that when 0 1 g g vss cao2 was used to aid microwave irradiation 480 w 2 min to pretreat was the cumulative production of methane from anaerobic digestion increased by 80 2 as compared with the control this finding expands the application field of cao2 and provides an efficient strategy for the improvement of methane production compared with other pretreatment techniques such as thermal and free nitrous acid cao2 pretreatment required extra addition of chemical which increased the input due to its strong oxidbillity and alkalinity however cao2 pretreatment can promote the disintegration of sludge flocs and facilitate the degradation of refractory organic or toxic pollutants in sludge farno et al 2015 wang et al 2019b li et al 2015 considering the massive quantities of was daily digested this cao2 based method should have substantial benefits for was anaerobic digestion despite these valuable findings the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment improves methane production from anaerobic digestion especially from the aspect of humus and lignocellulose degradations remains largely unknown as a strong oxidant although cao2 was demonstrated to have abilities to oxidize several pollutants such as estrone 17β estradiol 17α ethinyl estradiol estriol bisphenol a 4 nonyl phenol and 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene zhai and jiang 2014 arienzo 2000 it is unknown whether cao2 based pretreatment enhances the degradations of humus lignocellulose and other typical recalcitrant organics in was such as triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and roxarsone if it does what are the major degradation intermediates or products are these intermediates or products utilized by anaerobes to produce methane do the degradations of these recalcitrant organics bring other impacts to anaerobic digestion to date however all these questions have not been addressed which make such cao2 based was anaerobic digestion a black box with poor understanding through addressing these questions above the purpose of this work is to elucidate the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment enhances methane production from anaerobic digestion of was to obtain comprehensive information the effect of cao2 pretreatment at different dosages 0 0 26 g g vss on methane production was first studied then the details of how cao2 pretreatment improves methane production were explored the findings obtained not only provide insights into cao2 based was anaerobic digestion but also may guide engineers to develop strategies for the enhancements of both recalcitrant organic degradations and energy recovery in was treatment in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sources and characteristics of was and inocula the was used in the following tests was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the raw was filtrated by a sifter 2 0 mm and concentrated for 24 h at a 4 c freezer the primary characteristics of the concentrated raw was with the supernatant being decanted are listed in table 1 clearly the content of humus i e humic acid fulvic acid and humin and lignocellulose i e hemicellulose cellulose and lignin in was is at a substantial level accounting for 50 of the total vss in order to ensure the proper performance of biochemical methane potential tests boulanger et al 2012 the inoculum was concentrated before use and the main characteristics of the concentrated inoculum are shown in table 1 2 2 cao2 pretreatment at different levels on was in this test six batch reactors with a working volume of 1000 ml were performed firstly 1 8 l of was averagely distributed into these six batch reactors different amounts of cao2 were then added to the reactors to achieve a preselected dosage of 0 0 02 0 08 0 14 0 2 or 0 26 g g vss the pretreatment time in all the reactors was controlled at 48 h according to the literature since ph oxidation reduction potential and scod were stable after that time wang et al 2018b 2019a liu et al 2019b after pretreatment soluble cod soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and the intensities of oh and o2 in liquor phase were measured meanwhile humus lignocellulose and other recalcitrant organics in both liquor and solid phases in the reactors were also determined 2 3 methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was after 48 h pretreatment each reactor conducted above was fed with 300 ml degassed inocula angelidaki et al 2009 all the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition before being sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in a 35 1 c air bath shaker 120 rpm the ph in all the reactors was maintained at 7 0 0 1 by 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide during the entire period all the anaerobic digestion tests in this work unless otherwise described were conducted in triplicate with a blank reactor containing 300 ml inocula and 300 ml milli q water during the digestion the total bio gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the reactor using a glass syringe 300 ml to equilibrate with the indoor atmospheric pressure oh et al 2003 the cumulative yield of methane was calculated according to the equation reported previously wang et al 2019a 2 4 methane production from the cao2 pretreated humus and lignocellulose as mentioned before humic acid fulvic acid lignin cellulose and hemicellulose were measured to be the major recalcitrant organics in was cao2 pretreatment might enhance the degradations of these organics to assess whether their degradation intermediates or products could be utilized by anaerobes to produce methane 15 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 1000 ml each were carried out in this test these reactors were divided into five groups namely humic acid test fulvic acid test lignin test cellulose test and hemicellulose test with three in each humic acid test each reactor first received 300 ml synthetic wastewater containing 1453 mg l humic acid cas 68131 04 04 except for humic acid no extra organics were added in the reactors the humic acid concentration used here was equal to that measured in the raw was then 0 499 4 and 927 4 mg cao2 were respectively added into these three reactors with their amounts being equal to those added into the 0 0 14 and 0 26 g g vss reactors operated above respectively after 48 h treatment ultraviolet uv absorption spectrum fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms were used to identify the degradation possibility of humic acid and its degradation products or intermediates afterwards each reactor received 300 ml same inocula all other digestion conditions were the same as described in methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section the test lasted for 5 days during which the methane production in each reactor was measured daily by comparing the cumulative methane yield among the three reactors the feasibility of whether humic acid degradation products or intermediates can be used to produce methane can be indicated fulvic acid test the operations of this test were the same as performed in humic acid test except that 1453 mg l humic acid in synthetic wastewater was replaced with 1281 mg l fulvic acid cas 479 66 3 lignin test the test was operated the same as described in humic acid test except that 1057 mg l lignin alkali a model lignin compound cas 8068 05 1 was used to replace 1453 mg l humic acid in synthetic wastewater cellulose test the operation procedure of this test was the same as in fulvic acid test except that 1281 mg l fulvic acid in synthetic wastewater was replaced with 1210 mg l carboxymethylcellulose sodium a model cellulose compound cas 9004 32 4 hemicellulose test the test was operated the same as in humic acid test except that 350 mg l xylan a model hemicellulose compound cas 9014 63 5 was employed to replace 1453 mg l humic acid in synthetic wastewater 2 5 effect of the recalcitrant organic concentration on anaerobic digestion in this test 13 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were operated each received 150 ml same inocula and 150 ml synthetic wastewater containing 3 48 g l bovine serum albumin bsa a model protein compound and 0 98 g l dextran a model polysaccharide compound among them one was set as the control without addition of any recalcitrant organic the other twelve reactors were divided into two groups group i and group ii with six in each the six reactors in group i were added with 1453 mg l humic acid 1281 mg l fulvic acid 1057 mg l lignin 1210 mg l cellulose 355 mg l hemicellulose or 0 99 mg l triclocarban cas 101 20 2 0 31 mg l norfloxacin cas 70458 96 7 1 89 mg l phenanthrene cas 85 01 8 0 14 mg l diclofenac cas 15307 79 6 3 47 mg l roxarsone cas 121 19 7 the concentrations of recalcitrant organics used in group i were approximately equal to those measured in the raw was it should be noted that the effect of triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and roxarsone on anaerobic digestion was assessed in one reactor due to their relatively low concentrations as comparison the six reactors in group ii were fed with 1060 mg l humic acid 740 mg l fulvic acid 910 mg l lignin 730 mg l cellulose 180 mg l hemicellulose or 0 62 mg l triclocarban 0 20 mg l norfloxacin 1 42 mg l phenanthrene 0 09 mg l diclofenac 2 79 mg l roxarsone the dosages of these recalcitrant organics in group ii were the same as those determined in was mixture pretreated by 0 14 g cao2 g vss for 48 h this is because 0 14 g cao2 g vss resulted in the maximum methane production based on the results obtained in section 2 3 all other operational methods were the same as those described in methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section each reactor was operated for 3 days during which the methane yield was measured daily 2 6 impact of cao2 reaction residues on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis hydrogentrophic methonogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis processes in the cao2 pretreatment process large amounts of ca2 ca oh 2 oh and o2 would be released as its major reaction products these substances would totally or partly enter into the subsequent anaerobic digestion systems as cao2 reaction residues and contact with the inocula which thereby affected the biological processes relevant to anaerobic digestion such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the following batch tests therefore aimed to assess the impact of cao2 reaction residues on these bioprocesses using model substrates in this set of tests 15 replicate reactors with a working volume of 1000 ml each were operated and divided into five groups namely hydrolysis test acidogenesis test acetogenesis test hydrogentrophic methonogenesis test and acetoclastic methanogenesis test the procedures of the tests were operated according to the literature with the details being presented in supporting information text s1 2 7 effect of ca2 on methane production ca2 is the main product during the decomposition of cao2 to assess its effect on methane production 3 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were operated each received 150 ml same inocula and 150 ml synthetic wastewater containing 3 48 g l bsa and 0 98 g l dextran then different amounts of cacl2 were added to the reactors to achieve dosages of 0 2 62 or 4 76 g l the ca2 concentrations used here were respectively equal to those added into the 0 0 14 and 0 26 g cao2 g vss reactors operated above all other operational methods were the same as those described in methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section each reactor was operated for 5 days during which the methane yield was measured daily by comparing the cumulative methane among the three reactors the influence of ca2 on methane production could be indicated 2 8 model based analysis to further understand the effect of cao2 treatment on anaerobic digestion the gompertz model eq 1 wang et al 2018a was used to describe the methane yield data obtained from methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section 1 m m m exp exp r m e m m λ t 1 where m is the cumulative methane production ml g vss mm is the maximum methane yield ml g vss rm is the methane yield ml g vss d λ is the lag

2 9 analytical methods methane was measured using a gas chromatograph gc112a china with the analytical approach being detailed in our previous publication liu et al 2018 ph was measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd china proteins carbohydrates and short chain fatty acids were measured as previously described liu et al 2019a cod tss and vss were determined according to standard methods apha et al 1998 the concentration of lignocellulosic substance was determined by the washing method developed by van soest et al 1991 the determination of humus substance was performed according to the method reported previously ny t 1867 2010 the biodegradability of organics released in liquor phase was indicated using excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific france with a 450 w xe arc lamp luo et al 2013 electron magnetic resonance epr is used to measure oh and o2 and the method was detailed in supporting information text s2 the absorption of humus and lignocellulose at the wavelength range of 200 400 nm which can be used to indicate the aromaticity was obtained by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 japan chen et al 2012 in order to characterize the changes in the functional groups of the degradation products of humus and lignocellulose ftir was employed in brief 0 04 ml sample and 2 g of kbr were separately mixed placed in a vacuum oven to be dried and fully ground and compressed ftir spectra were acquired by transmission in the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 and resolution 4 cm 1 using an avatar 360 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy gc ms was used to identify the degradation products of humus and lignocellulose the samples obtained after filtration with 0 45 μm were dried under a vacuum freeze dryer for 24 h dissolved in dichloromethane and finally concentrated in a water bath at 38 c using a rotary evaporation apparatus the samples were then analyzed by a gc ms qp 2010 shimadzu instrument the temperature of the syringe was 250 c and the column temperature program was started at 60 c for 1 min and heated to 280 c at a rate of 10 c min for 3 min the ms ion source temperature was 250 c and the electron energy was 70 ev helium was used as the carrier gas phenanthrene was also determined by gc ms instrument the contents of triclocarban norfloxacin diclofenac and roxarsone were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometer mass spectrometer lc ms agilent 1260 6460 usa with the methods being detailed in supporting information text s3 2 10 statistical analysis all the tests were conducted in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was fig 1 shows the cumulative methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was pretreated by different cao2 levels these reactors showed similar trends in methane production it can be observed that the methane yield increased gradually from 1 to 18 d and no significant increase was observed after 18 d p 0 05 this indicated an optimal digestion time of 18 d in these reactors however the maximum methane yield was largely affected by the dosage of cao2 with an increase of cao2 from 0 to 0 14 g g vss the maximum methane yield increased from 146 3 6 4 to 215 9 9 3 ml g vss although further increase of cao2 to 0 20 and 0 26 g g vss resulted in slight decreases in methane production to 207 0 8 8and 192 9 7 3 ml g vss the values were still 1 4 and 1 3 folds of that from 0 g cao2 g vss to further understand the effect of cao2 pretreatment on anaerobic digestion an improved gompertz model was used to describe these experimental data three kinetic parameters namely maximum methane yield mm methane production rate rm and lag phase λ were calculated fig 1 it can be seen that the model fitted the data very well cao2 pretreatment was found to slightly prolong lag phase time λ however cao2 pretreatment in most cases caused increases in the maximum methane yield mm and production rate rm suggesting that cao2 pretreatment promoted not only biochemical methane potential but methane production rate this supported well the experimental analyses all the facts demonstrated that cao2 pretreatment at pertinent levels could promote methane production from anaerobic digestion effectively the mechanisms of how cao2 pretreatment affects methane production were explored in the following text 3 2 mechanisms of how cao2 pretreatment promotes methane production the was organics are mainly encapsulated in sludge cells by extracellular polymers and cell membranes before being digested they require to be released from sludge cells to liquor phase through was disintegration which is widely considered the major rate limiting step for anaerobic digestion it was previously reported that cao2 pretreatment enhanced was disintegration effectively wang et al 2019a and this was also confirmed by soluble cod soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vss reduction measured after 2 d pretreatment in this work fig s1 generally peroxide agents e g h2o2 can decompose to release free radicals e g oh and o2 to wreck sludge compared with these agents cao2 not only decomposes to release oh and o2 at a controlled rate when it meet with hydrous media but also has high energy peroxide covalent bonds besides a large amount of alkali would be generated in the process of cao2 decomposition which benefits sludge disintegration as well wang et al 2019a b although high concentrations of ca2 was not beneficial to was integration due to its flocculation alkali oh and o2 were documented to enhance was disintegration largely wang et al 2018b li et al 2019a therefore ca oh 2 oh and o2 produced in the pretreatment process promoted was disintegration which was one reason for the enhanced methane production apart from biodegradable substances such as proteins and carbohydrates sludge cells also contain substantial non degradable organics e g humus and lignocellulose to examine whether cao2 pretreatment caused degradations of these recalcitrant organics a fluorescence regional integration supported eem technique was first used to analyze the liquors obtained by different pretreatment systems the organics located in the five regions can be divided into five types according to their excitation emission wavelengths please see table s1 for details and the percentage of fluorescence response in each region can be used to indicate the relevant organic content please see text s4 for the detailed calculation method for percent fluorescence response it was found that cao2 pretreatment promoted substantially the percent fluorescence response in region iv fig 2 which represented soluble microbial by product like substances this suggested that the presence of cao2 improved the biodegradability of the released organics especially with an increase of cao2 dosage the percent fluorescence response in region iii i e fulvic acid like substances and region v i e humic acid like substances decreased fig 2 indicating that a portion of humus was oxidized it was measured that the concentrations of humus i e humic acid fulvic acid and humin lignocellulose i e lignin cellulose and hemicellulose and other typical recalcitrant organics e g triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and roxarsone in the cao2 pretreated reactors after 48 h pretreatment were lower than those in the reactor without cao2 addition fig s2 supporting the data presented in fig 2 well to obtain more information about the degradations of humus and lignocellulose by cao2 pretreatment a set of batch tests using model substrates was performed figs 3a 2 b show the uv absorption spectra of two representative substrates i e fulvic acid and cellulose with or without cao2 pretreatment for 48 h two absorption spectra of fulvic acid were similar in shape fig 3a and both showed strong absorption in the ultraviolet region indicating that each sample contained substantial aromatic cc bond and other chromophores chen et al 2002 compared with the sample without pretreatment cao2 pretreated sample showed a decrease in the absorbance suggesting that the latter contained less benzene polycyclic compounds and aromatic cc than the former korshin et al 1997 reported that the absorption band at wavelengths in the range of 240 250 nm was mainly caused by the electron transition of substituted benzene ring or polycyclic compounds while the absorption at 260 nm was usually assigned to cc in aromatic ring fukushima et al 2007 similar observation was also made on the absorption spectra of cellulose fig 3b for example the absorptions at bands 270 nm and 210 nm representing the aromatic ring in the lignocellulose structure and conjugated cc bonds in the side chain respectively maziero et al 2012 deuss et al 2015 in the cao2 pretreated sample were lower than those in the sample without pretreatment this indicated that cao2 destroyed substantially benzene rings and cc bonds it was previously reported that the open of benzene rings reduced the steric hindrance and π π electronic transition energy which thereby benefited cellulose degradation maziero et al 2012 cao2 pretreatment decreased the intensity of band 3400 cm 1 which is often related to the stretching of o h group in fulvic acid aiken et al 1985 the intensity of band 1650 cm 1 representing cc of aromatic ring is the index of aromaticity and polycondensation degree baigorri et al 2009 there was a decrease in its intensity in the cao2 pretreated sample which was consistent with the results presented in fig 3a moreover there were some increases in the intensities of bands 1450 cm 1 and 1275 cm 1 after cao2 pretreatment previous publications showed that the former was assigned to o h in alcohol aryl ether or carboxylic acid and c o stretching vibration of phenol while the latter was related to c o stretching vibration of carbohydrate niemeyer et al 1992 this indicated that more organics with small molecule weights were produced after cao2 pretreatment similar results were also observed on the ftir spectra of cellulose fig 3d table 2 outlines the main degradation products of fulvic acid after cao2 pretreatment for 48 h using gc ms analysis there were 22 degradation products being determined in the pretreated sample among them 2 organics were thought as phenol like substances it was reported that phenol like substances were the common aromatic degradation product of fulvic acid which were either derived from the aromatic ring structure derenne et al 1997 or formed by secondary cleavage and cyclization of the fatty chain in fulvic acid saiz jim enez 1994 besides several type organics with small molecular weights such as ester like acid like and alcohol like substances were also detected previous publications demonstrated that esters could be yielded by oxidative cleavage of a side chain linked to the fulvic acid macromolecule by ester bond or ether bond hatcher and clifford 1994 while acids might be produced by opening and fracturing aromatic ring in fulvic acid through oxidation naafs and van bergen 2002 in addition alcohols could be generated through fatty acid ester cleavage derenne et al 1997 similar to fulvic acid there were also many small molecular organics including two alcohol like substances two aldehyde like substances one ketone like substance five acid like substances and two ester like substances being determined in the cao2 pretreated cellulose sample table s2 confirming again its degradation it was documented that some small molecular organics identified could be used as digestion substrates for anaerobes widdel et al 1983 londry and fedorak 1992 which probably increased the substrates available fig 4 further shows daily methane yield from humic acid fulvic acid hemicellulose lignin and cellulose with or without cao2 pretreatment although no extra substrate was added about 13 6 ml methane was still produced daily from the inocula suggesting the existence of biodegradable organics possibly due to the secretion or lysis of the inocula when the pretreated humic acid was added methane yield increased obviously on 4 d digestion for example 20 4 and 18 0 ml methane were respectively produced from the 499 4 mg cao2 pretreated and 927 4 mg cao2 pretreated samples which were 1 4 and 1 2 folds of that produced from the inocula alone fig 4a this confirmed that some degradation products of humic acid could be used by anaerobes to produce methane directly it should be emphasized that the 499 4 mg cao2 pretreated sample produced more methane than the 927 4 mg cao2 pretreated sample though the latter was supposed to provide more biodegradable organics this might be due to that more cao2 reaction residues mainly o2 and oh entered into the latter digestion system and caused severer inhibition to anaerobic digestion which would be discussed further in the following text when humic acid without pretreatment was added methane yield decreased rather than increased as compared with that from the inocula alone indicating that humic acid at this level caused an inhibitory to methanogens similar observations were also made on other humus and lignocellulose samples fig 4 all these results demonstrated that cao2 pretreatment caused degradations of recalcitrant organics and provided more substrates available for subsequent methane production which was another reason for the improvement of methane yield as indicated above the presence of recalcitrant organics at high levels led to inhibitions to anaerobes thus we performed a set of batch tests to assess the inhibitions using bsa and dextran as digestion substrates compared with the control the presence of the recalcitrant organics at group i level significantly reduced the methane production p 0 05 table s3 except for lignin the decreases in the recalcitrant organics significantly promoted methane production p 0 05 table s4 the higher the recalcitrant organic concentration the lower the methane production and methane production rate table 3 for instance 55 3 8 9 ml and 11 25 1 82 ml g vss h were respectively measured in the control while the corresponding values were 44 2 6 8 ml and 7 64 1 65 ml g vss h in the 1060 mg l humic acid presence reactor in the 1453 mg l humic acid presence reactor the corresponding values further decreased to 37 7 5 4 ml and 7 13 1 23 ml g vss h respectively similar results were also measured at other recalcitrant organics confirming that the inhibitions of these recalcitrant organics to anaerobes were dosage dependent when was pretreated by cao2 the concentrations of these recalcitrant organics decreased substantially fig s2 the decreases in these recalcitrant organic concentrations mitigated their inhibitions to anaerobes e g methanogens which was the third reason for the improvement of methane production 3 3 the impact of cao2 reaction residues on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis hydrogentrophic methonogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis processes according to the literature large amounts of alkali ca2 oh and o2 would be released or generated as its major reaction products in the cao2 pretreatment process li et al 2015 indeed substantial intensities of o2 and oh were measured in the cao2 pretreated liquors after 48 h of treatment figs 5a 4 b although ph in all the digesters was maintained at 7 0 0 1 the latter three substances would enter into the subsequent digesters and contact with anaerobes which thereby affected the biological processes relevant to anaerobic digestion such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis it was found that degradations of all the model substrates tested in this work were affected by the residues and the presence of the residues reduced the degradations of all the model matrices fig s3 supporting information table 4 further summarizes the specific degradation rates of bsa glucose propionate hydrogen and acetate in the case without cao2 addition the degradation rate of bsa was measured at 31 46 2 20 mg g vss h which can be considered the original activity of the hydrolytic microorganisms xu et al 2018a in the case with 499 4 mg cao2 addition this cao2 amount was equal to that added into the 0 14 g g vss dosage reactor the degradation rate of bsa decreased to 29 86 0 99 mg g vss h suggesting that the cao2 reaction residues at 0 14 g g vss dosage reduced the relative activity of hydrolytic microbes expressed as by 5 1 when 927 4 mg cao2 was added the cao2 amount was equal to that added into the 0 26 g g vss dosage reactor the relative activity of the hydrolytic microbes was reduced by 11 3 based on the same calculation it was found that the cao2 reaction residues at 0 14 and 0 26 g g vss dosages reduced the relative activity of microbes relevant to acidogenesis by 1 7 and 11 3 the relative activity of anaerobes related to acetogenesis by 16 7 and 20 4 the relative activity of microbes responsible for hydrogentrophic methanogenesis by 41 7 and 66 7 and the relative activity of microbes relevant to acetoclastic methanogenesis by 30 2 and 57 4 respectively variance analysis showed that lower dosages e g 499 4 mg of cao2 had no significant effect on hydrolytic microbes and acidogenesis microbes but significantly inhibited the acetogenesis and methanogens table s5 the reaction residues at greater cao2 dosage e g 927 4 mg caused significant inhibition to all the anaerobes p 0 05 this could well explain why lower methane productions were obtained at higher cao2 dosages figs 1 and 4 though higher cao2 dosages were expected to supply more substrates for anaerobic digestion among the four major cao2 reaction residues i e alkali ca2 oh and o2 alkali did not affect these bioprocesses due to the fact that ph in all the digesters was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 after pretreatment it can be seen that with an increase of cacl2 level from 0 to 4 76 g l the cumulative methane production in 5 d digestion from the same synthetic medium increased slightly from 52 8 to 63 2 ml fig 5c suggesting that the presence of ca2 promoted rather than inhibited these bioprocesses and the residual radicals were the major inhibitors to the bioprocesses previous publications showed that many extracellular enzymes e g neutral proteases produced by microorganisms require ca2 to maintain their stability sonnleitner and fiechter 1985 nakamura et al 1997 moreover the presence of ca2 benefited to maintain relatively high abundances of hydrolytic microbes e g firmicutes acid producing microorganisms e g anaerolineaceae and acetoclastic methanogens e g synergistaceae chen et al 2016 liang et al 2015 ito et al 2011 however free radicals are known to strong oxidants that could attack microbes and cause damages to the bacterial cell membranes tokumura et al 2009 for example oh can easily close to dna molecules and cause breakage of dna strands imlay et al 1988 griveau and lannou 1997 3 4 overall understanding and implication using cao2 as an addition agent for was pretreatment to effectively promote the dewaterability of was and productions of volatile fatty acids hydrogen and methane has attracted increasing attention wang and li 2016 2019a li et al 2015 however this cao2 based method is a recently developed approach with poor understanding this work revealed for the first time the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment promotes methane production from anaerobic digestion of was which provides insights into cao2 based was pretreatment process according to the analyses above it was found that cao2 pretreatment enhanced the disintegration of was and degradation of recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose which supplied more substrates available for subsequent methane production the presence of recalcitrant organics was demonstrated to be detrimental to anaerobes relevant to anaerobic digestion thus the degradation of such recalcitrant organics benefited to mitigate their inhibitions to the anaerobes apart from biodegradable substrates e g proteins and carbohydrates was also included substantial recalcitrant organics such as humus lignocellulose antibiotics and endocrine disrupting compounds these organics generally could not be biodegraded in ordinary anaerobic digestion and might re enter into natural environment through final disposal of was or discharge the treated digestion liquor this brings risks to ecological environment and human health this work demonstrated that cao2 could effectively enhance methane production and recalcitrant organic degradations which not only benefited sustainable operation of wwtps but also reduced the environmental risks apart from the benefits it was also reported that cao2 pretreatment improved the dewaterability of was and decreased the toxicity of heavy metals substantially li et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the improvement of was dewaterability indicated a reduction in the transport and final disposal of the was volume while the decrease of heavy metal activity in was beneficial to its reuse especially land application it should be emphasized that the reaction residues e g oh and o2 released or generated in the cao2 treatment would inhibit anaerobes significantly especially at high cao2 dosages this may be addressed by prolonging the pretreatment time as the exist time of oh and o2 was not very long however a high cao2 dosage and a long pretreatment time implied a high input thus controlling cao2 dosage and pretreatment time at pertinent levels is very important to practical applications however technical optimization was not conducted here because this work mainly aimed to explore the mechanism of cao2 based pretreatment enhancing methane production therefore a comprehensive optimization research using either a mathematical model or a response surface method is necessitated in the future it should be also noted that the benefits of cao2 based was pretreatment discussed above are indicated only based on the optimization research scaling up this cao2 based method to pilot scale or full scale levels is therefore necessary to comprehensively assess its technical and economic feasibilities in the future 4 conclusion in this present study the underlying mechanism of how cao2 affects methane production during anaerobic digestion of sludge was revealed the main conclusions are 1 the addition of cao2 increased methane production with the increase of cao2 from 0 to 0 14 g g vss the cumulative methane content of the sludge increases from 146 3 to 215 9 ml g vss further increases of cao2 resulted in decreases in methane production 2 the presence of cao2 was found to promote the decomposition of was providing more soluble organics for subsequent digestion steps 3 cao2 pretreatment promoted the disintegration of sludge and the degradation of sludge recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose substantial methane could be produced from these degradation products 4 the presence of recalcitrant organics was detrimental to anaerobes relevant to anaerobic digestion and the degradation of such recalcitrant organics by cao2 mitigated their inhibitions to the anaerobes 5 the cao2 reaction residues inhibited all the microbes relevant to anaerobic digestion to some extents and their inhibitions to methanogens were severer than those to anaerobes responsible for other bioprocesses the main contributor to this inhibition was residual free radicals rather than ca2 acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the natural science funds of hunan province for distinguished young scholar 2018jj1002 and science and

18550,recent investigations verified that calcium peroxide cao2 could be used to pretreat waste activated sludge to promote methane yield from anaerobic digestion however the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment promotes methane production is unclear this work therefore aims to provide insights into such systems experimental results showed that with an increase of cao2 dosage from 0 to 0 14 g g vss volatile suspended solids the methane yield increased linearly from 146 3 to 215 9 ml g vss further increases of cao2 resulted in decreases in methane yield cao2 pretreatment promoted the disintegration of sludge and the degradation of sludge recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose thereby providing more substrates for subsequent methane production ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy indicated that cao2 enhanced the cleavage of unsaturated conjugated bonds and reduced the aromaticity of humus and lignocellulose fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that cao2 changed the structures and functional groups of humus and lignocellulose making them transform to be biodegradable gc ms analyses exhibited that the degradation products of humus and lignocellulose included several types of small molecular organics such as ester like acid like and alcohol like substances further investigation demonstrated that substantial methane could be produced from these degradation products it was also found that the presence of recalcitrant organics was detrimental to anaerobes relevant to anaerobic digestion and the degradation of such recalcitrant organics mitigated their inhibitions to the anaerobes model based analysis suggested that cao2 pretreatment increased the maximum methane yield and methane production rate which were consistent with the analysis above graphical abstract image 1 keywords calcium peroxide waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion humus lignocellulose 1 introduction waste activated sludge was which is an extremely complex byproduct in wastewater treatment plants wwtps contains heterogeneous substances such as bacteria pathogens inorganic particles colloids heavy metals and persistent organic substances without being effectively treated it is easy to cause secondary pollution to natural waterbodies groundwater and soil thereby threatening environmental safety and public health since was contains a large number of organics such as proteins and carbohydrates it is also considered a renewable bioenergy resource li et al 2018 xu et al 2018b as an effective technology for pollution control and energy recovery anaerobic digestion of was attracts much attention by which biodegradable organics are degraded was is stabilized and reduced pathogens are killed and biogas methane is also produced li et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 in general there are two major factors that restrict methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was one is disintegration degrees of sludge flocs limited by protection of extracellular polymeric substances and cell wall and or membrane the other is the substantial recalcitrant organics such as humus lignocellulose triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and loxosone present in was li et al 2019b wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 it was reported that humus accounted for 15 28 of the total organics in was while the amount of lignocellulose reached 14 44 of the total was organic matters li et al 2014 hu et al 2016 these recalcitrant organics are usually not used to produce methane in ordinary anaerobic digestion process moreover some of them e g humic acid triclocarban and roxarsone are demonstrated to inhibit the activities of microbes relevant to anaerobic digestion which thereby decrease methane yield bartoszek et al 2008 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 for example jiang et al 2017 pointed out that 5 μg l diclofenac damaged the microbial cell walls using acetate as the model substrate zhang et al 2014 found that the specific methanogenic activity was only 74 2 of blank in the presence of 20 mg l roxarsone to date however most efforts to increase methane production have focused on the former for instance with 24 h pretreatment of thickened was at an free nitrous acid concentration of 6 1 mg n l the hydraulic retention time hrt of the experimental anaerobic digester decreased from 15 0 to 7 5 days and the methane production rate increased by 165 compared to the control zhang et al 2019 kuglarz et al 2013 indicated that the sludge pretreated at 60 70 c by microwaves of 900 w gave 35 more methane which was more energetically sustainable compared to untreated sludge apart from acceleration of was disintegration enhancing the degradation of recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose in was may be an alternative method for promotion of methane production however little attention has been paid to this point so far cao2 a white or light yellow crystalline peroxide is considered a solid form of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 cassidy and irvine 1999 in hydrous media cao2 is decomposed slowly to form h2o2 o2 and ca oh 2 at a controlled rate due to this property cao2 is widely used as a bactericide preservative antacid oil bleach or oxidant in agriculture aquiculture medicine manufacturing and environmental protection cassidy and irvine 1999 kaewdee et al 2016 qian et al 2016 apart from these applications wang and li 2016 recently attempted another new direction being an additive for was pretreatment to enhance methane production it was found that when 0 1 g g vss cao2 was used to aid microwave irradiation 480 w 2 min to pretreat was the cumulative production of methane from anaerobic digestion increased by 80 2 as compared with the control this finding expands the application field of cao2 and provides an efficient strategy for the improvement of methane production compared with other pretreatment techniques such as thermal and free nitrous acid cao2 pretreatment required extra addition of chemical which increased the input due to its strong oxidbillity and alkalinity however cao2 pretreatment can promote the disintegration of sludge flocs and facilitate the degradation of refractory organic or toxic pollutants in sludge farno et al 2015 wang et al 2019b li et al 2015 considering the massive quantities of was daily digested this cao2 based method should have substantial benefits for was anaerobic digestion despite these valuable findings the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment improves methane production from anaerobic digestion especially from the aspect of humus and lignocellulose degradations remains largely unknown as a strong oxidant although cao2 was demonstrated to have abilities to oxidize several pollutants such as estrone 17β estradiol 17α ethinyl estradiol estriol bisphenol a 4 nonyl phenol and 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene zhai and jiang 2014 arienzo 2000 it is unknown whether cao2 based pretreatment enhances the degradations of humus lignocellulose and other typical recalcitrant organics in was such as triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and roxarsone if it does what are the major degradation intermediates or products are these intermediates or products utilized by anaerobes to produce methane do the degradations of these recalcitrant organics bring other impacts to anaerobic digestion to date however all these questions have not been addressed which make such cao2 based was anaerobic digestion a black box with poor understanding through addressing these questions above the purpose of this work is to elucidate the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment enhances methane production from anaerobic digestion of was to obtain comprehensive information the effect of cao2 pretreatment at different dosages 0 0 26 g g vss on methane production was first studied then the details of how cao2 pretreatment improves methane production were explored the findings obtained not only provide insights into cao2 based was anaerobic digestion but also may guide engineers to develop strategies for the enhancements of both recalcitrant organic degradations and energy recovery in was treatment in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sources and characteristics of was and inocula the was used in the following tests was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the raw was filtrated by a sifter 2 0 mm and concentrated for 24 h at a 4 c freezer the primary characteristics of the concentrated raw was with the supernatant being decanted are listed in table 1 clearly the content of humus i e humic acid fulvic acid and humin and lignocellulose i e hemicellulose cellulose and lignin in was is at a substantial level accounting for 50 of the total vss in order to ensure the proper performance of biochemical methane potential tests boulanger et al 2012 the inoculum was concentrated before use and the main characteristics of the concentrated inoculum are shown in table 1 2 2 cao2 pretreatment at different levels on was in this test six batch reactors with a working volume of 1000 ml were performed firstly 1 8 l of was averagely distributed into these six batch reactors different amounts of cao2 were then added to the reactors to achieve a preselected dosage of 0 0 02 0 08 0 14 0 2 or 0 26 g g vss the pretreatment time in all the reactors was controlled at 48 h according to the literature since ph oxidation reduction potential and scod were stable after that time wang et al 2018b 2019a liu et al 2019b after pretreatment soluble cod soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and the intensities of oh and o2 in liquor phase were measured meanwhile humus lignocellulose and other recalcitrant organics in both liquor and solid phases in the reactors were also determined 2 3 methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was after 48 h pretreatment each reactor conducted above was fed with 300 ml degassed inocula angelidaki et al 2009 all the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition before being sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in a 35 1 c air bath shaker 120 rpm the ph in all the reactors was maintained at 7 0 0 1 by 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide during the entire period all the anaerobic digestion tests in this work unless otherwise described were conducted in triplicate with a blank reactor containing 300 ml inocula and 300 ml milli q water during the digestion the total bio gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the reactor using a glass syringe 300 ml to equilibrate with the indoor atmospheric pressure oh et al 2003 the cumulative yield of methane was calculated according to the equation reported previously wang et al 2019a 2 4 methane production from the cao2 pretreated humus and lignocellulose as mentioned before humic acid fulvic acid lignin cellulose and hemicellulose were measured to be the major recalcitrant organics in was cao2 pretreatment might enhance the degradations of these organics to assess whether their degradation intermediates or products could be utilized by anaerobes to produce methane 15 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 1000 ml each were carried out in this test these reactors were divided into five groups namely humic acid test fulvic acid test lignin test cellulose test and hemicellulose test with three in each humic acid test each reactor first received 300 ml synthetic wastewater containing 1453 mg l humic acid cas 68131 04 04 except for humic acid no extra organics were added in the reactors the humic acid concentration used here was equal to that measured in the raw was then 0 499 4 and 927 4 mg cao2 were respectively added into these three reactors with their amounts being equal to those added into the 0 0 14 and 0 26 g g vss reactors operated above respectively after 48 h treatment ultraviolet uv absorption spectrum fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms were used to identify the degradation possibility of humic acid and its degradation products or intermediates afterwards each reactor received 300 ml same inocula all other digestion conditions were the same as described in methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section the test lasted for 5 days during which the methane production in each reactor was measured daily by comparing the cumulative methane yield among the three reactors the feasibility of whether humic acid degradation products or intermediates can be used to produce methane can be indicated fulvic acid test the operations of this test were the same as performed in humic acid test except that 1453 mg l humic acid in synthetic wastewater was replaced with 1281 mg l fulvic acid cas 479 66 3 lignin test the test was operated the same as described in humic acid test except that 1057 mg l lignin alkali a model lignin compound cas 8068 05 1 was used to replace 1453 mg l humic acid in synthetic wastewater cellulose test the operation procedure of this test was the same as in fulvic acid test except that 1281 mg l fulvic acid in synthetic wastewater was replaced with 1210 mg l carboxymethylcellulose sodium a model cellulose compound cas 9004 32 4 hemicellulose test the test was operated the same as in humic acid test except that 350 mg l xylan a model hemicellulose compound cas 9014 63 5 was employed to replace 1453 mg l humic acid in synthetic wastewater 2 5 effect of the recalcitrant organic concentration on anaerobic digestion in this test 13 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were operated each received 150 ml same inocula and 150 ml synthetic wastewater containing 3 48 g l bovine serum albumin bsa a model protein compound and 0 98 g l dextran a model polysaccharide compound among them one was set as the control without addition of any recalcitrant organic the other twelve reactors were divided into two groups group i and group ii with six in each the six reactors in group i were added with 1453 mg l humic acid 1281 mg l fulvic acid 1057 mg l lignin 1210 mg l cellulose 355 mg l hemicellulose or 0 99 mg l triclocarban cas 101 20 2 0 31 mg l norfloxacin cas 70458 96 7 1 89 mg l phenanthrene cas 85 01 8 0 14 mg l diclofenac cas 15307 79 6 3 47 mg l roxarsone cas 121 19 7 the concentrations of recalcitrant organics used in group i were approximately equal to those measured in the raw was it should be noted that the effect of triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and roxarsone on anaerobic digestion was assessed in one reactor due to their relatively low concentrations as comparison the six reactors in group ii were fed with 1060 mg l humic acid 740 mg l fulvic acid 910 mg l lignin 730 mg l cellulose 180 mg l hemicellulose or 0 62 mg l triclocarban 0 20 mg l norfloxacin 1 42 mg l phenanthrene 0 09 mg l diclofenac 2 79 mg l roxarsone the dosages of these recalcitrant organics in group ii were the same as those determined in was mixture pretreated by 0 14 g cao2 g vss for 48 h this is because 0 14 g cao2 g vss resulted in the maximum methane production based on the results obtained in section 2 3 all other operational methods were the same as those described in methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section each reactor was operated for 3 days during which the methane yield was measured daily 2 6 impact of cao2 reaction residues on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis hydrogentrophic methonogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis processes in the cao2 pretreatment process large amounts of ca2 ca oh 2 oh and o2 would be released as its major reaction products these substances would totally or partly enter into the subsequent anaerobic digestion systems as cao2 reaction residues and contact with the inocula which thereby affected the biological processes relevant to anaerobic digestion such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the following batch tests therefore aimed to assess the impact of cao2 reaction residues on these bioprocesses using model substrates in this set of tests 15 replicate reactors with a working volume of 1000 ml each were operated and divided into five groups namely hydrolysis test acidogenesis test acetogenesis test hydrogentrophic methonogenesis test and acetoclastic methanogenesis test the procedures of the tests were operated according to the literature with the details being presented in supporting information text s1 2 7 effect of ca2 on methane production ca2 is the main product during the decomposition of cao2 to assess its effect on methane production 3 reproductive reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were operated each received 150 ml same inocula and 150 ml synthetic wastewater containing 3 48 g l bsa and 0 98 g l dextran then different amounts of cacl2 were added to the reactors to achieve dosages of 0 2 62 or 4 76 g l the ca2 concentrations used here were respectively equal to those added into the 0 0 14 and 0 26 g cao2 g vss reactors operated above all other operational methods were the same as those described in methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section each reactor was operated for 5 days during which the methane yield was measured daily by comparing the cumulative methane among the three reactors the influence of ca2 on methane production could be indicated 2 8 model based analysis to further understand the effect of cao2 treatment on anaerobic digestion the gompertz model eq 1 wang et al 2018a was used to describe the methane yield data obtained from methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was section 1 m m m exp exp r m e m m λ t 1 where m is the cumulative methane production ml g vss mm is the maximum methane yield ml g vss rm is the methane yield ml g vss d λ is the lag

2 9 analytical methods methane was measured using a gas chromatograph gc112a china with the analytical approach being detailed in our previous publication liu et al 2018 ph was measured using a digital ph meter phs 3c leici co ltd china proteins carbohydrates and short chain fatty acids were measured as previously described liu et al 2019a cod tss and vss were determined according to standard methods apha et al 1998 the concentration of lignocellulosic substance was determined by the washing method developed by van soest et al 1991 the determination of humus substance was performed according to the method reported previously ny t 1867 2010 the biodegradability of organics released in liquor phase was indicated using excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific france with a 450 w xe arc lamp luo et al 2013 electron magnetic resonance epr is used to measure oh and o2 and the method was detailed in supporting information text s2 the absorption of humus and lignocellulose at the wavelength range of 200 400 nm which can be used to indicate the aromaticity was obtained by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 japan chen et al 2012 in order to characterize the changes in the functional groups of the degradation products of humus and lignocellulose ftir was employed in brief 0 04 ml sample and 2 g of kbr were separately mixed placed in a vacuum oven to be dried and fully ground and compressed ftir spectra were acquired by transmission in the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 and resolution 4 cm 1 using an avatar 360 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy gc ms was used to identify the degradation products of humus and lignocellulose the samples obtained after filtration with 0 45 μm were dried under a vacuum freeze dryer for 24 h dissolved in dichloromethane and finally concentrated in a water bath at 38 c using a rotary evaporation apparatus the samples were then analyzed by a gc ms qp 2010 shimadzu instrument the temperature of the syringe was 250 c and the column temperature program was started at 60 c for 1 min and heated to 280 c at a rate of 10 c min for 3 min the ms ion source temperature was 250 c and the electron energy was 70 ev helium was used as the carrier gas phenanthrene was also determined by gc ms instrument the contents of triclocarban norfloxacin diclofenac and roxarsone were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometer mass spectrometer lc ms agilent 1260 6460 usa with the methods being detailed in supporting information text s3 2 10 statistical analysis all the tests were conducted in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 methane production from anaerobic digestion of cao2 pretreated was fig 1 shows the cumulative methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was pretreated by different cao2 levels these reactors showed similar trends in methane production it can be observed that the methane yield increased gradually from 1 to 18 d and no significant increase was observed after 18 d p 0 05 this indicated an optimal digestion time of 18 d in these reactors however the maximum methane yield was largely affected by the dosage of cao2 with an increase of cao2 from 0 to 0 14 g g vss the maximum methane yield increased from 146 3 6 4 to 215 9 9 3 ml g vss although further increase of cao2 to 0 20 and 0 26 g g vss resulted in slight decreases in methane production to 207 0 8 8and 192 9 7 3 ml g vss the values were still 1 4 and 1 3 folds of that from 0 g cao2 g vss to further understand the effect of cao2 pretreatment on anaerobic digestion an improved gompertz model was used to describe these experimental data three kinetic parameters namely maximum methane yield mm methane production rate rm and lag phase λ were calculated fig 1 it can be seen that the model fitted the data very well cao2 pretreatment was found to slightly prolong lag phase time λ however cao2 pretreatment in most cases caused increases in the maximum methane yield mm and production rate rm suggesting that cao2 pretreatment promoted not only biochemical methane potential but methane production rate this supported well the experimental analyses all the facts demonstrated that cao2 pretreatment at pertinent levels could promote methane production from anaerobic digestion effectively the mechanisms of how cao2 pretreatment affects methane production were explored in the following text 3 2 mechanisms of how cao2 pretreatment promotes methane production the was organics are mainly encapsulated in sludge cells by extracellular polymers and cell membranes before being digested they require to be released from sludge cells to liquor phase through was disintegration which is widely considered the major rate limiting step for anaerobic digestion it was previously reported that cao2 pretreatment enhanced was disintegration effectively wang et al 2019a and this was also confirmed by soluble cod soluble proteins soluble carbohydrates and vss reduction measured after 2 d pretreatment in this work fig s1 generally peroxide agents e g h2o2 can decompose to release free radicals e g oh and o2 to wreck sludge compared with these agents cao2 not only decomposes to release oh and o2 at a controlled rate when it meet with hydrous media but also has high energy peroxide covalent bonds besides a large amount of alkali would be generated in the process of cao2 decomposition which benefits sludge disintegration as well wang et al 2019a b although high concentrations of ca2 was not beneficial to was integration due to its flocculation alkali oh and o2 were documented to enhance was disintegration largely wang et al 2018b li et al 2019a therefore ca oh 2 oh and o2 produced in the pretreatment process promoted was disintegration which was one reason for the enhanced methane production apart from biodegradable substances such as proteins and carbohydrates sludge cells also contain substantial non degradable organics e g humus and lignocellulose to examine whether cao2 pretreatment caused degradations of these recalcitrant organics a fluorescence regional integration supported eem technique was first used to analyze the liquors obtained by different pretreatment systems the organics located in the five regions can be divided into five types according to their excitation emission wavelengths please see table s1 for details and the percentage of fluorescence response in each region can be used to indicate the relevant organic content please see text s4 for the detailed calculation method for percent fluorescence response it was found that cao2 pretreatment promoted substantially the percent fluorescence response in region iv fig 2 which represented soluble microbial by product like substances this suggested that the presence of cao2 improved the biodegradability of the released organics especially with an increase of cao2 dosage the percent fluorescence response in region iii i e fulvic acid like substances and region v i e humic acid like substances decreased fig 2 indicating that a portion of humus was oxidized it was measured that the concentrations of humus i e humic acid fulvic acid and humin lignocellulose i e lignin cellulose and hemicellulose and other typical recalcitrant organics e g triclocarban norfloxacin phenanthrene diclofenac and roxarsone in the cao2 pretreated reactors after 48 h pretreatment were lower than those in the reactor without cao2 addition fig s2 supporting the data presented in fig 2 well to obtain more information about the degradations of humus and lignocellulose by cao2 pretreatment a set of batch tests using model substrates was performed figs 3a 2 b show the uv absorption spectra of two representative substrates i e fulvic acid and cellulose with or without cao2 pretreatment for 48 h two absorption spectra of fulvic acid were similar in shape fig 3a and both showed strong absorption in the ultraviolet region indicating that each sample contained substantial aromatic cc bond and other chromophores chen et al 2002 compared with the sample without pretreatment cao2 pretreated sample showed a decrease in the absorbance suggesting that the latter contained less benzene polycyclic compounds and aromatic cc than the former korshin et al 1997 reported that the absorption band at wavelengths in the range of 240 250 nm was mainly caused by the electron transition of substituted benzene ring or polycyclic compounds while the absorption at 260 nm was usually assigned to cc in aromatic ring fukushima et al 2007 similar observation was also made on the absorption spectra of cellulose fig 3b for example the absorptions at bands 270 nm and 210 nm representing the aromatic ring in the lignocellulose structure and conjugated cc bonds in the side chain respectively maziero et al 2012 deuss et al 2015 in the cao2 pretreated sample were lower than those in the sample without pretreatment this indicated that cao2 destroyed substantially benzene rings and cc bonds it was previously reported that the open of benzene rings reduced the steric hindrance and π π electronic transition energy which thereby benefited cellulose degradation maziero et al 2012 cao2 pretreatment decreased the intensity of band 3400 cm 1 which is often related to the stretching of o h group in fulvic acid aiken et al 1985 the intensity of band 1650 cm 1 representing cc of aromatic ring is the index of aromaticity and polycondensation degree baigorri et al 2009 there was a decrease in its intensity in the cao2 pretreated sample which was consistent with the results presented in fig 3a moreover there were some increases in the intensities of bands 1450 cm 1 and 1275 cm 1 after cao2 pretreatment previous publications showed that the former was assigned to o h in alcohol aryl ether or carboxylic acid and c o stretching vibration of phenol while the latter was related to c o stretching vibration of carbohydrate niemeyer et al 1992 this indicated that more organics with small molecule weights were produced after cao2 pretreatment similar results were also observed on the ftir spectra of cellulose fig 3d table 2 outlines the main degradation products of fulvic acid after cao2 pretreatment for 48 h using gc ms analysis there were 22 degradation products being determined in the pretreated sample among them 2 organics were thought as phenol like substances it was reported that phenol like substances were the common aromatic degradation product of fulvic acid which were either derived from the aromatic ring structure derenne et al 1997 or formed by secondary cleavage and cyclization of the fatty chain in fulvic acid saiz jim enez 1994 besides several type organics with small molecular weights such as ester like acid like and alcohol like substances were also detected previous publications demonstrated that esters could be yielded by oxidative cleavage of a side chain linked to the fulvic acid macromolecule by ester bond or ether bond hatcher and clifford 1994 while acids might be produced by opening and fracturing aromatic ring in fulvic acid through oxidation naafs and van bergen 2002 in addition alcohols could be generated through fatty acid ester cleavage derenne et al 1997 similar to fulvic acid there were also many small molecular organics including two alcohol like substances two aldehyde like substances one ketone like substance five acid like substances and two ester like substances being determined in the cao2 pretreated cellulose sample table s2 confirming again its degradation it was documented that some small molecular organics identified could be used as digestion substrates for anaerobes widdel et al 1983 londry and fedorak 1992 which probably increased the substrates available fig 4 further shows daily methane yield from humic acid fulvic acid hemicellulose lignin and cellulose with or without cao2 pretreatment although no extra substrate was added about 13 6 ml methane was still produced daily from the inocula suggesting the existence of biodegradable organics possibly due to the secretion or lysis of the inocula when the pretreated humic acid was added methane yield increased obviously on 4 d digestion for example 20 4 and 18 0 ml methane were respectively produced from the 499 4 mg cao2 pretreated and 927 4 mg cao2 pretreated samples which were 1 4 and 1 2 folds of that produced from the inocula alone fig 4a this confirmed that some degradation products of humic acid could be used by anaerobes to produce methane directly it should be emphasized that the 499 4 mg cao2 pretreated sample produced more methane than the 927 4 mg cao2 pretreated sample though the latter was supposed to provide more biodegradable organics this might be due to that more cao2 reaction residues mainly o2 and oh entered into the latter digestion system and caused severer inhibition to anaerobic digestion which would be discussed further in the following text when humic acid without pretreatment was added methane yield decreased rather than increased as compared with that from the inocula alone indicating that humic acid at this level caused an inhibitory to methanogens similar observations were also made on other humus and lignocellulose samples fig 4 all these results demonstrated that cao2 pretreatment caused degradations of recalcitrant organics and provided more substrates available for subsequent methane production which was another reason for the improvement of methane yield as indicated above the presence of recalcitrant organics at high levels led to inhibitions to anaerobes thus we performed a set of batch tests to assess the inhibitions using bsa and dextran as digestion substrates compared with the control the presence of the recalcitrant organics at group i level significantly reduced the methane production p 0 05 table s3 except for lignin the decreases in the recalcitrant organics significantly promoted methane production p 0 05 table s4 the higher the recalcitrant organic concentration the lower the methane production and methane production rate table 3 for instance 55 3 8 9 ml and 11 25 1 82 ml g vss h were respectively measured in the control while the corresponding values were 44 2 6 8 ml and 7 64 1 65 ml g vss h in the 1060 mg l humic acid presence reactor in the 1453 mg l humic acid presence reactor the corresponding values further decreased to 37 7 5 4 ml and 7 13 1 23 ml g vss h respectively similar results were also measured at other recalcitrant organics confirming that the inhibitions of these recalcitrant organics to anaerobes were dosage dependent when was pretreated by cao2 the concentrations of these recalcitrant organics decreased substantially fig s2 the decreases in these recalcitrant organic concentrations mitigated their inhibitions to anaerobes e g methanogens which was the third reason for the improvement of methane production 3 3 the impact of cao2 reaction residues on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis hydrogentrophic methonogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis processes according to the literature large amounts of alkali ca2 oh and o2 would be released or generated as its major reaction products in the cao2 pretreatment process li et al 2015 indeed substantial intensities of o2 and oh were measured in the cao2 pretreated liquors after 48 h of treatment figs 5a 4 b although ph in all the digesters was maintained at 7 0 0 1 the latter three substances would enter into the subsequent digesters and contact with anaerobes which thereby affected the biological processes relevant to anaerobic digestion such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis it was found that degradations of all the model substrates tested in this work were affected by the residues and the presence of the residues reduced the degradations of all the model matrices fig s3 supporting information table 4 further summarizes the specific degradation rates of bsa glucose propionate hydrogen and acetate in the case without cao2 addition the degradation rate of bsa was measured at 31 46 2 20 mg g vss h which can be considered the original activity of the hydrolytic microorganisms xu et al 2018a in the case with 499 4 mg cao2 addition this cao2 amount was equal to that added into the 0 14 g g vss dosage reactor the degradation rate of bsa decreased to 29 86 0 99 mg g vss h suggesting that the cao2 reaction residues at 0 14 g g vss dosage reduced the relative activity of hydrolytic microbes expressed as by 5 1 when 927 4 mg cao2 was added the cao2 amount was equal to that added into the 0 26 g g vss dosage reactor the relative activity of the hydrolytic microbes was reduced by 11 3 based on the same calculation it was found that the cao2 reaction residues at 0 14 and 0 26 g g vss dosages reduced the relative activity of microbes relevant to acidogenesis by 1 7 and 11 3 the relative activity of anaerobes related to acetogenesis by 16 7 and 20 4 the relative activity of microbes responsible for hydrogentrophic methanogenesis by 41 7 and 66 7 and the relative activity of microbes relevant to acetoclastic methanogenesis by 30 2 and 57 4 respectively variance analysis showed that lower dosages e g 499 4 mg of cao2 had no significant effect on hydrolytic microbes and acidogenesis microbes but significantly inhibited the acetogenesis and methanogens table s5 the reaction residues at greater cao2 dosage e g 927 4 mg caused significant inhibition to all the anaerobes p 0 05 this could well explain why lower methane productions were obtained at higher cao2 dosages figs 1 and 4 though higher cao2 dosages were expected to supply more substrates for anaerobic digestion among the four major cao2 reaction residues i e alkali ca2 oh and o2 alkali did not affect these bioprocesses due to the fact that ph in all the digesters was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 after pretreatment it can be seen that with an increase of cacl2 level from 0 to 4 76 g l the cumulative methane production in 5 d digestion from the same synthetic medium increased slightly from 52 8 to 63 2 ml fig 5c suggesting that the presence of ca2 promoted rather than inhibited these bioprocesses and the residual radicals were the major inhibitors to the bioprocesses previous publications showed that many extracellular enzymes e g neutral proteases produced by microorganisms require ca2 to maintain their stability sonnleitner and fiechter 1985 nakamura et al 1997 moreover the presence of ca2 benefited to maintain relatively high abundances of hydrolytic microbes e g firmicutes acid producing microorganisms e g anaerolineaceae and acetoclastic methanogens e g synergistaceae chen et al 2016 liang et al 2015 ito et al 2011 however free radicals are known to strong oxidants that could attack microbes and cause damages to the bacterial cell membranes tokumura et al 2009 for example oh can easily close to dna molecules and cause breakage of dna strands imlay et al 1988 griveau and lannou 1997 3 4 overall understanding and implication using cao2 as an addition agent for was pretreatment to effectively promote the dewaterability of was and productions of volatile fatty acids hydrogen and methane has attracted increasing attention wang and li 2016 2019a li et al 2015 however this cao2 based method is a recently developed approach with poor understanding this work revealed for the first time the underlying mechanism of how cao2 pretreatment promotes methane production from anaerobic digestion of was which provides insights into cao2 based was pretreatment process according to the analyses above it was found that cao2 pretreatment enhanced the disintegration of was and degradation of recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose which supplied more substrates available for subsequent methane production the presence of recalcitrant organics was demonstrated to be detrimental to anaerobes relevant to anaerobic digestion thus the degradation of such recalcitrant organics benefited to mitigate their inhibitions to the anaerobes apart from biodegradable substrates e g proteins and carbohydrates was also included substantial recalcitrant organics such as humus lignocellulose antibiotics and endocrine disrupting compounds these organics generally could not be biodegraded in ordinary anaerobic digestion and might re enter into natural environment through final disposal of was or discharge the treated digestion liquor this brings risks to ecological environment and human health this work demonstrated that cao2 could effectively enhance methane production and recalcitrant organic degradations which not only benefited sustainable operation of wwtps but also reduced the environmental risks apart from the benefits it was also reported that cao2 pretreatment improved the dewaterability of was and decreased the toxicity of heavy metals substantially li et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the improvement of was dewaterability indicated a reduction in the transport and final disposal of the was volume while the decrease of heavy metal activity in was beneficial to its reuse especially land application it should be emphasized that the reaction residues e g oh and o2 released or generated in the cao2 treatment would inhibit anaerobes significantly especially at high cao2 dosages this may be addressed by prolonging the pretreatment time as the exist time of oh and o2 was not very long however a high cao2 dosage and a long pretreatment time implied a high input thus controlling cao2 dosage and pretreatment time at pertinent levels is very important to practical applications however technical optimization was not conducted here because this work mainly aimed to explore the mechanism of cao2 based pretreatment enhancing methane production therefore a comprehensive optimization research using either a mathematical model or a response surface method is necessitated in the future it should be also noted that the benefits of cao2 based was pretreatment discussed above are indicated only based on the optimization research scaling up this cao2 based method to pilot scale or full scale levels is therefore necessary to comprehensively assess its technical and economic feasibilities in the future 4 conclusion in this present study the underlying mechanism of how cao2 affects methane production during anaerobic digestion of sludge was revealed the main conclusions are 1 the addition of cao2 increased methane production with the increase of cao2 from 0 to 0 14 g g vss the cumulative methane content of the sludge increases from 146 3 to 215 9 ml g vss further increases of cao2 resulted in decreases in methane production 2 the presence of cao2 was found to promote the decomposition of was providing more soluble organics for subsequent digestion steps 3 cao2 pretreatment promoted the disintegration of sludge and the degradation of sludge recalcitrant organics especially humus and lignocellulose substantial methane could be produced from these degradation products 4 the presence of recalcitrant organics was detrimental to anaerobes relevant to anaerobic digestion and the degradation of such recalcitrant organics by cao2 mitigated their inhibitions to the anaerobes 5 the cao2 reaction residues inhibited all the microbes relevant to anaerobic digestion to some extents and their inhibitions to methanogens were severer than those to anaerobes responsible for other bioprocesses the main contributor to this inhibition was residual free radicals rather than ca2 acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the natural science funds of hunan province for distinguished young scholar 2018jj1002 and science and

18551,the most probable number dilution culture assay mpn is used to enumerate viable phytoplankton in regulatory tests of ballast water treatment systems however the united states coast guard has not yet accepted mpn in part due to concerns of biased results due to cells being viable but not growing mpn does not assess the fate of every cell and thus the bias can only be evaluated by a companion method that assesses the ability of the various taxa to grow this growth ability growability is the complement of the bias and has been evaluated by microscopic taxonomy of before culture and after culture samples however microscopic taxonomy is extremely laborious and few data have been produced for phytoplankton growability in mpn assays to address the need for more and more reliable growability data a method was developed using next generation sequencing ngs and quantitative real time pcr qrt pcr techniques that target the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene for the taxonomic identification and growth assessment of eukaryotic phytoplankton respectively this growability method was applied to mpn samples from a ballast water management system test that were incubated with two different enrichment media at two different temperatures dna was extracted from filters of before culture and after culture samples and assessed for taxonomy by ngs and for pcr template dna concentration by qrt pcr growth ratios based on changes in 18s template concentration over the incubation period were calculated for each taxon and dead cell dna persistence through a 14 day incubation was verified to be 1 and did not influence the growth calculations in total 95 of 97 eukaryotic phytoplankton in the before culture sample demonstrated growth with definitive growth ratios ranging from 4 0 101 2 6 105 an additional 13 taxa demonstrated growth from non detect in before culture samples taxa based growability values were 87 88 in individual incubation conditions with no statistical differences among conditions and 98 for all conditions combined when growability was weighted by the before culture abundance of each taxa relevant to regulations based on all organisms regardless of taxa community based growability was 99 in each condition and in all conditions combined because the most abundant taxa all exhibited growth this study verifies that conventional phytoplankton mpn assays produce accurate results with low bias from undetected viable cells regardless of enrichments and incubation temperatures this work can provide regulatory confidence for broader acceptance of mpn assays without limitations graphical abstract image 1 keywords ballast water next generation sequencing viability methods invasive species most probable number mpn

the gold standard for evaluating the status of microorganisms emerson et al 2017 reproductive capacity is critical as it is necessary to for example cause infection in a host or successfully colonize

ballast water treatments mandated to control the spread of potentially harmful and invasive non native species blatchley et al 2018 cullen and macintyre 2016 regulations for ballast water management system bwms type approval testing are not harmonized for enumerating viable organisms in the regulated 10 50 μm size class the majority of which are phytoplankton the most probable number culture assay mpn is used in international maritime organization imo type approvals imo 2016 imo 2017 but has not been accepted for united states coast guard uscg type approvals coast guard maritime commons 2016 this is problematic for ultraviolet uv based bwmss because the existing uscg enumeration method a stain motility sm method etv 2010 is not appropriate for evaluating uv based bwmss designed to eliminate viable organisms imo 2017 the sm method does not measure the mechanism of uv disinfection damage of dna to prevent reproduction blatchley et al 2018 which results in 10 fold higher uv dose requirements than culture methods lundgreen et al 2018 the uscg has expressed concerns that organisms cannot be cultured reliably coast guardmaritime commons 2015 implying that mpns are inaccurate due to viable cells that do not grow to detection indeed in water treatment applications viable organisms that do not grow in culture assays represent a measurement bias that is not protective of public health or the environment cullen 2018 mpn assays do not classify each cell in a sample so any growth bias can only be assessed in a companion method one approach that has been used to estimate the growth bias for mpn on natural communities of phytoplankton is to make taxonomic assessments by microscopy on before culture bc and after culture ac samples reporting the percentage of taxa or the abundance weighted percentage of taxa that demonstrated growth the resulting growability values are the complement of the growth bias cullen 2018 the approach is straightforward in principle but laborious in practice which has limited the production of data encouragingly high values have been reported for subsets of mpn assays assessed for quality assurance madsen and petersen 2015 but rigorous values based on complete mpn arrays have not yet been published the approach of documenting bc and ac taxa can be improved using a modern assessment technology such as metabarcoding that is the use of polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of a marker dna fragment from environmental dna edna followed by massively parallel next generation sequencing ngs to identify organisms based on comparison to dna sequence databases pawlowski et al 2016 to address the need for more eukaryotic phytoplankton growability data a method was developed in this work using metabarcoding to create bc and ac taxonomy lists and quantitative real time pcr qrt pcr to classify each taxa as growing or not by determining whether each had increased or decreased in target sequence numbers ac relative to bc the focus was on eukaryotic phytoplankton as prokaryotic phytoplankton blue green algae will effectively be excluded from the regulated 10 50 μm size category this method was applied to measure growability in conventional mpn assays for bwms tests and also to test for differences in growability among different incubation conditions enrichment media temperature to inform on the factors that need to be standardized or not in mpn methods the method showed that growability was high and insensitive to the tested incubation conditions these results have significant implications not only for standardizing and validating mpn methods used in bwms testing but also for the determination of impacts of environmental stressors on phytoplankton ecology in nature 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and mpn methods this work used split samples collected from an mpn evaluation experiment performed by staff of the dhi ballastwater laboratory in hørsholm denmark the mpn experiment was to inform a panel formed under the environmental technology verification etv program in the united states to evaluate mpn as a method for measuring treatment performance of bwmss in type approval tests the experiment evaluated various aspects of mpn method performance for different incubation conditions enrichment media temperature the experiment was based on a 10 50 μm size fraction sample of untreated control water from a standard bwms test at the dhi maritime technology evaluation facility in hundested denmark originating from the kattegat north sea at an ambient water temperature of 10 c the sample was processed in general according to the dhi standard mpn method imo 2016 in 4 sets of mpns prepared with two different enrichment media and incubated at two different temperatures each in triplicate all media were prepared using 0 22 μm filter sterilized sample water with either guillard s f 2 guillard 1975 guillard and ryther 1962 or keller media keller et al 1987 as enrichments the two incubation temperatures were 20 c and 10 c these 4 experimental incubation conditions are referred to as g10 g20 k10 and k20 with g and k referring to guillard f 2 and keller enrichment media respectively and 10 and 20 referring to the incubation temperatures each mpn array consisted of 5 replicates at 3 dilutions 10 2 10 3 10 4 chosen to be able to asses viable phytoplankton concentrations at the expected target concentration of 1 000 cells ml and was incubated in constant light for 14 days growth was scored based on increases in chlorophyll autofluorescence from day 0 to day 14 monitored using a turner td 700 laboratory fluorometer at the end of the incubation the 5 replicates of each dilution in each of the 12 mpns were pooled for further post processing and archiving the chlorophyll scoring was used to calculate mpn values as per jarvis et al 2010 and both are given in table s1 for this work to evaluate mpn growability an 80 ml aliquot of the bc sample and 20 ml aliquots of 30 ml total of each of the 36 ac subsamples were used for the ac samples the within mpn aliquot subsamples were re combined to give 12 composite ac samples one for each of the 12 mpns when generated the 1 bc and 12 ac samples were filtered using 0 7 μm glass fiber filters and used for dna extractions 2 2 dna isolation dna extractions were performed according to the protocol described in chaganti et al 2012 in brief the filters were placed in 2 ml screw cap tubes with 400 μl of ddh2o 400 μg of 1 0 mm glass beads 400 μl cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab digestion buffer and 400 μl of phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 the samples were homogenized to break down cell structure using a thermo savant bio 101 fast prep homogenizer at the 4 5 speed setting for 2 min phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 13 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was transferred to another 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube and an equal volume of isopropanol was added and the sample was mixed by inversion and held at 21 c for 30 min dna was precipitated by centrifugation 12 000 g at 4 c for 15 min the precipitated dna pellet was washed twice with 70 ice cold ethanol and air dried before re suspension in 30 μl sterile milliq water 2 3 metabarcoding a two step pcr was performed on all dna samples targeting the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene forward 5 acctgcctgccggtacacaccgcccgtc3 and reverse 5 acgccaccgagctgatccttctgcaggttcacctac3 where a short 12 base 5 extension lower case base codes on the primer sequence was added as template for the second stage pcr the first step pcr was to amplify the targeted dna and the second step a short cycle pcr was designed to ligate identifying sequences barcodes and the required adaptor sequences for the ion torrent ngs library the thermocycling protocol for the first pcr of the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene consisted of an initial denaturing stage at 94 c for 2 min followed by 27 cycles of denaturing at 94 c for 15 s annealing at 55 c for 15 s elongation at 72 c for 30 s and a final elongation step at 72 c for 7 min followed by a hold at 4 c the second short cycle pcr to create the barcoded library consisted of an initial denaturing stage at 94 c for 2 min followed by 8 cycles of denaturing at 94 c for 15 s annealing at 60 c for 15 s elongation at 72 c for 30 s and a final elongation step at 72 c for 7 min followed by a hold at 4 c all barcoded pcr amplicons were pooled visualized and excised from an agarose gel then purified using a qiagen minelute gel extraction kit pooled pcr product was assessed for dna concentration and fragment size distribution using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer with a high sensitivity dna chip agilent technologies mississauga canada the samples were sequenced on a 318 microchip on an ion torrent personal genome machine pgm life technologies usa using 400 bp chemistry after sequencing sequence reads were filtered within the pgm software to remove polyclonal and low quality sequences sequences that matched the pgm 3 adaptor were trimmed to remove non informative sequence data 2 4 bioinformatic analyses raw sequences obtained from the ngs were quality filtered maxee 1 0 and truncated to 140 bp by excluding the primers and sequences exhibiting barcode mismatches primer mismatches and short or low quality reads were removed further data processing was performed using the uparse algorithm edgar 2013 following the default parameters chimeric sequences were removed using the uchime v4 2 method edgar et al 2011 operational taxonomic units otus were assigned with a 97 similarity threshold and otus represented only by either a single singleton or two doubleton sequences across all samples i e all bc and ac samples were excluded from the data prior to metabarcoding species assignment further qiime software v 1 8 caporaso et al 2012 was used to assign taxonomy to the representative sequence for each otu using blast at 80 sequence match at the lowest possible taxonomic level with the silva small subunit ssu reference database quast et al 2013 yilmaz et al 2014 the 18s small subunit primers selected for this rrna gene study were designed to amplify across a wide diversity of eukaryotes machida and knowlton 2012 however because the performance of mpn to grow phytoplankton was being measured which as applied is based on scoring of changes in chlorophyll autofluorescence the identified taxa were screened for phytoplankton taxa i e presence or absence of chlorophyll adl et al 2012 for a small number of taxa not enough taxonomic information was available to make a definitive assessment these were categorized as having chlorophyll but were sub categorized as having chlorophyll with high probability some stramenopile and one cryptophyte taxa both groups for which the majority of taxa are photosynthetic and some alveolate and dinoflagellate taxa of which approximately half the taxa are photosynthetic following taxonomic assignment otus assigned to taxa other than phytoplankton taxa with no chlorophyll unassigned reads and taxa of chlorophyll containing land plants embryophyta within archaeplastida that are probably present only as debris in near shore waters were removed from further analyses to assess whether the sequence read numbers approached full taxonomic characterization of the samples rarefaction curves were created using past software showing the relationship between the number of sequence reads and the number of recovered taxa for the bc and all replicates of the ac samples the goal of rarefaction is to determine if the relationship approaches an asymptote to ensure sufficient read depth has been achieved 2 5 quantitative real time pcr qrt pcr sequence read number data obtained from ngs are only semi quantitative and cannot be reliably compared across samples to make later growth determinations ngs sequence read numbers from bc and ac samples need to be normalized via qrt pcr the pcr template concentration was determined for all dna samples by amplifying the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene using the same primers as for the ngs library using sybr green qrt pcr the quantstudio 12k flex real time pcr system applied biosystems usa was used for qrt pcr with a volume of 20 μl and the power sybr green master mix warrington uk the reaction mixture consisted of 10 μl of 2 x sybr master mix solution 0 5 μl of 10 mm concentration each forward and reverse primer 1 μl of dna template and 8 μl milliq water the reaction protocol consisted of 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and annealing at 60 c for 1 min the pcr efficiency of the v9 region of the 18s rrna qrt pcr was estimated using the program linregpcr ramakers et al 2003 and amplicon efficiency threshold and cq values were obtained and used to calculate theoretical starting dna concentrations n0 per technical replicate in linregpcr ramakers et al 2003 using the unbiased method of tuomi et al 2010 technical replicates were averaged for each sample 2 6 growth calculations to determine whether a taxon demonstrated growth during the mpn incubation sequence read concentrations were determined and compared for bc and ac samples for each sample j the sequence read number for each taxa i nsi j was normalized using the total number of 18s v9 pcr template copies from qrt pcr n0 j and the volume of original sample processed for dna extraction vj to calculate the concentration of 18s v9 pcr template copies in each sample ci j c i j 1 v j n s i j i 1 m n s i j n 0 j the relevant volumes were 80 ml for the bc sample and 0 037 ml for each ac sample 5x0 01 5x0 001 5x0 0001 x 20 30 0 037 the taxon specific growth ratio in each ac sample ri acj was calculated by dividing the ac copy concentration by the bc copy concentration r i a c j c i a c j c i b c the mean ri for each condition was calculated by averaging non zero ri acj values for replicate samples of each condition taxa were scored as growers for ri 1 and as non growers for ri 1 in some cases a taxon was detected ac but not bc ci bc 0 these were also scored as growers but sub classified as new growers finally in some cases a taxon was detected bc but not ac ci acj 0 these were scored as non growers but sub classified as potential non growers because a lack of ac detection provides no numerical proof of non grower status and could be the result of detection limitations the growth scoring for each taxa at each condition was expressed as a dimensionless binary factor gi set to 1 for growers and new growers and to 0 for non growers and potential non growers when considering all conditions combined gi was set to 1 if a taxon had demonstrated growth in any of the conditions for each condition and all conditions combined taxa based growability gt was calculated as the percentage of taxa observed to grow g t i 1 m g i i m 100 where m is the total number of taxa observed in all ac and bc samples the community based growability gc was calculated as the bc abundance weighted percentage of species observed to grow g c i 1 m g i i c i b c i 1 m c i b c 100 2 7 time series qrt pcr of dead cells it is known that edna can include dna from dead cells e g cangelosi and meschke 2014 carini et al 2016 raising the possibility that ac detection may be of dead cell dna present in the original sample a time series qrt pcr test was conducted on heat killed phytoplankton to determine the persistence of dead cell dna a one liter water sample was collected from the detroit river windsor ontario canada and incubated for one week to amplify the number of phytoplankton for this test after which 10 aliquots of 50 ml were prepared all the aliquots were heat treated at 75 c for 15 min to kill the native phytoplankton two 50 ml aliquots were collected on each of days 0 1 5 11 and 14 and were filtered and edna extracted for qrt pcr of the v9 region of the 18s rrna following the same protocol as described for qrt pcr above to confirm the heat treated cells were dead 9 replicates of 0 2 ml from the untreated sample and 9 replicates of 0 2 ml from each 50 ml heat treated aliquot were placed in 96 well plates and incubated for 13 days at 20 c the plates were monitored for phytoplankton growth via chlorophyll auto fluorescence using a perkinelmer victor 3v plate reader with a 430 8 nm optical excitation filter and a 680 10 nm optical emission filter 3 results 3 1 metabarcoding after excluding the poor quality sequences 913 754 high quality sequences were obtained after assigning taxonomy to otu representative sequences using the silva small subunit database yilmaz et al 2014 299 unique accession numbers were assigned as taxa of these 86 taxa 29 of taxa 68 of sequences were classified as having chlorophyll for certain 24 taxa 8 of taxa negligible of sequences with high probability 8 taxa 3 of taxa negligible of sequences as certain but land plants 180 taxa 60 of taxa 24 of sequences as not having chlorophyll and one taxon 5 sequences was unassigned table 1 a for the purpose of measuring the growth performance of chlorophyll scored mpns for phytoplankton the analysis was restricted to the 110 taxa with certain or high probability of containing chlorophyll but not the land plants among samples the numbers of sequences were fairly evenly distributed with the exception of the k10 samples table 2 the combined total sequence counts for the three replicate ac samples for each incubation condition except k10 were similar and approximately twice the numbers in the bc sample although qrt pcr normalization had not yet been applied this signified significant growth occurred in these samples as each ac sample contained 1 2 162 the volume of the bc sample within each sample sequences associated with chlorophyll containing phytoplankton represented a high proportion of the total sample sequences table 2 the rarefaction plots showed moderately convergent curves for all but the replicates of the k10 sample fig 1 those convergent curves indicate that sufficient sequence coverage was achieved to characterize community diversity and that further sequencing would not likely increase the numbers of taxa substantially for k10 samples two replicates failed to sequence and the third was below the expected threshold for sequence read depth table 2 which was consistent with the observed poor qrt pcr amplification for the same samples and a lack of phytoplankton growth by chlorophyll autofluorescence in the mpn table s1 the k10 samples were reported to have fungal contamination during incubation and fungal taxa comprised 61 5 of the sequences in k10 samples compared to 2 0 0 8 in all other samples it was concluded that the k10 samples were atypical and were excluded from further analysis 3 2 bc community composition a total of 259 taxa were identified in the bc sample table 1b of which 97 were classified as putative phytoplankton taxa while the phytoplankton represented a minority of the detected taxa 37 they represented a majority of the sequences 84 among the phytoplankton taxa the most abundant groups were stramenopiles 59 of phytoplankton taxa 67 of phytoplankton sequences alveolates 21 of taxa 33 of sequences and archaeplastida 18 of taxa 1 of sequences the major phytoplankton taxa within the stramenopiles were diatoms and secondarily chrysophytes within the alveolates were dinoflagellates and within the archaeplastida were green algae although this analysis was based on phytoplankton the community composition of the non phytoplankton taxa is also reported here the most abundant non phytoplankton groups were opisthokonts 36 of non phytoplankton taxa 36 of non phytoplankton sequences alveolates 19 of taxa 30 of sequences rhizaria 15 of taxa 12 of sequences and stramenopiles 14 of taxa 19 of sequences the major non phytoplankton taxa within the opisthokonts were fungi and various flagellated protists within the rhizaria were cercozoans amoeboids within the alveolates were heterotrophic dinoflagellates and within the stramenopiles were filamentous protists labyrinthulomycetes and non photosynthetic chrysophytes among all the taxa the most abundant were a diatom thalassiosira spp 45 of sequences and a photosynthetic dinoflagellate karlodinium spp 26 of sequences and 5 diatoms 2 heterotrophic dinoflagellates 1 metazoan 1 labyrinthulomycetes and 1 fungus that each comprised 1 4 of sequences together these 12 taxa comprised 90 of the total sequences in the bc sample 3 3 phytoplankton growth assessments the mean growth ratio ri was calculated for each taxa in each condition to determine which phytoplankton grew from bc to ac ri 1 each taxa was classified as either a potential non grower ri 0 a non grower 0 ri 1 a grower ri 1 or a new grower ri undefined non growers were distinguished from potential non growers because the former had numerical confirmation of decline while the latter had zero ac detections which could alternatively be an artefact of method resolution for individual conditions there were 10 12 potential non growers of which only 2 were potential non growers when results from all conditions were combined fig 2 the two taxa not detected in the ac samples both had only 3 sequences in the bc sample so there is a high probability that being very rare those taxa were not transferred for mpn incubation no non growers were detected in any sample the remainder of the 97 taxa detected bc were growers in addition to these growers there were 13 taxa determined to be new growers taxa for which ri could not be calculated because bc detections were zero fig 2 growth was definitive with mean ri values within a condition ranging from 4 0 101 2 6 105 across taxa fig 3 a for each condition mean ri values for growers had a log normal distribution with 103 ri 104 for most taxa fig 3a in addition the mean ri values showed internal consistency in the ability to detect growth fig 3b as for each taxon mean ri values were well correlated between conditions k20 g20 r 0 75 g20 g10 r 0 74 g10 k20 r 0 81 3 4 effect of incubation conditions on phytoplankton taxa detections and growth there were no statistical differences in numbers of taxa that grew among the incubation conditions χ2 0 04 p 0 01 however there were differences in which taxa grew among incubation conditions fig 4 for the ac taxa 84 were common to all three incubation conditions 15 were common to two conditions and 9 were detected in only one condition however all taxa detected in only one ac condition had 3 or fewer sequences note all singletons and doubletons across all samples were excluded but rare sequences within samples were retained in the analysis this may indicate that differences in detected taxa among incubation conditions may relate to sequence read depth differences rather than differences in growth 3 5 edna degradation and detection the use of edna and metabarcoding to create bc and ac detection lists can lead to artefacts in growth calculations due to the measurement of dna from dead cells persisting in the ac samples to quantify the potential for this artefact in the analyses a time series qrt pcr was conducted with heat treated phytoplankton chlorophyll autofluorescence measurements in untreated and heat treated samples over time confirmed that the heat treated cells were dead or non viable fig s1 the qrt pcr results showed an exponential decline in 18s v9 template concentration over time with 95 dna degraded after 11 days and 99 dna degraded after 13 days fig 5 with 1 dead cell dna persistence in a 14 day mpn incubation and a 2 162 fold difference in bc and ac sample volumes there would need to be 216 000 dead cell dna sequences in a bc sample to detect 1 sequence ac much higher than the sequence counts for any taxa in the bc sample as a result dead cell dna carry over is not likely affecting the growth assessments 3 6 growability in mpn assays taxon specific growability gt was calculated which included rare taxa only detected ac after increasing through the incubation new growers gt values were high for each condition 87 88 and for all conditions combined 98 table 3 community specific growability gc was also calculated which did not include new growers because they did not contribute to the bc community weighting the bc sequence counts were used to determine the relative bc abundance for each taxon albeit with caution because the most abundant taxa were determined to be growers and conversely because the taxa not determined to be growers were rare gc values were very high for all conditions 99 94 99 97 and for all conditions combined 99 99 though the calculations do not warrant four significant figures they are necessary to show that values were not 100 some rare taxa scored as potential non growers the phytoplankton community was dominated by two taxa a diatom thalassiosira spp and a dinoflagellate karlodinium spp with 53 and 31 of the abundance respectively the next six most abundant phytoplankton taxa each contributed 1 3 of the abundance of the community together these 8 most abundant phytoplankters comprised 95 of the phytoplankton community and all were growers the remaining phytoplankters each had 1 of the phytoplankton abundance and of these only 2 were not growers 4 discussion 4 1 measurements of growability in the field of ballast water treatment there is a need for information about the reliability of culture based methods for enumerating viable organisms cullen 2018 developed a framework for validating organism status methods identifying detection factors as key method performance factors because their complement false negatives correspond to invasion risk from living or viable organisms undetected in an assay of a treatment for mpn assays the detection factor is the property of growability which can be determined by creating bc and ac taxa lists data generation using microscopic assessment has been constrained by logistic limitations due to the requirement for skilled taxonomists counting limits and sample preservation trade offs preservatives can destroy some taxa but the examination of fresh samples is not always possible in this work a method for measuring growability of eukaryotic phytoplankton was developed that can alleviate these constraints using modern molecular genetic tools metabarcoding for taxonomic assessments and qrt pcr to quantitatively compare ac and bc samples for accurate growth determinations the advent of ngs platforms that are reliable and affordable shendure and ji 2008 has led to the use of metabarcoding to assess species composition in many fields national research council 2007 and for diverse biological communities using edna neelakanta and sultana 2013 revealing remarkable diversity metabarcoding was used here for eukaryotic phytoplankton to assess conventional mpn assays scored by chlorophyll autofluorescence though this method could be applied to all protists with appropriate pcr primers this method offers improvements over microscopic taxonomic assessment by alleviating the logistic limits noted above based on the fact that dna preservatives allow for reliable sample archiving for later assessment in addition the taxonomic identification is based on 18s sequences hence results are comparable across sample times and sites by using common metabarcoding databases and assignment protocols there is considerable controversy over the culturability of phytoplankton among other microorganisms with some stating that most taxa cannot be cultured first and drake 2013 but with mpn practitioners reporting that many taxa do grow madsen and petersen 2015 the paradox is resolved by understanding that growability refers to a short term growth requirement that can be broadly successful and culturability refers to a more rigorous requirement of isolation and perpetual maintenance cullen 2018 cullen and macintyre 2016 growability is the relevant property to determine growth bias in mpn assays and measurements of growability in this work were high growth bias was low taxa based growability was 87 88 for individual conditions and 98 for multiple conditions combined these high growability values are consistent with the concept that every sample has by design the perfect media because it is prepared with filter sterilized water from the same source and should thus have all required compounds for survival and short term growth this is in keeping with the explanations of high expected growability by cullen and macintyre 2016 the observations of high growability but not culturability in similar applications by throndsen 1978 and the reports of high growability in these exact applications madsen and petersen 2015 these results are also consistent with work in other fields kaeberlein et al 2002 showed that the growability of marine bacteria could be greatly improved by incubating with sample water rather than defined media and metabarcoding of edna has been widely used to characterise the ac composition of complex microorganism communities that were previously considered essentially unculturable browne et al 2016 lagier et al 2016 it follows that different enrichment media should not impact growability which is what was found in this work similarly growability was not impacted by different incubation temperatures also as expected this simplifies the standardization of mpn assays where the key features to standardize are the use of filter sterilized sample water as the base for enrichment media and incubation in a near ambient temperature range in fact practices at bwms test facilities are standardized based on these features imo 2016 differences in patterns of growing taxa among incubation conditions were likely due to heterogeneous sampling of rare taxa which is enabled by the high resolution of the ngs method in fact for the 9 cases of taxa detected in only one ac condition fig 3 5 cases had a single sequence read and all cases had 3 or fewer ac sequence reads the growability of taxa under all incubation conditions combined provides strong physiological evidence of the ability for those taxa to grow in some incubation condition as opposed to being unculturable the high community based growability values are a reflection that all of the abundant taxa grew community based results are the relevant ones for evaluating methods used in ballast water treatment regulations because the regulations are not based on taxa but on numbers of individuals within size classes community based results are also the most reliable because the high numbers of detected sequences provide the most reliable growth scoring calculations and new growers which are rare taxa do not contribute to the outcome the growability of high abundance taxa is perhaps expected as these taxa are abundant because they were successfully reproducing in the environmental conditions which were replicated in the laboratory finally the similarity of growability values between incubation conditions was consistent with the enumerations produced by the mpns which were themselves being evaluated as the mean mpn responses between conditions were also not statistically different table s1 anova p 0 218 4 2 method reliability and resolution these analyses were designed to be robust all singletons and doubletons were removed and strict sequence quality filtering was applied thus all of the sequences retained in the analyses were meaningful the rarefaction curves showed good sequence read depth for the characterization of the communities consistent with the detections of rare taxa dna decay rates were measured in heat killed cells which ruled out the possibility of artefacts in ac detections originating from dead cells in the bc sample the use of qrt pcr allowed bc and ac detections to be compared to make quantitative growth determinations though the quantification of sequences at two time points bc and ac does not allow the calculation of true growth rates during incubation the growth ratios ri were still high and allowed definitive growth scoring finally the growth ratios could be biased by changes in the copy number of the 18s rdna genes during the 14 day incubation period however while 18s copy number is known to vary among eukaryotes prokopowich et al 2003 there is no expectation that the mean copy number would vary within a taxa over time especially over an incubation period of 14 days for some taxa there was uncertainty in growth scoring when a taxon was detected bc but not ac it was subcategorised as a potential non grower and when a taxon was detected ac but not bc it was classified as a new grower with unknown growth ratio resolution can be improved by obtaining more sequences for the analysis either by applying more sequencing effort or by increasing the volume of original sample processed increasing the number of ac sequence reads will help resolve taxa categorised as potential non growers zero ac detections into definitive grower or non grower categories increasing the number of bc sequence reads will help resolve new growers zero bc detections into growers with a defined ri assuming the same qrt pcr values across samples the resolution is determined by the ratio of volumes of original sample processed in bc and ac samples vac vbc the nature of mpn arrays leads to a low vac vbc ratio in this work 80 ml of bc sample were processed and though ac samples were 60 ml composites of 5 replicates at each of 3 dilutions the amount of original sample was only 0 037 ml resulting in vac vbc 1 2 162 thus taxa in potential non grower and new grower categories had ri 2 162 and ri 2 162 respectively it is unfortunate that the experimental design suffered from the probable contamination of k10 samples but it was useful as a negative control for growth detection showing that the method would generate appropriate negative growth outcomes this condition was excluded from comparative analyses because it was atypical and would give false causality for growability differences from different incubation conditions even if the k10 condition were the cause of the lack of growth it would not negate the results for growable taxa across all media combined but it was unlikely to be the cause as broad community growth was measured both for samples with the same enrichment media at a different temperature and for samples at the same temperature with a different enrichment media and the likelihood that some interaction effect resulted in a lack of growth is low these types of contamination events are rare in mpn assays 4 3 implications for method validation for validating methods used to measure treatment performance e g mpn and sm methods for measuring bwms treatments one of the most important metrics is the method detection factor the complement of the false negative rate as it is measurement bias that represents an invasion risk from living organisms not detected by an assay cullen 2018 the method developed in this work was used to make detection factor estimates growability for validating phytoplankton mpn assays even though measured growability values were high it is important to recognize that they are worst case values for phytoplankton in natural samples their status is not known a priori this method classifies taxa as non growers growers and new growers with certainty because of measured increases or decreases in pcr template concentrations however the distinction of potential non growers is an important one because although they are counted as non growers their true status is unknown the absence of ac detections could be because the organisms were alive but not capable of growth or they were dead in the original sample or growth may have been undetected with the method resolution for these three possibilities classifying taxa as non growers would give accurate worst case and worst case growability values respectively this work was compared to the only other published validation of a bwms assay for organisms in the 10 50 μm size category steinberg et al 2011 reported low false negative rates of 1 2 for the sm method however for the complementary detection factors 98 99 to be comparable to the detection factor values in this work growability the same classifying criteria must be applied steinberg et al 2011 assumed that organisms not staining and not motile were dead and eliminated them from the counts however their status was unknown and they could have been alive for example live but non staining and non motile diatoms such as amphiprora spp macintyre and cullen 2016 would fall into this category and be mis classified these organisms are potential false negatives in the sm assay analogous to organisms in the potential non grower category in this work which were ultimately counted as non growers when adjusted to be comparable the sm detection factor values for steinberg et al 2011 decline to 74 90 higher detection factors lower bias for mpn than sm is consistent with the results of molina et al 2016 who reported higher concentrations of live cells measured by mpn than sm in all comparative samples and with other comparative data blatchley et al 2018 cullen 2018 wright and welschmeyer 2015 where higher concentrations by mpn than sm were reported in a majority of samples 5 conclusion a reliable method for measuring growability was developed and used to measure the performance of phytoplankton mpn assays used in bwms testing the high 99 community growability measurements verify that most phytoplankton grow to detection in mpn assays even if many have not yet been brought into permanent culture this in turn verifies that mpn assays produce accurate and unbiased results the consistently high growability values for different enrichments and temperatures supports the conclusion that successful growth occurs because the media base is filter sterilized sample water containing all necessary compounds which provides a simple and elegant basis to standardize mpn assays this work can provide regulatory confidence for broader acceptance of mpn assays without limitations which will harmonize the sizing of uv based

18551,the most probable number dilution culture assay mpn is used to enumerate viable phytoplankton in regulatory tests of ballast water treatment systems however the united states coast guard has not yet accepted mpn in part due to concerns of biased results due to cells being viable but not growing mpn does not assess the fate of every cell and thus the bias can only be evaluated by a companion method that assesses the ability of the various taxa to grow this growth ability growability is the complement of the bias and has been evaluated by microscopic taxonomy of before culture and after culture samples however microscopic taxonomy is extremely laborious and few data have been produced for phytoplankton growability in mpn assays to address the need for more and more reliable growability data a method was developed using next generation sequencing ngs and quantitative real time pcr qrt pcr techniques that target the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene for the taxonomic identification and growth assessment of eukaryotic phytoplankton respectively this growability method was applied to mpn samples from a ballast water management system test that were incubated with two different enrichment media at two different temperatures dna was extracted from filters of before culture and after culture samples and assessed for taxonomy by ngs and for pcr template dna concentration by qrt pcr growth ratios based on changes in 18s template concentration over the incubation period were calculated for each taxon and dead cell dna persistence through a 14 day incubation was verified to be 1 and did not influence the growth calculations in total 95 of 97 eukaryotic phytoplankton in the before culture sample demonstrated growth with definitive growth ratios ranging from 4 0 101 2 6 105 an additional 13 taxa demonstrated growth from non detect in before culture samples taxa based growability values were 87 88 in individual incubation conditions with no statistical differences among conditions and 98 for all conditions combined when growability was weighted by the before culture abundance of each taxa relevant to regulations based on all organisms regardless of taxa community based growability was 99 in each condition and in all conditions combined because the most abundant taxa all exhibited growth this study verifies that conventional phytoplankton mpn assays produce accurate results with low bias from undetected viable cells regardless of enrichments and incubation temperatures this work can provide regulatory confidence for

ballast water treatments mandated to control the spread of potentially harmful and invasive non native species blatchley et al 2018 cullen and macintyre 2016 regulations for ballast water management

requirements than culture methods lundgreen et al 2018 the uscg has expressed concerns that organisms cannot be cultured reliably coast guardmaritime commons 2015 implying that mpns are inaccurate due to viable cells that do not grow to detection indeed in water treatment applications viable organisms that do not grow in culture assays represent a measurement bias that is not protective of public health or the environment cullen 2018 mpn assays do not classify each cell in a sample so any growth bias can only be assessed in a companion method one approach that has been used to estimate the growth bias for mpn on natural communities of phytoplankton is to make taxonomic assessments by microscopy on before culture bc and after culture ac samples reporting the percentage of taxa or the abundance weighted percentage of taxa that demonstrated growth the resulting growability values are the complement of the growth bias cullen 2018 the approach is straightforward in principle but laborious in practice which has limited the production of data encouragingly high values have been reported for subsets of mpn assays assessed for quality assurance madsen and petersen 2015 but rigorous values based on complete mpn arrays have not yet been published the approach of documenting bc and ac taxa can be improved using a modern assessment technology such as metabarcoding that is the use of polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of a marker dna fragment from environmental dna edna followed by massively parallel next generation sequencing ngs to identify organisms based on comparison to dna sequence databases pawlowski et al 2016 to address the need for more eukaryotic phytoplankton growability data a method was developed in this work using metabarcoding to create bc and ac taxonomy lists and quantitative real time pcr qrt pcr to classify each taxa as growing or not by determining whether each had increased or decreased in target sequence numbers ac relative to bc the focus was on eukaryotic phytoplankton as prokaryotic phytoplankton blue green algae will effectively be excluded from the regulated 10 50 μm size category this method was applied to measure growability in conventional mpn assays for bwms tests and also to test for differences in growability among different incubation conditions enrichment media temperature to inform on the factors that need to be standardized or not in mpn methods the method showed that growability was high and insensitive to the tested incubation conditions these results have significant implications not only for standardizing and validating mpn methods used in bwms testing but also for the determination of impacts of environmental stressors on phytoplankton ecology in nature 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and mpn methods this work used split samples collected from an mpn evaluation experiment performed by staff of the dhi ballastwater laboratory in hørsholm denmark the mpn experiment was to inform a panel formed under the environmental technology verification etv program in the united states to evaluate mpn as a method for measuring treatment performance of bwmss in type approval tests the experiment evaluated various aspects of mpn method performance for different incubation conditions enrichment media temperature the experiment was based on a 10 50 μm size fraction sample of untreated control water from a standard bwms test at the dhi maritime technology evaluation facility in hundested denmark originating from the kattegat north sea at an ambient water temperature of 10 c the sample was processed in general according to the dhi standard mpn method imo 2016 in 4 sets of mpns prepared with two different enrichment media and incubated at two different temperatures each in triplicate all media were prepared using 0 22 μm filter sterilized sample water with either guillard s f 2 guillard 1975 guillard and ryther 1962 or keller media keller et al 1987 as enrichments the two incubation temperatures were 20 c and 10 c these 4 experimental incubation conditions are referred to as g10 g20 k10 and k20 with g and k referring to guillard f 2 and keller enrichment media respectively and 10 and 20 referring to the incubation temperatures each mpn array consisted of 5 replicates at 3 dilutions 10 2 10 3 10 4 chosen to be able to asses viable phytoplankton concentrations at the expected target concentration of 1 000 cells ml and was incubated in constant light for 14 days growth was scored based on increases in chlorophyll autofluorescence from day 0 to day 14 monitored using a turner td 700 laboratory fluorometer at the end of the incubation the 5 replicates of each dilution in each of the 12 mpns were pooled for further post processing and archiving the chlorophyll scoring was used to calculate mpn values as per jarvis et al 2010 and both are given in table s1 for this work to evaluate mpn growability an 80 ml aliquot of the bc sample and 20 ml aliquots of 30 ml total of each of the 36 ac subsamples were used for the ac samples the within mpn aliquot subsamples were re combined to give 12 composite ac samples one for each of the 12 mpns when generated the 1 bc and 12 ac samples were filtered using 0 7 μm glass fiber filters and used for dna extractions 2 2 dna isolation dna extractions were performed according to the protocol described in chaganti et al 2012 in brief the filters were placed in 2 ml screw cap tubes with 400 μl of ddh2o 400 μg of 1 0 mm glass beads 400 μl cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab digestion buffer and 400 μl of phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 the samples were homogenized to break down cell structure using a thermo savant bio 101 fast prep homogenizer at the 4 5 speed setting for 2 min phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 13 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the supernatant was transferred to another 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube and an equal volume of isopropanol was added and the sample was mixed by inversion and held at 21 c for 30 min dna was precipitated by centrifugation 12 000 g at 4 c for 15 min the precipitated dna pellet was washed twice with 70 ice cold ethanol and air dried before re suspension in 30 μl sterile milliq water 2 3 metabarcoding a two step pcr was performed on all dna samples targeting the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene forward 5 acctgcctgccggtacacaccgcccgtc3 and reverse 5 acgccaccgagctgatccttctgcaggttcacctac3 where a short 12 base 5 extension lower case base codes on the primer sequence was added as template for the second stage pcr the first step pcr was to amplify the targeted dna and the second step a short cycle pcr was designed to ligate identifying sequences barcodes and the required adaptor sequences for the ion torrent ngs library the thermocycling protocol for the first pcr of the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene consisted of an initial denaturing stage at 94 c for 2 min followed by 27 cycles of denaturing at 94 c for 15 s annealing at 55 c for 15 s elongation at 72 c for 30 s and a final elongation step at 72 c for 7 min followed by a hold at 4 c the second short cycle pcr to create the barcoded library consisted of an initial denaturing stage at 94 c for 2 min followed by 8 cycles of denaturing at 94 c for 15 s annealing at 60 c for 15 s elongation at 72 c for 30 s and a final elongation step at 72 c for 7 min followed by a hold at 4 c all barcoded pcr amplicons were pooled visualized and excised from an agarose gel then purified using a qiagen minelute gel extraction kit pooled pcr product was assessed for dna concentration and fragment size distribution using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer with a high sensitivity dna chip agilent technologies mississauga canada the samples were sequenced on a 318 microchip on an ion torrent personal genome machine pgm life technologies usa using 400 bp chemistry after sequencing sequence reads were filtered within the pgm software to remove polyclonal and low quality sequences sequences that matched the pgm 3 adaptor were trimmed to remove non informative sequence data 2 4 bioinformatic analyses raw sequences obtained from the ngs were quality filtered maxee 1 0 and truncated to 140 bp by excluding the primers and sequences exhibiting barcode mismatches primer mismatches and short or low quality reads were removed further data processing was performed using the uparse algorithm edgar 2013 following the default parameters chimeric sequences were removed using the uchime v4 2 method edgar et al 2011 operational taxonomic units otus were assigned with a 97 similarity threshold and otus represented only by either a single singleton or two doubleton sequences across all samples i e all bc and ac samples were excluded from the data prior to metabarcoding species assignment further qiime software v 1 8 caporaso et al 2012 was used to assign taxonomy to the representative sequence for each otu using blast at 80 sequence match at the lowest possible taxonomic level with the silva small subunit ssu reference database quast et al 2013 yilmaz et al 2014 the 18s small subunit primers selected for this rrna gene study were designed to amplify across a wide diversity of eukaryotes machida and knowlton 2012 however because the performance of mpn to grow phytoplankton was being measured which as applied is based on scoring of changes in chlorophyll autofluorescence the identified taxa were screened for phytoplankton taxa i e presence or absence of chlorophyll adl et al 2012 for a small number of taxa not enough taxonomic information was available to make a definitive assessment these were categorized as having chlorophyll but were sub categorized as having chlorophyll with high probability some stramenopile and one cryptophyte taxa both groups for which the majority of taxa are photosynthetic and some alveolate and dinoflagellate taxa of which approximately half the taxa are photosynthetic following taxonomic assignment otus assigned to taxa other than phytoplankton taxa with no chlorophyll unassigned reads and taxa of chlorophyll containing land plants embryophyta within archaeplastida that are probably present only as debris in near shore waters were removed from further analyses to assess whether the sequence read numbers approached full taxonomic characterization of the samples rarefaction curves were created using past software showing the relationship between the number of sequence reads and the number of recovered taxa for the bc and all replicates of the ac samples the goal of rarefaction is to determine if the relationship approaches an asymptote to ensure sufficient read depth has been achieved 2 5 quantitative real time pcr qrt pcr sequence read number data obtained from ngs are only semi quantitative and cannot be reliably compared across samples to make later growth determinations ngs sequence read numbers from bc and ac samples need to be normalized via qrt pcr the pcr template concentration was determined for all dna samples by amplifying the v9 region of the 18s rrna gene using the same primers as for the ngs library using sybr green qrt pcr the quantstudio 12k flex real time pcr system applied biosystems usa was used for qrt pcr with a volume of 20 μl and the power sybr green master mix warrington uk the reaction mixture consisted of 10 μl of 2 x sybr master mix solution 0 5 μl of 10 mm concentration each forward and reverse primer 1 μl of dna template and 8 μl milliq water the reaction protocol consisted of 95 c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and annealing at 60 c for 1 min the pcr efficiency of the v9 region of the 18s rrna qrt pcr was estimated using the program linregpcr ramakers et al 2003 and amplicon efficiency threshold and cq values were obtained and used to calculate theoretical starting dna concentrations n0 per technical replicate in linregpcr ramakers et al 2003 using the unbiased method of tuomi et al 2010 technical replicates were averaged for each sample 2 6 growth calculations to determine whether a taxon demonstrated growth during the mpn incubation sequence read concentrations were determined and compared for bc and ac samples for each sample j the sequence read number for each taxa i nsi j was normalized using the total number of 18s v9 pcr template copies from qrt pcr n0 j and the volume of original sample processed for dna extraction vj to calculate the concentration of 18s v9 pcr template copies in each sample ci j c i j 1 v j n s i j i 1 m n s i j n 0 j the relevant volumes were 80 ml for the bc sample and 0 037 ml for each ac sample 5x0 01 5x0 001 5x0 0001 x 20 30 0 037 the taxon specific growth ratio in each ac sample ri acj was calculated by dividing the ac copy concentration by the bc copy concentration r i a c j c i a c j c i b c the mean ri for each condition was calculated by averaging non zero ri acj values for replicate samples of each condition taxa were scored as growers for ri 1 and as non growers for ri 1 in some cases a taxon was detected ac but not bc ci bc 0 these were also scored as growers but sub classified as new growers finally in some cases a taxon was detected bc but not ac ci acj 0 these were scored as non growers but sub classified as potential non growers because a lack of ac detection provides no numerical proof of non grower status and could be the result of detection limitations the growth scoring for each taxa at each condition was expressed as a dimensionless binary factor gi set to 1 for growers and new growers and to 0 for non growers and potential non growers when considering all conditions combined gi was set to 1 if a taxon had demonstrated growth in any of the conditions for each condition and all conditions combined taxa based growability gt was calculated as the percentage of taxa observed to grow g t i 1 m g i i m 100 where m is the total number of taxa observed in all ac and bc samples the community based

can include dna from dead cells e g cangelosi and meschke 2014 carini et al 2016 raising the possibility that ac detection may be of dead cell dna present in the original sample a time series qrt pcr test was conducted on heat killed phytoplankton to determine the persistence of dead cell dna a one liter water sample was collected from the detroit river windsor ontario canada and incubated for one week to amplify the number of phytoplankton for this test after which 10 aliquots of 50 ml were prepared all the aliquots were heat treated at 75 c for 15 min to kill the native phytoplankton two 50 ml aliquots were collected on each of days 0 1 5 11 and 14 and were filtered and edna extracted for qrt pcr of the v9 region of the 18s rrna following the same protocol as described for qrt pcr above to confirm the heat treated cells were dead 9 replicates of 0 2 ml from the untreated sample and 9 replicates of 0 2 ml from each 50 ml heat treated aliquot were placed in 96 well plates and incubated for 13 days at 20 c the plates were monitored for phytoplankton growth via chlorophyll auto fluorescence using a perkinelmer victor 3v plate reader with a 430 8 nm optical excitation filter and a 680 10 nm optical emission filter 3 results 3 1 metabarcoding after excluding the poor quality sequences 913 754 high quality sequences were obtained after assigning taxonomy to otu representative sequences using the silva small subunit database yilmaz et al 2014 299 unique accession numbers were assigned as taxa of these 86 taxa 29 of taxa 68 of sequences were classified as having chlorophyll for certain 24 taxa 8 of taxa negligible of sequences with high probability 8 taxa 3 of taxa negligible of sequences as certain but land plants 180 taxa 60 of taxa 24 of sequences as not having chlorophyll and one taxon 5 sequences was unassigned table 1 a for the purpose of measuring the growth performance of chlorophyll scored mpns for phytoplankton the analysis was restricted to the 110 taxa with certain or high probability of containing chlorophyll but not the land plants among samples the numbers of sequences were fairly evenly distributed with the exception of the k10 samples table 2 the combined total sequence counts for the three replicate ac samples for each incubation condition except k10 were similar and approximately twice the numbers in the bc sample although qrt pcr normalization had not yet been applied this signified significant growth occurred in these samples as each ac sample contained 1 2 162 the volume of the bc sample within each sample sequences associated with chlorophyll containing phytoplankton represented a high proportion of the total sample sequences table 2 the rarefaction plots showed moderately convergent curves for all but the replicates of the k10 sample fig 1 those convergent curves indicate that sufficient sequence coverage was achieved to characterize community diversity and that further sequencing would not likely increase the numbers of taxa substantially for k10 samples two replicates failed to sequence and the third was below the expected threshold for sequence read depth table 2 which was consistent with the observed poor qrt pcr amplification for the same samples and a lack of phytoplankton growth by chlorophyll autofluorescence in the mpn table s1 the k10 samples were reported to have fungal contamination during incubation and fungal taxa comprised 61 5 of the sequences in k10 samples compared to 2 0 0 8 in all other samples it was concluded that the k10 samples were atypical and were excluded from further analysis 3 2 bc community composition a total of 259 taxa were identified in the bc sample table 1b of which 97 were classified as putative phytoplankton taxa while the phytoplankton represented a minority of the detected taxa 37 they represented a majority of the sequences 84 among the phytoplankton taxa the most abundant groups were stramenopiles 59 of phytoplankton taxa 67 of phytoplankton sequences alveolates 21 of taxa 33 of sequences and archaeplastida 18 of taxa 1 of sequences the major phytoplankton taxa within the stramenopiles were diatoms and secondarily chrysophytes within the alveolates were dinoflagellates and within the archaeplastida were green algae although this analysis was based on phytoplankton the community composition of the non phytoplankton taxa is also reported here the most abundant non phytoplankton groups were opisthokonts 36 of non phytoplankton taxa 36 of non phytoplankton sequences alveolates 19 of taxa 30 of sequences rhizaria 15 of taxa 12 of sequences and stramenopiles 14 of taxa 19 of sequences the major non phytoplankton taxa within the opisthokonts were fungi and various flagellated protists within the rhizaria were cercozoans amoeboids within the alveolates were heterotrophic dinoflagellates and within the stramenopiles were filamentous protists labyrinthulomycetes and non photosynthetic chrysophytes among all the taxa the most abundant were a diatom thalassiosira spp 45 of sequences and a photosynthetic dinoflagellate karlodinium spp 26 of sequences and 5 diatoms 2 heterotrophic dinoflagellates 1 metazoan 1 labyrinthulomycetes and 1 fungus that each comprised 1 4 of sequences together these 12 taxa comprised 90 of the total sequences in the bc sample 3 3 phytoplankton growth assessments the mean growth ratio ri was calculated for each taxa in each condition to determine which phytoplankton grew from bc to ac ri 1 each taxa was classified as either a potential non grower ri 0 a non grower 0 ri 1 a grower ri 1 or a new grower ri undefined non growers were distinguished from potential non growers because the former had numerical confirmation of decline while the latter had zero ac detections which could alternatively be an artefact of method resolution for individual conditions there were 10 12 potential non growers of which only 2 were potential non growers when results from all conditions were combined fig 2 the two taxa not detected in the ac samples both had only 3 sequences in the bc sample so there is a high probability that being very rare those taxa were not transferred for mpn incubation no non growers were detected in any sample the remainder of the 97 taxa detected bc were growers in addition to these growers there were 13 taxa determined to be new growers taxa for which ri could not be calculated because bc detections were zero fig 2 growth was definitive with mean ri values within a condition ranging from 4 0 101 2 6 105 across taxa fig 3 a for each condition mean ri values for growers had a log normal distribution with 103 ri 104 for most taxa fig 3a in addition the mean ri values showed internal consistency in the ability to detect growth fig 3b as for each taxon mean ri values were well correlated between conditions k20 g20 r 0 75 g20 g10 r 0 74 g10 k20 r 0 81 3 4 effect of incubation conditions on phytoplankton taxa detections and growth there were no statistical differences in numbers of taxa that grew among the incubation conditions χ2 0 04 p 0 01 however there were differences in which taxa grew among incubation conditions fig 4 for the ac taxa 84 were common to all three incubation conditions 15 were common to two conditions and 9 were detected in only one condition however all taxa detected in only one ac condition had 3 or fewer sequences note all singletons and doubletons across all samples were excluded but rare sequences within samples were retained in the analysis this may indicate that differences in detected taxa among incubation conditions may relate to sequence read depth differences rather than differences in growth 3 5 edna degradation and detection the use of edna and metabarcoding to create bc and ac detection lists can lead to artefacts in growth calculations due to the measurement of dna from dead cells persisting in the ac samples to quantify the potential for this artefact in the analyses a time series qrt pcr was conducted with heat treated phytoplankton chlorophyll autofluorescence measurements in untreated and heat treated samples over time confirmed that the heat treated cells were dead or non viable fig s1 the qrt pcr results showed an exponential decline in 18s v9 template concentration over time with 95 dna degraded after 11 days and 99 dna degraded after 13 days fig 5 with 1 dead cell dna persistence in a 14 day mpn incubation and a 2 162 fold difference in bc and ac sample volumes there would need to be 216 000 dead cell dna sequences in a bc sample to detect 1 sequence ac much higher than the sequence counts for any taxa in the bc sample as a result dead cell dna carry over is not likely affecting the growth assessments 3 6 growability in mpn assays taxon specific growability gt was calculated which included rare taxa only detected ac after increasing through the incubation new growers gt values were high for each condition 87 88 and for all conditions combined 98 table 3 community specific growability gc was also calculated which did not include new growers because they did not contribute to the bc community weighting the bc sequence counts were used to determine the relative bc abundance for each taxon albeit with caution because the most abundant taxa were determined to be growers and conversely because the taxa not determined to be growers were rare gc values were very high for all conditions 99 94 99 97 and for all conditions combined 99 99 though the calculations do not warrant four significant figures they are necessary to show that values were not 100 some rare taxa scored as potential non growers the phytoplankton community was dominated by two taxa a diatom thalassiosira spp and a dinoflagellate karlodinium spp with 53 and 31 of the abundance respectively the next six most abundant phytoplankton taxa each contributed 1 3 of the abundance of the community together these 8 most abundant phytoplankters comprised 95 of the phytoplankton community and all were growers the remaining phytoplankters each had 1 of the phytoplankton abundance and of these only 2 were not growers 4 discussion 4 1 measurements of growability in the field of ballast water treatment there is a need for information about the reliability of culture based methods for enumerating viable organisms cullen 2018 developed a framework for validating organism status methods identifying detection factors as key method performance factors because their complement false negatives correspond to invasion risk from living or viable organisms undetected in an assay of a treatment for mpn assays the detection factor is the property of growability which can be determined by creating bc and ac taxa lists data generation using microscopic assessment has been constrained by logistic limitations due to the requirement for skilled taxonomists counting limits and sample preservation trade offs preservatives can destroy some taxa but the examination of fresh samples is not always possible in this work a method for measuring growability of eukaryotic phytoplankton was developed that can alleviate these constraints using modern molecular genetic tools metabarcoding for taxonomic assessments and qrt pcr to quantitatively compare ac and bc samples for accurate growth determinations the advent of ngs platforms that are reliable and affordable shendure and ji 2008 has led to the use of metabarcoding to assess species composition in many fields national research council 2007 and for diverse biological communities using edna neelakanta and sultana 2013 revealing remarkable diversity metabarcoding was used here for eukaryotic phytoplankton to assess conventional mpn assays scored by chlorophyll autofluorescence though this method could be applied to all protists with appropriate pcr primers this method offers improvements over microscopic taxonomic assessment by alleviating the logistic limits noted above based on the fact that dna preservatives allow for reliable sample archiving for later assessment in addition the taxonomic identification is based on 18s sequences hence results are comparable across sample times and sites by using common metabarcoding databases and assignment protocols there is considerable controversy over the culturability of phytoplankton among other microorganisms with some stating that most taxa cannot be cultured first and drake 2013 but with mpn practitioners reporting that many taxa do grow madsen and petersen 2015 the paradox is resolved by understanding that growability refers to a short term growth requirement that can be broadly successful and culturability refers to a more rigorous requirement of isolation and perpetual maintenance cullen 2018 cullen and macintyre 2016 growability is the relevant property to determine growth bias in mpn assays and measurements of growability in this work were high growth bias was low taxa based growability was 87 88 for individual conditions and 98 for multiple conditions combined these high growability values are consistent with the concept that every sample has by design the perfect media because it is prepared with filter sterilized water from the same source and should thus have all required compounds for survival and short term growth this is in keeping with the explanations of high expected growability by cullen and macintyre 2016 the observations of high growability but not culturability in similar applications by throndsen 1978 and the reports of high growability in these exact applications madsen and petersen 2015 these results are also consistent with work in other fields kaeberlein et al 2002 showed that the growability of marine bacteria could be greatly improved by incubating with sample water rather than defined media and metabarcoding of edna has been widely used to characterise the ac composition of complex microorganism communities that were previously considered essentially unculturable browne et al 2016 lagier et al 2016 it follows that different enrichment media should not impact growability which is what was found in this work similarly growability was not impacted by different incubation temperatures also as expected this simplifies the standardization of mpn assays where the key features to standardize are the use of filter sterilized sample water as the base for enrichment media and incubation in a near ambient temperature range in fact practices at bwms test facilities are standardized based on these features imo 2016 differences in patterns of growing taxa among incubation conditions were likely due to heterogeneous sampling of rare taxa which is enabled by the high resolution of the ngs method in fact for the 9 cases of taxa detected in only one ac condition fig 3 5 cases had a single sequence read and all cases had 3 or fewer ac sequence reads the growability of taxa under all incubation conditions combined provides strong physiological evidence of the ability for those taxa to grow in some incubation condition as opposed to being unculturable the high community based growability values are a reflection that all of the abundant taxa grew community based results are the relevant ones for evaluating methods used in ballast water treatment regulations because the regulations are not based on taxa but on numbers of individuals within size classes community based results are also the most reliable because the high numbers of detected sequences provide the most reliable growth scoring calculations and new growers which are rare taxa do not contribute to the outcome the growability of high abundance taxa is perhaps expected as these taxa are abundant because they were successfully reproducing in the environmental conditions which were replicated in the laboratory finally the similarity of growability values between incubation conditions was consistent with the enumerations produced by the mpns which were themselves being evaluated as the mean mpn responses between conditions were also not statistically different table s1 anova p 0 218 4 2 method reliability and resolution these analyses were designed to be robust all singletons and doubletons were removed and strict sequence quality filtering was applied thus all of the sequences retained in the analyses were meaningful the rarefaction curves showed good sequence read depth for the characterization of the communities consistent with the detections of rare taxa dna decay rates were measured in heat killed cells which ruled out the possibility of artefacts in ac detections originating from dead cells in the bc sample the use of qrt pcr allowed bc and ac detections to be compared to make quantitative growth determinations though the quantification of sequences at two time points bc and ac does not allow the calculation of true growth rates during incubation the growth ratios ri were still high and allowed definitive growth scoring finally the growth ratios could be biased by changes in the copy number of the 18s rdna genes during the 14 day incubation period however while 18s copy number is known to vary among eukaryotes prokopowich et al 2003 there is no expectation that the mean copy number would vary within a taxa over time especially over an incubation period of 14 days for some taxa there was uncertainty in growth scoring when a taxon was detected bc but not ac it was subcategorised as a potential non grower and when a taxon was detected ac but not bc it was classified as a new grower with unknown growth ratio resolution can be improved by obtaining more sequences for the analysis either by applying more sequencing effort or by increasing the volume of original sample processed increasing the number of ac sequence reads will help resolve taxa categorised as potential non growers zero ac detections into definitive grower or non grower categories increasing the number of bc sequence reads will help resolve new growers zero bc detections into growers with a defined ri assuming the same qrt pcr values across samples the resolution is determined by the ratio of volumes of original sample processed in bc and ac samples vac vbc the nature of mpn arrays leads to a low vac vbc ratio in this work 80 ml of bc sample were processed and though ac samples were 60 ml composites of 5 replicates at each of 3 dilutions the amount of original sample was only 0 037 ml resulting in vac vbc 1 2 162 thus taxa in potential non grower and new grower categories had ri 2 162 and ri 2 162 respectively it is unfortunate that the experimental design suffered from the probable contamination of k10 samples but it was useful as a negative control for growth detection showing that the method would generate appropriate negative growth outcomes this condition was excluded from comparative analyses because it was atypical and would give false causality for growability differences from different incubation conditions even if the k10 condition were the cause of the lack of growth it would not negate the results for growable taxa across all media combined but it was unlikely to be the cause as broad community growth was measured both for samples with the same enrichment media at a different temperature and for samples at the same temperature with a different enrichment media and the likelihood that some interaction effect resulted in a lack of growth is low these types of contamination events are rare in mpn assays 4 3 implications for method validation for validating methods used to measure treatment performance e g mpn and sm methods for measuring bwms treatments one of the most important metrics is the method detection factor the complement of the false negative rate as it is measurement bias that represents an invasion risk from living organisms not detected by an assay cullen 2018 the method developed in this work was used to make detection factor estimates growability for validating phytoplankton mpn assays even though measured growability values were high it is important to recognize that they are worst case values for phytoplankton in natural samples their status is not known a priori this method classifies taxa as non growers growers and new growers with certainty because of measured increases or decreases in pcr template concentrations however the distinction of potential non growers is an important one because although they are counted as non growers their true status is unknown the absence of ac detections could be because the organisms were alive but not capable of growth or they were dead in the original sample or growth may have been undetected with the method resolution for these three possibilities classifying taxa as non growers would give accurate worst case and worst case growability values respectively this work was compared to the only other published validation of a bwms assay for organisms in the 10 50 μm size category steinberg et al 2011 reported low false negative rates of 1 2 for the sm method however for the complementary detection factors 98 99 to be comparable to the detection factor values in this work growability the same classifying criteria must be applied steinberg et al 2011 assumed that organisms not staining and not motile were dead and eliminated them from the counts however their status was unknown and they could have been alive for example live but non staining and non motile diatoms such as amphiprora spp macintyre and cullen 2016 would fall into this category and be mis classified these organisms are potential false negatives in the sm assay analogous to organisms in the potential non grower category in this work which were ultimately counted as non growers when adjusted to be comparable the sm detection factor values for steinberg et al 2011 decline to 74 90 higher detection factors lower bias for mpn than sm is consistent with the results of molina et al 2016 who reported higher concentrations of live cells measured by mpn than sm in all comparative samples and with other comparative data blatchley et al 2018 cullen 2018 wright and welschmeyer 2015 where higher concentrations by mpn than sm were reported in a majority of samples 5 conclusion a reliable method for measuring growability was developed and used to measure the performance of phytoplankton mpn assays used in bwms testing the high 99 community growability measurements verify that most phytoplankton grow to detection in mpn assays even if many have not yet been brought into permanent culture this in turn verifies that mpn assays produce accurate and unbiased results the consistently high growability values for different enrichments and temperatures supports the conclusion that successful growth occurs because the media base is filter sterilized sample water containing all necessary compounds which provides a simple and elegant basis to standardize mpn assays this work can provide regulatory confidence for broader acceptance of mpn assays without limitations which will harmonize the sizing of uv based

18552,the removal of β estradiol e2 and α ethinylestradiol ee2 in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtp would need to be improved in order to comply with prospective environmental quality standards eqs of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l 1 respectively the effluent concentration of a micropollutant in an activated sludge process is a function of the removal rate the hydraulic retention time hrt and the flow pattern which is usually overlooked in order to better understand this aspect we carried out tracer studies in eight wwtps in the uk and found that relatively modest changes in aeration tanks would translate into tangible improvements in their flow pattern we further evaluated the degradation rates for e1 estrone e2 e3 estriol and ee2 in each wwtp and we estimated that the modification of the flow pattern would be sufficient to place effluent concentrations of e2 23 2 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 210 l gvss 1 d 1 far below the prospective eqs while ee2 0 3 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 2 9 l gvss 1 d 1 would have to rely on river dilution for compliance regarding e1 and e3 with no prospective legislation the modifications would place e3 9 9 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 39 5 l gvss 1 d 1 effluent concentrations easily below its predicted no effect concentrations pnec 60 ng l 1 while for e1 2 6 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 19 2 l gvss 1 d 1 it would very much depend on the degradation rates of the specific wwtp pnec 6 ng l 1 improvement in flow pattern had the additional benefit of improving the effectiveness of other plausible changes in hrt or biological removal rates managing the flow pattern of existing wwtps is a cost efficient tool for managing the fate of estrogens graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogens activated sludge plug flow continuously stirred tank reactor cstr hydraulic flow optimization 1 introduction there is great concern over the risks that anthropogenic trace chemicals micropollutants may pose to the environment and human health some of the most studied and cited examples include the natural and synthetic estrogens estrone e1 17 β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 which have been shown to exert harmful effects at low ng l 1 concentrations eea 2013 kidd et al 2007 concentrations of natural estrogens in crude sewage are typically in the order of tens of ng l 1 of e1 and e2 and up to hundreds of ng l 1 of e3 gardner et al 2013 liu et al 2015 while synthetic ee2 concentrations are typically in the order of 1 ng l 1 gardner et al 2013 e1 e2 and ee2 are included on the eu monitoring watch list under the water framework directive european commission 2018 and stringent environmental quality standards eqs of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l 1 respectively have been proposed for e2 and ee2 in surface waters european commission 2012 not without controversy since the threat that such concentrations pose on wild fish populations has been questioned by some authors hamilton et al 2014 this situation places increasing pressure on the wastewater industry to improve the performance of wastewater treatment plants wwtp that are at present an inadequate barrier to these chemicals the implementation of sophisticated tertiary treatment technologies such as ozonation oulton et al 2010 is perceived as the most promising way to guarantee compliance but the rationale and wider cost benefits of such major investments has been brought into question since these technologies are usually energy intensive and can still produce harmful by products johnson and sumpter 2015 conventional activated sludge processes asp are able to degrade estrogens to different extents a recent review reported that removals ranged from 447 to 100 for natural estrogens free estrogens might be produced in asps as a result of the cleavage of conjugated estrogens or as metabolites of other estrogens that results in negative removals liu et al 2015 and removal of ee2 has been reported to vary between 0 and 90 clara et al 2005 joss et al 2004 ternes et al 1999 the use of percentage values alone to assess the ability of an asp to remove harmful chemicals can be misleading environmentally relevant risk depends on exposure to the final effluent concentrations of the harmful chemical into receiving water bodies in fact in the review mentioned above only 4 out of 41 wwtps had average e2 effluent concentrations lower than the proposed eqs 0 4 ng l 1 liu et al 2015 in a survey of representative uk wwtps almost all effluents exceeded the proposed eqs for ee2 0 035 ng l 1 by an order of magnitude or more gardner et al 2012 indeed up to 25 of the total length of european rivers has been estimated to exceed the proposed eqs johnson et al 2013 estrogen removal varies between wwtps and this suggests that the wwtp performance can be improved by modifying the design operation or biology of the plant the effluent concentration of any micropollutant in a wwtp is a function of the rate of removal the hydraulic retention time hrt and the flow pattern however whilst factors affecting the rate of removal such as the srt temperature or organic load have been extensively studied alvarino et al 2014 clara et al 2005 joss et al 2004 li et al 2005a petrie et al 2014 shi et al 2004 the flow pattern has been often neglected there has been just one theoretical study joss et al 2006 and no reports on full scale plants there are well established procedures for predicting the effluent concentration of any biodegradable pollutant in a wwtp from the hrt the pollutants influent concentration and the biotransformation rate the as reactor is usually assumed to conform to one of two ideal flow patterns either a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr equation 1 or plug flow equation 2 1 c c 0 1 k τ 2 c c 0 e k τ where c and c 0 are the concentrations of estrogen ng l 1 in the reactor effluent and influent respectively τ is the hydraulic retention time in the reactor and k is the first order degradation constant d 1 estrogens as well as other contaminants have been reported to degrade according to first or pseudo first order reactions alvarino et al 2014 joss et al 2004 li et al 2005a ren et al 2007 in a cstr instantaneous mixing of the influent makes the composition of the wastewater uniform through the volume of the reactor while in a plug flow the composition varies along the reactor levenspiel 1999 first order reactions are most efficient in plug flow reactors but in practice the hydraulic flow pattern of real reactors lies somewhere in between these two ideal flow patterns fall et al 2012 sánchez et al 2016 tracer studies are used to describe the flow in aeration tanks fall et al 2012 makinia and wells 2005 sánchez et al 2016 and there are several models in the literature able to represent non ideal flow among them the tanks in series model is simple and can incorporate different compartment arrangements and recycling flows levenspiel 1999 this work aimed to quantify the potential for enhancing the removal of micropollutants in asps through the optimization of the flow pattern in the aeration tank we used e1 e2 e3 and ee2 as model micropollutants and we tried to answer the following questions 1 how do real reactors behave hydraulically 2 can the flow pattern of a real full scale activated sludge reactor be improved with relatively minor modifications 3 if so how much would these modifications enhance estrogen removal for this purpose tracer studies were carried out in eight wwtps in order to accurately determine their flow pattern the pseudo first order degradation coefficient of each estrogen was obtained for each wwtp and the results were fitted using different configurations based on the tanks in series model estrogen effluent concentrations were predicted by assuming both the real reactor flow pattern and the ideal patterns mentioned previously 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals estrogen standards e1 e2 e3 and ee2 98 purity were purchased from sigma

loughborough uk was selected for the tracer study due to its conservative behaviour 2 2 wastewater treatment plant wwtp selection eight wwtps were selected because of their different sizes and geometries table 1 2 3 concentrations of estrogens reaching secondary treatment in order to estimate the concentration of e1 e2 and e3 reaching secondary treatment in each wwtp data of bod load and dry weather flow dwf were fed into a model previously developed for the estimation of natural estrogens in wwtp influents dotan et al 2017 concentrations of ee2 were estimated according to the uk per capita load and considering each plant s population equivalent pe and dwf green et al 2013 finally these concentrations were corrected to account for deconjugation and biotransformation during primary treatment as done elsewhere gardner et al 2013 an example of the application of these models is shown in the supporting information table s1 modelled influent concentrations are in the same range of those reported in the literature gardner et al 2013 liu et al 2015 2 4 biotransformation rates the biotransformation rates were obtained from a series of experiments carried out in batch systems with an active volume of 0 5 l each bioreactor was spiked with a mixture of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 in meoh to a final concentration of 100 μg l 1 of each estrogen in order to avoid any influence of the solvent the reactors were spiked and left for 30 min under a fume hood to evaporate before adding the as the batches were placed in an incubator for 72 h at a constant temperature of 15 ᵒc and continuously mixed to maintain aeration triplicate 1 ml samples were taken at 0 0 3 0 6 1 2 4 8 12 24 48 and 72 h and cleaned up by solid phase extraction as adapted from ross et al 2017 details in the supporting information table s2 two sets of samples were taken from the bioreactor at each time point for the first set of samples 1 2 ml samples were centrifuged at 12 000 g and and subsequently 1 ml of the aqueous phase of these samples was processed for analysis with this set of samples we measured the concentration of estrogens in the aqueous phase for the second set 1 ml of sample from the bioreactor was processed straight away in order to obtain the total concentration of estrogens in the aqueous and solid phases jointly as previously done by joss et al 2004 the concentration of estrogens in the solid phase was calculated by subtracting the aqueous concentration from the total concentration abiotic loss was taken into account with a control reactor in which the mixture of estrogens was spiked in 0 5 l of distilled water instead of as background concentration of estrogens was taken into account with a non spiked control reactor deuterated standards of all estrogens were spiked in the samples to account for losses or gains during sampling processing and from matrix interference 2 5 analytical methods estrogen concentrations were determined using lc ms ms consisting of a waters

spectrometer was operated in the negative electrospray ionization mode using multiple reaction monitoring mrm chromatographic separation was achieved using a beh c18 column with pore size 130 å particle size 1 7 μm id 2 1 mm and length 100 mm the concentrations of the estrogens in the samples were calculated relative to the deuterated standards using the software masslynx v4 1 the method parameters are detailed in the supporting information table s3 2 6 tracer studies methodology and results analysis in each wwtp a seapoint fluorometer brentwook usa with a detection limit of 0 2 μg l 1 was installed in the outlet of the aeration tank and set up to take one measurement every minute an amount of the fluorescent tracer depending on the volume of the tank was poured as a single pulse in the inlet to give a final concentration of 10 μg l 1 in aeration tanks that were divided into lanes see fig s4 in the supporting information it was physically impossible to access the point before the flow splits so only one of the lanes was used for the tracer study all the lanes were identical having the same geometry and flow pattern each tracer study lasted between 22 and 24 h and flow data influent and ras were taken from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system during the whole period of the tracer studies in each tracer study a 5 l sample of mixed liquor was transported to the laboratory to calibrate the fluorometer and measure its background fluorescence from the c pulse curve concentration of tracer over time obtained from the readings of the fluorometer the average time of passage t o b s equivalent to the theoretical hydraulic retention time was calculated as follows 3 t o b s t i c t i δ t i c t i δ t i where c t is the concentration of the tracer μg l 1 at every time point t i s the c pulse curves were compared to different models using aquasim 2 1 g reichert 1994 based on the tanks in series model and using the volumes and flows from each wwtp table 1 the tanks in series model considers any reactor as a number of n consecutive tanks in series in such a way that when n 1 the system behaves like a cstr and when n tends to infinity the system behaves as a plug flow levenspiel 1999 influent flows return activated sludge ras surplus activated sludge sas and reactor volumes as well as the mass of the tracer recovered in each study were fed into each model as an example the initial layout of wwtp3 and its configuration implemented in the software are shown in fig 1 a and b for all the other wwtp see fig s4 in the supporting information the analysis proceeded as follows each wwtp s first simulation considered each lane or tank as one cstr subsequently each lane or tank was divided into 2 3 and so on cstrs according to the tanks in series model although in theory a plug flow reactor is equivalent to an infinite number of tanks in series in practice plug flow behaviour has been reported for values of n as low as 2 12 tanks in series metcalf and eddy 2003 tsai and chen 2013 therefore a conservative value of n 30 tanks in series was used to model a pure plug flow in each lane the models produced use very basic configurations for the reactors relying on the geometry of the tanks configurations that are more sophisticated would produce a better fit but were considered unnecessary for the purpose of this study 2 7 wwtp upgrade wwtp3 was upgraded in order to provide extra capacity required by a growing population the upgrade consisted of the construction of three concrete baffles in the front of the tank and the installation of a combination of a fine bubble diffused aeration fbda system aquaconsult aerostrip diffusers to replace disc aerators and an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system eliquo hydrok barnsley uk fig 1 a the ifas system consisted on four sets of textile mobile curtains biotextil cleartec jäger umwelt technik set parallel to the flow and attached to removable frames two tracer studies were carried out in this wwtp i e before and after modifications in order to find if the hydrodynamics would change perceptibly 2 8 modelling estrogen effluent concentrations in wwtps once the best fit tanks in series hydrodynamic model for each wwtp was selected the degradation of estrogens was included in the model in order to obtain the biodegradation rates for each estrogen in each degradation experiment a model considering parallel biodegradation and sorption similar to the one described by joss et al 2004 was chosen to fit the experimental data in this model which assumes biodegradation takes place exclusively in the aqueous phase and describes both biodegradation and adsorption as pseudo first order kinetics processes the mass flux of estrogen in the solid and aqueous phases would be described as follows 4 d c s d t k a d c a q k d e s c s 5 d c a q d t k b i o c a q k a d c a q k d e s c s with k a d k a d v s s k d e s k d e s v s s and k b i o k b i o v s s where c s is the amount of estrogen adsorbed to the solid phase per reactor volume g l 1 c aq is the concentration of estrogen in the aqueous phase g l 1 k ad is the pseudo first order adsorption constant l gvss 1 d 1 k des is the pseudo first order desorption constant l gvss 1 d 1 k bio is the pseudo first order biotransformation constant l gvss 1 d 1 and vss are the volatile suspended solids g l 1 however since as previously observed joss et al 2004 adsorption was instantaneous only k des and k bio had to be estimated estimates and methodology in section s5 in the supporting information the influent concentrations of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 implemented in the hydraulic models were those obtained as detailed in section 2 3 for each wwtp the removal of estrogens in the reactor was modelled according to different hydraulic scenarios firstly using the current hydrodynamics secondly assuming a hypothetical modification equivalent to that in wwtp3 assuming no concomitant change in the biology and lastly considering the reactor as an ideal plug flow 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance and efficiency of activated sludge processes in wwtps table 2 shows the results from the tracer studies and influent modelled concentrations of estrogens the experimental c pulse curve and visual best fits to the tanks in series model for wwtp3 are shown in fig 1 c for all the other wwtp see fig s4 in the supporting information these provide the number of tanks in series shown in table 2 although the geometries of the plants were very different the hydraulic performance of most of the as processes were quite similar all the wwtps apart from wwtp 5 behaved like 1 to 2 tanks in series n 1 2 presumably the aeration of asps promotes mixing and cstr like behaviour and overcomes any effects imposed by the geometry of the plant in most cases the observed and theoretical hrts were similar the measured value fell within the variability expected due to inlet and ras flow fluctuation table 2 however in wwtps 1 and 2 the observed hrt was substantially shorter than the theoretical value which suggests that there was either short circuiting or dead volume in the reactor levenspiel 1999 on the other hand in wwtp3 the observed hrt was higher than expected suggesting that either the wrong reactor volume or wrong flow was used in the model this discrepancy may happen because only daily average ras flow data were available for wwtp3 rather than the 15 min ras flow data available for all other wwtps the fortuitous modification of the aeration tank in wwtp3 changed the hydraulic behaviour therein the peak of the c pulse curve moved from 1 45 h to 2 33 h fig 1c and d and the shape of the curve was more symmetrical meaning the aeration tank is more plug flow like levenspiel 1999 likewise the fitting to the tanks in series model showed a change from 1 to 2 to 5 tanks in series 3 2 influence of hydraulic performance on modelled effluent concentrations there was a 15 fold variation between wwtps in the modelled estrogen effluent concentrations for e1 e2 and e3 while the variation was 3 fold for ee2 fig 2 obviously effluent concentrations decreased as the number of tanks in series increased fig 2 more importantly a very modest improvement from 1 to 2 tanks to 5 tanks had a substantial impact on effluent quality showing that meaningful improvements in performance can be made without attaining perfect plug flow some wwtps had a greater intrinsic ability to degrade certain estrogens than others the pseudo first order degradation rates k bio fig 2 obtained from the degradation experiments which were used to predict effluent concentrations for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 varied between wwtps by about one order of magnitude and were in the same range of the rates obtained in previous studies alvarino et al 2014 blair et al 2015 li et al 2005b petrie et al 2014 shi et al 2004 however this variability is not systematic i e there is not a single wwtp better at removing all the four estrogens this difference in the degradation rates implies that the biological degradation process could in principle be substantially improved presumably by optimizing other parameters that affect k bio e g srt e2 is an easily degradable compound 23 2 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 210 l gvss 1 d 1 the highest removal rates of all the estrogens in fact greater than 95 removal was achieved in the wwtps irrespective of their flow pattern fig s6 in the supporting information which is in agreement with many previous studies chimchirian et al 2007 clara et al 2005 hashimoto et al 2007 zhou et al 2012 still some of these studies detect e2 in effluents at concentrations ranging 1 2 ng l 1 chimchirian et al 2007 zhou et al 2012 which are above the proposed eqs 0 4 ng l 1 in the present study the modelled effluent concentration of e2 in wwtps 1 3 and 6 would not necessarily meet the putative eqs at all times based on their current hydraulic performance wwtp 3 whose e2 degradation rate is the lowest of the wwtps benefited from the modification going from an effluent concentration of 0 32 0 12 ng l 1 with the old geometry to 0 04 0 03 ng l 1 that would allow it to comply with the putative eqs despite the observed variability due to diurnal flow fluctuations fig 2 this predicted effluent concentration neglects any additional biological benefit that the ifas and new aeration system may also confer wwtp1 and wwtp6 would also benefit from similar modifications an improvement to five tanks in series would guarantee compliance to the e2 eqs for both wwtps ee2 is the most recalcitrant of the four estrogens 0 3 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 2 9 l gvss 1 d 1 in fact the 0 035 ng l 1 putative eqs 0 035 ng l 1 would not be reached in any of the wwtps studied here even with an ideal plug flow which agrees with previous findings from a survey across 162 uk wwtps that showed that all wwtps would need significant dilution 7 33 times dilution depending on the wwtp by receiving waters in order to reach the proposed eqs gardner et al 2012 however this does not necessarily mean that the prospective eqs would not be achievable since the median annual dilution factor in uk rivers has been predicted to be 37 keller et al 2014 however dilution is not a very satisfying method of protecting the environment for wwtp7 and wwtp8 optimization to plug flow would translate to an approximate 50 reduction in ee2 effluent concentration this is the result of a combination of factors not only were the k bio higher for these plants but they also operated at high solids concentrations table 1 however it is noticeable that for the majority of the wwtps improvement in ee2 final effluent concentrations through hydraulics alone is negligible with the current flow pattern the required k bio for ee2 to ensure an effluent concentration lower than the 0 035 ng l 1 putative eqs would vary between 22 9 2 6 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp2 to 83 6 32 1 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp6 fig 3 however a more efficient flow pattern would substantially lower the minimum k bio required for compliance from 6 2 1 6 l gvss 1 d 1 in wwtp7 to 18 5 1 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp6 which could be optimised by modifying other parameters e g srt this further emphasizes the importance of the hydraulic flow pattern to the biological removal of micropollutants a more efficient hydraulic behaviour reduces the required improvements in biology there are currently no proposed eqs for e1 and e3 and only a few studies address their effect on aquatic organisms nonetheless pnecs of 6 ng l 1 and 60 ng l 1 respectively have been suggested for both compounds based on in vivo vitellogenin potency data caldwell et al 2012 e3 is relatively easily degradable 9 9 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 39 5 l gvss 1 d 1 and except for wwtp 6 the current flow pattern in all wwtps would be enough to guarantee an effluent concentration below the proposed pnec wwtp 6 however would be able to meet the pnec most of the time if the flow pattern was changed to five tanks in series it is worth mentioning that wwtp3 wwtp6 and wwtp7 have similar pseudo first order degradation rates 11 7 9 9 and 13 8 l gvss 1 d 1 respectively but a higher solids concentration table 1 allows wwtp 3 and wwtp7 to comfortably meet the pnec this highlights the important role of biomass concentration in the optimization of micropollutant degradation in asps e1 is less biodegradable 2 6 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 19 2 l gvss 1 d 1 and between 56 and 100 was removed fig s2 only wwtp 7 would initially meet the 6 ng l 1 pnec but other wwtps would potentially go below that concentration after modification to 5 tanks in series in fact this would be enough to place wwtp 8 below the pnec wwtps 2 and 6 would also benefit from the modification but their compliance would still be limited by the flow variation although an eqs has not been proposed for e1 its contribution to the total estrogenicity of wastewater should not be disregarded caldwell et al 2012 because of its potency and typically elevated influent concentrations compared to e2 and ee2 3 3 engineering implications if we wish to proactively engineer the removal of micropollutants in wwtp we must consider the flow pattern the first order removal rate the hydraulic retention time the load and the desired eqs the flow pattern is an essential and overlooked element in this paper we have demonstrated that accurate knowledge of reactor hydraulics is essential to understanding both the performance of a reactor and the potential for improving that performance in general we found that the higher the k bio the more leeway for improvement from hydrodynamics up to the point where k bio was so high that complete degradation is achieved anyway thus for easily degradable compounds like e2 and e3 and to a lesser extent e1 a slight modification of the reactor would lead to significant reductions in the final effluent concentrations this is important because it would apply to all pollutants including some harmful substances whose k bio are in a similar range however the usefulness of hydrodynamic improvements will depend on the proposed eqs or pnecs of any given substance simply increasing the hrt in these wwtps would have ensured compliance of some e2 and e3 but not all e1 and ee2 compounds table 3 crucially a small improvement in the efficiency of the flow pattern can make changes in hrt much more effective in a plug flow reactor the relationship between the concentration of pollutants c and hrt is exponential eq 1 which means that a modification in the hrt will have a greater impact on effluent concentrations in a plug flow reactor than in a cstr thus modest modifications to optimise the flow pattern from 1 to 5 tanks in series would also result in a greater sensitivity of final effluent concentrations to small changes in hrt the hrt required for compliance decreases dramatically when simulating the aeration tanks with the aforementioned upgrade to 5 tanks in series table 3 this means that after such modifications all the wwtps except wwtp5 could meet the pnec for e1 by implementing a longer hrt that still falls inside those considered typical for asps metcalf and eddy 2003 and wwtps 7 and 8 could meet the eqs for ee2 with a high but still reasonable hrt these sensitivities to hrt variations further emphasize the benefits of optimizing the hydrodynamics of aeration tanks in the future one could envisage the use of cfd in also helping to achieve this task a consideration of hydrodynamics can improve performance directly and lowers the bar for effective improvements in removal rates based on other factors that can optimise k bio such as the solids retention time or indeed may help to reduce ozonation requirements if tertiary treatment is deemed necessary clearly understanding and improving the removal of ee2 is an important and urgent task 4 conclusions the current work aimed to quantify the role of flow pattern in aeration tanks on the removal of estrogens in full scale wwtps the results indicate that there is leeway for improving biological degradation by an initial adequate design or even by some minor modifications to existing plants to promote more plug flow like behaviour the hydraulic behaviour of the majority of the as reactors in this study was more similar to a cstr than to a plug flow reactor despite their different geometries slight modifications in the geometry of a full scale aeration tank caused an improvement in its hydraulic behaviour from 1 to 2 to 5 tanks in series turning it into a more plug flow like reactor these modifications would in theory have a substantial impact on effluent quality enhancing the removal of the natural estrogens and leading to the compliance of e2 to the putative eqs effluent concentrations of the synthetic ee2 would not be significantly reduced with these modifications and wwtps would have to rely on river dilution in order to meet the 0 035 ng l 1 putative eqs however a more efficient flow pattern would substantially lower the minimum k bio required for ee2 compliance of from 6 2 1 6 l gvss 1 d 1 in wwtp7 to 18 5 1 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp6 a more plug flow hydraulic behaviour would also result in a greater sensitivity of final effluent concentrations to small changes in hrt further emphasizing the importance of the hydraulic flow pattern to the biological removal of micropollutants and the benefits of optimizing the hydrodynamics of aeration tanks reactor hydraulic optimization can provide a tool to minimize the effluent concentrations for the most easily degradable estrogens and alleviate the need for advanced oxidation processes conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of

18552,the removal of β estradiol e2 and α ethinylestradiol ee2 in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtp would need to be improved in order to comply with prospective environmental quality standards eqs of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l 1 respectively the effluent concentration of a micropollutant in an activated sludge process is a function of the removal rate the hydraulic retention time hrt and the flow pattern which is usually overlooked in order to better understand this aspect we carried out tracer studies in eight wwtps in the uk and found that relatively modest changes in aeration tanks would translate into tangible improvements in their flow pattern we further evaluated the degradation rates for e1 estrone e2 e3 estriol and ee2 in each wwtp and we estimated that the modification of the flow pattern would be sufficient to place effluent concentrations of e2 23 2 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 210 l gvss 1 d 1 far below the prospective eqs while ee2 0 3 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 2 9 l gvss 1 d 1 would have to rely on river dilution for compliance regarding e1 and e3 with no prospective legislation the modifications would place e3 9 9 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 39 5 l gvss 1 d 1 effluent concentrations easily below its predicted no effect concentrations pnec 60 ng l 1 while for e1 2 6 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 19 2 l gvss 1 d 1 it would very much depend on the degradation rates of the specific wwtp pnec 6 ng l 1 improvement in flow pattern had the additional benefit of improving the effectiveness of other plausible changes in hrt or biological removal rates managing the flow pattern of existing wwtps is a cost efficient tool for managing the fate of estrogens graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogens activated sludge plug flow continuously stirred tank reactor cstr hydraulic flow optimization 1 introduction there is great concern over the risks that anthropogenic trace chemicals micropollutants may pose to the environment and human health some of the most studied and cited examples include the natural and synthetic estrogens estrone e1 17 β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 which have been shown to exert harmful effects at low ng l 1 concentrations eea 2013 kidd et al 2007 concentrations of natural estrogens in crude sewage are typically in the order of tens of ng l 1 of e1 and e2 and up to hundreds of ng l 1 of e3 gardner et al 2013 liu et al 2015 while synthetic ee2 concentrations are typically in the order of 1 ng l 1 gardner et al 2013 e1 e2 and ee2 are included on the eu monitoring watch list under the water framework directive european commission 2018 and stringent environmental quality standards eqs of 0 4 and 0 035 ng l 1 respectively have been proposed for e2 and ee2 in surface waters european commission 2012 not without controversy since the threat that such concentrations pose on wild fish populations has been questioned by some authors hamilton et al 2014 this situation places increasing pressure on the wastewater industry to improve the performance of wastewater treatment plants wwtp that are at present an inadequate barrier to these chemicals the implementation of sophisticated tertiary treatment technologies such as ozonation oulton et al 2010 is perceived as the most promising way to guarantee compliance but the rationale and wider cost benefits of such major investments has been brought into question since these technologies are usually energy intensive and can still produce harmful by products johnson and sumpter 2015 conventional activated sludge processes asp are able to degrade estrogens to different extents a recent review reported that removals ranged from 447 to 100 for natural estrogens free estrogens might be produced in asps as a result of the cleavage of conjugated estrogens or as metabolites of other estrogens that results in negative removals liu et al 2015 and removal of ee2 has been reported to vary between 0 and 90 clara et al 2005 joss et al 2004 ternes et al 1999 the use of percentage values alone to assess the ability of an asp to remove harmful chemicals can be misleading environmentally relevant risk depends on exposure to the final effluent concentrations of the harmful chemical into receiving water bodies in fact in the review mentioned above only 4 out of 41 wwtps had average e2 effluent concentrations lower than the proposed eqs 0 4 ng l 1 liu et al 2015 in a survey of representative uk wwtps almost all effluents exceeded the proposed eqs for ee2 0 035 ng l 1 by an order of magnitude or more gardner et al 2012 indeed up to 25 of the total length of european rivers has been estimated to exceed the proposed eqs johnson et al 2013 estrogen removal varies between wwtps and this suggests that the wwtp performance can be improved by modifying the design operation or biology of the plant the effluent concentration of any micropollutant in a wwtp is a function of the rate of removal the hydraulic retention time hrt and the flow pattern however whilst factors affecting the rate of removal such as the srt temperature or organic load have been extensively studied alvarino et al 2014 clara et al 2005 joss et al 2004 li et al 2005a petrie et al 2014 shi et al 2004 the flow pattern has been often neglected there has been just one theoretical study joss et al 2006 and no reports on full scale plants there are well established procedures for predicting the effluent concentration of any biodegradable pollutant in a wwtp from the hrt the pollutants influent concentration and the biotransformation rate the as reactor is usually assumed to conform to one of two ideal flow patterns either a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr equation 1 or plug flow equation 2 1 c c 0 1 k τ 2 c c 0 e k τ where c and c 0 are the concentrations of estrogen ng l 1 in the reactor effluent and influent respectively τ is the hydraulic retention time in the reactor and k is the first order degradation constant d 1 estrogens as well as other contaminants have been reported to degrade according to first or pseudo first order reactions alvarino et al 2014 joss et al 2004 li et al 2005a ren et al 2007 in a cstr instantaneous mixing of the influent makes the composition of the wastewater uniform through the volume of the reactor while in a plug flow the composition varies along the reactor levenspiel 1999 first order reactions are most efficient in plug flow reactors but in practice the hydraulic flow pattern of real reactors lies somewhere in between these two ideal flow patterns fall et al 2012 sánchez et al 2016 tracer studies are used to describe the flow in aeration tanks fall et al 2012 makinia and wells 2005 sánchez et al 2016 and there are several models in the literature able to represent non ideal flow among them the tanks in series model is simple and can incorporate different compartment arrangements and recycling flows levenspiel 1999 this work aimed to quantify the potential for enhancing the removal of micropollutants in asps through the optimization of the flow pattern in the aeration tank we used e1 e2 e3 and ee2 as model micropollutants and we tried to answer the following questions 1 how do real reactors behave hydraulically 2 can the flow pattern of a real full scale activated sludge reactor be improved with relatively minor modifications 3 if so how much would these modifications enhance estrogen removal for this purpose tracer studies were carried out in eight wwtps in order to accurately determine their flow pattern the pseudo first order degradation coefficient of each estrogen was obtained for each wwtp and the results were fitted using different configurations based on the tanks in series model estrogen effluent concentrations were predicted by assuming both the real reactor flow pattern and the ideal patterns mentioned previously 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals estrogen standards e1 e2 e3 and ee2 98 purity were purchased from sigma

butyl methyl ether mtbe and ammonium hydroxide solution 5 m nh4oh were purchased from sigma aldrich irvine uk the fluorescent dye rhodamine wt acros organics 20 solution in water fisher scientific loughborough uk was selected for the tracer study due to its conservative behaviour 2 2 wastewater treatment plant wwtp selection eight wwtps were selected because of their different sizes and geometries table 1 2 3 concentrations of estrogens reaching secondary treatment in order to estimate the concentration of e1 e2 and e3 reaching secondary treatment in each wwtp data of bod load and dry weather flow dwf were fed into a model previously developed for the estimation of natural estrogens in wwtp influents dotan et al 2017 concentrations of ee2 were estimated according to the uk per capita load and considering each plant s population equivalent pe and dwf green et al 2013 finally these concentrations were corrected to account for deconjugation and biotransformation during primary treatment as done elsewhere gardner et al 2013 an example of the application of these models is shown in the supporting information table s1 modelled influent concentrations are in the same range of those reported in the literature gardner et al 2013 liu et al 2015 2 4 biotransformation rates the biotransformation rates were obtained from a series of experiments carried out in batch systems with an active volume of 0 5 l each bioreactor was spiked with a mixture of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 in meoh to a final concentration of 100 μg l 1 of each estrogen in order to avoid any influence of the solvent the reactors were spiked and left for 30 min under a fume hood to evaporate before adding the as the batches were placed in an incubator for 72 h at a constant temperature of 15 ᵒc and continuously mixed to maintain aeration triplicate 1 ml samples were taken at 0 0 3 0 6 1 2 4 8 12 24 48 and 72 h and cleaned up by solid phase extraction as adapted from ross et al 2017 details in the supporting information table s2 two sets of samples were taken from the bioreactor at each time point for the first set of samples 1 2 ml samples were centrifuged at 12 000 g and and subsequently 1 ml of the aqueous phase of these samples was processed for analysis with this set of samples we measured the concentration of estrogens in the aqueous phase for the second set 1 ml of sample from the bioreactor was processed straight away in order to obtain the total concentration of estrogens in the aqueous and solid phases jointly as previously done by joss et al 2004 the concentration of estrogens in the solid phase was calculated by subtracting the aqueous concentration from the total concentration abiotic loss was taken into account with a control reactor in which the mixture of estrogens was spiked in 0 5 l of distilled water instead of as background concentration of estrogens was taken into account with a non spiked control reactor deuterated standards of all estrogens were spiked in the samples to account for losses or gains during sampling processing and from matrix interference 2 5 analytical methods estrogen concentrations were determined using lc ms ms consisting of a waters

spectrometer was operated in the negative electrospray ionization mode using multiple reaction monitoring mrm chromatographic separation was achieved using a beh c18 column with pore size 130 å particle size 1 7 μm id 2 1 mm and length 100 mm the concentrations of the estrogens in the samples were calculated relative to the deuterated standards using the software masslynx v4 1 the method parameters are detailed in the supporting information table s3 2 6 tracer studies methodology and results analysis in each wwtp a seapoint fluorometer brentwook usa with a detection limit of 0 2 μg l 1 was installed in the outlet of the aeration tank and set up to take one measurement every minute an amount of the fluorescent tracer depending on the volume of the tank was poured as a single pulse in the inlet to give a final concentration of 10 μg l 1 in aeration tanks that were divided into lanes see fig s4 in the supporting information it was physically impossible to access the point before the flow splits so only one of the lanes was used for the tracer study all the lanes were identical having the same geometry and flow pattern each tracer study lasted between 22 and 24 h and flow data influent and ras were taken from the supervisory control and data acquisition scada system during the whole period of the tracer studies in each tracer study a 5 l sample of mixed liquor was transported to the laboratory to calibrate the fluorometer and measure its background fluorescence from the c pulse curve concentration of tracer over time obtained from the readings of the fluorometer the average time of passage t o b s equivalent to the theoretical hydraulic retention time was calculated as follows 3 t o b s t i c t i δ t i c t i δ t i where c t is the concentration of the tracer μg l 1 at every time point t i s the c pulse curves were compared to different models using aquasim 2 1 g reichert 1994 based on the tanks in series model and using the volumes and flows from each wwtp table 1 the tanks in series model considers any reactor as a number of n consecutive tanks in series in such a way that when n 1 the system behaves like a cstr and when n tends to infinity the system behaves as a plug flow levenspiel 1999 influent flows return activated sludge ras surplus activated sludge sas and reactor volumes as well as the mass of the tracer recovered in each study were fed into each model as an example the initial layout of wwtp3 and its configuration implemented in the software are shown in fig 1 a and b for all the other wwtp see fig s4 in the supporting information the analysis proceeded as follows each wwtp s first simulation considered each lane or tank as one cstr subsequently each lane or tank was divided into 2 3 and so on cstrs according to the tanks in series model although in theory a plug flow reactor is equivalent to an infinite number of tanks in series in practice plug flow behaviour has been reported for values of n as low as 2 12 tanks in series metcalf and eddy 2003 tsai and chen 2013 therefore a conservative value of n 30 tanks in series was used to model a pure plug flow in each lane the models produced use very basic configurations for the reactors relying on the geometry of the tanks configurations that are more sophisticated would produce a better fit but were considered unnecessary for the purpose of this study 2 7 wwtp upgrade wwtp3 was upgraded in order to provide extra capacity required by a growing population the upgrade consisted of the construction of three concrete baffles in the front of the tank and the installation of a combination of a fine bubble diffused aeration fbda system aquaconsult aerostrip diffusers to replace disc aerators and an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system eliquo hydrok barnsley uk fig 1 a the ifas system consisted on four sets of textile mobile curtains biotextil cleartec jäger umwelt technik set parallel to the flow and attached to removable frames two tracer studies were carried out in this wwtp i e before and after modifications in order to find if the hydrodynamics would change perceptibly 2 8 modelling estrogen effluent concentrations in wwtps once the best fit tanks in series hydrodynamic model for each wwtp was selected the degradation of estrogens was included in the model in order to obtain the biodegradation rates for each estrogen in each degradation experiment a model considering parallel biodegradation and sorption similar to the one described by joss et al 2004 was chosen to fit the experimental data in this model which assumes biodegradation takes place exclusively in the aqueous phase and describes both biodegradation and adsorption as pseudo first order kinetics processes the mass flux of estrogen in the solid and aqueous phases would be described as follows 4 d c s d t k a d c a q k d e s c s 5 d c a q d t k b i o c a q k a d c a q k d e s c s with k a d k a d v s s k d e s k d e s v

pseudo first order adsorption constant l gvss 1 d 1 k des is the pseudo first order desorption constant l gvss 1 d 1 k bio is the pseudo first order biotransformation constant l gvss 1 d 1 and vss are the volatile suspended solids g l 1 however since as previously observed joss et al 2004 adsorption was instantaneous only k des and k bio had to be estimated estimates and methodology in section s5 in the supporting information the influent concentrations of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 implemented in the hydraulic models were those obtained as detailed in section 2 3 for each wwtp the removal of estrogens in the reactor was modelled according to different hydraulic scenarios firstly using the current hydrodynamics secondly assuming a hypothetical modification equivalent to that in wwtp3 assuming no concomitant change in the biology and lastly considering the reactor as an ideal plug flow 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance and efficiency of activated sludge processes in wwtps table 2 shows the results from the tracer studies and influent modelled concentrations of estrogens the experimental c pulse curve and visual best fits to the tanks in series model for wwtp3 are shown in fig 1 c for all the other wwtp see fig s4 in the supporting information these provide the number of tanks in series shown in table 2 although the geometries of the plants were very different the hydraulic performance of most of the as processes were quite similar all the wwtps apart from wwtp 5 behaved like 1 to 2 tanks in series n 1 2 presumably the aeration of asps promotes mixing and cstr like behaviour and overcomes any effects imposed by the geometry of the plant in most cases the observed and theoretical hrts were similar the measured value fell within the variability expected due to inlet and ras flow fluctuation table 2 however in wwtps 1 and 2 the observed hrt was substantially shorter than the theoretical value which suggests that there was either short circuiting or dead volume in the reactor levenspiel 1999 on the other hand in wwtp3 the observed hrt was higher than expected suggesting that either the wrong reactor volume or wrong flow was used in the model this discrepancy may happen because only daily average ras flow data were available for wwtp3 rather than the 15 min ras flow data available for all other wwtps the fortuitous modification of the aeration tank in wwtp3 changed the hydraulic behaviour therein the peak of the c pulse curve moved from 1 45 h to 2 33 h fig 1c and d and the shape of the curve was more symmetrical meaning the aeration tank is more plug flow like levenspiel 1999 likewise the fitting to the tanks in series model showed a change from 1 to 2 to 5 tanks in series 3 2 influence of hydraulic performance on modelled effluent concentrations there was a 15 fold variation between wwtps in the modelled estrogen effluent concentrations for e1 e2 and e3 while the variation was 3 fold for ee2 fig 2 obviously effluent concentrations decreased as the number of tanks in series increased fig 2 more importantly a very modest improvement from 1 to 2 tanks to 5 tanks had a substantial impact on effluent quality showing that meaningful improvements in performance can be made without attaining perfect plug flow some wwtps had a greater intrinsic ability to degrade certain estrogens than others the pseudo first order degradation rates k bio fig 2 obtained from the degradation experiments which were used to predict effluent concentrations for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 varied between wwtps by about one order of magnitude and were in the same range of the rates obtained in previous studies alvarino et al 2014 blair et al 2015 li et al 2005b petrie et al 2014 shi et al 2004 however this variability is not systematic i e there is not a single wwtp better at removing all the four estrogens this difference in the degradation rates implies that the biological degradation process could in principle be substantially improved presumably by optimizing other parameters that affect k bio e g srt e2 is an easily degradable compound 23 2 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 210 l gvss 1 d 1 the highest removal rates of all the estrogens in fact greater than 95 removal was achieved in the wwtps irrespective of their flow pattern fig s6 in the supporting information which is in agreement with many previous studies chimchirian et al 2007 clara et al 2005 hashimoto et al 2007 zhou et al 2012 still some of these studies detect e2 in effluents at concentrations ranging 1 2 ng l 1 chimchirian et al 2007 zhou et al 2012 which are above the proposed eqs 0 4 ng l 1 in the present study the modelled effluent concentration of e2 in wwtps 1 3 and 6 would not necessarily meet the putative eqs at all times based on their current hydraulic performance wwtp 3 whose e2 degradation rate is the lowest of the wwtps benefited from the modification going from an effluent concentration of 0 32 0 12 ng l 1 with the old geometry to 0 04 0 03 ng l 1 that would allow it to comply with the putative eqs despite the observed variability due to diurnal flow fluctuations fig 2 this predicted effluent concentration neglects any additional biological benefit that the ifas and new aeration system may also confer wwtp1 and wwtp6 would also benefit from similar modifications an improvement to five tanks in series would guarantee compliance to the e2 eqs for both wwtps ee2 is the most recalcitrant of the four estrogens 0 3 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 2 9 l gvss 1 d 1 in fact the 0 035 ng l 1 putative eqs 0 035 ng l 1 would not be reached in any of the wwtps studied here even with an ideal plug flow which agrees with previous findings from a survey across 162 uk wwtps that showed that all wwtps would need significant dilution 7 33 times dilution depending on the wwtp by receiving waters in order to reach the proposed eqs gardner et al 2012 however this does not necessarily mean that the prospective eqs would not be achievable since the median annual dilution factor in uk rivers has been predicted to be 37 keller et al 2014 however dilution is not a very satisfying method of protecting the environment for wwtp7 and wwtp8 optimization to plug flow would translate to an approximate 50 reduction in ee2 effluent concentration this is the result of a combination of factors not only were the k bio higher for these plants but they also operated at high solids concentrations table 1 however it is noticeable that for the majority of the wwtps improvement in ee2 final effluent concentrations through hydraulics alone is negligible with the current flow pattern the required k bio for ee2 to ensure an effluent concentration lower than the 0 035 ng l 1 putative eqs would vary between 22 9 2 6 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp2 to 83 6 32 1 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp6 fig 3 however a more efficient flow pattern would substantially lower the minimum k bio required for compliance from 6 2 1 6 l gvss 1 d 1 in wwtp7 to 18 5 1 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp6 which could be optimised by modifying other parameters e g srt this further emphasizes the importance of the hydraulic flow pattern to the biological removal of micropollutants a more efficient hydraulic behaviour reduces the required improvements in biology there are currently no proposed eqs for e1 and e3 and only a few studies address their effect on aquatic organisms nonetheless pnecs of 6 ng l 1 and 60 ng l 1 respectively have been suggested for both compounds based on in vivo vitellogenin potency data caldwell et al 2012 e3 is relatively easily degradable 9 9 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 39 5 l gvss 1 d 1 and except for wwtp 6 the current flow pattern in all wwtps would be enough to guarantee an effluent concentration below the proposed pnec wwtp 6 however would be able to meet the pnec most of the time if the flow pattern was changed to five tanks in series it is worth mentioning that wwtp3 wwtp6 and wwtp7 have similar pseudo first order degradation rates 11 7 9 9 and 13 8 l gvss 1 d 1 respectively but a higher solids concentration table 1 allows wwtp 3 and wwtp7 to comfortably meet the pnec this highlights the important role of biomass concentration in the optimization of micropollutant degradation in asps e1 is less biodegradable 2 6 l gvss 1 d 1 k bio 19 2 l gvss 1 d 1 and between 56 and 100 was removed fig s2 only wwtp 7 would initially meet the 6 ng l 1 pnec but other wwtps would potentially go below that concentration after modification to 5 tanks in series in fact this would be enough to place wwtp 8 below the pnec wwtps 2 and 6 would also benefit from the modification but their compliance would still be limited by the flow variation although an eqs has not been proposed for e1 its contribution to the total estrogenicity of wastewater should not be disregarded caldwell et al 2012 because of its potency and typically elevated influent concentrations compared to e2 and ee2 3 3 engineering implications if we wish to proactively engineer the removal of micropollutants in wwtp we must consider the flow pattern the first order removal rate the hydraulic retention time the load and the desired eqs the flow pattern is an essential and overlooked element in this paper we have demonstrated that accurate knowledge of reactor hydraulics is essential to understanding both the performance of a reactor and the potential for improving that performance in general we found that the higher the k bio the more leeway for improvement from hydrodynamics up to the point where k bio was so high that complete degradation is achieved anyway thus for easily degradable compounds like e2 and e3 and to a lesser extent e1 a slight modification of the reactor would lead to significant reductions in the final effluent concentrations this is important because it would apply to all pollutants including some harmful substances whose k bio are in a similar range however the usefulness of hydrodynamic improvements will depend on the proposed eqs or pnecs of any given substance simply increasing the hrt in these wwtps would have ensured compliance of some e2 and e3 but not all e1 and ee2 compounds table 3 crucially a small improvement in the efficiency of the flow pattern can make changes in hrt much more effective in a plug flow reactor the relationship between the concentration of pollutants c and hrt is exponential eq 1 which means that a modification in the hrt will have a greater impact on effluent concentrations in a plug flow reactor than in a cstr thus modest modifications to optimise the flow pattern from 1 to 5 tanks in series would also result in a greater sensitivity of final effluent concentrations to small changes in hrt the hrt required for compliance decreases dramatically when simulating the aeration tanks with the aforementioned upgrade to 5 tanks in series table 3 this means that after such modifications all the wwtps except wwtp5 could meet the pnec for e1 by implementing a longer hrt that still falls inside those considered typical for asps metcalf and eddy 2003 and wwtps 7 and 8 could meet the eqs for ee2 with a high but still reasonable hrt these sensitivities to hrt variations further emphasize the benefits of optimizing the hydrodynamics of aeration tanks in the future one could envisage the use of cfd in also helping to achieve this task a consideration of hydrodynamics can improve performance directly and lowers the bar for effective improvements in removal rates based on other factors that can optimise k bio such as the solids retention time or indeed may help to reduce ozonation requirements if tertiary treatment is deemed necessary clearly understanding and improving the removal of ee2 is an important and urgent task 4 conclusions the current work aimed to quantify the role of flow pattern in aeration tanks on the removal of estrogens in full scale wwtps the results indicate that there is leeway for improving biological degradation by an initial adequate design or even by some minor modifications to existing plants to promote more plug flow like behaviour the hydraulic behaviour of the majority of the as reactors in this study was more similar to a cstr than to a plug flow reactor despite their different geometries slight modifications in the geometry of a full scale aeration tank caused an improvement in its hydraulic behaviour from 1 to 2 to 5 tanks in series turning it into a more plug flow like reactor these modifications would in theory have a substantial impact on effluent quality enhancing the removal of the natural estrogens and leading to the compliance of e2 to the putative eqs effluent concentrations of the synthetic ee2 would not be significantly reduced with these modifications and wwtps would have to rely on river dilution in order to meet the 0 035 ng l 1 putative eqs however a more efficient flow pattern would substantially lower the minimum k bio required for ee2 compliance of from 6 2 1 6 l gvss 1 d 1 in wwtp7 to 18 5 1 l gvss 1 d 1 wwtp6 a more plug flow hydraulic behaviour would also result in a greater sensitivity of final effluent concentrations to small changes in hrt further emphasizing the importance of the hydraulic flow pattern to the biological removal of micropollutants and the benefits of optimizing the hydrodynamics of aeration tanks reactor hydraulic optimization can provide a tool to minimize the effluent concentrations for the most easily degradable estrogens and alleviate the need for advanced oxidation processes conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of

18553,high solids anaerobic digestion hs ad of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw is operated at a total solid ts content 10 to enhance the waste treatment economy though it might be associated to free ammonia nh3 inhibition this study aimed to calibrate and cross validate a hs ad model for homogenized reactors in order to assess the effects of high nh3 levels in hs ad of ofmsw but also to evaluate the suitability of the reversible non competitive inhibition function to reproduce the effect of nh3 on the main acetogenic and methanogenic populations the practical identifiability of structural biochemical parameters i e 35 and initial conditions i e 32 was evaluated using batch experiments at different ts and or inoculum to substrate ratios variance based global sensitivity analysis and approximate bayesian computation were used for parameter optimization the experimental data in this study permitted to estimate up to 8 biochemical parameters whereas the rest of parameters and biomass contents were poorly identifiable the study also showed the relatively high levels of nh3 i e up to 2 3 g n l and ionic strength i e up to 0 9 m when increasing ts in hs ad of ofmsw however the nh3 non competitive function was unable to capture the acetogenic methanogenic inhibition therefore the calibration emphasized the need for target oriented experimental data to enhance the practical identifiability and the predictive capabilities of structured hs ad models but also the need for further testing the nh3 inhibition function used in these simulations graphical abstract image 1 keywords high solids anaerobic digestion model ammonia inhibition ionic strength global sensitivity analysis approximate bayesian computation 1 introduction high solids anaerobic digestion hs ad of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw is operated at total solids ts 10 to minimize the reactor volume the water addition and the digestate dewatering pastor poquet et al 2019a hs ad can also lead up to 80 ts removal easing the digestate post treatment however hs ad of ofmsw is usually associated to free ammonia nh3 inhibition resulting in volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation nh3 affects both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens but also the rest of vfa degraders acetogens in anaerobic digestion ad being the inhibition related to the operative parameters i e temperature and ph and the biomass acclimation rajagopal et al 2013 adding lignocellulosic materials to ofmsw permits to minimize the buildup of total ammonia nitrogen tan while the low hydrolysis rates of these materials permit to increase the ts content and to counteract the vfa accumulation in hs ad capson tojo et al 2017 pastor poquet et al 2019a however including lignocellulosic waste in ofmsw depends on the season or the local waste management strategy whether or not a lignocellulosic co substrate is used understanding the effects of nh3 inhibition is crucial to optimize hs ad of ofmsw a hs ad model was recently developed for homogenized reactors to evaluate the nh3 inhibition in hs ad of ofmsw pastor poquet et al 2018 2019b this structured model based on the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 gathers the main bio physical chemical mechanisms in hs ad in the hs ad model apparent i e kmol kg h2o instead of global i e kmol kg concentrations determine the effect of ts upon solutes as a consequence of the low water content within hs ad meanwhile an extended set of mass balances allows the simulation of the organic mass removal from the biogas production a liquid solution non ideality subroutine was subsequently included in the model as a function of the ionic strength i since non ideality determines the ph co2 liquid gas transfer and nh3 inhibition in hs ad pastor poquet et al 2019b as a preliminary assumption the hs ad model included a reversible non competitive inhibition function by nh3 inh3 equation 1 in the biochemical rates of all acetogenic and methanogenic populations a mathematical resource commonly used in structured ad models astals et al 2018 1 i n h 3 k i s n h 3 k i s n h 3 s n h 3 a p p simulating the nh3 inhibition at high ts with the hs ad model requires an adequate set of input parameters θ to be estimated by calibration pastor poquet et al 2018 2019b θ includes both the structural biochemical parameters θ p and the initial and influent conditions θ b θ θ p θ b nonetheless calibration of structured ad models is not trivial due to the equation complexity and large number of θ involved dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 donoso bravo et al 2011 to calibrate a mathematical model θ must be structurally and practically identifiable instead of correlated the θ structural identifiability is theoretically assessed assuming noise free experimental data and error free model structure noteworthy nearly all θ in adm1 are locally structurally identifiable nimmegeers et al 2017 this is a prerequisite to assess the θ practical identifiability and calibrate the hs ad model using imperfect experimental data unfortunately the reduced number of experimental data often available and or the presence of experimental errors yield non identifiable parameters i e parameters that cannot be uniquely estimated these are known as practical identifiability issues calibration usually consists of minimizing an objective function j θ that condenses the goodness of fitting between the experimental data y and the model outputs y sim θ being these outputs a function of n input parameters θ dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 flotats et al 2010 several j θ can be used to calibrate ad models as the weighted sum of squares or any user defined alternative donoso bravo et al 2011 ratto et al 2001 assuming the existence of a global minimum optimum for an objective function j θ opt this value is reached using the optimal set of input parameters θ opt practical identifiability issues commonly translate into j θ showing many local optimums and or flat valleys where the precise value of θ cannot be easily determined guisasola et al 2006 rodriguez fernandez et al 2006 thus only practical identification of a reduced θ subset i e n n is often possible for adm1 based models nimmegeers et al 2017 this is called model over parameterization i e the modification of two individual θ θ i with i 1 n can lead to a similar model output particularly when using batch experiments highly dependent on the initial conditions to calibrate ad models different sets of experimental conditions including different inoculum to substrate ratios isr are required to reduce the θ correlation donoso bravo et al 2011 flotats et al 2010 two main approaches can be used to calibrate complex models the bayesian and the frequentist the frequentist approach searches for optimal θ values θ opt whereas the bayesian approach considers θ opt as probabilistic distributions conditioned on the experimental data p θ opt y instead of single values ratto et al 2001 rodriguez fernandez et al 2006 saltelli et al 2006 in both approaches when facing over parameterization it must be assessed which θ i significantly influence y sim θ sensitivity analysis and need to be adequately calibrated adm1 based models contain several θ p i e 35 and θ b i e 24 θ p might be obtained from literature though a different model structure from where these θ p were obtained potentially influences the optimal θ p values distributions pastor poquet et al 2019b on the other hand θ b might not be easily determined due to the lack of experimental data or the difficulties to translate the data into adequate model units donoso bravo et al 2011 flotats et al 2003 parameter inference based on the bayes theorem equation 2 is particularly suited to calibrate structured ad models since it can deal with complex j θ showing several optima or flat geometries where frequentist inference might not be well suited kennedy and o hagan 2001 toni and stumpf 2010 in bayesian inference the prior parameter distribution p θ is sampled to obtain the posterior parameter distribution p θ y conditioned on the experimental data y and the likelihood function p y θ while p y can be considered as a normalizing constant importantly any user defined j θ arising from p y θ can be used in informal statistical approaches equation 3 as variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa and approximate bayesian computation abc donoso bravo et al 2011 nott et al 2012 2 p θ y p y θ p θ p y 3 j θ f p y θ variance based gsa provides an appropriate assessment about the potentiality of θ i to influence the model outputs and the correlations existing with the rest of θ θ j with j 1 n and i j kennedy and petropoulos 2017 oakley and o hagan 2004 similarly abc permits also to highlight practical identifiability issues yielding simultaneously the most likely p θ y beaumont et al 2009 filippi et al 2013 toni and stumpf 2010 as main disadvantage bayesian inference is often computationally intensive the mathematical performance of the hs ad model was previously verified though the model was only validated for a single hs ad batch experiment due to the elevated number of θ requiring calibration i e 30 pastor poquet et al 2018 2019b instead this study aimed to fully calibrate and cross validate the hs ad model to simulate the effect of high nh3 levels in hs ad of ofmsw while testing the non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 on the main acetogenic methanogenic populations in particular this study assessed the practical identifiability of 35 θ p and 32 θ b by using nine hs ad batch digesters at different ts and or isr as a source of experimental data identifiability was assessed by variance based gsa and abc permitting to approximate also p θ y importantly the proposed methodology can be easily readapted to account for further hs ad datasets e g batch continuous and or model configurations 2 methodology 2 1 experimental data to calibrate and cross validate the hs ad model while further evaluating the effects of increasing the initial ts content on hs ad simulations four different batch experiments were used at thermophilic 55 c conditions from 10 to 30 ts table 1 the laboratory scale reactor design volume vreactor was either 160 or 280 ml for the different experiments in all experiments centrifuged inoculum was used to increase simultaneously the initial ts and isr these small scale digesters were manually shaken when the biogas production was measured the batch experiments are described next whereas a thorough description of these experiments and the bio physical chemical analyses performed was reported elsewhere pastor poquet et al 2019a experiment 1 consisted of a sacrifice test for mono digestion of ofmsw using isr 1 00 g vs g vs in this experiment the main physical chemical dynamics i e biogas production and composition ts vs vfa tan and mono valent ions were evaluated at different operational times in experiments 2 to 4 the biogas production and composition were measured at different experimental times whereas the rest of physical chemical analyses i e ts vs vfa tan and ions were only performed before starting and after ending each experiment non sacrifice experiments included mono digestion of ofmsw using isr 1 50 g vs g vs experiment 2 and isr 0 50 g vs g vs experiment 3 but also co digestion of ofmsw and beech sawdust using isr 0 16 g vs g vs experiment 4 within experiments 2 and 4 different initial ts contents dilutions were evaluated though all the initial batch conditions contained exactly the same amount of substrate and centrifuged inoculum briefly 1 the inoculum was centrifuged 2 the same amount of substrate and inoculum was added to each bottle 3 distilled water was added to reach the different ts contents and 4 each bottle was manually homogenized this strategy was aimed to use the mass balances among the different initial ts conditions as explained in section 2 3 1 since soluble materials were partially removed when centrifuging the inoculum in total nine different hs ad batch conditions were assessed at different ts isr and or co digestion ratios subsequently named as batch no 1 to 9 table 1 2 2 hs ad model the hs ad model included the main biochemical rates of pastor poquet et al 2018 though some minor modifications were also implemented table 2 firstly a reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 was included in the valeric sva butyric sbu propionic spro and hydrogen sh2 uptake rates similarly to the nh3 snh3 inhibition on the acetate sac uptake aiming to simulate the vfa accumulation observed in the hs ad experiments being a likely consequence of the nh3 buildup pastor poquet et al 2019a secondly carbohydrates xch were split into readily biodegradable xch fast and slowly biodegradable xch slow to simulate the relatively lower hydrolysis rates of sawdust and the longer methane production observed in co digestion experiments i e 200 d table 1 importantly the hydrolysis of both xch fast and xch slow pooled into soluble sugars ssu 2 3 model calibration and cross validation a common set of biochemical parameters was used for all hs ad simulations at different isr and or ts contents all biochemical parameters for thermophilic 55 c ad were extracted from batstone et al 2002 though some of those needed to be calibrated i e θ p to improve the model fitting the initial conditions of the batch experiments were predefined according to the experimental data available as described by pastor poquet et al 2018 and also mentioned next moreover different ranges of initial biomass concentrations were used i e θ b to assess the potential interrelationship of θ b with θ p in batch experiments 2 3 1 initial conditions the initial conditions used for each batch simulation are shown in table 3 since the same amount of substrate and inoculum was used along different initial ts contents in experiment 2 but also in experiment 4 mass balances were used to reduce the number of unknown initial conditions table 1 to use mass balances the anaerobic biodegradability bd of each substrate inoculum mixture in experiment 2 and experiment 4 was assumed constant whereas the soluble s and particulate x components were assumed proportional among the different ts contents with these assumptions mass balances permitted to extrapolate the molar and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations as a function of the initial reactor content mass mglobal reactor content specific weight ρglobal and reactor content volume vglobal for example the concentration of acetoclastic methanogens xac in batch no 3 was approximated from batch no 2 as xac batch3 xac batch2 vglobal batch2 vglobal batch3 the nitrogen content of soluble si and particulate xi inert in each substrate inoculum mixture ni subs determined the initial protein xpr amino acid saa content according to the nitrogen balance as shown elsewhere pastor poquet et al 2018 thus ni subs was different for each batch experiment table 3 on the other hand despite the initial conditions of batch experiments were maintained for all the hs ad simulations different biomass concentrations i e degraders of sugars xsu amino acids xaa long chain fatty acids xfa valerate xc5 butyrate xbu propionate xpro acetate xac and hydrogen xh2 were also assessed as mentioned before finally since mass balances were used among different ts in experiments 2 and 4 only the initial conditions of batch no 1 2 6 and 7 table 1 were evaluated 2 3 2 biochemical parameters biomass concentrations and calibration ranges the modified biochemical parameters θ p and modified biomass concentrations θ b in this study including their initial values and potential variability ranges are shown in table 4 in total 35 θ p and 32 θ b were evaluated θ p related to the hydrolysis sugar fractioning fsu maximum growth rate km and half saturation constant ks but also the ph nh3 and h2 inhibition constants ki since all these θ p are simultaneously associated to the substrate under study are correlated among themselves and strongly regulate the biogas production composition from solid substrates batstone et al 2002 garcia gen et al 2015 on the other hand θ b included all the initial biomass concentrations in the hs ad simulations i e xsu xaa xfa xc5 xbu xpro xac and xh2 as these concentrations might not only strongly influence the biogas production during the initial days of batch experiments but might also be potentially interrelated among themselves and or to the previous θ p the sugars uptake yields butyrate fbu su propionate fpro su acetate fac su and hydrogen fh2 su as cod fractions in adm1 therefore a maximum of three fractions can be selected simultaneously to fulfill the cod balance fbu su fpro su fac su fh2 su 1 in this study fbu su fac su and fh2 su were selected while fpro su was recalculated fpro su 1 fbu su fac su fh2 su importantly further structural parameters and initial conditions need to be induced in the hs ad model as for example the amino acid aa saa fractioning and the biomass yield coefficients yb though these were not assessed here aiming to reduce the problem under study in either case the proposed methodology for calibration validation can easily include any further θ variability ranges for structural parameters are suggested in adm1 batstone et al 2002 however considerably wider ranges were assessed in this study to emphasize the absence of prior knowledge about the optimal values for simplicity all θ p were allowed to vary by 90 from their initial values θ p 0 1 0 9 θ p 0 θ p 1 0 9 θ p 0 uniform p θ p table 4 as the only exception the lower ph threshold for acetoclastic methanogens phll ac was bounded between a ph value where methanogenesis potentially collapses i e 5 0 and the upper ph threshold for acetoclastic methanogens phul ac i e 7 0 to maintain the suitability of the hill function to simulate the ph inhibition table 2 different methods are available to approximate the initial conditions i e biomass concentrations in batch simulations as for example simulating a continuous reactor fed with exactly the same substrate until reaching steady state and then use these steady conditions to initialize the batch simulations dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 donoso bravo et al 2011 however since the inoculum was centrifuged right before setting the batch experiments in this study absence of prior knowledge about the initial biomass concentrations was preferred to explore homogeneously different orders of magnitude in the biomass concentrations often 0 θ b 1 kmol cod m3 the logarithm transformed θ b were allowed to vary by 50 from their initial values θ b 0 1 0 5 log 10 θ b 0 log 10 θ b 1 0 5 log 10 θ b 0 uniform p log 10 θ b table 4 2 3 3 objective function the weighted sum of squares between all the available experimental and the corresponding simulated values was used as objective function j θ equation 4 j θ was adapted from flotats et al 2003 to assess the model goodness

p y i j t y i j 2 noteworthy only 6 out of 9 experimental conditions were used to calculate j θ in this study batch no 1 3 5 6 7 and 9 table 1 meanwhile 3 out of 9 experimental conditions were used for cross validation batch no 2 4 and 8 table 1 other experimental combinations could be used for calibration cross validation as for example batch no 2 4 5 7 and 8 for calibration and batch no 1 3 6 and 9 for cross validation however the configuration used in this study permitted to include the most extreme hs ad conditions for model calibration i e ts 10 and ts 30 while intermediate conditions i e 10 ts 30 were used for cross validation this strategy also aimed to enhance the number of experimental data used for calibration and to ensure the most diverse operative conditions where θ might be representative additionally the proposed configuration included the most informative dataset i e batch no 1 to increase the complexity of j θ and remove identifiability issues related to the lack of bio physical chemical dynamics in the overall experimental dataset as further discussed in section 3 1 3 2 3 4 global sensitivity analysis gsa was aimed to highlight the most influential θ to be calibrated with the available set of experimental data for gsa multiple θ combinations were used to evaluate j θ equation 4 latin hypercube sampling lhs served to explore the global θ space solon et al 2015 subsequently j θ arrays and their corresponding θ were assessed by the gsa engine of kennedy and o hagan 2001 and oakley and o hagan 2004 the gsa engine calculates the individual ie and global ge effects of θ i upon the global model output e g p y θ j θ variance on the other hand the gsa engine provides also all the double correlations between θ i and θ j i e θ i θ j being i j both ie and θ i θ j are expressed as a percentage of the global variance explained thus θ i showing a relatively low ie are associated to poor practical identifiability since these θ i influence minimally the model output meanwhile ge comprises ie the double correlations θ i θ j and all the rest of multiple correlations for a single θ i therefore ge itself should not be used to assess the identifiability instead the overall correlation of θ i with θ can be inferred by the relative difference between ie and ge though ie and ge are expressed in different units as interactions can be repeated in the ge of two or more θ i oakley and o hagan 2004 saltelli et al 2006 summarizing both a low ie and a large ie to ge difference mean poor identifiability for a single θ i though a priori no fixed threshold neither for ie nor for ge minus ie permits to distinguish whether θ i should be considered as non identifiable a maximum θ subset of n 30 and or 400 simulations of j θ can be evaluated simultaneously with the gsa engine kennedy and petropoulos 2017 therefore to assess θ interactions when n 30 a combination strategy was followed firstly 30 θ i were randomly selected and evaluated by gsa i e gsa no 1 from these θ only those showing the smallest ie e g 1 were disregarded as non identifiable removed from the initial θ subset and not used for further gsa importantly these non identifiable θ i were fixed at their initial values table 4 for all subsequent model simulations since non identifiability implies that these θ can be fixed at any value within p θ dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 guisasola et al 2006 then θ p and or θ b non previously assessed by gsa were combined with the non removed θ subset and a new gsa was performed i e gsa no 2 the gsa methodology was repeated until the last remaining θ subset was considered as potentially identifiable θ in total seven gsa with different θ combinations were progressively performed table 5 in this study the only criterion for non identifiability was assumed as ie 0 20 which also coincided with a relatively low ge i e 4 5 though this conservative criterion could be modified as mentioned in section 3 1 1 to enhance the gsa representativeness in presence of a high number of θ i e 20 n 30 and or wide variability ranges i e 50 each gsa was conducted in triplicate and the results averaged finally all j θ arrays used for gsa were searched for the minimum observed value j min θ i e j θ opt to be subsequently used in abc 2 3 5 approximate bayesian computation the θ posterior distribution p θ y was assessed by abc toni and stumpf 2010 in short multiple simulations were carried at different θ combinations sampled by lhs whereas relatively high j θ values were discarded by a progressively stringent criterion based in a tolerance coefficient ɛ i e 1 0 in other words only j θ j min θ ɛ were accepted for posterior evaluation p θ j θ j min θ ɛ with this approach θ identifiability was further assessed by the convergence in the confidence range in this study ɛ was successively reduced from 2 50 to 1 05 i e 2 50 1 80 1 30 1 10 and 1 05 within each explored j θ j min θ ɛ range 400 simulations were used θ were allowed to vary within the same range used for gsa table 4 meanwhile the 5 95 interquartile range of each θ was used as confidence range but also as a criterion for identifiability convergence the posterior mean median mode kurtosis skewness and correlation matrix were also evaluated as described in martin and ayesa 2010 2 3 6 cross validation cross validation assesses the model goodness of fitting in experiments not used for calibration bennett et al 2013 in this study the θ posterior mean was considered as θ opt thus θ opt were used to simulate all batch experiments including the three experimental conditions selected for cross validation batch no 2 4 and 8 table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 gsa selecting the most influencing input parameters for calibration 3 1 1 preliminary identifiability assessment gsa results are summarized in table 5 gsa was started with 30 θ p and progressively led to only 14 θ 13 θ p i e kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km pro km ac km h2 kd phll ac fbu su fac su fh2 su and 1 θ b i e xac batch7 in this study only the θ i showing ie 0 20 were fixed at their initial values table 4 to enhance the capabilities of gsa and abc for calibrating structured ad models as mentioned in section 2 3 4 the overall j θ variance explained by the gsa engine was around 70 in all cases confirming the validity of this methodology to assess the most influential θ in the hs ad model oakley and o hagan 2004 ie provides a relative measure of the θ i practical identifiability while a high θ i correlation high difference between ie and ge suggests that θ i cannot be independently calibrated with the available set of experimental data saltelli et al 2006 as an example gsa no 1 showed that 40 7 out of 72 4 of the global j θ variance was explained by adding up the ie of 30 θ p table 5 while the remaining 31 7 variance was explained by correlations among these for example km c4 explained individually around 4 4 of the global variance i e ie though showing ge up to 17 9 this meant that the correlation of km c4 with other θ was high and any improvement in j θ obtained by solely modifying km c4 could be partially or totally compensated by the modification of a correlated θ i in this line the km c4 fbu bu correlation in gsa no 1 explained up to 2 8 of the global variance data not shown due to the influence of fbu su in j θ i e ie 2 0 and ge 24 4 table 5 in this study θ i were disregarded by a single and low demanding criterion i e ie 0 20 table 5 since any chosen criterion for potential identifiability would influence the gsa results when n 30 meanwhile gsa also depends on n i e 30 and or the particular combination of θ p and θ b used thus using a more demanding identifiability criterion e g ie 0 50 instead of 0 20 might have led to discard θ i during preliminary gsa runs which would be subsequently characterized as potentially identifiable for example gsa no 1 showed an ie 0 22 for km c5 whereas gsa no 7 eventually showed an ie 0 67 table 5 to enhance identifiability a strategy to reduce the gap between ie and ge for each θ i is required kennedy and petropoulos 2017 however reducing the ie to ge gap in this study would require to readapt the criterion used for potential identifiability one strategy might consist on fixing those θ i showing for example ie 0 30 in gsa no 7 i e fac su and then perform further rounds of gsa i e gsa no 8 until ie ge for all θ i with all the above a second assessment for identifiability can be useful when using variance based gsa for structured ad models abc is a well suited tool in this regard yielding also p θ y in contrast to gsa importantly both methodologies should yield equivalent results regarding the θ i identifiability though abc is much computationally intensive than gsa as explained in section 3 2 1 3 1 2 importance of the p θ for model calibration it must be noted that any p θ could be used to calibrate ad models provided that θ do not contradict biochemical laws e g θ p 0 and θ b 0 or disrupt mathematical resources e g phul ac phll ac and the overall p θ range is as densely and homogeneously sampled as possible on the other hand the p θ distribution used e g uniform log transformed uniform normal can be also crucial to determine p θ y and the overall θ estimation in this study using triplicates permitted to enhance the gsa representativeness overall sampling in presence of large n and p θ ranges meanwhile a uniform distribution with mostly a 90 modification was predefined for θ p whereas a log transformed uniform distribution with a 50 modification was allowed for θ b table 4 as mentioned in section 2 3 2 these specific p θ ranges were considered sufficiently wide for the objectives of this study and were based mainly on experience and visual analysis of the overall model results particularly the order of magnitude of many θ p are relatively well characterized in literature according to their corresponding bio physical chemical meaning nonetheless the order of magnitude of θ b is highly unknown particularly after the inoculum centrifugation used in this study thus using a uniform p θ permitted to emphasize the precision over punctual θ p values within the p θ p range whereas the precision over the unknown order of magnitude in the θ b range was emphasized by using a log transformed uniform distribution p log 10 θ b with all the above using a different p θ range or distribution might alter the results of variance based gsa and the overall calibration of structured ad models for example using considerably narrower p θ p ranges in gsa no 1 i e 1 0 3 θ p 0 θ p 1 0 3 θ p 0 uniform p θ p resulted in some θ p which were highlighted as potentially identifiable in this study being disregarded as non identifiable e g kh pr and km c4 likely because part of their optimal or sub optimal θ p values were left outside the p θ p range supplementary information on the other hand using wider ranges i e 0 01 θ p 0 θ p 3 θ p 0 uniform p θ p the results were not substantially different i e only the km c5 identifiability was additionally disregarded by gsa no 1 however using a log transformed uniform distribution i e 1 0 5 log 10 θ p 0 log 10 θ p 1 0 5 log10 θ p 0 uniform p log 10 θ p relatively altered the results of gsa no 1 i e the order of magnitude of km c5 and km c4 was disregarded while the order of magnitude of kh ch slow and ks xh2 has was highlighted as highly important for the hs ad model calibration therefore for the correct calibration of structured ad models both the p θ range and distribution should be set accordingly to all the prior information available for these θ minimizing the p θ range explored alongside the number of simulations required for the objectives of the study 3 1 3 importance of the available data for model calibration provided θ are structurally identifiable practical identifiability relates to the quantity as well as the quality i e experimental errors and or the sampling frequency of the experimental data available donoso bravo et al 2011 guisasola et al 2006 nimmegeers et al 2017 rodriguez fernandez et al 2006 particularly a reduced number of experimental data associated to some model dynamics usually prevents practical identifiability of the θ involved in these specific dynamics for example yb might not be identifiable in ad models provided that the biomass concentration dynamics were measured bernard et al 2001 in this study the hydrolysis constant of readily biodegradable carbohydrates kh ch fast and lipids kh li but also the maximum growth rate of sugar km su and amino acid km aa degraders showed a reduced influence in j θ by gsa these results suggest that either insufficient experimental data was available to calibrate kh ch fast kh li km su and km aa or that the biogas production in the hs ad batch experiments table 1 was mostly influenced by the vfa uptake as the main limiting step in the same line due to the monod properties km and ks might be correlated when using batch experiments for calibration dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 flotats et al 2010 guisasola et al 2006 nevertheless gsa showed negligible influence for all ks in this study likely due to using different batch experiments i e isr and ts and or a reduced number of experimental data to obtain j θ equation 4 the liquid gas transfer coefficient kla was also disregarded during the initial steps of gsa i e ie 0 07 and ge 0 39 table 5 the kla coefficient is related to the homogenization and mixing strategy as well as other operational parameters in ad e g temperature and ph batstone et al 2002 in this study all the hs ad digesters were manually shaken however increasing the ts content can hamper the liquid gas transfer mechanisms in hs ad pastor poquet et al 2019a therefore a calibration strategy should be specifically envisaged to correctly calibrate kla e g using different stirring velocities devices for mixing since the presence of several θ in hs ad models can prevent identifiability of kla with the reduced number of experimental data usually available importantly both the nh3 and h2 inhibition parameters table 2 were shown as non identifiable in this study despite the strong influence of these parameters to regulate the biogas production in an adm1 based model as mentioned in section 2 3 2 these results were associated to the reduced tan and vfa dynamics in the experimental data since only one single sacrifice experiment was available for calibration validation therefore despite using different initial conditions i e isr and or ts for model calibration the nh3 inhibition parameters in hs ad of ofmsw cannot be assessed by using traditional batch experiments where only the biogas production and composition are usually dynamically evaluated the above results condense the importance of an adequate sampling to enhance identifiability in ad models but also to test hypotheses regarding the effects of inhibitory substances in hs ad particularly an extensive sampling for vfa ph and tan at different operational times during batch experiments is required to identify crucial parameters regarding the nh3 inhibition in hs ad of ofmsw therefore sacrifice experiments and or any sampling technique for batch setups allowing the thorough characterization of the reactor content variables in dynamic mode should be recommended to calibrate structured hs ad models using batch experiments on the other hand including semi continuous datasets when available might also alleviate these identifiability issues during calibration bennett et al 2013 nimmegeers et al 2017 3 1 4 the importance of initial conditions for model calibration interestingly all θ b except xac batch7 were shown as non identifiable in this study table 5 the reason presumably lies on the high km of all microorganisms shading the effect of their initial concentration for example xpro was associated to a maximum growth rate km pro around 10 d 1 table 4 thus xpro doubles within 1 h i e log 2 k m log 2 24 10 0 6 h whereas the hs ad batch experiments lasted considerably longer than 20 days table 1 xac and xh2 are important variables to avoid batch acidification during the initial 0 10 days of hs ad simulations due to the rapid changes occurring in the bio physical chemistry during these days and the influence of these two microbial populations to define the buffering capacity batstone et al 2002 capson tojo et al 2017 nonetheless these biomass concentrations were also rapidly disregarded by gsa in this study tables 3 and 4 except the potential identifiability of xac batch7 suggested by gsa no 7 which was likely explained by the influence of the order of magnitude of this particular biomass content to regulate the risk of acidification of the most extreme hs ad condition in experiment 7 i e batch no 9 ts 30 table 1 with all the above it is likely that only the initial biomass magnitude not a precise value was needed to calibrate the hs ad model based on batch experiments in other words approximate biomass concentrations serve mainly to avoid acidification in the hs ad batch simulations since these might not influence significantly the model calibration the θ influence on j θ in this study was further assessed by abc 3 2 parameter optimization 3 2 1 second identifiability assessment fig 1 shows p θ y using ɛ 1 05 the main statistics for these p θ y are summarized in table 6 including the confidence ranges i e 5 95 interquartile range since a reliable assessment of the θ confidence range is as important as the value of θ opt themselves guisasola et al 2006 the correlation matrix is included as supplementary information fig 2 shows the 5 95 interquartile range vs ɛ since reducing progressively ɛ permitted to assess the convergence of the θ posterior as second identifiability assessment parameter identifiability is roughly associated to the sharpness of the posterior distribution p θ y martin and ayesa 2010 toni and stumpf 2010 in this line kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km ac phll ac and fbu su showed relatively well defined bell shaped distributions by abc suggesting an adequate identifiability fig 1 meanwhile km pro km h2 kd xac batch7 fac su and fh2 su showed a more uniform like distribution suggesting a poorer identifiability the substantial reduction observed in the interquartile range for kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km ac phll ac and fbu su i e 60 80 corroborated their adequate identifiability in this study in contrast to km pro km h2 kd xac batch7 fac su and fh2 su that showed a much constant interquartile range i e 50 reduction fig 2 the poor practical identifiability of these last θ is explained by their high correlation with the rest of θ for example the fac su fbu su correlation was 0 82 while km pro kd was 0 72 data not shown as suggested in section 3 1 4 xac batch7 served mainly to counteract the potential acidification in batch no 9 since the poor reduction in the interquartile range i e 23 alongside the high correlation with other θ i e phll ac xac batch7 0 24 indicated that only an approximate biomass content is needed to calibrate structured hs ad models based on batch experiments as expected abc supported the identifiability assessment previously performed by gsa in particular θ showing ie 1 5 in gsa no 7 i e km pro km h2 and fac su table 5 were associated to a poor identifiability however some parameters showing an ie 1 5 in gsa no 7 i e kd xac batch7 and fh2 su were also indicated as non identifiable by abc in contrast to gsa suggesting that abc was a more sensitive methodology for parameter identifiability in this study with all the above a more restrictive ie threshold i e 0 50 instead of 0 20 could have been used in further gsa rounds once fixing poorly identifiable parameters to any value within the prior as mentioned in section 3 1 1 abc is computationally intensive due to the high level of j θ j min θ ɛ rejection particularly when using highly demanding ɛ filippi et al 2013 toni and stumpf 2010 for example the acceptance ratio was 0 129 when using ɛ 1 80 meaning that only 1 out of 8 simulations was accepted for posterior evaluation whereas the acceptance ratio was 0 004 when using ɛ 1 10 data not shown thus abc is not recommended to assess identifiability in complex models with a large number of θ i e n 30 different upgrades have been proposed to increase the abc efficiency beaumont et al 2009 filippi et al 2013 toni and stumpf 2010 though the evaluation of these upgrades for calibrating structured ad models was out of the scope of this study conversely the gsa engine relies upon a bayesian emulator to speed up the analysis of model outputs kennedy and o hagan 2001 oakley and o hagan 2004 therefore gsa can be an adequate tool to reduce the global computation required for parameter optimization by preliminarily reducing the number of θ to be further assessed by abc as shown in this study 3 2 2 batch simulations using the θ mean as θ opt table 6 led to a good approximation of both the methane production fig 3 and the rest of variables at the end of all batch experiments fig 4 used either for calibration i e batch no 1 3 5 6 7 and 9 or cross validation i e batch no 2 4 and 8 table 1 therefore the θ mean might be a good approximation of θ opt particularly for those θ where practical identifiability was likely i e kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km ac phll ac and fbu su importantly the hs ad model was able to capture particularly well the ts and tan contents but also vs data not shown in all mono and co digestion experiments confirming the suitability of the hypotheses used for the model development pastor poquet et al 2018 some disagreements were also observed between the simulations and the experimental results particularly the implementation of a reversible nh3 inhibition function equation 1 in all the vfa and h2 degrading populations table 2 was unable to capture the vfa accumulation at the end of hs ad experiments fig 4 as the most noticeable example calibration failed to represent the sbu accumulation in batch no 6 fig 4e yielding also a slight miss adjustment in the methane production fig 3c more in general sac and sbu at the end of all experiments were poorly represented fig 4 despite the butyrate km c4 and acetate km ac growth rates were adequately identified and the nh3 inhibition upon the acetate uptake is a relatively well established strategy in structured ad models batstone et al 2002 two main reasons might explain the vfa disagreement between the model simulations and the experimental data available the first reason relates to the relatively low amount of experimental data hampering calibration as mentioned in section 3 1 3 in this line the nh3 half inhibition parameters in the vfa and or h2 uptakes ki nh3 were disregarded as unimportant by gsa to represent the experimental data table 5 mainly because only batch no 1 contained the vfa ph and tan dynamics the second reason relates to the poor suitability of the reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 to explain the vfa accumulation in hs ad simulations as discussed in next section 3 3 main effects of increasing the ts content in hs ad of ofmsw in this study calibration cross validation served to further test the hypotheses used for model construction e g mass balances particularly regarding the ts and vs simulation noteworthy the correct simulation of ts is crucial in hs ad as ts determines the apparent concentration of soluble compounds subsequently affecting all the hs ad bio physical chemical dynamics pastor poquet et al 2019b for example ts 20 supposes approximately 20 higher apparent concentrations i e kmol kg h2o regarding the corresponding global concentrations i e kmol kg the hs ad model was also calibrated validated to assess the effects of increasing ts upon the nh3 inhibition in hs ad specifically a high solute content potentially associated to a high ts exacerbates the solution non ideality affecting all the hs ad dynamics e g ph nh3 concentration co2 transfer pastor poquet et al 2019b more in detail non ideality can lower snh3 serving as a potential source of nh3 inhibition abatement in hs ad of ofmsw in this study i ranged from 0 22 to 0 93 m fig 4c emphasizing the need for an adequate non ideal bio physical chemical approach hafner and bisogni 2009 solon et al 2015 importantly despite the high i observed snh3 reached up to 0 13 mol n kg in this study fig 4d equivalent to 0 16 mol n kg h2o i e 2 3 g n l these snh3 were considerably high since reactors operated at snh3 1 0 g n l usually show an inefficient vfa conversion rajagopal et al 2013 the inefficient vfa conversion in hs ad experiments was not well simulated by the reversible nh3 inhibition function as mentioned in section 3 2 2 to understand the poor vfa simulation it is necessary to consider the relatively flat inhibition described by equation 1 but also the cod fluxes in the hs ad model briefly inh3 is 0 50 when snh3 app ki snh3 whereas inh3 is 0 33 when snh3 app 2 ki snh3 equation 1 in other words a non competitive reversible inhibition by nh3 might be far too blunt to describe the actual effect of nh3 upon the anaerobic biomass astals et al 2018 on the other hand due to the cod fractioning used in this study approximately 54 of the cod from ssu table 6 and 26 of the cod from saa flowed through the butyrate pathway whereas up to 80 of the cod either from ssu saa and or long chain fatty acids sfa flowed through the acetate pathway batstone et al 2002 meanwhile a considerable proportion of the initially biodegradable cod i e 75 85 was assigned to xch ssu xpr saa table 3 with all the above the blunt definition of the nh3 inhibition function alongside the high cod flowing through the butyrate and acetate pathways presumably favored the xbu and xac growth even at considerably high snh3 i e up to 2 3 g n l during simulations summarizing the high substrate content counterbalanced the effect of the nh3 inhibition preventing the correct simulation of the sbu and sac accumulation at the end of the hs ad experiments therefore the reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 in the vfa and or h2 uptakes table 2 requires further testing to represent the vfa accumulation observed in hs ad of ofmsw to this particular aim using extensive data regarding the vfa ph and tan dynamics in hs ad simulations is strongly recommended to end up the hs ad model pastor poquet et al 2018 is a suitable platform to understand the inner mechanisms of hs ad whereas further model developments and or model configurations i e inhibition functions should be also tested to enhance our understanding about the vfa accumulation within hs ad of ofmsw similarly additional experimental data is needed to thoroughly understand the role of nh3 inhibition in hs ad simulations specifically extensive data regarding the main species driving non ideality i e vfa ph tan and or further bio physical chemical mechanisms i e precipitation in hs ad seem to be crucial due to the outstanding importance of non ideality for the biochemical parameter optimization pastor poquet et al 2019b in this scheme the relatively simple calibration validation methodology presented in this study can serve to test the θ practical identifiability and confidence ranges in presence of any set of experimental data and or hs ad model structure 4 conclusions nine different batch conditions were used to calibrate and cross validate the hs ad model for parameter optimization variance based gsa in tandem with abc served to evaluate the practical identifiability of 35 θ p and 32 θ b among all these mostly 8 θ p were correctly identified with the available data as corroborated by the convergence of p θ y the study also showed that hs ad may be operated at snh3 2 3 g n l and i 0 9 m whereas a reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function was not able to explain the vfa accumulation in hs ad of ofmsw therefore further datasets about the vfa ph and tan dynamics are required to enhance the θ practical identifiability whereas further model configurations should be tested to enhance the simulation of the nh3 inhibition in hs ad declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18553,high solids anaerobic digestion hs ad of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw is operated at a total solid ts content 10 to enhance the waste treatment economy though it might be associated to free ammonia nh3 inhibition this study aimed to calibrate and cross validate a hs ad model for homogenized reactors in order to assess the effects of high nh3 levels in hs ad of ofmsw but also to evaluate the suitability of the reversible non competitive inhibition function to reproduce the effect of nh3 on the main acetogenic and methanogenic populations the practical identifiability of structural biochemical parameters i e 35 and initial conditions i e 32 was evaluated using batch experiments at different ts and or inoculum to substrate ratios variance based global sensitivity analysis and approximate bayesian computation were used for parameter optimization the experimental data in this study permitted to estimate up to 8 biochemical parameters whereas the rest of parameters and biomass contents were poorly identifiable the study also showed the relatively high levels of nh3 i e up to 2 3 g n l and ionic strength i e up to 0 9 m when increasing ts in hs ad of ofmsw however the nh3 non competitive function was unable to capture the acetogenic methanogenic inhibition therefore the calibration emphasized the need for target oriented experimental data to enhance the practical identifiability and the predictive capabilities of structured hs ad models but also the need for further testing the nh3 inhibition function used in these simulations graphical abstract image 1 keywords high solids anaerobic digestion model ammonia inhibition ionic strength global sensitivity analysis approximate bayesian computation 1 introduction high solids anaerobic digestion hs ad of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw is operated at total solids ts 10 to minimize the reactor volume the water addition and the digestate dewatering pastor poquet et al 2019a hs ad can also lead up to 80 ts removal easing the digestate post treatment however hs ad of ofmsw is usually associated to free ammonia nh3 inhibition resulting in volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation nh3 affects both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens but also the rest of vfa degraders acetogens in anaerobic digestion ad being the inhibition related to the operative parameters i e temperature and ph and the biomass acclimation rajagopal et al 2013 adding lignocellulosic materials to ofmsw permits to minimize the buildup of total ammonia nitrogen tan while the low hydrolysis rates of these materials permit to increase the ts content and to counteract the vfa accumulation in hs ad capson tojo et al 2017 pastor poquet et al 2019a however including lignocellulosic waste in ofmsw depends on the season or the local waste management strategy whether or not a lignocellulosic co substrate is used understanding the effects of nh3 inhibition is crucial to optimize hs ad of ofmsw a hs ad model was recently developed for homogenized reactors to evaluate the nh3 inhibition in hs ad of ofmsw pastor poquet et al 2018 2019b this structured model based on the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 gathers the main bio physical chemical mechanisms in hs ad in the hs ad model apparent i e kmol kg h2o instead of global i e kmol kg concentrations determine the effect of ts upon solutes as a consequence of the low water content within hs ad meanwhile an extended set of mass balances allows the simulation of the organic mass removal from the biogas production a liquid solution non ideality subroutine was subsequently included in the model as a function of the ionic strength i since non ideality determines the ph co2 liquid gas transfer and nh3 inhibition in hs ad pastor poquet et al 2019b as a preliminary assumption the hs ad model included a reversible non competitive inhibition function by nh3 inh3 equation 1 in the biochemical rates of all acetogenic and methanogenic populations a mathematical resource commonly used in structured ad models astals et al 2018 1 i n h 3 k i s n h 3 k i s n h 3 s n h 3 a p p simulating the nh3 inhibition at high ts with the hs ad model requires an adequate set of input parameters θ to be estimated by calibration pastor poquet et al 2018 2019b θ includes both the structural biochemical parameters θ p and the initial and influent conditions θ b θ θ p θ b nonetheless calibration of structured ad models is not trivial due to the equation complexity and large number of θ involved dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 donoso bravo et al 2011 to calibrate a mathematical model θ must be structurally and practically identifiable instead of correlated the θ structural identifiability is theoretically assessed assuming noise free experimental data and error free model structure noteworthy nearly all θ in adm1 are locally structurally identifiable nimmegeers et al 2017 this is a prerequisite to assess the θ practical identifiability and calibrate the hs ad model using imperfect experimental data unfortunately the reduced number of experimental data often available and or the presence of experimental errors yield non identifiable parameters i e parameters that cannot be uniquely estimated these are known as practical identifiability issues calibration usually consists of minimizing an objective function j θ that condenses the goodness of fitting between the experimental data y and the model outputs y sim θ being these outputs a function of n input parameters θ dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 flotats et al 2010 several j θ can be used to calibrate ad models as the weighted sum of squares or any user defined alternative donoso bravo et al 2011 ratto et al 2001 assuming the existence of a global minimum optimum for an objective function j θ opt this value is reached using the optimal set of input parameters θ opt practical identifiability issues commonly translate into j θ showing many local optimums and or flat valleys where the precise value of θ cannot be easily determined guisasola et al 2006 rodriguez fernandez et al 2006 thus only practical identification of a reduced θ subset i e n n is often possible for adm1 based models nimmegeers et al 2017 this is called model over parameterization i e the modification of two individual θ θ i with i 1 n can lead to a similar model output particularly when using batch experiments highly dependent on the initial conditions to calibrate ad models different sets of experimental conditions including different inoculum to substrate ratios isr are required to reduce the θ correlation donoso bravo et al 2011 flotats et al 2010 two main approaches can be used to calibrate complex models the bayesian and the frequentist the frequentist approach searches for optimal θ values θ opt whereas the bayesian approach considers θ opt as probabilistic distributions conditioned on the experimental data p θ opt y instead of single values ratto et al 2001 rodriguez fernandez et al 2006 saltelli et al 2006 in both approaches when facing over parameterization it must be assessed which θ i significantly influence y sim θ sensitivity analysis and need to be adequately calibrated adm1 based models contain several θ p i e 35 and θ b i e 24 θ p might be obtained from literature though a different model structure from where these θ p were obtained potentially influences the optimal θ p values distributions pastor poquet et al 2019b on the other hand θ b might not be easily determined due to the lack of experimental data or the difficulties to translate the data into adequate model units donoso bravo et al 2011 flotats et al 2003 parameter inference based on the bayes theorem equation 2 is particularly suited to calibrate structured ad models since it can deal with complex j θ showing several optima or flat geometries where frequentist inference might not be well suited kennedy and o hagan 2001 toni and stumpf 2010 in bayesian inference the prior parameter distribution p θ is sampled to obtain the posterior parameter distribution p θ y conditioned on the experimental data y and the likelihood function p y θ while p y can be considered as a normalizing constant importantly any user defined j θ arising from p y θ can be used in informal statistical approaches equation 3 as variance based global sensitivity analysis gsa and approximate bayesian computation abc donoso bravo et al 2011 nott et al 2012 2 p θ y p y θ p θ p y 3 j θ f p y θ variance based gsa provides an appropriate assessment about the potentiality of θ i to influence the model outputs and the correlations existing with the rest of θ θ j with j 1 n and i j kennedy and petropoulos 2017 oakley and o hagan 2004 similarly abc permits also to highlight practical identifiability issues yielding simultaneously the most likely p θ y beaumont et al 2009 filippi et al 2013 toni and stumpf 2010 as main disadvantage bayesian inference is often computationally intensive the mathematical performance of the hs ad model was previously verified though the model was only validated for a single hs ad batch experiment due to the elevated number of θ requiring calibration i e 30 pastor poquet et al 2018 2019b instead this study aimed to fully calibrate and cross validate the hs ad model to simulate the effect of high nh3 levels in hs ad of ofmsw while testing the non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 on the main acetogenic methanogenic populations in particular this study assessed the practical identifiability of 35 θ p and 32 θ b by using nine hs ad batch digesters at different ts and or isr as a source of experimental data identifiability was assessed by variance based gsa and abc permitting to approximate also p θ y importantly the proposed methodology can be easily readapted to account for further hs ad datasets e g batch continuous and or model configurations 2 methodology 2 1 experimental data to calibrate and cross validate the hs ad model while further evaluating the effects of increasing the initial ts content on hs ad simulations four different batch experiments were used at thermophilic 55 c conditions from 10 to 30 ts table 1 the laboratory scale reactor design volume vreactor was either 160 or 280 ml for the different experiments in all experiments centrifuged inoculum was used to increase simultaneously the initial ts and isr these small scale digesters were manually shaken when the biogas production was measured the batch experiments are described next whereas a thorough description of these experiments and the bio physical chemical analyses performed was reported elsewhere pastor poquet et al 2019a experiment 1 consisted of a sacrifice test for mono digestion of ofmsw using isr 1 00 g vs g vs in this experiment the main physical chemical dynamics i e biogas production and composition ts vs vfa tan and mono valent ions were evaluated at different operational times in experiments 2 to 4 the biogas production and composition were measured at different experimental times whereas the rest of physical chemical analyses i e ts vs vfa tan and ions were only performed before starting and after ending each experiment non sacrifice experiments included mono digestion of ofmsw using isr 1 50 g vs g vs experiment 2 and isr 0 50 g vs g vs experiment 3 but also co digestion of ofmsw and beech sawdust using isr 0 16 g vs g vs experiment 4 within experiments 2 and 4 different initial ts contents dilutions were evaluated though all the initial batch conditions contained exactly the same amount of substrate and centrifuged inoculum briefly 1 the inoculum was centrifuged 2 the same amount of substrate and inoculum was added to each bottle 3 distilled water was added to reach the different ts contents and 4 each bottle was manually homogenized this strategy was aimed to use the mass balances among the different initial ts conditions as explained in section 2 3 1 since soluble materials were partially removed when centrifuging the inoculum in total nine different hs ad batch conditions were assessed at different ts isr and or co digestion ratios subsequently named as batch no 1 to 9 table 1 2 2 hs ad model the hs ad model included the main biochemical rates of pastor poquet et al 2018 though some minor modifications were also implemented table 2 firstly a reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 was included in the valeric sva butyric sbu propionic spro and hydrogen sh2 uptake rates similarly to the nh3 snh3 inhibition on the acetate sac uptake aiming to simulate the vfa accumulation observed in the hs ad experiments being a likely consequence of the nh3 buildup pastor poquet et al 2019a secondly carbohydrates xch were split into readily biodegradable xch fast and slowly biodegradable xch slow to simulate the relatively lower hydrolysis rates of sawdust and the longer methane production observed in co digestion experiments i e 200 d table 1 importantly the hydrolysis of both xch fast and xch slow pooled into soluble sugars ssu 2 3 model calibration and cross validation a common set of biochemical parameters was used for all hs ad simulations at different isr and or ts contents all biochemical parameters for thermophilic 55 c ad were extracted from batstone et al 2002 though some of those needed to be calibrated i e θ p to improve the model fitting the initial conditions of the batch experiments were predefined according to the experimental data available as described by pastor poquet et al 2018 and also mentioned next moreover different ranges of initial biomass concentrations were used i e θ b to assess the potential interrelationship of θ b with θ p in batch experiments 2 3 1 initial conditions the initial conditions used for each batch simulation are shown in table 3 since the same amount of substrate and inoculum was used along different initial ts contents in experiment 2 but also in experiment 4 mass balances were used to reduce the number of unknown initial conditions table 1 to use mass balances the anaerobic biodegradability bd of each substrate inoculum mixture in experiment 2 and experiment 4 was assumed constant whereas the soluble s and particulate x components were assumed proportional among the different ts contents with these assumptions mass balances permitted to extrapolate the molar and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations as a function of the initial reactor content mass mglobal reactor content specific weight ρglobal and reactor content volume vglobal for example the concentration of acetoclastic methanogens xac in batch no 3 was approximated from batch no 2 as xac batch3 xac batch2 vglobal batch2 vglobal batch3 the nitrogen content of soluble si and particulate xi inert in each substrate inoculum mixture ni subs determined the initial protein xpr amino acid saa content according to the nitrogen balance as shown elsewhere pastor poquet et al 2018 thus ni subs was different for each batch experiment table 3 on the other hand despite the initial conditions of batch experiments were maintained for all the hs ad simulations different biomass concentrations i e degraders of sugars xsu amino acids xaa long chain fatty acids xfa valerate xc5 butyrate xbu propionate xpro acetate xac and hydrogen xh2 were also assessed as mentioned before finally since mass balances were used among different ts in experiments 2 and 4 only the initial conditions of batch no 1 2 6 and 7 table 1 were evaluated 2 3 2 biochemical parameters biomass concentrations and calibration ranges the modified biochemical parameters θ p and modified biomass concentrations θ b in this study including their initial values and potential variability ranges are shown in table 4 in total 35 θ p and 32 θ b were evaluated θ p related to the hydrolysis sugar fractioning fsu maximum growth rate km and half saturation constant ks but also the ph nh3 and h2 inhibition constants ki since all these θ p are simultaneously associated to the substrate under study are correlated among themselves and strongly regulate the biogas production composition from solid substrates batstone et al 2002 garcia gen et al 2015 on the other hand θ b included all the initial biomass concentrations in the hs ad simulations i e xsu xaa xfa xc5 xbu xpro xac and xh2 as these concentrations might not only strongly influence the biogas production during the initial days of batch experiments but might also be potentially interrelated among themselves and or to the previous θ p the sugars uptake yields butyrate fbu su propionate fpro su acetate fac su and hydrogen fh2 su as cod fractions in adm1 therefore a maximum of three fractions can be selected simultaneously to fulfill the cod balance fbu su fpro su fac su fh2 su 1 in this study fbu su fac su and fh2 su were selected while fpro su was recalculated fpro su 1 fbu su fac su fh2 su importantly further structural parameters and initial conditions need to be induced in the hs ad model as for example the amino acid aa saa fractioning and the biomass yield coefficients yb though these were not assessed here aiming to reduce the problem under study in either case the proposed methodology for calibration validation can easily include any further θ variability ranges for structural parameters are suggested in adm1 batstone et al 2002 however considerably wider ranges were assessed in this study to emphasize the absence of prior knowledge about the optimal values for simplicity all θ p were allowed to vary by 90 from their initial values θ p 0 1 0 9 θ p 0 θ p 1 0 9 θ p 0 uniform p θ p table 4 as the only exception the lower ph threshold for acetoclastic methanogens phll ac was bounded between a ph value where methanogenesis potentially collapses i e 5 0 and the upper ph threshold for acetoclastic methanogens phul ac i e 7 0 to maintain the suitability of the hill function to simulate the ph inhibition table 2 different methods are available to approximate the initial conditions i e biomass concentrations in batch simulations as for example simulating a continuous reactor fed with exactly the same substrate until reaching steady state and then use these steady conditions to initialize the batch simulations dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 donoso bravo et al 2011 however since the inoculum was centrifuged right before setting the batch experiments in this study absence of prior knowledge about the initial biomass concentrations was preferred to explore homogeneously different orders of magnitude in the biomass concentrations often 0 θ b 1 kmol cod m3 the logarithm transformed θ b were allowed to vary by 50 from their initial values θ b 0 1 0 5 log 10 θ b 0 log 10 θ b 1 0 5 log 10 θ b 0 uniform p log 10 θ b table 4 2 3 3 objective function the weighted sum of squares between all the available experimental and the corresponding simulated values was used as objective function j θ equation 4 j θ was adapted from flotats et al 2003 to assess the model goodness of fitting being θ the structural parameters and or initial conditions implemented in the hs ad model r the number of batch simulations d the number of experimental datasets t exp the experimental time of each batch experiment y i j t the experimental measurements y i j t s i m θ the simulated values and w i j the weighting coefficients calculated as a function of the average experimental data y i j equation 5 with this approach j θ was lower bounded by the preliminarily unknown global minimum j θ j θ opt 4 j θ i 1 r j 1 d t t 1 t e x p w i j y i j t y i j t s i m θ 2 5 w i j 1 t t 1 t e x p y i j t y i j 2 noteworthy only 6 out of 9 experimental conditions were used to calculate j θ in this study batch no 1 3 5 6 7 and 9 table 1 meanwhile 3 out of 9 experimental conditions were used for cross validation batch no 2 4 and 8 table 1 other experimental combinations could be used for calibration cross validation as for example batch no 2 4 5 7 and 8 for calibration and batch no 1 3 6 and 9 for cross validation however the configuration used in this study permitted to include the most extreme hs ad conditions for model calibration i e ts 10 and ts 30 while intermediate conditions i e 10 ts 30 were used for cross validation this strategy also aimed to enhance the number of experimental data used for calibration and to ensure the most diverse operative conditions where θ might be representative additionally the proposed configuration included the most informative dataset i e batch no 1 to increase the complexity of j θ and remove identifiability issues related to the lack of bio physical chemical dynamics in the overall experimental dataset as further discussed in section 3 1 3 2 3 4 global sensitivity analysis gsa was aimed to highlight the most influential θ to be calibrated with the available set of experimental data for gsa multiple θ combinations were used to evaluate j θ equation 4 latin hypercube sampling lhs served to explore the global θ space solon et al 2015 subsequently j θ arrays and their corresponding θ were assessed by the gsa engine of kennedy and o hagan 2001 and oakley and o hagan 2004 the gsa engine calculates the individual ie and global ge effects of θ i upon the global model output e g p y θ j θ variance on the other hand the gsa engine provides also all the double correlations between θ i and θ j i e θ i θ j being i j both ie and θ i θ j are expressed as a percentage of the global variance explained thus θ i showing a relatively low ie are associated to poor practical identifiability since these θ i influence minimally the model output meanwhile ge comprises ie the double correlations θ i θ j and all the rest of multiple correlations for a single θ i therefore ge itself should not be used to assess the identifiability instead the overall correlation of θ i with θ can be inferred by the relative difference between ie and ge though ie and ge are expressed in different units as interactions can be repeated in the ge of two or more θ i oakley and o hagan 2004 saltelli et al 2006 summarizing both a low ie and a large ie to ge difference mean poor identifiability for a single θ i though a priori no fixed threshold neither for ie nor for ge minus ie permits to distinguish whether θ i should be considered as non identifiable a maximum θ subset of n 30 and or 400 simulations of j θ can be evaluated simultaneously with the gsa engine kennedy and petropoulos 2017 therefore to assess θ interactions when n 30 a combination strategy was followed firstly 30 θ i were randomly selected and evaluated by gsa i e gsa no 1 from these θ only those showing the smallest ie e g 1 were disregarded as non identifiable removed from the initial θ subset and not used for further gsa importantly these non identifiable θ i were fixed at their initial values table 4 for all subsequent model simulations since non identifiability implies that these θ can be fixed at any value within p θ dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 guisasola et al 2006 then θ p and or θ b non previously assessed by gsa were combined with the non removed θ subset and a new gsa was performed i e gsa no 2 the gsa methodology was repeated until the last remaining θ subset was considered as potentially identifiable θ in total seven gsa with different θ combinations were progressively performed table 5 in this study the only criterion for non identifiability was assumed as ie 0 20 which also coincided with a relatively low ge i e 4 5 though this conservative criterion could be modified as mentioned in section 3 1 1 to enhance the gsa representativeness in presence of a high number of θ i e 20 n 30 and or wide variability ranges i e 50 each gsa was conducted in triplicate and the results averaged finally all j θ arrays used for gsa were searched for the minimum observed value j min θ i e j θ opt to be subsequently used in abc 2 3 5 approximate bayesian computation the θ posterior distribution p θ y was assessed by abc toni and stumpf 2010 in short multiple simulations were carried at different θ combinations sampled by lhs whereas relatively high j θ values were discarded by a progressively stringent criterion based in a tolerance coefficient ɛ i e 1 0 in other words only j θ j min θ ɛ were accepted for posterior evaluation p θ j θ j min θ ɛ with this approach θ identifiability was further assessed by the convergence in the confidence range in this study ɛ was successively reduced from 2 50 to 1 05 i e 2 50 1 80 1 30 1 10 and 1 05 within each explored j θ j min θ ɛ range 400 simulations were used θ were allowed to vary within the same range used for gsa table 4 meanwhile the 5 95 interquartile range of each θ was used as confidence range but also as a criterion for identifiability convergence the posterior mean median mode kurtosis skewness and correlation matrix were also evaluated as described in martin and ayesa 2010 2 3 6 cross validation cross validation assesses the model goodness of fitting in experiments not used for calibration bennett et al 2013 in this study the θ posterior mean was considered as θ opt thus θ opt were used to simulate all batch experiments including the three experimental conditions selected for cross validation batch no 2 4 and 8 table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 gsa selecting the most influencing input parameters for calibration 3 1 1 preliminary identifiability assessment gsa results are summarized in table 5 gsa was started with 30 θ p and progressively led to only 14 θ 13 θ p i e kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km pro km ac km h2 kd phll ac fbu su fac su fh2 su and 1 θ b i e xac batch7 in this study only the θ i showing ie 0 20 were fixed at their initial values table 4 to enhance the capabilities of gsa and abc for calibrating structured ad models as mentioned in section 2 3 4 the overall j θ variance explained by the gsa engine was around 70 in all cases confirming the validity of this methodology to assess the most influential θ in the hs ad model oakley and o hagan 2004 ie provides a relative measure of the θ i practical identifiability while a high θ i correlation high difference between ie and ge suggests that θ i cannot be independently calibrated with the available set of experimental data saltelli et al 2006 as an example gsa no 1 showed that 40 7 out of 72 4 of the global j θ variance was explained by adding up the ie of 30 θ p table 5 while the remaining 31 7 variance was explained by correlations among these for example km c4 explained individually around 4 4 of the global variance i e ie though showing ge up to 17 9 this meant that the correlation of km c4 with other θ was high and any improvement in j θ obtained by solely modifying km c4 could be partially or totally compensated by the modification of a correlated θ i in this line the km c4 fbu bu correlation in gsa no 1 explained up to 2 8 of the global variance data not shown due to the influence of fbu su in j θ i e ie 2 0 and ge 24 4 table 5 in this study θ i were disregarded by a single and low demanding criterion i e ie 0 20 table 5 since any chosen criterion for potential identifiability would influence the gsa results when n 30 meanwhile gsa also depends on n i e 30 and or the particular combination of θ p and θ b used thus using a more demanding identifiability criterion e g ie 0 50 instead of 0 20 might have led to discard θ i during preliminary gsa runs which would be subsequently characterized as potentially identifiable for example gsa no 1 showed an ie 0 22 for km c5 whereas gsa no 7 eventually showed an ie 0 67 table 5 to enhance identifiability a strategy to reduce the gap between ie and ge for each θ i is required kennedy and petropoulos 2017 however reducing the ie to ge gap in this study would require to readapt the criterion used for potential identifiability one strategy might consist on fixing those θ i showing for example ie 0 30 in gsa no 7 i e fac su and then perform further rounds of gsa i e gsa no 8 until ie ge for all θ i with all the above a second assessment for identifiability can be useful when using variance based gsa for structured ad models abc is a well suited tool in this regard yielding also p θ y in contrast to gsa importantly both methodologies should yield equivalent results regarding the θ i identifiability though abc is much computationally intensive than gsa as explained in section 3 2 1 3 1 2 importance of the p θ for model calibration it must be noted that any p θ could be used to calibrate ad models provided that θ do not contradict biochemical laws e g θ p 0 and θ b 0 or disrupt mathematical resources e g phul ac phll ac and the overall p θ range is as densely and homogeneously sampled as possible on the other hand the p θ distribution used e g uniform log transformed uniform normal can be also crucial to determine p θ y and the overall θ estimation in this study using triplicates permitted to enhance the gsa representativeness overall sampling in presence of large n and p θ ranges meanwhile a uniform distribution with mostly a 90 modification was predefined for θ p whereas a log transformed uniform distribution with a 50 modification was allowed for θ b table 4 as mentioned in section 2 3 2 these specific p θ ranges were considered sufficiently wide for the objectives of this study and were based mainly on experience and visual analysis of the overall model results particularly the order of magnitude of many θ p are relatively well characterized in literature according to their corresponding bio physical chemical meaning nonetheless the order of magnitude of θ b is highly unknown particularly after the inoculum centrifugation used in this study thus using a uniform p θ permitted to emphasize the precision over punctual θ p values within the p θ p range whereas the precision over the unknown order of magnitude in the θ b range was emphasized by using a log transformed uniform distribution p log 10 θ b with all the above using a different p θ range or distribution might alter the results of variance based gsa and the overall calibration of structured ad models for example using considerably narrower p θ p ranges in gsa no 1 i e 1 0 3 θ p 0 θ p 1 0 3 θ p 0 uniform p θ p resulted in some θ p which were highlighted as potentially identifiable in this study being disregarded as non identifiable e g kh pr and km c4 likely because part of their optimal or sub optimal θ p values were left outside the p θ p range supplementary information on the other hand using wider ranges i e 0 01 θ p 0 θ p 3 θ p 0 uniform p θ p the results were not substantially different i e only the km c5 identifiability was additionally disregarded by gsa no 1 however using a log transformed uniform distribution i e 1 0 5 log 10 θ p 0 log 10 θ p 1 0 5 log10 θ p 0 uniform p log 10 θ p relatively altered the results of gsa no 1 i e the order of magnitude of km c5 and km c4 was disregarded while the order of magnitude of kh ch slow and ks xh2 has was highlighted as highly important for the hs ad model calibration therefore for the correct calibration of structured ad models both the p θ range and distribution should be set accordingly to all the prior information available for these θ minimizing the p θ range explored alongside the number of simulations required for the objectives of the study 3 1 3 importance of the available data for model calibration provided θ are structurally identifiable practical identifiability relates to the quantity as well as the quality i e experimental errors and or the sampling frequency of the experimental data available donoso bravo et al 2011 guisasola et al 2006 nimmegeers et al 2017 rodriguez fernandez et al 2006 particularly a reduced number of experimental data associated to some model dynamics usually prevents practical identifiability of the θ involved in these specific dynamics for example yb might not be identifiable in ad models provided that the biomass concentration dynamics were measured bernard et al 2001 in this study the hydrolysis constant of readily biodegradable carbohydrates kh ch fast and lipids kh li but also the maximum growth rate of sugar km su and amino acid km aa degraders showed a reduced influence in j θ by gsa these results suggest that either insufficient experimental data was available to calibrate kh ch fast kh li km su and km aa or that the biogas production in the hs ad batch experiments table 1 was mostly influenced by the vfa uptake as the main limiting step in the same line due to the monod properties km and ks might be correlated when using batch experiments for calibration dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 flotats et al 2010 guisasola et al 2006 nevertheless gsa showed negligible influence for all ks in this study likely due to using different batch experiments i e isr and ts and or a reduced number of experimental data to obtain j θ equation 4 the liquid gas transfer coefficient kla was also disregarded during the initial steps of gsa i e ie 0 07 and ge 0 39 table 5 the kla coefficient is related to the homogenization and mixing strategy as well as other operational parameters in ad e g temperature and ph batstone et al 2002 in this study all the hs ad digesters were manually shaken however increasing the ts content can hamper the liquid gas transfer mechanisms in hs ad pastor poquet et al 2019a therefore a calibration strategy should be specifically envisaged to correctly calibrate kla e g using different stirring velocities devices for mixing since the presence of several θ in hs ad models can prevent identifiability of kla with the reduced number of experimental data usually available importantly both the nh3 and h2 inhibition parameters table 2 were shown as non identifiable in this study despite the strong influence of these parameters to regulate the biogas production in an adm1 based model as mentioned in section 2 3 2 these results were associated to the reduced tan and vfa dynamics in the experimental data since only one single sacrifice experiment was available for calibration validation therefore despite using different initial conditions i e isr and or ts for model calibration the nh3 inhibition parameters in hs ad of ofmsw cannot be assessed by using traditional batch experiments where only the biogas production and composition are usually dynamically evaluated the above results condense the importance of an adequate sampling to enhance identifiability in ad models but also to test hypotheses regarding the effects of inhibitory substances in hs ad particularly an extensive sampling for vfa ph and tan at different operational times during batch experiments is required to identify crucial parameters regarding the nh3 inhibition in hs ad of ofmsw therefore sacrifice experiments and or any sampling technique for batch setups allowing the thorough characterization of the reactor content variables in dynamic mode should be recommended to calibrate structured hs ad models using batch experiments on the other hand including semi continuous datasets when available might also alleviate these identifiability issues during calibration bennett et al 2013 nimmegeers et al 2017 3 1 4 the importance of initial conditions for model calibration interestingly all θ b except xac batch7 were shown as non identifiable in this study table 5 the reason presumably lies on the high km of all microorganisms shading the effect of their initial concentration for example xpro was associated to a maximum growth rate km pro around 10 d 1 table 4 thus xpro doubles within 1 h i e log 2 k m log 2 24 10 0 6 h whereas the hs ad batch experiments lasted considerably longer than 20 days table 1 xac and xh2 are important variables to avoid batch acidification during the initial 0 10 days of hs ad simulations due to the rapid changes occurring in the bio physical chemistry during these days and the influence of these two microbial populations to define the buffering capacity batstone et al 2002 capson tojo et al 2017 nonetheless these biomass concentrations were also rapidly disregarded by gsa in this study tables 3 and 4 except the potential identifiability of xac batch7 suggested by gsa no 7 which was likely explained by the influence of the order of magnitude of this particular biomass content to regulate the risk of acidification of the most extreme hs ad condition in experiment 7 i e batch no 9 ts 30 table 1 with all the above it is likely that only the initial biomass magnitude not a precise value was needed to calibrate the hs ad model based on batch experiments in other words approximate biomass concentrations serve mainly to avoid acidification in the hs ad batch simulations since these might not influence significantly the model calibration the θ influence on j θ in this study was further assessed by abc 3 2 parameter optimization 3 2 1 second identifiability assessment fig 1 shows p θ y using ɛ 1 05 the main statistics for these p θ y are summarized in table 6 including the confidence ranges i e 5 95 interquartile range since a reliable assessment of the θ confidence range is as important as the value of θ opt themselves guisasola et al 2006 the correlation matrix is included as supplementary information fig 2 shows the 5 95 interquartile range vs ɛ since reducing progressively ɛ permitted to assess the convergence of the θ posterior as second identifiability assessment parameter identifiability is roughly associated to the sharpness of the posterior distribution p θ y martin and ayesa 2010 toni and stumpf 2010 in this line kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km ac phll ac and fbu su showed relatively well defined bell shaped distributions by abc suggesting an adequate identifiability fig 1 meanwhile km pro km h2 kd xac batch7 fac su and fh2 su showed a more uniform like distribution suggesting a poorer identifiability the substantial reduction observed in the interquartile range for kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km ac phll ac and fbu su i e 60 80 corroborated their adequate identifiability in this study in contrast to km pro km h2 kd xac batch7 fac su and fh2 su that showed a much constant interquartile range i e 50 reduction fig 2 the poor practical identifiability of these last θ is explained by their high correlation with the rest of θ for example the fac su fbu su correlation was 0 82 while km pro kd was 0 72 data not shown as suggested in section 3 1 4 xac batch7 served mainly to counteract the potential acidification in batch no 9 since the poor reduction in the interquartile range i e 23 alongside the high correlation with other θ i e phll ac xac batch7 0 24 indicated that only an approximate biomass content is needed to calibrate structured hs ad models based on batch experiments as expected abc supported the identifiability assessment previously performed by gsa in particular θ showing ie 1 5 in gsa no 7 i e km pro km h2 and fac su table 5 were associated to a poor identifiability however some parameters showing an ie 1 5 in gsa no 7 i e kd xac batch7 and fh2 su were also indicated as non identifiable by abc in contrast to gsa suggesting that abc was a more sensitive methodology for parameter identifiability in this study with all the above a more restrictive ie threshold i e 0 50 instead of 0 20 could have been used in further gsa rounds once fixing poorly identifiable parameters to any value within the prior as mentioned in section 3 1 1 abc is computationally intensive due to the high level of j θ j min θ ɛ rejection particularly when using highly demanding ɛ filippi et al 2013 toni and stumpf 2010 for example the acceptance ratio was 0 129 when using ɛ 1 80 meaning that only 1 out of 8 simulations was accepted for posterior evaluation whereas the acceptance ratio was 0 004 when using ɛ 1 10 data not shown thus abc is not recommended to assess identifiability in complex models with a large number of θ i e n 30 different upgrades have been proposed to increase the abc efficiency beaumont et al 2009 filippi et al 2013 toni and stumpf 2010 though the evaluation of these upgrades for calibrating structured ad models was out of the scope of this study conversely the gsa engine relies upon a bayesian emulator to speed up the analysis of model outputs kennedy and o hagan 2001 oakley and o hagan 2004 therefore gsa can be an adequate tool to reduce the global computation required for parameter optimization by preliminarily reducing the number of θ to be further assessed by abc as shown in this study 3 2 2 batch simulations using the θ mean as θ opt table 6 led to a good approximation of both the methane production fig 3 and the rest of variables at the end of all batch experiments fig 4 used either for calibration i e batch no 1 3 5 6 7 and 9 or cross validation i e batch no 2 4 and 8 table 1 therefore the θ mean might be a good approximation of θ opt particularly for those θ where practical identifiability was likely i e kh pr kh ch slow km fa km c5 km c4 km ac phll ac and fbu su importantly the hs ad model was able to capture particularly well the ts and tan contents but also vs data not shown in all mono and co digestion experiments confirming the suitability of the hypotheses used for the model development pastor poquet et al 2018 some disagreements were also observed between the simulations and the experimental results particularly the implementation of a reversible nh3 inhibition function equation 1 in all the vfa and h2 degrading populations table 2 was unable to capture the vfa accumulation at the end of hs ad experiments fig 4 as the most noticeable example calibration failed to represent the sbu accumulation in batch no 6 fig 4e yielding also a slight miss adjustment in the methane production fig 3c more in general sac and sbu at the end of all experiments were poorly represented fig 4 despite the butyrate km c4 and acetate km ac growth rates were adequately identified and the nh3 inhibition upon the acetate uptake is a relatively well established strategy in structured ad models batstone et al 2002 two main reasons might explain the vfa disagreement between the model simulations and the experimental data available the first reason relates to the relatively low amount of experimental data hampering calibration as mentioned in section 3 1 3 in this line the nh3 half inhibition parameters in the vfa and or h2 uptakes ki nh3 were disregarded as unimportant by gsa to represent the experimental data table 5 mainly because only batch no 1 contained the vfa ph and tan dynamics the second reason relates to the poor suitability of the reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 to explain the vfa accumulation in hs ad simulations as discussed in next section 3 3 main effects of increasing the ts content in hs ad of ofmsw in this study calibration cross validation served to further test the hypotheses used for model construction e g mass balances particularly regarding the ts and vs simulation noteworthy the correct simulation of ts is crucial in hs ad as ts determines the apparent concentration of soluble compounds subsequently affecting all the hs ad bio physical chemical dynamics pastor poquet et al 2019b for example ts 20 supposes approximately 20 higher apparent concentrations i e kmol kg h2o regarding the corresponding global concentrations i e kmol kg the hs ad model was also calibrated validated to assess the effects of increasing ts upon the nh3 inhibition in hs ad specifically a high solute content potentially associated to a high ts exacerbates the solution non ideality affecting all the hs ad dynamics e g ph nh3 concentration co2 transfer pastor poquet et al 2019b more in detail non ideality can lower snh3 serving as a potential source of nh3 inhibition abatement in hs ad of ofmsw in this study i ranged from 0 22 to 0 93 m fig 4c emphasizing the need for an adequate non ideal bio physical chemical approach hafner and bisogni 2009 solon et al 2015 importantly despite the high i observed snh3 reached up to 0 13 mol n kg in this study fig 4d equivalent to 0 16 mol n kg h2o i e 2 3 g n l these snh3 were considerably high since reactors operated at snh3 1 0 g n l usually show an inefficient vfa conversion rajagopal et al 2013 the inefficient vfa conversion in hs ad experiments was not well simulated by the reversible nh3 inhibition function as mentioned in section 3 2 2 to understand the poor vfa simulation it is necessary to consider the relatively flat inhibition described by equation 1 but also the cod fluxes in the hs ad model briefly inh3 is 0 50 when snh3 app ki snh3 whereas inh3 is 0 33 when snh3 app 2 ki snh3 equation 1 in other words a non competitive reversible inhibition by nh3 might be far too blunt to describe the actual effect of nh3 upon the anaerobic biomass astals et al 2018 on the other hand due to the cod fractioning used in this study approximately 54 of the cod from ssu table 6 and 26 of the cod from saa flowed through the butyrate pathway whereas up to 80 of the cod either from ssu saa and or long chain fatty acids sfa flowed through the acetate pathway batstone et al 2002 meanwhile a considerable proportion of the initially biodegradable cod i e 75 85 was assigned to xch ssu xpr saa table 3 with all the above the blunt definition of the nh3 inhibition function alongside the high cod flowing through the butyrate and acetate pathways presumably favored the xbu and xac growth even at considerably high snh3 i e up to 2 3 g n l during simulations summarizing the high substrate content counterbalanced the effect of the nh3 inhibition preventing the correct simulation of the sbu and sac accumulation at the end of the hs ad experiments therefore the reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function equation 1 in the vfa and or h2 uptakes table 2 requires further testing to represent the vfa accumulation observed in hs ad of ofmsw to this particular aim using extensive data regarding the vfa ph and tan dynamics in hs ad simulations is strongly recommended to end up the hs ad model pastor poquet et al 2018 is a suitable platform to understand the inner mechanisms of hs ad whereas further model developments and or model configurations i e inhibition functions should be also tested to enhance our understanding about the vfa accumulation within hs ad of ofmsw similarly additional experimental data is needed to thoroughly understand the role of nh3 inhibition in hs ad simulations specifically extensive data regarding the main species driving non ideality i e vfa ph tan and or further bio physical chemical mechanisms i e precipitation in hs ad seem to be crucial due to the outstanding importance of non ideality for the biochemical parameter optimization pastor poquet et al 2019b in this scheme the relatively simple calibration validation methodology presented in this study can serve to test the θ practical identifiability and confidence ranges in presence of any set of experimental data and or hs ad model structure 4 conclusions nine different batch conditions were used to calibrate and cross validate the hs ad model for parameter optimization variance based gsa in tandem with abc served to evaluate the practical identifiability of 35 θ p and 32 θ b among all these mostly 8 θ p were correctly identified with the available data as corroborated by the convergence of p θ y the study also showed that hs ad may be operated at snh3 2 3 g n l and i 0 9 m whereas a reversible non competitive nh3 inhibition function was not able to explain the vfa accumulation in hs ad of ofmsw therefore further datasets about the vfa ph and tan dynamics are required to enhance the θ practical identifiability whereas further model configurations should be tested to enhance the simulation of the nh3 inhibition in hs ad declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18554,n nitrosodimethylamine ndma treatment in groundwater using propane biosparging paul b hatzinger david r lippincott biotechnology development and applications group aptim federal services lawrenceville nj united states biotechnology development and applications group aptim federal services lawrenceville nj united states biotechnology development and applications group aptim federal services lawrenceville nj united states corresponding author n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is found in groundwater and drinking water from industrial agricultural water treatment and military aerospace sources and it must often be treated to part per trillion ng l concentrations the most effective remedial technology for ndma in groundwater is pump and treat with ultraviolet irradiation uv but this approach is expensive because it requires ex situ infrastructure and high energy input the objective of this project was to evaluate an in situ biological treatment approach for ndma previous laboratory studies have revealed that propane oxidizing bacteria are capable of biodegrading ndma from μg l to low ng l concentrations fournier et al 2009 webster et al 2013 during this field study air and propane gas were sparged into an ndma contaminated aquifer for more than 1 year groundwater samples were collected throughout the study from a series of monitoring wells within downgradient and sidegradient of the zone of influence of the biosparge system over the course of the study ndma concentrations declined by 99 7 to 99 9 in the four monitoring wells within the zone of influence of the biosparge system reaching low ng l concentrations whereas the control well declined by only 14 pseudo first order degradation rate constants for ndma in system monitoring wells ranged from 0 019 day 1 to 0 037 day 1 equating to half lives ranging from 19 to 36 days native propanotrophs increased by more than one order of magnitude in the propane impacted wells but not in the control well the field data show for the first time that propane biosparging can be an effective in situ approach to reduce the concentrations of ndma in a groundwater to ng l concentrations graphical abstract image 1

tire manufacturers alkylamine producers and users and fish processors astdr 1989 its presence at military installations and aerospace facilities has occurred largely from the former use and disposal of liquid rocket propellants containing unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine udmh this compound which is a major component of the propellant aerozine 50 contains ndma as a chemical impurity and has also been observed to form ndma under oxidizing conditions lunn and sansone 1994 fleming et al 1996 mitch et al 2003 testing has also revealed that ndma is present in reclaimed wastewater and in numerous drinking water supplies as a disinfection byproduct formed during chlorination particularly when chloramine reacts with dimethylamine or other organic nitrogen precursors mitch and sedlak 2002a b mitch et al 2003 sedlak et al 2005 sgroi et al 2018 krasner et al 2018 because of its physiochemical properties including high water solubility low adsorption coefficient log kow 0 57 astdr 1989 and low henry s law constant 2 63 10 7 atm m3 mol at 20 c astdr 1989 ndma is not readily removed from groundwater via traditional remediation technologies such as adsorption to granular activated carbon or air stripping mitch et al 2003 the most effective treatment technology currently available for treating ndma in groundwater is ex situ treatment with ultraviolet irradiation uv which breaks the n n bond in ndma at a wavelength of 225 250 nm yielding nitrite and dimethylamine as primary products mitch et al 2003 stefan and bolton 2002 although effective this ex situ approach is expensive because typical energy requirements for treating ndma to ng l concentrations are far greater than for pathogen removal particularly when order of magnitude reductions are required and or when other constituents in the water increase turbidity or otherwise reduce treatment efficiency mitch et al 2003 moreover this approach requires the capital investment in typical pump and treat infrastructure i e piping pumps control system facility water discharge system in addition to the uv system historically ndma was not considered to be an important water contaminant so no federal maximum contaminant level mcl currently exists for drinking water in the u s however according to the u s environmental protection agency usepa a safe level of ndma in drinking water based on lifetime de minimis risk calculations 10 6 risk of developing cancer is a mere 0 7 ng l usepa 1993 ndma along with several other nitrosamines is listed on the usepa s contaminant candidate list 4 ccl 4 usepa 2016 large water utilities are required to analyze for ccl listed compounds so that the usepa can determine their prevalence and concentrations in drinking water sources nationwide this is a possible step toward regulation under the safe drinking water act a total of 15 states have established health based guidance levels for ndma in drinking water ranging from 0 7 to 18 ng l usepa 2017 moreover local or state regulatory bodies often set discharge limits for ndma treated via ex situ processes under the resource conservation recovery act rcra or other relevant legislation and these limits are typically in the ng l range e g 4 2 ng l for the nasa white sands test facility hatzinger et al 2017 the prospects of setting a federal maximum contaminant level mcl for ndma in water is unclear but with water resources becoming increasingly scarce and recharge and reuse of wastewater becoming more common ndma is likely to remain as a contaminant of concern in drinking water for the forseeable future the objective of this project was to demonstrate an effective in situ biological remediation option for the treatment of ndma the technology chosen cometabolic biosparging relies on the use of an inexpensive alkane substrate propane and oxygen to stimulate the growth and degradative activity of propane oxidizing bacteria propanotrophs a number of which have been observed to aerobically biodegrade ndma while using propane as a substrate sharp et al 2005 2007 2010 fournier et al 2009 weidhaas et al 2012 homme and sharp 2013 propane and potentially other compounds induces the enzyme propane monooxygenase prmo in these microorganisms which has been observed to catalyze the degradation of ndma as well as numerous other persistent water pollutants sharp et al 2007 2010 homme and sharp 2013 steffan et al 1997 wackett et al 1989 while growing on the propane the bacteria fortuitously degrade ndma via the prmo enzyme without gain of carbon or energy a process termed cometabolism alexander 1994 unlike bioremediation processes that require the degradative bacteria to metabolize and grow on the target contaminant the addition of a secondary growth substrate e g propane to support bacterial growth has been observed to allow cometabolic treatment of μg l concentrations of some contaminants such as ndma and 1 2 dibromoethane to low ng l concentrations e g fournier et al 2009 hatzinger et al 2015 2017 2018 such treatment levels are typically not attainable with metabolic systems because there is insufficient carbon and energy for microbial growth alexander 1994 schmidt et al 1985 this approach also may allow the simultaneous treatment of multiple co contaminants at low concentrations e g chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes and 1 4 dioxane tovanabootr et al 2001 lippincott et al 2015 chu et al 2018 during this field demonstration propane and oxygen from air were added to an ndma contaminated aquifer to stimulate native propanotrophs to biodegrade ndma from 20 μg l to low ng l concentrations to our knowledge this represents the first in situ treatment approach for ndma remediation that is likely to have wide applicability 2 materials and methods 2 1 site geology and hydrogeology the aerojet general corporation superfund site aerojet where the demonstration was conducted is located in eastern sacramento county california usa near the transition zone between the great valley and sierra nevada geomorphic provinces the geology of the great valley as summarized by hackel 1966 can be described as a large elongate northwest trending asymmetric trough this trough is filled with a very thick sequence up to 18 000 m of sediments of primarily marine origin ranging in age from jurassic to recent the sediments that compose the eastern flank of the great valley where aerojet is situated thin dramatically as they approach the foothills of the sierra nevada and eventually thin out completely exposing the underlying crystalline basement rocks of pre tertiary age igneous and metamorphic rocks that make up the sierra nevada mountain range aerojet is underlain by fluvial and marine sedimentary deposits ranging in age from cretaceous to recent these sedimentary deposits unconformably overlie jurassic aged metamorphic basement rocks that dip to the west these sediments form a wedge which thickens from east to west across the aerojet site the easternmost sediments at the aerojet site are about 18 m thick while at its western boundary a distance of 10 km the sediments are nearly 600 m thick hydrostratigraphic layers identified at the site include quaternary sediments and the tertiary aged laguna formation mehrten formation valley springs formation and ione formation a hydrostratigraphic cross section that passes through the demonstration area is presented in supplementary data figure s 1 the wells installed for this demonstration were screened in layer m4 a permeable zone in the mehrten formation which is composed of multiple sublayers of coarse grained fluvial black sands variegated gravels and interbedded clays tuffs and breccia and often contains the first waterbearing sublayer encountered across the facility figure s 1 the mehrten formation contains the most productive aquifers underlying the aerojet site and serves as the principal source of water for private and public water supply wells in the area the majority of the chemicals released to groundwater are found in the mehrten formation groundwater flow direction is controlled by a local bedrock high oriented east to west across the middle of the facility locally a trough in the bedrock controls groundwater flow toward alder creek reported hydraulic conductivities for the various hydrostratigraphic layers range from 0 3 to 106 m day with an average of about 21 m day central valley environmental inc 2005 slug testing performed on three monitoring wells prior to the demonstration indicated hydraulic conductivities ranging from 0 05 to 1 6 m day in the chosen test plot area a subsequent passive flux meter test annable et al 2005 conducted in three of the installed test plot wells revealed darcy velocities in each well ranging from 0 12 to 0 17 m day with wells generally showing an increased velocity with depth in the interval tested the average groundwater velocity was 0 14 m day based on all measured values supplementary data figure s 2 and accompanying text 2 2 demonstration plot design and operation as previously discussed in situ remediation of ndma via cometabolism was undertaken via the addition and distribution of propane gas and oxygen in groundwater for this demonstration an air and propane biosparging approach was utilized to deliver these gases to the subsurface the main advantage of this approach is that the necessary substrates can be supplied to a contaminated aquifer without pumping groundwater which requires significant additional infrastructure and operation and maintenance concerns such as biofouling that being said recirculation systems have been used successfully in recent years for cometabolic bioremediation of various contaminants including 1 2 dibromoethane hatzinger et al 2018 and mixtures of 1 4 dioxane and chlorinated organics chu et al 2018 one of the disadvantages of biosparging is the potential for poor gas distribution in highly heterogenous formations with primary gas flow channeling through the most conductive zones in a formation and bypassing other regions as has been observed for traditional high flow air sparging applications leeson et al 2002 and references therein however the focus of this demonstration on a confined permeable region in a highly layered aquifer was thought to minimize the potential for significant short circuiting of added air and propane 2 2 1 demonstration plot layout an overhead view of the demonstration plot design is provided in fig 1 and a generalized test plot cross section and conceptual design is provided in fig 2 during the initial operation 4 months only one well was generally used as a propane sparge well pmw 1 but for the duration of the project thereafter three wells were utilized pmw 1 bw 6 bw 7 the bw 6 and bw 7 wells were installed when the initial sparge well was observed to not provide sufficient propane to the treatment area the final demonstration plot included 7 monitoring wells monitoring wells were divided into three groups 1 one background monitoring well bmw 1 located 23 m sidegradient of the central part of the test plot 2 four treatment zone performance monitoring wells pmw 1 pmw 2 pmw 3 pmw 4 located within pmw 1 pmw 2 slightly upgradient pmw 3 1 2 m and slightly downgradient pmw 4 4 1 m of the triangulated propane sparge wells and 3 two downgradient monitoring wells pmw 5 and pmw 6 located 9 1 m and 10 7 m downgradient of the central region the triangulated propane sparge wells respectively the final spacing of the biosparge and monitoring wells was determined based upon an initial field test in which air was injected into a temporary well over time at differing flow rates 0 014 0 14 cubic meters per minute cmm and dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured using a field meter see section 2 2 4 in wells installed from 2 5 to 8 m from the biosparge well the short term tests indicated a radius of influence for a single sparge well of at least 3 8 m at a gas flow rate of 0 14 cmm data not shown background well bmw 1 was located outside of the expected influence of the biosparging system and was used to verify ndma and other groundwater contaminant concentrations flowing through the treatment area because of the steep vertical grade of the test site it was not possible to install a well upgradient of the test plot but the test plot wells and the control well were all located within the central region of a large ndma plume performance monitoring wells pmw 1 through pmw 4 were used to verify propane and oxygen distribution propanotroph numbers and treatment effectiveness within the treatment zone pmw 1 was also used as a biosparge well throughout the demonstration as previously described performance wells pmw 5 and pmw 6 were used to evaluate treatment effectiveness downgradient of the treatment zone monitoring and biosparging wells were installed via rotosonic drilling continuous cores were initially collected from ground surface to the bottom of each boring the lithology of each core was logged by a qualified geologist an example of one of the boring logs is provided in supplementary data figure s 3 and a general schematic of the site geology is provided in fig 2 the wells were installed through the temporary casing placed via the rotosonic method and were constructed with flush threaded 5 cm diameter schedule 40 pvc riser and screen the monitoring wells and biosparging wells bw 6 and bw 7 were constructed with 1 5 m of 0 025 cm slotted well screen final screen lengths and intervals at each location were determined based on the lithology observed during drilling screen intervals were selected to ensure that the well screen was placed within the zone with highest overall ndma concentrations which was a highly conductive interval zone m4 figure s 1 in the mehrten formation characterized by well graded gravel and sand fig 2 a previous investigation using depth dependent groundwater sampling identified this general zone as having the highest ndma concentrations among the conductive intervals encountered during drilling data not shown the depth to the top of the screen of each well varied from 13 7 to 18 3 m below ground surface the filter pack for each well consisted of 2 12 sand or equivalent extending to 0 9 m above the top of screen a minimum 0 9 m bentonite seal was placed above the filter pack the remaining annular space was filled with cement bentonite grout no more than five percent bentonite by weight emplaced to within 0 6 m of the surface via tremie pipe well development was accomplished by pumping the groundwater until the water was clear and the well was sediment free to the extent practical wells were developed using a surge block if necessary and submersible pump water was not added to the well to aid in development nor was any type of air lift technique used the pump tubing and surge block were decontaminated between locations 2 2 2 biosparging system design the propane biosparging system used during this demonstration was described previously in lippincott et al 2015 in summary the system consists of two trailers one of which contains the main control panel and main electrical junction box as well as the air feed system a two stage duplex air compressor w 5 hp motors and a 450 l tank capable of providing 1 cmm 1200 kpa the air flow from the initial trailer is transferred to the second trailer via flexible hose the second trailer consists of the propane feed system air propane distribution system and a soil vapor extraction sve system the sve system was not utilized during this demonstration the propane is fed from an external propane cylinder with a two stage regulator that delivers propane to the air propane distribution system in the second trailer the system is designed to feed propane below the lower explosive limit lel 2 1 and will automatically shut down in the event the lel is exceeded the propane used for this demonstration was purchased in 44 kg tanks and was 99 purity with no mercaptans added airgas sacramento ca propane feed concentrations for this demonstration were generally between 30 and 40 vol vol v v of the lel between 0 63 and 0 84 propane the air propane mixture exiting the second trailer is manifolded among 1 5 discharge points that include flow indicators with needle valves i e maximum of 5 sparge wells 2 2 3 biosparging system operation performance monitoring the biosparging system was operated for a period of 374 days from start up to shut down as noted pmw 1 was operated as the sole sparging well for the first 4 months of operation and then wells bw 6 bw 7 and pmw 1 were operated together for the remaining period of operation the operational data are provided in supplementary data table s 1 the variables that were adjusted and optimized throughout the demonstration included 1 the average lel reading measure of percentage propane in the air propane feed 2 the length of the sparging cycles 3 the number of sparging cycles per day and 4 the breakdown of the sparge cycle which was composed of an initial air sparge and period of combined air propane sparging and then a final air sparge to clear the sparge lines of propane gas these variables were modified during the demonstration as described below and in table s 1 based upon the levels of propane and ndma observed during sampling events and during propane degradation testing the percent propane in the sparge gas was increased over the first few months of the demonstration and eventually set at 40 of the lel on day 131 which equated to 0 84 propane in the feed gas the setting remained at this level through day 374 when the sparge system was shut down similarly the number of cycles per day was increased from 6 to 8 on day 89 and then further to 12 on day 217 through the end of operation on day 374 the amount of time that propane was sparged to each of the wells per cycle was increased from 20 min to 26 min on day 89 decreased slightly to 24 min on day 134 and then increased to 40 min on day 217 for the remainder of the 374 day sparging period the amount of propane added to the test plot wells 0 8 kg day was considered optimized on day 217 and generally remained the same thereafter for the remaining 5 months of active sparging full rounds of groundwater sampling were conducted on 13 occasions as shown on table s 1 this included two sampling rounds to establish baseline i e pre gas injection conditions on day 84 and 70 with day 0 being the beginning of system operation nine performance sampling events during active sparging days 42 84 161 185 213 241 287 311 and 353 and two rebound events after biosparging ceased day 385 and 430 sampling generally consisted of 7 wells pmw 1 to pmw 6 and bmw 1 an additional round of baseline sampling of all wells excluding pmw 6 for propanotrophs was also conducted on day 6 for the final three sampling events wells bw 6 and bw 7 were also sampled 2 2 4 groundwater sampling and analytical groundwater samples were collected by field personnel utilizing low flow purging in accordance with usepa low flow ground water sampling protocol puls and barcelona 1996 samples were obtained from each monitoring well using a dedicated submersible bladder pump and teflon tubing groundwater was passed through a flow through cell fitted with a ysi 600xl field meter yellow springs oh that simultaneously measured ph orp temperature specific conductivity and do the values for each parameter were recorded and once all values were stable based upon low flow sampling protocol groundwater samples were collected for laboratory analysis all field meters were calibrated at the beginning of each day groundwater samples were analyzed for basic field parameters ndma usepa method 521 dissolved gases methane propane ethane ethene via epa 3810 rsk175 kampbell and vandegrift 1998 and anions usepa 300 0 total propanotrophic bacteria were quantified during one baseline event prior to gas injection to establish background levels and four of the monthly events thereafter the analysis of anions and dissolved gases was performed by aptim s analytical laboratory in lawrenceville nj total propanotrophs were quantified by qpcr at microbial insights knoxville tn by measuring the genes for prmo using a set of proprietary primer and probe sequences derived from gordonia sp strain ty 5 kotani et al 2003 analysis of ndma was performed by weck laboratories city of industry ca weck laboratories is a california department of public health approved lab and is listed under the state of california environmental laboratory accreditation program elap 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndma ndma declined by 99 7 to 99 9 in the four monitoring wells within the zone of influence of the biosparge system pmw 1 to pmw 4 an area of 6 m by 6 m fig 3 baseline concentrations of 25 000 6 000 ng l ndma average groundwater concentrations in the 7 test plot wells from day 70 and day 84 declined to between 2 7 and 72 ng l by day 353 mean value 40 30 ng l 99 8 reduction similar declines in ndma also were observed in biosparge wells bw 6 and bw 7 with reductions exceeding 99 9 the sidegradient control well bmw 1 that was not appreciably influenced by the system had an average ndma concentration of 36 000 ng l during baseline sampling and was 31 000 ng l on day 353 a decline of only 14 the far downgradient wells pmw 5 and pmw 6 showed measurable declines near the end of the demonstration presumably as treated water from the biosparge plot began to reach this region of the aquifer ndma in pmw 5 and pmw 6 declined to 5 400 ng l and 13 000 ng l respectively by day 430 the final day of sample collection pseudo first order degradation rate constants were determined for monitoring wells pmw 2 to pmw 6 and well bmw 1 using data from day 84 to day 353 see fig 3 and supplementary data table s 2 and figure s 4 and accompanying text a rate constant was not calculated for pmw 1 which also served as a sparge well the rates assume that losses are due to biodegradation rather than volatile losses given the high water solubility and low henry s law constant for ndma the relatively low gas flow rates i e compared to an air sparging application to volatize chemicals which is typically designed with soil vapor extraction sve and the fact that the geological interval where the gases were added was confined estimated rate constants for ndma in treatment area monitoring wells pmw 2 pmw 3 and pmw 4 were 0 037 0 011 day 1 0 019 0 008 day 1 and 0 031 0 014 day 1 respectively these rates equate to ndma half lives ranging from 19 to 36 days and are similar to those reported by lippincott et al 2015 for treatment of 1 4 dioxane using propane biosparging at a site in california where degradation rates varied from 0 02 day 1 to 0 04 day 1 the rates are higher than those reported for the model estimated biodegradation of ndma 0 01 day 1 in a california aquifer receiving recycled water for recharge zhao et al 2008 it is likely that this process may also be cometabolic with substrates in the recycled wastewater supporting ndma biodegradation particularly since no organisms capable of growth linked ndma biodegradation have yet been reported no other comparable in situ rate data for active ndma treatment are available to our knowledge after the system was shut down on day 373 increases in ndma were observed in all four of the monitoring wells within the zone of influence of the biosparge wells fig 3 this is consistent with a supply of propane gas being necessary for continued in situ biodegradation as ndma enters the treatment zone in the aquifer from upgradient for a full scale application e g as a downgradient biobarrier the in situ system would be required to operate until ndma concentrations in the upgradient region declined to below regulatory levels this plume is currently captured via a series of extraction wells and the ndma is treated in a central facility using a uv system the data from this field test clearly indicate that propane biosparging is an effective approach to reduce the concentrations of ndma in a groundwater aquifer by 3 4 orders of magnitude and that concentrations in the low ng l range can be achieved with continuous treatment these results are consistent with data achieved in pure culture studies fournier et al 2009 as well as using various bioreactor designs in both the laboratory and the field hatzinger et al 2011 2017 webster et al 2013 to our knowledge this is the first report of successful in situ treatment of ndma in groundwater to ng l concentrations using cometabolism or any other bioremediation approach the application of propane biosparging lippincott et al 2015 and groundwater recirculation with propane chu et al 2018 for effective treatment of another dod contaminant of concern 1 4 dioxane have also recently been reported a number of different co mingled chlorinated aliphatics were simultaneously treated during each of these demonstrations 3 2 propane and oxygen distribution of adequate propane and oxygen and appropriate ratios of these two gases was critical to the success of this remedial approach as previously noted preliminary testing at the demonstration plot suggested that a gas sparging radius of at least 3 8 m could be achieved in the aquifer from a single sparge well when the system was started initially with sparging through well pmw 1 dissolved propane was detected at between 5 and 50 μg l in pmw 4 which was located 6 1 m from pmw 1 showing that the gas was being distributed in the aquifer fig 4 however based on analytical results for both dissolved propane and ndma the amount of propane provided by pmw 1 alone was not sufficient for stimulating ndma degradation so biosparge wells bw 6 and bw 7 were added to the plot to increase propane distribution the addition of these wells significantly increased the dissolved propane concentrations in pmw 1 pmw 2 and pmw 3 500 μg l and the overall amount of propane supplied to the demonstration plot pmw 4 also had detectable dissolved propane albeit at lower concentrations than the other three wells it is interesting to note that low concentrations of propane 70 μg l were detected in control well bmw 1 which was 23 m away from the center of the demonstration plot for a few months after installation of bw 6 and bw 7 significant ndma degradation was not indicated in this well likely because the quantities of propane reaching this region were too low to stimulate significant bacterial activity however some of the added propane clearly traveled this far in the aquifer this may reflect the fact that the biosparging zone was in a confined region of the aquifer which acted to enhance horizontal transport do in the test plot was generally below 5 mg l prior to the initiation of biosparging do increased throughout the treatment zone wells pmw 1 to pmw 4 consistently to 10 mg l during active sparging even when only pmw 1 was in operation as the lone biosparge well fig 5 do increases of similar magnitude were observed in downgradient well pmw 5 after installation of additional biosparge wells bw 6 bw 7 and do in downgradient well pmw 6 also increased to near 10 mg l by the end of the demonstration slight increases in do were detected in control well bmw 1 but the maximum do was 5 mg l and the concentration decreased after day 300 this may be due to seasonal variations or indicate that as with propane a small amount of sparged air reached the side gradient well the oxygen propane ratio in the groundwater was important to the success of this field demonstration in particular it was important to ensure that adequate oxygen was present to support propane biodegradation and not create anoxic conditions in the aquifer the required molar ratio of oxygen o2 to propane c3h8 for complete oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide co2 not accounting for microbial biomass incorporation of c is 5 mols o2 to 1 mol c3h8 eq 1 when converted to mg l the above stoichiometry suggests that the oxygen requirement for bacteria to biodegrade 1 mg l of c3h8 is 3 6 mg l o2 thus on a mg l basis an oxygen to propane ratio of 4 1 is required to ensure that anoxic conditions do not occur in the aquifer 1 c3h8 5o2 3co2 4h2o a desired ratio of oxygen to propane was always exceeded based on the analytical data generated during the project with do typically exceeding 10 mg l fig 5 during system operation and dissolved propane never exceeding 1 mg l fig 4 during a sparging field test run under optimized conditions two 45 min sparge cycles were conducted at 0 17 cmm with propane at 40 of the lel and propane was measured in pmw 3 and pmw 4 before during and after each of the sparge cycles fig 6 propane concentrations in these wells which reached 225 μg l declined to 25 50 μg l during 1 h indicating rapid consumption of propane in the aquifer if one assumes that the decline in concentration is due predominantly to biodegradation the propane first order decay rates in these wells are 0 03 min 1 for pmw 3 and 0 02 min 1 for pmw 4 these propane decay rates are consistent with those observed recently at vandenberg air force base during a demonstration of cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane 0 01 0 05 min 1 lippincott et al 2015 3 3 nitrate and sulfate nitrate concentrations in pmw 1 through pmw 5 declined appreciably over the course of the demonstration fig 7 the background levels in most of the wells ranged from 1 7 to 2 5 mg l as no3 n with slightly lower values in pmw 6 during system operation no3 n in pmw 1 to pmw 5 declined to 0 3 mg l a similar decline did not occur in background well bmw 1 and pmw 6 only showed a moderate decline toward the end of the demonstration nitrite was not detected in any of the wells because of the high do the loss of nitrate is likely not the result of denitrification a process that is typically inhibited by oxygen ferguson 1994 rather the consumption of nitrate is consistent with assimilation of n from no3 by propanotrophs in the aquifer as a required inorganic nutrient no exogenous inorganic nutrients were added to the aquifer as is often required during cometabolic treatment e g lippincott et al 2015 hatzinger et al 2018 so bacterial assimilation of existing inorganic nutrients is expected as a general confirmation of this hypothesis sulfate concentrations throughout the test plot ranged from 13 to 20 mg l during baseline sampling and remained consistently in this range over the course of the demonstration as would be expected under the oxidizing conditions in the aquifer supplementary data figure s 5 unlike n most bacteria do not require significant quantities of s as a nutrient for growth 3 4 propanotrophic bacteria the population of indigenous propanotrophs in wells pmw 2 pmw 3 and pmw 4 increased by greater than 1 log order over the course of the demonstration fig 8 on day 311 the final day of sampling during active biosparging the propanotroph density in these three wells ranged from 2 105 to 6 105 cells ml the propanotroph population in each of these wells remained reasonably constant thereafter even in the absence of propane addition for more than 100 days by comparison the cell density in bmw 1 declined from 2 104 to 6 103 cells ml over the entire course of the demonstration it should also be noted that only propanotrophs present as planktonic bacteria in groundwater were measured it is possible even likely that the density of propanotrophs adsorbed to aquifer particles increased more significantly as some of these organisms are known to form biofilms hatzinger et al 2011 2018 webster et al 2013 lippincott et al 2015 3 5 ph and oxidation reduction potential the ph in the demonstration plot generally remained between 6 5 and 7 during the demonstration figure s 6 the ph was slightly elevated in pmw 1 which was used as both a sparge well and a monitoring well during some events but did not exceed 7 5 su the baseline oxidation reduction potential orp in the plot ranged from 100 mv to 100 mv prior to system start up with the exception of day 161 when the orp in three of the pmws was negative the orp in the demonstration plot wells was generally greater than 100 mv indicating that conditions were sufficiently oxidizing for an aerobic degradation process to occur figure s 7 3 6 technology application this field demonstration showed for the first time that propane biosparging can be an effective approach to reduce the concentrations of ndma in a groundwater aquifer by 3 4 orders of magnitude and that concentrations in the low ng l range can be achieved the ability to reach ng l concentrations of ndma with cometabolism is consistent with data from previous laboratory studies with pure cultures as well as laboratory and field bioreactor testing fournier et al 2009 webster et al 2013 hatzinger et al 2018 at the aerojet site as well as other large dilute ndma plumes the most effective full scale application of cometabolic biosparging is likely to be a biobarrier to prevent further downgradient migration of contaminated groundwater this type of barrier could be designed with either vertical or horizontal gas injection wells depending on site geology and economic considerations in order to optimize this approach however it is important to conduct initial testing in an aquifer to assess the distribution of gases from biosparge wells both horizontally and vertically in the aquifer like traditional air sparging leeson et al 2002 biosparged gases can follow preferential flow paths which may impact their overall distribution in an aquifer in addition while secondary sinks for oxygen in the aerojet aquifer were minimal if conditions in an aquifer are highly anaerobic a longer timeframe may be required to achieve desired levels of oxygen in an aquifer to support cometabolic bioremediation under such conditions however a biosparging approach would typically be favored over a design where gases are added to extracted groundwater and reinjected because mineral and biological fouling of such systems is likely to limit their long term effectiveness finally in the absence of mg l concentrations of nitrate n in groundwater it is likely that another source of n will need to be added during biosparging to maintain cell growth and contaminant degradation rates over time 4 conclusions field data suggest that biosparging with propane in air can be an effective in situ approach to treat ndma in groundwater to low ng l concentrations for large dilute plumes of ndma such as that present at the aerojet site a biobarrier design

lawrenceville nj united states biotechnology development and applications group aptim federal services lawrenceville nj united states biotechnology development and applications group aptim federal services lawrenceville nj united states corresponding author n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is found in groundwater and drinking water from industrial agricultural water treatment and military aerospace sources and it must often be treated to part per trillion ng l concentrations the most effective remedial technology for ndma in groundwater is pump and treat with ultraviolet irradiation uv but this approach is expensive because it requires ex situ infrastructure and high energy input the objective of this project was to evaluate an in situ biological treatment approach for ndma previous laboratory studies have revealed that propane oxidizing bacteria are capable of biodegrading ndma from μg l to low ng l concentrations fournier et al 2009 webster et al 2013 during this field study air and propane gas were sparged into an ndma contaminated aquifer for more than 1 year groundwater samples were collected throughout the study from a series of monitoring wells within downgradient and sidegradient of the zone of influence of the biosparge system over the course of the study ndma concentrations declined by 99 7 to 99 9 in the four monitoring wells within the zone of influence of the biosparge system reaching low ng l concentrations whereas the control well declined by only 14 pseudo first order degradation rate constants for ndma in system monitoring wells ranged from 0 019 day 1 to 0 037 day 1 equating to half lives ranging from 19 to 36 days native propanotrophs increased by more than one order of magnitude in the propane impacted wells but not in the control well the field data show for the first time that propane biosparging can be an effective in situ approach to reduce the concentrations of ndma in a groundwater to ng l concentrations graphical abstract image 1

drinking water supplies as a disinfection byproduct formed during chlorination particularly when chloramine reacts with dimethylamine or other organic nitrogen precursors mitch and sedlak 2002a b

utilities are required to analyze for ccl listed compounds so that the usepa can determine their prevalence and concentrations in drinking water sources nationwide this is a possible step toward regulation under the safe drinking water act a total of 15 states have established health based guidance levels for ndma in drinking water ranging from 0 7 to 18 ng l usepa 2017 moreover local or state regulatory bodies often set discharge limits for ndma treated via ex situ processes under the resource conservation recovery act rcra or other relevant legislation and these limits are typically in the ng l range e g 4 2 ng l for the nasa white sands test facility hatzinger et al 2017 the prospects of setting a federal maximum contaminant level mcl for ndma in water is unclear but with water resources becoming increasingly scarce and recharge and reuse of wastewater becoming more common ndma is likely to remain as a contaminant of concern in drinking water for the forseeable future the objective of this project was to demonstrate an effective in situ biological remediation option for the treatment of ndma the technology chosen cometabolic biosparging relies on the use of an inexpensive alkane substrate propane and oxygen to stimulate the growth and degradative activity of propane oxidizing bacteria propanotrophs a number of which have been observed to aerobically biodegrade ndma while using propane as a substrate sharp et al 2005 2007 2010 fournier et al 2009 weidhaas et al 2012 homme and sharp 2013 propane and potentially other compounds induces the enzyme propane monooxygenase prmo in these microorganisms which has been observed to catalyze the degradation of ndma as well as numerous other persistent water pollutants sharp et al 2007 2010 homme and sharp 2013 steffan et al 1997 wackett et al 1989 while growing on the propane the bacteria fortuitously degrade ndma via the prmo enzyme without gain of carbon or energy a process termed cometabolism alexander 1994 unlike bioremediation processes that require the degradative bacteria to metabolize and grow on the target contaminant the addition of a secondary growth substrate e g propane to support bacterial growth has been observed to allow cometabolic treatment of μg l concentrations of some contaminants such as ndma and 1 2 dibromoethane to low ng l concentrations e g fournier et al 2009 hatzinger et al 2015 2017 2018 such treatment levels are typically not attainable with metabolic systems because there is insufficient carbon and energy for microbial growth alexander 1994 schmidt et al 1985 this approach also may allow the simultaneous treatment of multiple co contaminants at low concentrations e g chlorinated ethenes chlorinated ethanes and 1 4 dioxane tovanabootr et al 2001 lippincott et al 2015 chu et al 2018 during this field demonstration propane and oxygen from air were added to an ndma contaminated aquifer to stimulate native propanotrophs to biodegrade ndma from 20 μg l to low ng l concentrations to our knowledge this represents the first in situ treatment approach for ndma remediation that is likely to have wide applicability 2 materials and methods 2 1 site geology and hydrogeology the aerojet general corporation superfund site aerojet where the demonstration was conducted is located in eastern sacramento county california usa near the transition zone between the great valley and sierra nevada geomorphic provinces the geology of the great valley as summarized by hackel 1966 can be described as a large elongate northwest trending asymmetric trough this trough is filled with a very thick sequence up to 18 000 m of sediments of primarily marine origin ranging in age from jurassic to recent the sediments that compose the eastern flank of the great valley where aerojet is situated thin dramatically as they approach the foothills of the sierra nevada and eventually thin out completely exposing the underlying crystalline basement rocks of pre tertiary age igneous and metamorphic rocks that make up the sierra nevada mountain range aerojet is underlain by fluvial and marine sedimentary deposits ranging in age from cretaceous to recent these sedimentary deposits unconformably overlie jurassic aged metamorphic basement rocks that dip to the west these sediments form a wedge which thickens from east to west across the aerojet site the easternmost sediments at the aerojet site are about 18 m thick while at its western boundary a distance of 10 km the sediments are nearly 600 m thick hydrostratigraphic layers identified at the site include quaternary sediments and the tertiary aged laguna formation mehrten formation valley springs formation and ione formation a hydrostratigraphic cross section that passes through the demonstration area is presented in supplementary data figure s 1 the wells installed for this demonstration were screened in layer m4 a permeable zone in the mehrten formation which is composed of multiple sublayers of coarse grained fluvial black sands variegated gravels and interbedded clays tuffs and breccia and often contains the first waterbearing sublayer encountered across the facility figure s 1 the mehrten formation contains the most productive aquifers underlying the aerojet site and serves as the principal source of water for private and public water supply wells in the area the majority of the chemicals released to groundwater are found in the mehrten formation groundwater flow direction is controlled by a local bedrock high oriented east to west across the middle of the facility locally a trough in the bedrock controls groundwater flow toward alder creek reported hydraulic conductivities for the various hydrostratigraphic layers range from 0 3 to 106 m day with an average of about 21 m day central valley environmental inc 2005 slug testing performed on three monitoring wells prior to the demonstration indicated hydraulic conductivities ranging from 0 05 to 1 6 m day in the chosen test plot area a subsequent passive flux meter test annable et al 2005 conducted in three of the installed test plot wells revealed darcy velocities in each well ranging from 0 12 to 0 17 m day with wells generally showing an increased velocity with depth in the interval tested the average groundwater velocity was 0 14 m day based on all measured values supplementary data figure s 2 and accompanying text 2 2 demonstration plot design and operation as previously discussed in situ remediation of ndma via cometabolism was undertaken via the addition and distribution of propane gas and oxygen in groundwater for this demonstration an air and propane biosparging approach was utilized to deliver these gases to the subsurface the main advantage of this approach is that the necessary substrates can be supplied to a contaminated aquifer without pumping groundwater which requires significant additional infrastructure and operation and maintenance concerns such as biofouling that being said recirculation systems have been used successfully in recent years for cometabolic bioremediation of various contaminants including 1 2 dibromoethane hatzinger et al 2018 and mixtures of 1 4 dioxane and chlorinated organics chu et al 2018 one of the disadvantages of biosparging is the potential for poor gas distribution in highly heterogenous formations with primary gas flow channeling through the most conductive zones in a formation and bypassing other regions as has been observed for traditional high flow air sparging applications leeson et al 2002 and references therein however the focus of this demonstration on a confined permeable region in a highly layered aquifer was thought to minimize the potential for significant short circuiting of added air and propane 2 2 1 demonstration plot layout an overhead view of the demonstration plot design is provided in fig 1 and a generalized test plot cross section and conceptual design is provided in fig 2 during the initial operation 4 months only one well was generally used as a propane sparge well pmw 1 but for the duration of the project thereafter three wells were utilized pmw 1 bw 6 bw 7 the bw 6 and bw 7 wells were installed when the initial sparge well was observed to not provide sufficient propane to the treatment area the final demonstration plot included 7 monitoring wells monitoring wells were divided into three groups 1 one background monitoring well bmw 1 located 23 m sidegradient of the central part of the test plot 2 four treatment zone performance monitoring wells pmw 1 pmw 2 pmw 3 pmw 4 located within pmw 1 pmw 2 slightly upgradient pmw 3 1 2 m and slightly downgradient pmw 4 4 1 m of the triangulated propane sparge wells and 3 two downgradient monitoring wells pmw 5 and pmw 6 located 9 1 m and 10 7 m downgradient of the central region the triangulated propane sparge wells respectively the final spacing of the biosparge and monitoring wells was determined based upon an initial field test in which air was injected into a temporary well over time at differing flow rates 0 014 0 14 cubic meters per minute cmm and dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured using a field meter see section 2 2 4 in wells installed from 2 5 to 8 m from the biosparge well the short term tests indicated a radius of influence for a single sparge well of at least 3 8 m at a gas flow rate of 0 14 cmm data not shown background well bmw 1 was located outside of the expected influence of the biosparging system and was used to verify ndma and other groundwater contaminant concentrations flowing through the treatment area because of the steep vertical grade of the test site it was not possible to install a well upgradient of the test plot but the test plot wells and the control well were all located within the central region of a large ndma plume performance monitoring wells pmw 1 through pmw 4 were used to verify propane and oxygen distribution propanotroph numbers and treatment effectiveness within the treatment zone pmw 1 was also used as a biosparge well throughout the demonstration as previously described performance wells pmw 5 and pmw 6 were used to evaluate treatment effectiveness downgradient of the treatment zone monitoring and biosparging wells were installed via rotosonic drilling continuous cores were initially collected from ground surface to the bottom of each boring the lithology of each core was logged by a qualified geologist an example of one of the boring logs is provided in supplementary data figure s 3 and a general schematic of the site geology is provided in fig 2 the wells were installed through the temporary casing placed via the rotosonic method and were constructed with flush threaded 5 cm diameter schedule 40 pvc riser and screen the monitoring wells and biosparging wells bw 6 and bw 7 were constructed with 1 5 m of 0 025 cm slotted well screen final screen lengths and intervals at each location were determined based on the lithology observed during drilling screen intervals were selected to ensure that the well screen was placed within the zone with highest overall ndma concentrations which was a highly conductive interval zone m4 figure s 1 in the mehrten formation characterized by well graded gravel and sand fig 2 a previous investigation using depth dependent groundwater sampling identified this general zone as having the highest ndma concentrations among the conductive intervals encountered during drilling data not shown the depth to the top of the screen of each well varied from 13 7 to 18 3 m below ground surface the filter pack for each well consisted of 2 12 sand or equivalent extending to 0 9 m above the top of screen a minimum 0 9 m bentonite seal was placed above the filter pack the remaining annular space was filled with cement bentonite grout no more than five percent bentonite by weight emplaced to within 0 6 m of the surface via tremie pipe well development was accomplished by pumping the groundwater until the water was clear and the well was sediment free to the extent practical wells were developed using a surge block if necessary and submersible pump water was not added to the well to aid in development nor was any type of air lift technique used the pump tubing and surge block were decontaminated between locations 2 2 2 biosparging system design the propane biosparging system used during this demonstration was described previously in lippincott et al 2015 in summary the system consists of two trailers one of which contains the main control panel and main electrical junction box as well as the air feed system a two stage duplex air compressor w 5 hp motors and a 450 l tank capable of providing 1 cmm 1200 kpa the air flow from the initial trailer is transferred to the second trailer via flexible hose the second trailer consists of the propane feed system air propane distribution system and a soil vapor extraction sve system the sve system was not utilized during this demonstration the propane is fed from an external propane cylinder with a two stage regulator that delivers propane to the air propane distribution system in the second trailer the system is designed to feed propane below the lower explosive limit lel 2 1 and will automatically shut down in the event the lel is exceeded the propane used for this demonstration was purchased in 44 kg tanks and was 99 purity with no mercaptans added airgas sacramento ca propane feed concentrations for this demonstration were generally between 30 and 40 vol vol v v of the lel between 0 63 and 0 84 propane the air propane mixture exiting the second trailer is manifolded among 1 5 discharge points that include flow indicators with needle valves i e maximum of 5 sparge wells 2 2 3 biosparging system operation performance monitoring the biosparging system was operated for a period of 374 days from start up to shut down as noted pmw 1 was operated as the sole sparging well for the first 4 months of operation and then wells bw 6 bw 7 and pmw 1 were operated together for the remaining period of operation the operational data are provided in supplementary data table s 1 the variables that were adjusted and optimized throughout the demonstration included 1 the average lel reading measure of percentage propane in the air propane feed 2 the length of the sparging cycles 3 the number of sparging cycles per day and 4 the breakdown of the sparge cycle which was composed of an initial air sparge and period of combined air propane sparging and then a final air sparge to clear the sparge lines of propane gas these variables were modified during the demonstration as described below and in table s 1 based upon the levels of propane and ndma observed during sampling events and during propane degradation testing the percent propane in the sparge gas was increased over the first few months of the demonstration and eventually set at 40 of the lel on day 131 which equated to 0 84 propane in the feed gas the setting remained at this level through day 374 when the sparge system was shut down similarly the number of cycles per day was increased from 6 to 8 on day 89 and then further to 12 on day 217 through the end of operation on day 374 the amount of time that propane was sparged to each of the wells per cycle was increased from 20 min to 26 min on day 89 decreased slightly to 24 min on day 134 and then increased to 40 min on day 217 for the remainder of the 374 day sparging period the amount of propane added to the test plot wells 0 8 kg day was considered optimized on day 217 and generally remained the same thereafter for the remaining 5 months of active sparging full rounds of groundwater sampling were conducted on 13 occasions as shown on table s 1 this included two sampling rounds to establish baseline i e pre gas injection conditions on day 84 and 70 with day 0 being the beginning of system operation nine performance sampling events during active sparging days 42 84 161 185 213 241 287 311 and 353 and two rebound events after biosparging ceased day 385 and 430 sampling generally consisted of 7 wells pmw 1 to pmw 6 and bmw 1 an additional round of baseline sampling of all wells excluding pmw 6 for propanotrophs was also conducted on day 6 for the final three sampling events wells bw 6 and bw 7 were also sampled 2 2 4 groundwater sampling and analytical groundwater samples were collected by field personnel utilizing low flow purging in accordance with usepa low flow ground water sampling protocol puls and barcelona 1996 samples were obtained from each monitoring well using a dedicated submersible bladder pump and teflon tubing groundwater was passed through a flow through cell fitted with a ysi 600xl field meter yellow springs oh that simultaneously measured ph orp temperature specific conductivity and do the values for each parameter were recorded and once all values were stable based upon low flow sampling protocol groundwater samples were collected for laboratory analysis all field meters were calibrated at the beginning of each day groundwater samples were analyzed for basic field parameters ndma usepa method 521 dissolved gases methane propane ethane ethene via epa 3810 rsk175 kampbell and vandegrift 1998 and anions usepa 300 0 total propanotrophic bacteria were quantified during one baseline event prior to gas injection to establish background levels and four of the monthly events thereafter the analysis of anions and dissolved gases was performed by aptim s analytical laboratory in lawrenceville nj total propanotrophs were quantified by qpcr at microbial insights knoxville tn by measuring the genes for prmo using a set of proprietary primer and probe sequences derived from gordonia sp strain ty 5 kotani et al 2003 analysis of ndma was performed by weck laboratories city of industry ca weck laboratories is a california department of public health approved lab and is listed under the state of california environmental laboratory accreditation program elap 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndma ndma declined by 99 7 to 99 9 in the four monitoring wells within the zone of influence of the biosparge system pmw 1 to pmw 4 an area of 6 m by 6 m fig 3 baseline concentrations of 25 000 6 000 ng l ndma average groundwater concentrations in the 7 test plot wells from day 70 and day 84 declined to between 2 7 and 72 ng l by day 353 mean value 40 30 ng l 99 8 reduction similar declines in ndma also were observed in biosparge wells bw 6 and bw 7 with reductions exceeding 99 9 the sidegradient control well bmw 1 that was not appreciably influenced by the system had an average ndma concentration of 36 000 ng l during baseline sampling and was 31 000 ng l on day 353 a decline of only 14 the far downgradient wells pmw 5 and pmw 6 showed measurable declines near the end of the demonstration presumably as treated water from the biosparge plot began to reach this region of the aquifer ndma in pmw 5 and pmw 6 declined to 5 400 ng l and 13 000 ng l respectively by day 430 the final day of sample collection pseudo first order degradation rate constants were determined for monitoring wells pmw 2 to pmw 6 and well bmw 1 using data from day 84 to day 353 see fig 3 and supplementary data table s 2 and figure s 4 and accompanying text a rate constant was not calculated for pmw 1 which also served as a sparge well the rates assume that losses are due to biodegradation rather than volatile losses given the high water solubility and low henry s law constant for ndma the relatively low gas flow rates i e compared to an air sparging application to volatize chemicals which is typically designed with soil vapor extraction sve and the fact that the geological interval where the gases were added was confined estimated rate constants for ndma in treatment area monitoring wells pmw 2 pmw 3 and pmw 4 were 0 037 0 011 day 1 0 019 0 008 day 1 and 0 031 0 014 day 1 respectively these rates equate to ndma half lives ranging from 19 to 36 days and are similar to those reported by lippincott et al 2015 for treatment of 1 4 dioxane using propane biosparging at a site in california where degradation rates varied from 0 02 day 1 to 0 04 day 1 the rates are higher than those reported for the model estimated biodegradation of ndma 0 01 day 1 in a california aquifer receiving recycled water for recharge zhao et al 2008 it is likely that this process may also be cometabolic with substrates in the recycled wastewater supporting ndma biodegradation particularly since no organisms capable of growth linked ndma biodegradation have yet been reported no other comparable in situ rate data for active ndma treatment are available to our knowledge after the system was shut down on day 373 increases in ndma were observed in all four of the monitoring wells within the zone of influence of the biosparge wells fig 3 this is consistent with a supply of propane gas being necessary for continued in situ biodegradation as ndma enters the treatment zone in the aquifer from upgradient for a full scale application e g as a downgradient biobarrier the in situ system would be required to operate until ndma concentrations in the upgradient region declined to below regulatory levels this plume is currently captured via a series of extraction wells and the ndma is treated in a central facility using a uv system the data from this field test clearly indicate that propane biosparging is an effective approach to reduce the concentrations of ndma in a groundwater aquifer by 3 4 orders of magnitude and that concentrations in the low ng l range can be achieved with continuous treatment these results are consistent with data achieved in pure culture studies fournier et al 2009 as well as using various bioreactor designs in both the laboratory and the field hatzinger et al 2011 2017 webster et al 2013 to our knowledge this is the first report of successful in situ treatment of ndma in groundwater to ng l concentrations using cometabolism or any other bioremediation approach the application of propane biosparging lippincott et al 2015 and groundwater recirculation with propane chu et al 2018 for effective treatment of another dod contaminant of concern 1 4 dioxane have also recently been reported a number of different co mingled chlorinated aliphatics were simultaneously treated during each of these demonstrations 3 2 propane and oxygen distribution of adequate propane and oxygen and appropriate ratios of these two gases was critical to the success of this remedial approach as previously noted preliminary testing at the demonstration plot suggested that a gas sparging radius of at least 3 8 m could be achieved in the aquifer from a single sparge well when the system was started initially with sparging through well pmw 1 dissolved propane was detected at between 5 and 50 μg l in pmw 4 which was located 6 1 m from pmw 1 showing that the gas was being distributed in the aquifer fig 4 however based on analytical results for both dissolved propane and ndma the amount of propane provided by pmw 1 alone was not sufficient for stimulating ndma degradation so biosparge wells bw 6 and bw 7 were added to the plot to increase propane distribution the addition of these wells significantly increased the dissolved propane concentrations in pmw 1 pmw 2 and pmw 3 500 μg l and the overall amount of propane supplied to the demonstration plot pmw 4 also had detectable dissolved propane albeit at lower concentrations than the other three wells it is interesting to note that low concentrations of propane 70 μg l were detected in control well bmw 1 which was 23 m away from the center of the demonstration plot for a few months after installation of bw 6 and bw 7 significant ndma degradation was not indicated in this well likely because the quantities of propane reaching this region were too low to stimulate significant bacterial activity however some of the added propane clearly traveled this far in the aquifer this may reflect the fact that the biosparging zone was in a confined region of the aquifer which acted to enhance horizontal transport do in the test plot was generally below 5 mg l prior to the initiation of biosparging do increased throughout the treatment zone wells pmw 1 to pmw 4 consistently to 10 mg l during active sparging even when only pmw 1 was in operation as the lone biosparge well fig 5 do increases of similar magnitude were observed in downgradient well pmw 5 after installation of additional biosparge wells bw 6 bw 7 and do in downgradient well pmw 6 also increased to near 10 mg l by the end of the demonstration slight increases in do were detected in control well bmw 1 but the maximum do was 5 mg l and the concentration decreased after day 300 this may be due to seasonal variations or indicate that as with propane a small amount of sparged air reached the side gradient well the oxygen propane ratio in the groundwater was important to the success of this field demonstration in particular it was important to ensure that adequate oxygen was present to support propane biodegradation and not create anoxic conditions in the aquifer the required molar ratio of oxygen o2 to propane c3h8 for complete oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide co2 not accounting for microbial biomass incorporation of c is 5 mols o2 to 1 mol c3h8 eq 1 when converted to mg l the above stoichiometry suggests that the oxygen requirement for bacteria to biodegrade 1 mg l of c3h8 is 3 6 mg l o2 thus on a mg l basis an oxygen to propane ratio of 4 1 is required to ensure that anoxic conditions do not occur in the aquifer 1 c3h8 5o2 3co2 4h2o a desired ratio of oxygen to propane was always exceeded based on the analytical data generated during the project with do typically exceeding 10 mg l fig 5 during system operation and dissolved propane never exceeding 1 mg l fig 4 during a sparging field test run under optimized conditions two 45 min sparge cycles were conducted at 0 17 cmm with propane at 40 of the lel and propane was measured in pmw 3 and pmw 4 before during and after each of the sparge cycles fig 6 propane concentrations in these wells which reached 225 μg l declined to 25 50 μg l during 1 h indicating rapid consumption of propane in the aquifer if one assumes that the decline in concentration is due predominantly to biodegradation the propane first order decay rates in these wells are 0 03 min 1 for pmw 3 and 0 02 min 1 for pmw 4 these propane decay rates are consistent with those observed recently at vandenberg air force base during a demonstration of cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane 0 01 0 05 min 1 lippincott et al 2015 3 3 nitrate and sulfate nitrate concentrations in pmw 1 through pmw 5 declined appreciably over the course of the demonstration fig 7 the background levels in most of the wells ranged from 1 7 to 2 5 mg l as no3 n with slightly lower values in pmw 6 during system operation no3 n in pmw 1 to pmw 5 declined to 0 3 mg l a similar decline did not occur in background well bmw 1 and pmw 6 only showed a moderate decline toward the end of the demonstration nitrite was not detected in any of the wells because of the high do the loss of nitrate is likely not the result of denitrification a process that is typically inhibited by oxygen ferguson 1994 rather the consumption of nitrate is consistent with assimilation of n from no3 by propanotrophs in the aquifer as a required inorganic nutrient no exogenous inorganic nutrients were added to the aquifer as is often required during cometabolic treatment e g lippincott et al 2015 hatzinger et al 2018 so bacterial assimilation of existing inorganic nutrients is expected as a general confirmation of this hypothesis sulfate concentrations throughout the test plot ranged from 13 to 20 mg l during baseline sampling and remained consistently in this range over the course of the demonstration as would be expected under the oxidizing conditions in the aquifer supplementary data figure s 5 unlike n most bacteria do not require significant quantities of s as a nutrient for growth 3 4 propanotrophic bacteria the population of indigenous propanotrophs in wells pmw 2 pmw 3 and pmw 4 increased by greater than 1 log order over the course of the demonstration fig 8 on day 311 the final day of sampling during active biosparging the propanotroph density in these three wells ranged from 2 105 to 6 105 cells ml the propanotroph population in each of these wells remained reasonably constant thereafter even in the absence of propane addition for more than 100 days by comparison the cell density in bmw 1 declined from 2 104 to 6 103 cells ml over the entire course of the demonstration it should also be noted that only propanotrophs present as planktonic bacteria in groundwater were measured it is possible even likely that the density of propanotrophs adsorbed to aquifer particles increased more significantly as some of these organisms are known to form biofilms hatzinger et al 2011 2018 webster et al 2013 lippincott et al 2015 3 5 ph and oxidation reduction potential the ph in the demonstration plot generally remained between 6 5 and 7 during the demonstration figure s 6 the ph was slightly elevated in pmw 1 which was used as both a sparge well and a monitoring well during some events but did not exceed 7 5 su the baseline oxidation reduction potential orp in the plot ranged from 100 mv to 100 mv prior to system start up with the exception of day 161 when the orp in three of the pmws was negative the orp in the demonstration plot wells was generally greater than 100 mv indicating that conditions were sufficiently oxidizing for an aerobic degradation process to occur figure s 7 3 6 technology application this field demonstration showed for the first time that propane biosparging can be an effective approach to reduce the concentrations of ndma in a groundwater aquifer by 3 4 orders of magnitude and that concentrations in the low ng l range can be achieved the ability to reach ng l concentrations of ndma with cometabolism is consistent with data from previous laboratory studies with pure cultures as well as laboratory and field bioreactor testing fournier et al 2009 webster et al 2013 hatzinger et al 2018 at the aerojet site as well as other large dilute ndma plumes the most effective full scale application of cometabolic biosparging is likely to be a biobarrier to prevent further downgradient migration of contaminated groundwater this type of barrier could be designed with either vertical or horizontal gas injection wells depending on site geology and economic considerations in order to optimize this approach however it is important to conduct initial testing in an aquifer to assess the distribution of gases from biosparge wells both horizontally and vertically in the aquifer like traditional air sparging leeson et al 2002 biosparged gases can follow preferential flow paths which may impact their overall distribution in an aquifer in addition while secondary sinks for oxygen in the aerojet aquifer were minimal if conditions in an aquifer are highly anaerobic a longer timeframe may be required to achieve desired levels of oxygen in an aquifer to support cometabolic bioremediation under such conditions however a biosparging approach would typically be favored over a design where gases are added to extracted groundwater and reinjected because mineral and biological fouling of such systems is likely to limit their long term effectiveness finally in the absence of mg l concentrations of nitrate n in groundwater it is likely that another source of n will need to be added during biosparging to maintain cell growth and contaminant degradation rates over time 4 conclusions field data suggest that biosparging with propane in air can be an effective in situ approach to treat ndma in groundwater to low ng l concentrations for large dilute plumes of ndma such as that present at the aerojet site a biobarrier design
