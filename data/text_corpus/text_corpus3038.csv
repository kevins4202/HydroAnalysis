15190,increased concentration of mercury particularly methylmercury in the environment is a worldwide concern because of its toxicity in severely exposed humans although the formation of methylmercury in oxic water columns has been previously suggested there is no evidence of the presence of microorganisms able to perform this process using the hgcab gene pair hgc microorganisms in such environments here we show the prevalence of hgc microorganisms in sinking particles of the oxic water column of lake geneva switzerland and france and its anoxic bottom sediments compared to anoxic sediments sinking particles found in oxic waters exhibited relatively high proportion of hgc genes taxonomically assigned to firmicutes in contrast hgc members from nitrospirae chloroflexota and pvc superphylum were prevalent in anoxic sediment while hgc desulfobacterota were found in both environments altogether the description of the diversity of putative mercury methylators in the oxic water

1 introduction in the environment inorganic divalent mercury hgii can be transformed into methylmercury mehg a neurotoxic compound that bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in aquatic food webs ultimately leading to severe environmental and human health risks doney et al 2010 mason et al 2012 driscoll et al 2013 this process also called hg methylation is mediated by microorganisms carrying hgca and hgcb genes hgc microorganisms coding respectively for a corrinoid protein and a ferredoxin parks et al 2013 smith et al 2015 the discovery of hgc genes opens avenues to unravel the diversity and distribution of putative hg methylators in the environment in microbial groups recognized well to include hg methylators desulfobacterota firmicutes methanomicrobia gilmour et al 2013 podar et al 2015 and in newly discovered groups such as chloroflexota and pvc superphylum mcdaniel et al 2020 gionfriddo et al 2020 capo et al 2022a additionally the study of the abundance of hgcab encoding genes transcripts and hgcab proteins may in theory provide information about the occurrence and importance of hg methylation in the environment first biodiversity studies using the hgc gene pair were based on the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification with primers targeting hgca followed by cloning bae et al 2014 liu et al 2014 schaefer et al 2014 while recent studies used metabarcoding bravo et al 2018a b xu et al 2019 2021 and metagenomic approaches to detect full length hgc genes jones et al 2019 peterson et al 2020 capo et al 2020 hg methylators are known to thrive in oxygen deficient environments e g rice paddies wetlands sediments anoxic waters in which redox conditions play an important role regulating both the activity of hgii methylating microorganisms and the availability of hgii for methylation bravo and cosio 2020 recent works further highlighted the huge diversity of hg methylators in aquatic water columns mostly oxygen deficient and underlying sediments lin et al 2021 azaroff et al 2020 capo et al 2022b although hg methylation to form mehg is a process known to occur in the absence of oxygen the in situ production of mehg was often reported in oxic marine waters monperrus et al 2007 heimbürger et al 2010 lehnherr et al 2011 blum et al 2013 and rarely in oxic lake water columns gascón díez et al 2016 gallorini and loizeau 2021 which raises questions about the compartments where this process might occur the understanding and quantification of the potential mehg formation in oxic environments are crucial since it may significantly contribute to the overall budget of mehg production in the environment gallorini and loizeau 2021 especially considering that oxygenated water bodies represent the vast majority of the total volume of water on earth gnanadesikan et al 2012 such a question is of importance because of the need to understand the source and fate of hg in the environment to predict how current environmental change and subsequent consequences i e deoxygenation jane et al 2021 will impact the formation of mehg in our near future ecosystems for lake geneva the largest freshwater reservoir of western europe gascón díez et al 2016 reported relatively high hg methylation rates constant k m in sinking particles 1 6 6 5 10 2 day 1 compared to nearby sediments 0 1 0 7 10 2 day 1 moreover k m measured in sinking particles of the oxic water column presented similar ranges as those reported from anoxic water bodies such as canadian lakes 0 56 14 8 10 2 day 1 eckley et al 2005 and the baltic sea 1 6 4 8 10 3 day 1 soerensen et al 2018 sinking particles also called settling particles or lacustrine marine snow provide microhabitats with anaerobic niches for microorganisms bianchi et al 2018 and are thus suspected to be suitable habitats for hg methylators gallorini and loizeau 2021 2022 because this process happens in absence of oxygen bravo and cosio 2020 for instance an experiment by ortiz et al 2015 showed the potential of sinking particles to be adequate for hg methylation by detecting significant k m in controlled microcosms another study focusing on polar marine waters highlights the role of sinking particulate matter in hgii methylation lehnherr et al 2011 although most studies focused on marine and not freshwater sinking particles recently metagenomes obtained from sinking particles of the baltic sea dna captured on 3 µm pore size filters were found to exhibit higher abundance of hgc genes in comparison to metagenomes from anoxygenic water columns dna captured on subsequent 0 2 3 µm fractions capo et al 2020 villar et al 2020 found hgca genes in the oxic water of the open ocean suggesting the presence of hg methylators in this environment in freshwater systems while two previous study showed that sinking particles were an important environment prone to mehg formation gascón díez et al 2016 gallorini and loizeau 2022 no evidence on the presence of the hgca gene was reported hampering the understanding of anaerobic biological processes involved in mehg formation in sinking particles from oxic water columns describing the anaerobic microorganisms involved in mehg formation in sinking particles improves current knowledge and understanding on the niches that hg methylators can successfully colonize furthermore determining the concentration of mehg in sinking particles is of major importance to quantify the contribution of this pelagic source of mehg to food web biomagnification rates in order to fill this gap of knowledge the present study aims to unveil the diversity and potentially the abundance of hgc microorganisms inhabiting sinking particles of the oxic water column of lake geneva switzerland france by combining the analyses of different chemical forms of hg and the characterization of organic matter om composition with molecular tools metagenomics and qpcr analyses our study provides scientific evidence of the presence of hg methylators in sinking particles from oxic lake water columns and points out the important role of these environments as a source of mehg for the aquatic food webs 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling and conditioning sinking particles and bottom sediments were collected in lake geneva fig 1 on september 21 october 17 and november 16 2017 at two sites ng2 6 35 0 e 46 30 6 n swiss coordinates m 534 350 150 400 at 137 m water depth and ng3 6 34 46 e 46 29 40 n swiss coordinates 534 050 149 600 at 192 m water depth no sinking particle samples were obtained in november at site ng2 due to a trap system recovery problem surface sediments were collected by scrapping the first oxic millimeters up to 1 cm obtained from a van veen grab sampler sinking particles were collected using a trap system described by gascón díez et al 2016 2018 briefly it was composed of a weight an acoustic release and a particle trap frame composed of six 80 cm long plexiglas tubes of 11 cm internal diameter placed 5 m above the lake bottom actual sampling depth 132 at ng2 and 187 m at ng3 and maintained vertically by two buoys during 26 29 days sinking particles from the six plexiglas tubes were pooled bottom sediment and sinking particles samples were transported to the laboratory in a cool box prior to processing sediments were freeze dried in a christ beta 1 8 k freeze drying unit 54 c 6 pa for at least 48 h dry samples were ground and homogenized with an agate mortar 2 2 sediment grain size distribution and organic matter characterization a laser diffraction analyzer coulter ls 100 beckman coulter usa was used to determine particle grain size distributions in the size range 0 4 900 µm following the procedure described by loizeau et al 1994 on wet samples rock eval analyses were performed at the institute of earth sciences of the university of lausanne switzerland using a rock eval 6 technologies vinci rueil malmaison france during rock eval pyrolysis 160 170 mg of ground and homogenized sample is subject to a pyrolysis step followed by the complete oxidation of the residual sample a flame ionization detector measures the hydrocarbon released during pyrolysis while co2 and co are detected by infrared absorbance during both steps the applied standard cycle consists of pyrolysis starting isothermally at 300 c then the sample is heated to 650 c the oxidation step starts isothermally at 400 c and then heats up to 850 c organic carbon decomposition results in 4 main peaks the s1 peak hydrocarbons released during the isothermal phase the s2 peak hydrocarbons produced between 300 and 650 c the s3 peak co2 from pyrolysis of om up to 400 c and the s4 peak co2 released from residual om below 550 c during the oxidation step mineral carbon decomposition is recorded by the s3 peak pyrolysis co2 released above 400 c and the s5 peak oxidation co2 released above 550 c these peaks are used to determine the amount of total organic carbon toc and the amount of mineral carbon minc in addition the calculated hydrogen index hi s2 toc and oxygen index oi s3 toc are proportional to the h c and o c ratios of the organic matter respectively they are used for om classification in a van krevelen like diagram espitalié et al 1985 1986 the hi and oi signatures allow a rough distinction between algal bacterial types i and ii kerogen and terrestrial plant types iii and iv kerogen om as well as the degree of degradation and oxidation behar et al 2001 the calibration standard used was the ifp 160 000 a toarcian marine sediment collected in the paris basin analytical precision was better than 0 05 wt 1σ for toc 1 5 c 1σ for tmax 10 mg hc g toc 1σ for hi and 10 mg co2 g toc 1σ for oi 2 3 measurements of total mercury and methylmercury concentrations total mercury thg was analyzed using a direct mercury analyzer dma 80 iii mws gmbh switzerland that consists of thermal decomposition amalgamation and atomic absorption spectroscopy all analyses were run in triplicate using 0 1 0 2 g of dried and homogenized samples the detection limit and working range were 0 01 mg kg and 0 03 50 mg kg respectively certified reference material marine sediment srm 2702 0 4474 0 0069 mg kg was measured at the beginning and end of each measurement series deviation of analyses was lower than 5 of the certified value mehg in the solid dried phases sediments and sinking particles was extracted using the hno3 leaching ch2cl2 extraction method described by liu et al 2012 and subsequently analyzed following the us epa method 1630 the extract is purged in a vessel allowing the n2 flow to volatilize ethylated hg species to a tenax trap the trapped hg is thermally released and carried into a gc column with ar as a carrier gas hg species are separated on a gc column and then thermally reduced to elemental mercury finally hg is detected using a brooks rand model iii cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer cv afs manufacturer certified accuracy is 109 and precision 3 samples were run in triplicates and the recovery of extractions and analyses of the certified reference material erm cc580 were on average 90 2 4 molecular analysis dna was extracted in triplicate from freeze dried samples with the power soil rneasy extraction total rna kit and rneasy powersoil elution kit qiagen under sterile conditions according to instructions from the manufacturer dna quantity and quality was addressed on 1 agarose gel by electrophoresis in 0 5 tris edta buffer and by spectrophotometry dna was used for quantitative pcr quantification of genes 16s rrna dsra and mera as described in bravo et al 2016 as well as hgca for desulfobacterota previously deltaproteobacteria with ncbi classification and firmicutes using primers described in christensen et al 2016 appropriate standard curves and no template controls were included in triplicate for each reaction and the target copy number per sample was calculated metagenome sequencing was carried out at the facility of the institute for clinical microbiology ikmb hosted by kiel university germany using nextera dnaflex and novaseq sp 2 150 bp sequencing kit in pair end 150 bp read length mode ion illumina novaseq 6000 2 5 bioinformatics for the 11 obtained metagenomes between 31 6 and 56 8 million reads were obtained the raw data are accessible at ncbi sra accession prjna831615 trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 0 36 was used to quality trim the data with the following parameters illuminaclip nexterape pe fa 2 30 10 leading 5 trailing 5 minlen 36 the metagenome assembly of the dna samples generated using the assembler megahit 1 1 2 li et al 2016 with default settings yielded 10 535 672 contigs this was followed using the software prodigal 2 6 2 hyatt et al 2010 for prokaryotic gene prediction that detected 15 658 347 protein coding genes in the co assembly the dna reads from the 11 metagenomes were mapped against the contigs with bowtie2 and the resulting sam files were converted to bam files using samtools 1 9 li et al 2009 on average 43 763 487 5159 940 dna sequences were mapped onto the assembly the bam files and the prodigal output gff file were used to estimate reads counts by using the featurecounts software liao et al 2014 the overall community composition was evaluated using the software kraken2 2 0 8 wood et al 2019 and bracken 2 5 lu et al 2017 with default settings 2 6 detection and taxonomic identification of hgc genes to detect hgc genes in the metagenomes we firstly looked for hgcab homologs with the function hmmsearch from hmmer software 3 2 1 finn et al 2011 and using the hmm profiles from the recent database hg mate version 01 gionfriddo et al 2021 as a reference database of protein sequences we considered 5174 genes with e values 10 3 as significant hits we used knowledge from the seminal paper of parks et al 2013 that described unique motif from hgca nvwca a g s gk and hgcb genes c m i ec g s a g c we kept information about hgca genes found alone in their contigs or side by side to hgcb genes for distribution plots only read counts from hgca were used we calculated hgca corrected read counts by dividing read counts by gene base pair read bp in order to compare the hgca counts obtained from different samples we extracted the counts of the housekeeping gene rpob from the metagenomes following the strategy recommended in the consensus protocol for the study of hgc genes from metagenomes capo et al 2022c the rpob genes found in the metagenomes were detected using the function hmmsearch from hmmer software 3 2 1 finn et al 2011 we used rpob hmm profiles provided by jcvi http tigrfams jcvi org cgi bin index cgi tigr02013 hmm for bacterial rpob genes verified hits of rpob genes were detected using the trusted cut off we calculated rpob coverage values by dividing the number of read mapped to each rpob genes to their number of base pairs reads bp we normalized each hgca gene coverage values by rpob coverage values and obtained the final dataset table s1 to putatively taxonomically annotate the hgc genes detected in our metagenomes we used the recent database hg mate version 01 gionfriddo et al 2021 that compiled a total of 1020 hgc sequences from publicly available isolate genomes n 204 single cell genomes n 29 and metagenome assembled genomes n 787 to taxonomically identify each hg methylation gene we constructed two phylogenetic trees one for concatenated hgc gene pairs and one for hgca genes fig s1 for each phylogenetic analysis the amino acid sequences were aligned using muscle in the software megax kumar et al 2018 raxml 8 2 10 stamatakis et al 2014 was used to generate maximum likelihood ml tree under the gamma distribution with the lg model with the following parameters raxmlhpc f a p 283976 m protgammaauto n automre x 2381 t 10 branch support was generated by rapid bootstrapping 2 7 statistics homoscedasticity and normality of values and or residuals were verified by bartlett s tests and kolmogorov smirnov s tests in rstudio software 4 0 3 because these criteria were not met wilcoxon mann whitney tests were applied p 0 05 a principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed applying the function wcmdscale to a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix built with the function vegdist from i the hgca gene abundance table ii the species abundance table provided by the bracken analysis a protest permutation procedure analysis 1000 permutations was performed using the function procrustes to evaluate the level of concordance between the distribution of hgc microbial groups and the composition of the prokaryotic community the functions wcmdscale vegdist procrustes belong to the r package vegan oksanen et al 2015 and the functions rcorr and corrplot belong to the r packages hmisc harrell and harrell 2013 and corrplot wei et al 2021 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 higher mehg production in lake sinking particles than sediments mean values of thg and mehg concentrations were similar between sites but different between anoxic sediments and sinking particles from oxic water columns while thg concentrations were significantly higher in sediments than in sinking particles the opposite trend was observed for mehg concentrations showing higher concentrations in sinking particles than in sediments fig 2 wilcoxon rank test p value 0 05 no clear trends were observed between september october and november samplings therefore data are summarized with range and mean concentrations table s2 the results of these field campaigns 2017 agree with observations made at the same sites in 2010 2011 and 2014 by gascón díez et al 2016 2018 similarly at both sites the ratio between mehg and thg mehg thg was significantly higher wilcoxon rank test p value 0 05 in sinking particles 12 to 38 than in sediments 1 to 4 fig 2 and are in good agreement with previously reported hg methylation rate constants gascón díez et al 2016 samples were collected in the northern part of lake geneva fig 1 close to the city of lausanne not far from the bay of vidy where the lausanne s wastewater treatment plant releases its effluent of treated and untreated waters however gascón díez et al 2018 showed that the effluent has no or a negligible influence on sinking particle hg contamination at the ng2 and ng3 sites particle size distribution was very homogenous in all samples with an overall mean grain size of 22 1 μm and a range of the mean sizes of 18 4 26 8 μm table s3 most of the particles are in the silt size range 81 2 with a small contribution of sand size particles 13 5 and clays 5 4 no significant differences were observed between bottom sediment and sinking particles wilcoxon rank test p value 0 05 3 2 contrasted microbial communities in sinking particles and anoxic sediments from lake geneva the overall prokaryotic community from anoxic sediments and sinking particles was dominated by alpha beta gammaproteobacteria and actinobacteria being the most abundant taxa fig 4 we used principal coordinates analysis pcoa to explore and to visualize similarities or dissimilarities of the overall prokaryotic community fig 5 a and the structure of hgc fig 5b across sites but also between niches sediments versus sinking particles while no differences in terms of community composition were observed across sites ng2 and ng3 the community structure of sinking particles and sediments differed fig 5a betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria desulfobacterota in gtdb classification actinobacteria and euryarchaeota were more abundant in bottom sediments compared to sinking particle s metagenomes fig 4 in contrast higher proportions of gammaproteobacteria and cyanobacteria were observed in sinking particles compared to bottom sediments alphaproteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and deinococcus thermus were found with similar proportions in bottom sediment and sinking particle s metagenomes fig 4 previous studies also reported higher seasonal variability in the composition of bacterial communities from pelagic ecosystems allgaier et al 2006 lima et al 2016 than sediments tšertova et al 2011 2013 these differences were explained by the occurrence of episodic disturbances having a larger impact in open water column than in sediments such as rainfall andersson et al 2014 environmental impacts rösel et al 2012 storms and strong winds jones et al 2008 solar radiation pérez et al 2007 and anthropogenic impacts zhang et al 2020 similarly to the overall prokaryotic community the structure of hgc community differed between sediments and sinking particles fig 5b in other words although the hgc community was quite similar between sites ng2 and ng3 and sampling times september october and november a larger variability was observed in terms of structure in sinking particles compared to sediments suggesting the occurrence of several microenvironments in the former accordingly the procrustean analysis providing a descriptive summary and graphical comparison of the ordination of the communities prokaryotic fig 5a and the distribution of hgca fig 5b showed a significant level of concordance r 0 96 pval 0 001 between the composition of the prokaryotic community and the distribution of hgca microorganisms fig 5c confirming that both communities are similar in sediments and sinking particles across sites and sampling times but different between sinking particles and sediments previous studies have shown that the molecular composition of organic matter had impact in the composition of hgc community bravo et al 2018a and in the overall prokaryotic community pérez and sommaruga 2006 accordingly the differences found in the hi and oi indexes used as proxies for om characteristics could in part explain the differences in community compositions between sinking particles and sediments 3 3 unveiling the diversity of hg methylators in sinking particles of oxic water and anoxic sediments in metagenomes obtained from sinking particles and anoxic sediments of lake geneva a total of 59 hgca genes were found including 9 paired with hgcb genes i e side by side on the same contig table s1 among them 27 were identified as desulfobacterota particularly geobacterales 9 hgc genes desulfatiglandales 3 hgc genes desulfobulbales 1 desulfobulbus and desulfuromonadales 1 desulfuromonas other microbial lineages identified included firmicutes 6 genes nitrospirae 3 genes bacteroidetes 4 genes chloroflexota 4 genes and members of the pvc superphylum 4 genes in terms of composition while sinking particle s metagenomes exhibited higher proportion of hgc firmicutes fig 4 hgc members of desulfobacterota nitrospirae chloroflexota and pvc superphylum were prevalent in sediment metagenomes compared to a previous study describing the diversity of putative hg methylators in the nearby vidy bay sediments bravo et al 2018b the use of the hgc gene catalog hg mate capo et al 2022c gionfriddo et al 2021 allowed to achieve a refined identification of hg methylators of anoxic sediments and sinking particles from lake geneva for instance this study allowed a better identification of hgc desulfobacterota which were up to 60 of the unidentified hg methylators in bravo et al 2018b we also detected the presence of hgc members of the pvc superphylum a microbial group for which the microbial ecology is still scarcely revealed and that was recently identified as potential important hg methylators peterson et al 2020 capo et al 2020 our results are in good agreement with the three lake metagenomes analyzed by podar et al 2015 highlighting the dominance of hgca genes from desulfobacterota geopsychrobacter syntrophobacter geobacter in anoxic bottom waters and a higher diversity in hgc desulfobacterota firmicutes and methanogenic archaea in sediments also previous studies have highlighted the importance of methanogenic archaea and iron reducing bacteria from the geobacteraceae family in hg methylation in boreal lakes bravo et al 2018b additionally two recent studies based on the analysis of metagenomes from sulfate enriched lakes revealed the presence of other hgc microbial lineages including kiritimatiellaeota from pvc superphylum spirochaetes or aminicenantes jones et al 2019 peterson et al 2020 the contrasted diversity between water column and sediments was also recently observed in a brackish ecosystem the baltic sea in which hgc spirochaetes were predominant in sinking particles capo et al 2020 but not in anoxic sediments capo et al 2022a while certain hgc desulfobacterota were abundant in both environments previous studies suggested the presence of potential anaerobic hg methylators in sinking particles of oxic lake water column gascón díez et al 2016 this study provides evidence of the presence of those microorganisms in such environments and reveal the differences between sediments and sinking particles in terms of hg methylators composition our results not only confirm the role of desulfobacterota in sediments but also unveil the diversity of hg methylators in sinking particles highlighting an important contribution of hgc firmicutes to the hg methylating microbial community of lake geneva 3 4 high mehg concentrations in sinking particles from oxic water columns one key challenge related to the research about hg cycling in the environment is the prediction of mehg formation in the environment the measurement of hg methylation rates conducted in the laboratory by spiking isotopic hg into environmental samples was used for decades to inform about the potential formation of mehg in environmental conditions regnell et al 2019 relationships between the abundance of specific genes and corresponding rates are still rarely demonstrated in natural systems rocca et al 2015 particularly in the context of hg methylation bravo and cosio 2020 here we expanded previously obtained geochemical data obtained by gascón díez et al 2016 2018 by applying molecular methods in the present study positive and significant correlations were observed between mehg concentrations and the metagenomics hgca estimates taxonomically assigned to firmicutes r 0 67 p 0 02 fig s2 in line with their long known role in hg methylation bravo and cosio 2020 in contrast negative relationships were found between metagenomics hgca estimates from desulfobacterota and mehg concentrations r 0 77 p 0 01 although reduced hg methylation rate was observed when srb are inhibited by molybdate gascón díez et al 2016 linking mehg concentrations with hgca genes abundance is not the aim of this study however our data suggest that obtaining hgca transcript data aside hg chemistry data could help to identify factors controlling their expression and inform on condition causing subsequent mehg formation in the environment as recently demonstrated in the baltic sea capo et al 2022b it is well recognized that the abundance of hgc genes transcripts or proteins in the environment is not the only factor controlling the mehg formation indeed the bioavailability of hg is tightly regulated by environmental factors such as the composition of the organic matter chiasson gould et al 2014 and the presence of sulfur compounds such as thiols schaefer and morel 2009 adediran et al 2019 in our case gascón díez et al 2016 reported that mehg concentrations observed in anoxic sediments and sinking particles from oxic water columns of lake geneva were mostly explained by hg methylation km rates compared to mehg demethylations kd rates in this study we also compared qpcr copy number µg dna and metagenomic estimates i e normalized length corrected read numbers for hgca genes from two microbial groups desulfobacterota and firmicutes table 1 this concordance between qpcr and metagenomics estimates was confirmed by significant positive spearman rank s correlations for both desulfobacterota r 0 80 pval 0 01 and firmicutes r 0 85 pval 0 01 fig s2 supporting that metagenome efficiently identified those bacterial groups both qpcr and metagenomics based approaches could be useful to estimate the amounts of hgc genes present in the environment although both provided in theory inherently biased estimates due to methods our results suggest the presence of several sulfate reducers not involved in hg methylation as the dsra gene involved in sulfate reduction wagner et al 1998 and hgca counts qpcr and metagenomics estimates from desulfobacterota were not correlated although many hgc microorganisms have been described as sulfate reducers gilmour et al 2013 podar et al 2015 fig s2 a small proportion of sulfate reducing bacteria isolates are confirmed carrier of hgc and few are experimentally confirmed hg methylators yu and barkay 2022 in this context our results either indicate the presence of sulfate reducers in both sinking particles and sediment lacking the biological hg methylation capacity i e not devoid of hgca genes or might suggest that hgc desulfobacterota do not have the metabolic capacity for sulfate reduction our results support for the first time the hypothesis that firmicutes may be key hg methylators in the oxic water column of lake geneva while being not detected in the oxic water columns of marine systems20 37 and still understudied in lakes hi index indicated that om in sediments was more degraded than in sinking particles the positive correlation between the abundance of hgc firmicutes fig s2 and the hi could indicate that those microorganisms might be favored by the freshness of om 4 conclusions the formation of mehg in the environment is of high importance because this neurotoxic compound can cause severe threats to the ecosystems and human health there are still uncertainties about which environmental conditions trigger this microbially mediated process as well as the diversity and ecology of microorganisms involved in hg methylation in aquatic environments the results of this study highlight the presence of hgc microorganisms in sinking particles of the oxic water column of lake geneva and point the firmicutes as potential key hg methylators in micro anaerobic niches from sinking particles the role of anaerobic microorganisms in oxic ecosystems has been for a long time overlooked this study shows their presence and potential key role in the largest freshwater reservoir of western europe with potential effect on global hg biogeochemical cycle credit authorship contribution

and in newly discovered groups such as chloroflexota and pvc superphylum mcdaniel et al 2020 gionfriddo et al 2020 capo et al 2022a additionally the study of the abundance of hgcab encoding genes transcripts and hgcab proteins may in theory provide information about the occurrence and importance of hg methylation in the environment first biodiversity studies using the hgc gene pair were based on the polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification with primers targeting hgca followed by cloning bae et al 2014 liu et al 2014 schaefer et al 2014 while recent studies used metabarcoding bravo et al 2018a b xu et al 2019 2021 and metagenomic approaches to detect full length hgc genes jones et al 2019 peterson et al 2020 capo et al 2020 hg methylators are known to thrive in oxygen deficient environments e g rice paddies wetlands sediments anoxic waters in which redox conditions play an important role regulating both the activity of hgii methylating microorganisms and the availability of hgii for methylation bravo and cosio 2020 recent works further highlighted the huge diversity of hg methylators in aquatic water columns mostly oxygen deficient and underlying sediments lin et al 2021 azaroff et al 2020 capo et al 2022b although hg methylation to form mehg is a process known to occur in the absence of oxygen the in situ production of mehg was often reported in oxic marine waters monperrus et al 2007 heimbürger et al 2010 lehnherr et al 2011 blum et al 2013 and rarely in oxic lake water columns gascón díez et al 2016 gallorini and loizeau 2021 which raises questions about the compartments where this process might occur the understanding and quantification of the potential mehg formation in oxic environments are crucial since it may significantly contribute to the overall budget of mehg production in the environment gallorini and loizeau 2021 especially considering that oxygenated water bodies represent the vast majority of the total volume of water on earth gnanadesikan et al 2012 such a question is of importance because of the need to understand the source and fate of hg in the environment to predict how current environmental change and subsequent consequences i e deoxygenation jane et al 2021 will impact the formation of mehg in our near future ecosystems for lake geneva the largest freshwater reservoir of western europe gascón díez et al 2016 reported relatively high hg methylation rates constant k m in sinking particles 1 6 6 5 10 2 day 1 compared to nearby sediments 0 1 0 7 10 2 day 1 moreover k m measured in sinking particles of the oxic water column presented similar ranges as those reported from anoxic water bodies such as canadian lakes 0 56 14 8 10 2 day 1 eckley et al 2005 and the baltic sea 1 6 4 8 10 3 day 1 soerensen et al 2018 sinking particles also called settling particles or lacustrine marine snow provide microhabitats with anaerobic niches for microorganisms bianchi et al 2018 and are thus suspected to be suitable habitats for hg methylators gallorini and loizeau 2021 2022 because this process happens in absence of oxygen bravo and cosio 2020 for instance an experiment by ortiz et al 2015 showed the potential of sinking particles to be adequate for hg methylation by detecting significant k m in controlled microcosms another study focusing on polar marine waters highlights the role of sinking particulate matter in hgii methylation lehnherr et al 2011 although most studies focused on marine and not freshwater sinking particles recently metagenomes obtained from sinking particles of the baltic sea dna captured on 3 µm pore size filters were found to exhibit higher abundance of hgc genes in comparison to metagenomes from anoxygenic water columns dna captured on subsequent 0 2 3 µm fractions capo et al 2020 villar et al 2020 found hgca genes in the oxic water of the open ocean suggesting the presence of hg methylators in this environment in freshwater systems while two previous study showed that sinking particles were an important environment prone to mehg formation gascón díez et al 2016 gallorini and loizeau 2022 no evidence on the presence of the hgca gene was reported hampering the understanding of anaerobic biological processes involved in mehg formation in sinking particles from oxic water columns describing the anaerobic microorganisms involved in mehg formation in sinking particles improves current knowledge and understanding on the niches that hg methylators can successfully colonize furthermore determining the concentration of mehg in sinking particles is of major importance to quantify the contribution of this pelagic source of mehg to food web biomagnification rates in order to fill this gap of knowledge the present study aims to unveil the diversity and potentially the abundance of hgc microorganisms inhabiting sinking particles of the oxic water column of lake geneva switzerland france by combining the analyses of different chemical forms of hg and the characterization of organic matter om composition with molecular tools metagenomics and qpcr analyses our study provides scientific evidence of the presence of hg methylators in sinking particles from oxic lake water columns and points out the important role of these environments as a source of mehg for the aquatic food webs 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling and conditioning sinking particles and bottom sediments were collected in lake geneva fig 1 on september 21 october 17 and november 16 2017 at two sites ng2 6 35 0 e 46 30 6 n swiss coordinates m 534 350 150 400 at 137 m water depth and ng3 6 34 46 e 46 29 40 n swiss coordinates 534 050 149 600 at 192 m water depth no sinking particle samples were obtained in november at site ng2 due to a trap system recovery problem surface sediments were collected by scrapping the first oxic millimeters up to 1 cm obtained from a van veen grab sampler sinking particles were collected using a trap system described by gascón díez et al 2016 2018 briefly it was composed of a weight an acoustic release and a particle trap frame composed of six 80 cm long plexiglas tubes of 11 cm internal diameter placed 5 m above the lake bottom actual sampling depth 132 at ng2 and 187 m at ng3 and maintained vertically by two buoys during 26 29 days sinking particles from the six plexiglas tubes were pooled bottom sediment and sinking particles samples were transported to the laboratory in a cool box prior to processing sediments were freeze dried in a christ beta 1 8 k freeze drying unit 54 c 6 pa for at least 48 h dry samples were ground and homogenized with an agate mortar 2 2 sediment grain size distribution and organic matter characterization a laser diffraction analyzer coulter ls 100 beckman coulter usa was used to determine particle grain size distributions in the size range 0 4 900 µm following the procedure described by loizeau et al 1994 on wet samples rock eval analyses were performed at the institute of earth sciences of the university of lausanne switzerland using a rock eval 6 technologies vinci rueil malmaison france during rock eval pyrolysis 160 170 mg of ground and homogenized sample is subject to a pyrolysis step followed by the complete oxidation of the residual sample a flame ionization detector measures the hydrocarbon released during pyrolysis while co2 and co are detected by infrared absorbance during both steps the applied standard cycle consists of pyrolysis starting isothermally at 300 c then the sample is heated to 650 c the oxidation step starts isothermally at 400 c and then heats up to 850 c organic carbon decomposition results in 4 main peaks the s1 peak hydrocarbons released during the isothermal phase the s2 peak hydrocarbons produced between 300 and 650 c the s3 peak co2 from pyrolysis of om up to 400 c and the s4 peak co2 released from residual om below 550 c during the oxidation step mineral carbon decomposition is recorded by the s3 peak pyrolysis co2 released above 400 c and the s5 peak oxidation co2 released above 550 c these peaks are used to determine the amount of total organic carbon toc and the amount of mineral carbon minc in addition the calculated hydrogen index hi s2 toc and oxygen index oi s3 toc are proportional to the h c and o c ratios of the organic matter respectively they are used for om classification in a van krevelen like diagram espitalié et al 1985 1986 the hi and oi signatures allow a rough distinction between algal bacterial types i and ii kerogen and terrestrial plant types iii and iv kerogen om as well as the degree of degradation and oxidation behar et al 2001 the calibration standard used was the ifp 160 000 a toarcian marine sediment collected in the paris basin analytical precision was better than 0 05 wt 1σ for toc 1 5 c 1σ for tmax 10 mg hc g toc 1σ for hi and 10 mg co2 g toc 1σ for oi 2 3 measurements of total mercury and methylmercury concentrations total mercury thg was analyzed using a direct mercury analyzer dma 80 iii mws gmbh switzerland that consists of thermal decomposition amalgamation and atomic absorption spectroscopy all analyses were run in triplicate using 0 1 0 2 g of dried and homogenized samples the detection limit and working range were 0 01 mg kg and 0 03 50 mg kg respectively certified reference material marine sediment srm 2702 0 4474 0 0069 mg kg was measured at the beginning and end of each measurement series deviation of analyses was lower than 5 of the certified value mehg in the solid dried phases sediments and sinking particles was extracted using the hno3 leaching ch2cl2 extraction method described by liu et al 2012 and subsequently analyzed following the us epa method 1630 the extract is purged in a vessel allowing the n2 flow to volatilize ethylated hg species to a tenax trap the trapped hg is thermally released and carried into a gc column with ar as a carrier gas hg species are separated on a gc column and then thermally reduced to elemental mercury finally hg is detected using a brooks rand model iii cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer cv afs manufacturer certified accuracy is 109 and precision 3 samples were run in triplicates and the recovery of extractions and analyses of the certified reference material erm cc580 were on average 90 2 4 molecular analysis dna was extracted in triplicate from freeze dried samples with the power soil rneasy extraction total rna kit and rneasy powersoil elution kit qiagen under sterile conditions according to instructions from the manufacturer dna quantity and quality was addressed on 1 agarose gel by electrophoresis in 0 5 tris edta buffer and by spectrophotometry dna was used for quantitative pcr quantification of genes 16s rrna dsra and mera as described in bravo et al 2016 as well as hgca for desulfobacterota previously deltaproteobacteria with ncbi classification and firmicutes using primers described in christensen et al 2016 appropriate standard curves and no template controls were included in triplicate for each reaction and the target copy number per sample was calculated metagenome sequencing was carried out at the facility of the institute for clinical microbiology ikmb hosted by kiel university germany using nextera dnaflex and novaseq sp 2 150 bp sequencing kit in pair end 150 bp read length mode ion illumina novaseq 6000 2 5 bioinformatics for the 11 obtained metagenomes between 31 6 and 56 8 million reads were obtained the raw data are accessible at ncbi sra accession prjna831615 trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 0 36 was used to quality trim the data with the following parameters illuminaclip nexterape pe fa 2 30 10 leading 5 trailing 5 minlen 36 the metagenome assembly of the dna samples generated using the assembler megahit 1 1 2 li et al 2016 with default settings yielded 10 535 672 contigs this was followed using the software prodigal 2 6 2 hyatt et al 2010 for prokaryotic gene prediction that detected 15 658 347 protein coding genes in the co assembly the dna reads from the 11 metagenomes were mapped against the contigs with bowtie2 and the resulting sam files were converted to bam files using samtools 1 9 li et al 2009 on average 43 763 487 5159 940 dna sequences were mapped onto the assembly the bam files and the prodigal output gff file were used to estimate reads counts by using the featurecounts software liao et al 2014 the overall community composition was evaluated using the software kraken2 2 0 8 wood et al 2019 and bracken 2 5 lu et al 2017 with default settings 2 6 detection and taxonomic identification of hgc genes to detect hgc genes in the metagenomes we firstly looked for hgcab homologs with the function hmmsearch from hmmer software 3 2 1 finn et al 2011 and using the hmm profiles from the recent database hg mate version 01 gionfriddo et al 2021 as a reference database of protein sequences we considered 5174 genes with e values 10 3 as significant hits we used knowledge from the seminal paper of parks et al 2013 that described unique motif from hgca nvwca a g s gk and hgcb genes c m i ec g s a g c we kept information about hgca genes found alone in their contigs or side by side to hgcb genes for distribution plots only read counts from hgca were used we calculated hgca corrected read counts by dividing read counts by gene base pair read bp in order to compare the hgca counts obtained from different samples we extracted the counts of the housekeeping gene rpob from the metagenomes following the strategy recommended in the consensus protocol for the study of hgc genes from metagenomes capo et al 2022c the rpob genes found in the metagenomes were detected using the function hmmsearch from hmmer software 3 2 1 finn et al 2011 we used rpob hmm profiles provided by jcvi http tigrfams jcvi org cgi bin index cgi tigr02013 hmm for bacterial rpob genes verified hits of rpob genes were detected using the trusted cut off we calculated rpob coverage values by dividing the number of read mapped to each rpob genes to their number of base pairs reads bp we normalized each hgca gene coverage values by rpob coverage values and obtained the final dataset table s1 to putatively taxonomically annotate the hgc genes detected in our metagenomes we used the recent database hg mate version 01 gionfriddo et al 2021 that compiled a total of 1020 hgc sequences from publicly available isolate genomes n 204 single cell genomes n 29 and metagenome assembled genomes n 787 to taxonomically identify each hg methylation gene we constructed two phylogenetic trees one for concatenated hgc gene pairs and one for hgca genes fig s1 for each phylogenetic analysis the amino acid sequences were aligned using muscle in the software megax kumar et al 2018 raxml 8 2 10 stamatakis et al 2014 was used to generate maximum likelihood ml tree under the gamma distribution with the lg model with the following parameters raxmlhpc f a p 283976 m protgammaauto n automre x 2381 t 10 branch support was generated by rapid bootstrapping 2 7 statistics homoscedasticity and normality of values and or residuals were verified by bartlett s tests and kolmogorov smirnov s tests in rstudio software 4 0 3 because these criteria were not met wilcoxon mann whitney tests were applied p 0 05 a principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed applying the function wcmdscale to a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix built with the function vegdist from i the hgca gene abundance table ii the species abundance table provided by the bracken analysis a protest permutation procedure analysis 1000 permutations was performed using the function procrustes to evaluate the level of concordance between the distribution of hgc microbial groups and the composition of the prokaryotic community the functions wcmdscale vegdist procrustes belong to the r package vegan oksanen et al 2015 and the functions rcorr and corrplot belong to the r packages hmisc harrell and harrell 2013 and corrplot wei et al 2021 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 higher mehg production in lake sinking particles than sediments mean values of thg and mehg concentrations were similar between sites but different between anoxic sediments and sinking particles from oxic water columns while thg concentrations were significantly higher in sediments than in sinking particles the opposite trend was observed for mehg concentrations showing higher concentrations in sinking particles than in sediments fig 2 wilcoxon rank test p value 0 05 no clear trends were observed between september october and november samplings therefore data are summarized with range and mean concentrations table s2 the results of these field campaigns 2017 agree with observations made at the same sites in 2010 2011 and 2014 by gascón díez et al 2016 2018 similarly at both sites the ratio between mehg and thg mehg thg was significantly higher wilcoxon rank test p value 0 05 in sinking particles 12 to 38 than in sediments 1 to 4 fig 2 and are in good agreement with previously reported hg methylation rate constants gascón díez et al 2016 samples were collected in the northern part of lake geneva fig 1 close to the city of lausanne not far from the bay of vidy where the lausanne s wastewater treatment plant releases its effluent of treated and untreated waters however gascón díez et al 2018 showed that the effluent has no or a negligible influence on sinking particle hg contamination at the ng2 and ng3 sites particle size distribution was very homogenous in all samples with an overall mean grain size of 22 1 μm and a range of the mean sizes of 18 4 26 8 μm table s3 most of the particles are in the silt size range 81 2 with a small contribution of sand size particles 13 5 and clays 5 4 no significant differences were observed between bottom sediment and sinking particles wilcoxon rank test p value 0 05 3 2 contrasted microbial communities in sinking particles and anoxic sediments from lake geneva the overall prokaryotic community from anoxic sediments and sinking particles was dominated by alpha beta gammaproteobacteria and actinobacteria being the most abundant taxa fig 4 we used principal coordinates analysis pcoa to explore and to visualize similarities or dissimilarities of the overall prokaryotic community fig 5 a and the structure of hgc fig 5b across sites but also between niches sediments versus sinking particles while no differences in terms of community composition were observed across sites ng2 and ng3 the community structure of sinking particles and sediments differed fig 5a betaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria desulfobacterota in gtdb classification actinobacteria and euryarchaeota were more abundant in bottom sediments compared to sinking particle s metagenomes fig 4 in contrast higher proportions of gammaproteobacteria and cyanobacteria were observed in sinking particles compared to bottom sediments alphaproteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and deinococcus thermus were found with similar proportions in bottom sediment and sinking particle s metagenomes fig 4 previous studies also reported higher seasonal variability in the composition of bacterial communities from pelagic ecosystems allgaier et al 2006 lima et al 2016 than sediments tšertova et al 2011 2013 these differences were explained by the occurrence of episodic disturbances having a larger impact in open water column than in sediments such as rainfall andersson et al 2014 environmental impacts rösel et al 2012 storms and strong winds jones et al 2008 solar radiation pérez et al 2007 and anthropogenic impacts zhang et al 2020 similarly to the overall prokaryotic community the structure of hgc community differed between sediments and sinking particles fig 5b in other words although the hgc community was quite similar between sites ng2 and ng3 and sampling times september october and november a larger variability was observed in terms of structure in sinking particles compared to sediments suggesting the occurrence of several microenvironments in the former accordingly the procrustean analysis providing a descriptive summary and graphical comparison of the ordination of the communities prokaryotic fig 5a and the distribution of hgca fig 5b showed a significant level of concordance r 0 96 pval 0 001 between the composition of the prokaryotic community and the distribution of hgca microorganisms fig 5c confirming that both communities are similar in sediments and sinking particles across sites and sampling times but different between sinking particles and sediments previous studies have shown that the molecular composition of organic matter had impact in the composition of hgc community bravo et al 2018a and in the overall prokaryotic community pérez and sommaruga 2006 accordingly the differences found in the hi and oi indexes used as proxies for om characteristics could in part explain the differences in community compositions between sinking particles and sediments 3 3 unveiling the diversity of hg methylators in sinking particles of oxic water and anoxic sediments in metagenomes obtained from sinking particles and anoxic sediments of lake geneva a total of 59 hgca genes were found including 9 paired with hgcb genes i e side by side on the same contig table s1 among them 27 were identified as desulfobacterota particularly geobacterales 9 hgc genes desulfatiglandales 3 hgc genes desulfobulbales 1 desulfobulbus and desulfuromonadales 1 desulfuromonas other microbial lineages identified included firmicutes 6 genes nitrospirae 3 genes bacteroidetes 4 genes chloroflexota 4 genes and members of the pvc superphylum 4 genes in terms of composition while sinking particle s metagenomes exhibited higher proportion of hgc firmicutes fig 4 hgc members of desulfobacterota nitrospirae chloroflexota and pvc superphylum were prevalent in sediment metagenomes compared to a previous study describing the diversity of putative hg methylators in the nearby vidy bay sediments bravo et al 2018b the use of the hgc gene catalog hg mate capo et al 2022c gionfriddo et al 2021 allowed to achieve a refined identification of hg methylators of anoxic sediments and sinking particles from lake geneva for instance this study allowed a better identification of hgc desulfobacterota which were up to 60 of the unidentified hg methylators in bravo et al 2018b we also detected the presence of hgc members of the pvc superphylum a microbial group for which the microbial ecology is still scarcely revealed and that was recently identified as potential important hg methylators peterson et al 2020 capo et al 2020 our results are in good agreement with the three lake metagenomes analyzed by podar et al 2015 highlighting the dominance of hgca genes from desulfobacterota geopsychrobacter syntrophobacter geobacter in anoxic bottom waters and a higher diversity in hgc desulfobacterota firmicutes and methanogenic archaea in sediments also previous studies have highlighted the importance of methanogenic archaea and iron reducing bacteria from the geobacteraceae family in hg methylation in boreal lakes bravo et al 2018b additionally two recent studies based on the analysis of metagenomes from sulfate enriched lakes revealed the presence of other hgc microbial lineages including kiritimatiellaeota from pvc superphylum spirochaetes or aminicenantes jones et al 2019 peterson et al 2020 the contrasted diversity between water column and sediments was also recently observed in a brackish ecosystem the baltic sea in which hgc spirochaetes were predominant in sinking particles capo et al 2020 but not in anoxic sediments capo et al 2022a while certain hgc desulfobacterota were abundant in both environments previous studies suggested the presence of potential anaerobic hg methylators in sinking particles of oxic lake water column gascón díez et al 2016 this study provides evidence of the presence of those microorganisms in such environments and reveal the differences between sediments and sinking particles in terms of hg methylators composition our results not only confirm the role of desulfobacterota in sediments but also unveil the diversity of hg methylators in sinking particles highlighting an important contribution of hgc firmicutes to the hg methylating microbial community of lake geneva 3 4 high mehg concentrations in sinking particles from oxic water columns one key challenge related to the research about hg cycling in the environment is the prediction of mehg formation in the environment the measurement of hg methylation rates conducted in the laboratory by spiking isotopic hg into environmental samples was used for decades to inform about the potential formation of mehg in environmental conditions regnell et al 2019 relationships between the abundance of specific genes and corresponding rates are still rarely demonstrated in natural systems rocca et al 2015 particularly in the context of hg methylation bravo and cosio 2020 here we expanded previously obtained geochemical data obtained by gascón díez et al 2016 2018 by applying molecular methods in the present study positive and significant correlations were observed between mehg concentrations and the metagenomics hgca estimates taxonomically assigned to firmicutes r 0 67 p 0 02 fig s2 in line with their long known role in hg methylation bravo and cosio 2020 in contrast negative relationships were found between metagenomics hgca estimates from desulfobacterota and mehg concentrations r 0 77 p 0 01 although reduced hg methylation rate was observed when srb are inhibited by molybdate gascón díez et al 2016 linking mehg concentrations with hgca genes abundance is not the aim of this study however our data suggest that obtaining hgca transcript data aside hg chemistry data could help to identify factors controlling their expression and inform on condition causing subsequent mehg formation in the environment as recently demonstrated in the baltic sea capo et al 2022b it is well recognized that the abundance of hgc genes transcripts or proteins in the environment is not the only factor controlling the mehg formation indeed the bioavailability of hg is tightly regulated by environmental factors such as the composition of the organic matter chiasson gould et al 2014 and the presence of sulfur compounds such as thiols schaefer and morel 2009 adediran et al 2019 in our case gascón díez et al 2016 reported that mehg concentrations observed in anoxic sediments and sinking particles from oxic water columns of lake geneva were mostly explained by hg methylation km rates compared to mehg demethylations kd rates in this study we also compared qpcr copy number µg dna and metagenomic estimates i e normalized length corrected read numbers for hgca genes from two microbial groups desulfobacterota and firmicutes table 1 this concordance between qpcr and metagenomics estimates was confirmed by significant positive spearman rank s correlations for both desulfobacterota r 0 80 pval 0 01 and firmicutes r 0 85 pval 0 01 fig s2 supporting that metagenome efficiently identified those bacterial groups both qpcr and metagenomics based approaches could be useful to estimate the amounts of hgc genes present in the environment although both provided in theory inherently biased estimates due to methods our results suggest the presence of several sulfate reducers not involved in hg methylation as the dsra gene involved in sulfate reduction wagner et al 1998 and hgca counts qpcr and metagenomics estimates from desulfobacterota were not correlated although many hgc microorganisms have been described as sulfate reducers gilmour et al 2013 podar et al 2015 fig s2 a small proportion of sulfate reducing bacteria isolates are confirmed carrier of hgc and few are experimentally confirmed hg methylators yu and barkay 2022 in this context our results either indicate the presence of sulfate reducers in both sinking particles and sediment lacking the biological hg methylation capacity i e not devoid of hgca genes or might suggest that hgc desulfobacterota do not have the metabolic capacity for sulfate reduction our results support for the first time the hypothesis that firmicutes may be key hg methylators in the oxic water column of lake geneva while being not detected in the oxic water columns of marine systems20 37 and still understudied in lakes hi index indicated that om in sediments was more degraded than in sinking particles the positive correlation between the abundance of hgc firmicutes fig s2 and the hi could indicate that those microorganisms might be favored by the freshness of om 4 conclusions the formation of mehg in the environment is of high importance because this neurotoxic compound can cause severe threats to the ecosystems and human health there are still uncertainties about which environmental conditions trigger this microbially mediated process as well as the diversity and ecology of microorganisms involved in hg methylation in aquatic environments the results of this study highlight the presence of hgc microorganisms in sinking particles of the oxic water column of lake geneva and point the firmicutes as potential key hg methylators in micro anaerobic niches from sinking particles the role of anaerobic microorganisms in oxic ecosystems has been for a long time overlooked this study shows their presence and potential key role in the largest freshwater reservoir of western europe with potential effect on global hg biogeochemical cycle credit authorship contribution

15191,snow owns stronger adsorption capacity for organic pollutants compared with rain huge amounts of anthropogenic dissolved organic matters doms in the atmosphere may enter the water environment with urban snow and increase water pollution risk extracting stable pollution features of urban snow is conducive to identifying the urban snow pollution from the water environment herein we systematically explored the spectroscopic and compositional profiles of urban snow in beijing from three snow events by multiple analytical tools and extracted stable pollution features of urban snow for the first time results showed that conventional pollutants with high concentration were detected in urban snow the fluorescence signals of humic like and some protein like materials the molecular weight distributions of chromophoric dom at 254 nm and humic like materials and 172 kinds of lignin like molecular formulas were extracted as stable features for urban snow these stable features of urban snow laid the foundation for the identification of urban snow pollution and the analysis of the impact mechanisms of atmospheric pollution sources on the water environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords snow dissolved organic matter pollution features pollution source identification data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction precipitation is an important wet deposition pathway to realize matter exchange and circulation between the atmosphere and the hydrosphere gao et al 2021 during precipitation process dissolved organic matters doms in carbonaceous aerosol will depart from the atmosphere and input into the hydrosphere in dom pool dissolved organic carbon doc is the main carbon source and contributes to about 50 of the total dom vitale and guardo 2019 safieddine and heald 2017 assessed that the average total doc wet deposition flux of ocean and inland was 85 and 188 tg yr with concentration value of 0 1 1 and 1 10 mg l respectively therefore doc plays a pivotal role in the atmosphere hydrosphere carbon cycle massicotte et al 2017 niu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in carbonaceous aerosol doc is derived from natural e g volcano eruption or anthropogenic e g fossil fuel combustion sources legrand et al 2013 with rapid development of industrialization and modernization the proportion of anthropogenic activities derived doc progressively increased in total doc wet deposition flux from global perspective the wet deposition flux of doc which originated from combustion of fossil fuels was estimated to be 36 tg yr yan and kim 2012 obviously precipitation with high doc concentration may pose potential threat to the water environment in some regions with prosperous anthropogenic activities therefore sometimes precipitation can be regarded as a kind of pollution source in moderate and high latitude regions the pollution risk of precipitation for the water environment in winter is higher than that in other seasons because the form of precipitation in winter is snow instead of rain snow owns strong capacity for adsorbing organic particulate matters pms which is an efficient scavenger of organic contaminants lei and wania 2004 in addition the combustion amount of fossil fuels will significantly increase in winter simultaneously resulting the increase of various organic pollutants concentrations in the air hence snow may remove more organic pollutants from the atmosphere into the water environment compared with rain precise source governance is the core of water pollution control shen et al 2020 2021a and pollution source identification is one of the important strategies for pollution source governance the key to identify pollution sources from the water environment is to master their features a pollution source has many features some of which are easy to change with anthropogenic activities analytical instruments and environmental factors while some of which are not easy to change showing good stability the stable features are more likely to be the potential indicators to accurately track pollution sources from the water environment compared with unstable features for example compared with facial features the police prefer to use fingerprint or dna information to identify suspect since these features are stable and difficult to change thus the extraction of stable features for pollution sources is the premise to ensure the realization of pollution source identification in recent years many literatures reported various characteristics of snow including doms antony et al 2014 2018 fellman et al 2015 hu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 2020b niu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 feng et al 2020 gao et al 2020 2021 elements mann et al 2015 calace et al 2017 thapa et al 2020 and microbial communities riedel et al 2008 qiu et al 2016 smith et al 2018 however the aims of these studies were to explicate transport and transformation mechanisms of doms including element in snow and their impacts on ecosystem functions not to generalize the stable features of snow besides the snow samples of these studies were commonly collected from the areas with sparse anthropogenic activities such as antarctica antony et al 2014 2018 calace et al 2017 arctic ocean riedel et al 2008 mann et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b tibetan plateau hu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 feng et al 2020 gao et al 2021 and other mountains and polar regions fellman et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 gao et al 2020 thapa et al 2020 which could not give valuable information on pollution source identification for the water environment in the region with large population beijing is a typical densely populated region located north of the tropic of cancer which is suitable to be selected as the study area to explore the pollution features of urban snow in previous studies yuan et al 2018 characterized the concentrations of several specific pollutants heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in snowpack and snowmelt surface runoff from different functional areas in beijing aiming to evaluate their ecological risk to the water environment rather than identify their pollution characteristics wang et al 2016 investigated the spectroscopic features of snow from beijing in 2015 the sampling period of this study was relatively short so that they could not conclude the stable features of snow in beijing evidently it was of great necessity to perform a study with long sampling period so far there was no relevant report focused on that pm is one of the major pollutants in the air of beijing the main component of which is organic matter om li et al 2021 the atmospheric pm emission potential begins to increase in autumn and remains at a relatively high level in winter which means that the beijing snow may contain rich oms thus we chose dom as a grasp and utilized various techniques about dom characterization to depict the pollution features of urban snow in beijing ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrum and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem are useful tools for describing the spectroscopic features of chromophoric dom cdom li and hur 2017 and fluorescent dom fdom carstea et al 2016 respectively eem and uv vis techniques are favored in the filed of pollution source identification because of their fast testing speed simple operation and mature analytical algorithms carstea et al 2016 li and hur 2017 however our previous work indicated that spectroscopic features of pollution sources revealed by eem and uv vis were their apparent features which might be potential deceptive and could not be used as strong evidence for pollution source identification shen et al 2021b it is also important to reveal the compositional features of pollution sources the integration of spectroscopic and compositional features for pollution sources not only strengthens the understanding of pollution sources but also improves the reliability of pollution source identification high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are common techniques for unravelling dom compositions size exclusion chromatography sec combined with ultraviolet detector uvd and fluorescence detector fld can present the apparent molecular weight mw distributions of doms and reveal their compositional characteristics at molecular level brezinski and gorczyca 2019 among various mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was recognized as the most powerful tool for composition assignment of unknown materials in dom zhang et al 2020a in this study we collected urban snow in beijing from 2019 to 2021 the pollution features of urban snow were thoroughly analyzed by uv vis eem sec and ft icr ms techniques the main purpose of this study was to excavate the stable features of urban snow from all the spectroscopic and compositional features these stable features might be the potential indicators for identification of urban snow pollution in the water environment which provided important support for the engineering application of urban snow pollution identification in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample and data collection the air masses of beijing come from siberia wen et al 2021 with the intensification of anthropogenic activities the concentration of atmospheric pm is increasing in the process of air masses migrating to the southeast of beijing li et al 2021 consequently the concentration of atmospheric pm in the south of beijing is significantly higher than that in the north of beijing it is obvious that the urban snow in the south of beijing contains rich dom which is beneficial to the analyses of spectroscopic and compositional features haidian district is located in the southcentral of beijing which is positioned as the cultural and educational area yuan et al 2018 the functional orientation of haidian district makes it one of the urban areas with the largest population vehicle ownership and fossil fuel consumption beijing municipal bureau statistics 2020 thus it is reasonable to set the sampling site in haidian district in this study the sampling points 20 in total are evenly set in tsinghua university and their locations are depicted in fig s1 the sampling was performed during the snow event on december 16th 2019 january 6th 2020 and january 19th 2021 the snowfall of these three snow events were about 3 3 4 5 and 0 2 mm respectively fresh snow samples were collected twice by 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube from 1 cm above the underlying surface before sampling all centrifuge tubes were ultrasonically cleaned with de ionized water after sampling ceased all snow samples were preserved at a 4 c refrigerator away from light and analyzed as soon as possible the atmospheric online observation site that was located at tsinghua university see fig s1 could measure and record air quality and meteorological parameters in real time the data of wind speed and the concentrations of pms pm10 and pm2 5 and carbonaceous species in pm2 5 organic carbon oc and om before and after the three snow events were extracted from this online observation site the measurement methods measurement instruments and data quality assurance quality control scenarios of wind speed pms and oc were described in previous work duan et al 2016 om concentration is equal to the oc concentration multiplied by 1 6 ma et al 2022 2 2 experimental measurement the water quality parameters wqps including ph conductivity ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod were tested based on the standard protocols proposed by the ministry of ecology and environment of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 the specific instruments for measurements of wqps are summarized in table s1 the snow samples sent for measurements of doc uv vis eem sec and ft icr ms were filtered by pre washed 0 45 μm polyethersulfone filters diameter 25 mm jinglong china in advance doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l japan with the combustion oxidation nondispersive infrared absorption method bisutti et al 2004 uv vis and eem spectra were scanned by uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa and fluorescence spectrometer hitachi fl 2700 japan respectively the scanning range and scanning interval of uv vis spectra was 200 600 and 1 nm respectively detailed scanning schemes of eem spectra are presented in table s2 the cell length for uv vis and eem measurements was 1 cm 1 cm sec was performed by infinity liquid chromatography system agilent 1260lc usa coupled with uvd and fld the sec scenarios are shown in table s3 besides the standard curve between retention time and lg mw used in this study was consistent with that in our previous study shen et al 2021b before conducting ft icr ms the snow samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe system which was composed of automatic spe instrument thermo scientific dionex autotrace 280 usa and spe column cartridge volume 6 ml agilent bond elut ppl usa the elution steps are described in table s4 the doc recovery rates of snow sample in 2019 2020 and 2021 after spe were 56 2 52 4 and 58 6 respectively ft icr ms was performed on a 15 0 t ft icr mass spectrometer bruker solarix usa with electrospray ionization esi source the concentrated snow samples were injected into esi source by syringe detailed operating parameters of ft cir ms are displayed in table s5 the time domain signal was superimposed 300 times to strengthen the signal to noise ratio s n sodium formate with concentration of 10 mmol l was utilized to externally calibrate the instrument before sample detection and internal calibration was conducted by dom with known molecular formula after sample detection in this study the measurements of wqps doc uv vis and eem were conducted for all samples considering that sec and ft icr ms were mainly used to characterize the mw distributions of fdom and compositions of dom in urban snow without focusing on the quantitative analysis or dataset integration the samples from the same year were mixed in equal amount 5 ml for testing sec and ft icr ms 2 3 analytical method in this study the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and sr were used to characterize the cdom and fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix were applied to describe the fdom the calculation methods of these spectroscopic parameters are elaborated in the supplementary material parallel factor parafac analysis was used to decompose eem spectra of urban snow into individual fluorescent components the algorithm principles and decomposition routines of which were expatiated in our previous studies shen et al 2020 2022 parafac analysis was carried out by matlab r2013a mathworks inc usa which assembled with the dreem v 2 0 toolbox compiled by murphy et al 2013 the systematic biases and inner filter effects of all eem spectra were corrected the algorithm derived by ohno 2002 was used to correct the primary and secondary inner filter effects detailed illustrations about this mathematical approach can be found in the supplementary material during exploratory phase there was not outliers in any of eem datasets all fluorescence data were normalized into raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the fluorescent component similarity was calculated by the tucker congruence coefficient tcc the algorithm of which was elaborated in the supplementary material the molecular formulas were exploited under negative esi mode and preliminarily assigned by bruker in house software dataanalysis 4 2 with s n 5 the element criteria for molecular formulas were cahbocndse the maximum numbers of n and s atoms of which were 3 and 1 respectively the exported molecular formulas were further screened via python based on the following conditions 2 h 2c 2 n o s o 0 33 h c 2 25 0 o c 1 0 n c 0 5 0 s c 0 2 mass error 0 2 ppm the van krevelen plots were used to ascribe the major biochemical compound classes of dom in urban snow the delineation of biochemical compound classes is described in table s6 liu et al 2020 the double bond equivalence dbe was determined as follows dbe 2c 2 h n 2 the modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated as follows koch and dittmar 2006 aimod 1 c 0 5o s 0 5 n p h c 0 5o s n p significant differences were estimated by variance analysis and significant level was reflected by p value 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of snow event on the atmospheric and water environment fig s2 presented the concentration variations of pm10 pm2 5 om and oc of the atmosphere before and after the three snow events in 2019 and 2020 the concentrations of pm10 pm2 5 om and oc collectively showed decrease trends after snow days december 16th 2019 and january 6th 2020 while the concentrations of these parameters in 2021 collectively showed increase trends after snow day january 19th 2021 wind speed is one of the important factors affecting the diffusion of pms for these three snow events the increase of wind speed after snow days in 2019 and 2020 was conducive to the diffusion of pms while the decrease of wind speed after snow day in 2021 was favorable to the accumulation of pms however the wind speed before and after the three snow events was basically at scale 1 2 light air and light breeze according to the beaufort wind scale zhang et al 2022 indicating that wind speed had very limited impacts on pm diffusion for these three snow events snow intensity is another important factor affecting the scavenging of atmospheric pms liu et al 2018 found that scavenging ratio of atmospheric pms would enhance with the increase of snow intensity the snow event in 2021 owned similar duration time 12 h to that of other two snow events but its snowfall was obviously lower than that of other two snow events 0 2 mm vs 3 3 4 5 mm which demonstrated that the snow event in 2021 had a lower snow intensity compared with other two snow events hence the scavenging ratio of atmospheric pms in 2021 might be inferior to that in other two years besides diao et al 2020 revealed that if the concentration of pms was low before the snow event the scavenging effect of atmospheric pms might be poor even a negative scavenging process fig s2 showed that the concentrations of pms om and oc on the day before the snow day in 2021 was lower than those on the day before the snow day in other two years which provided an unfavorable condition for the scavenging of atmospheric pms in 2021 the insights from snow intensity and pms concentration could preliminarily give reasonable explanations for the increase of pms concentration in the air after the snow event in 2021 snow event can remove pms from the atmosphere but may not improve the quality of atmospheric environment the impacts of wind speed snow intensity pms concentration and other factors on the diffusion and scavenging of pms should also be comprehensively considered during snow event the pms especially the organic pollutants will be adsorbed by snow lei and wania 2004 and then may enter the water environment so what is the concentration of pollutants carried by urban snow the average wqp values of urban snow are listed in table s7 it was a remarkable fact that the wqp values with bold type in table s7 cod and nh3 n values of 2021 tn values of 2019 and 2021 tp value of 2019 exceeded the class v surface water quality criteria of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 indicating that the snow in the region with large population might bring deterioration risk to surface water quality if it massively flowed into the water environment obviously the air pollutants carried by urban snow might also be one of the sources of water pollution the study on pollution characteristics of urban snow is of great importance to identify it in the water environment 3 2 study on spectroscopic and compositional features of urban snow 3 2 1 doc and uv vis analysis as shown in tables s7 and s8 the average doc concentration of urban snow collected from beijing in 2019 2020 and 2021 was 4 64 0 13 2 15 0 06 and 6 68 0 15 mg l respectively which was higher than that of fresh snow collected from regions with sparse anthropogenic activities fellman et al 2015 li et al 2016 hu et al 2018 feng et al 2020 and was basically consistent with that of fresh snow collected from other urban areas siudek et al 2015 yang et al 2020 anthropogenic processes will promote the formation of carbonaceous aerosols in the local atmosphere and consequently motivate snow to condense more doc wang et al 2016 reported that the average doc content in beijing snow was more than 20 mg l in 2015 which was much higher than the results of this study the reduction of doc content in beijing snow was closely related to the air pollution prevention and control action plan that was pursued by the beijing municipal government in recent years wen et al 2021 the typical uv vis spectra and ultraviolet spectroscopic parameters of urban snow are shown in fig s3 and table s7 respectively weishaar et al 2003 proved that suva254 was positively correlated r2 0 97 with aromaticity of cdom the average suva254 values of urban snow in three years were 1 16 0 13 2 19 0 16 and 0 58 0 08 l mg m respectively implying that the cdom of urban snow in 2020 owned the higher aromaticity compared with that of urban snow in other two years helms et al 2008 confirmed that sr was negatively correlated r2 0 86 with mw of cdom the average sr values of urban snow in three years were 1 15 0 08 1 92 0 11 and 1 26 0 04 respectively which indicated that the cdom of urban snow in 2020 had the lower mw compared with that of urban snow in other two years previously few studies reported the suva254 and sr values of snow in urban area several results about suva254 and sr of snow in glacier and polar regions are summarized in table s9 beine et al 2012 stubbins et al 2012 gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the influence mechanisms of anthropogenic activities on suva254 and sr of snow could not be clearly concluded since the current data was quite limited and the composition of cdom in snow was complex the p values for evaluating the significant level of suva254 or sr values of urban snow between different years are tabulated in table s10 all groups displayed significant differences except the sr values of 2019 and 2021 due to the variations of pollutant sources emission and other factors the cdom compositions of urban snow are reasonable to change which may lead to significant differences in suva254 or sr values between different years although suva254 and sr well described the aromaticity and mw features of cdom in urban snow they were not stable features of urban snow since they exhibited significant differences between different years 3 2 2 eem analysis the typical eem spectra and fluorescence spectroscopic parameters of urban snow are displayed in fig s4 and table s7 respectively hix was commonly used to evaluate the maturation of doms in aquatic ecosystem high hix values 10 0 were indictive of strong humification degree of doms and associated with recalcitrant humified organic materials derived from terrestrial sources mainly allochthonous origin whereas low hix values 4 0 were the sign of fresh humified oms derived from microbiological activities mainly autochthonous origin huguet et al 2009 the average hix values of urban snow in three years were 0 97 0 16 0 74 0 23 and 1 18 0 09 respectively which implied that the humification level of doms in the urban snow was weak and humic like materials in the urban snow mainly came from autochthonous microbial activities bix was proposed by huguet et al 2019 to estimate the presence of m fluorophore in humic like substances and features of autochthonous biological activity in water the average bix values of urban snow in three years were around 1 0 which corresponded to the presence of m fluorophore freshly released into the urban snow the ratiocination obtained from bix values was in accordance with that obtained from hix values fi was an indicator to distinguish the sources of aquatic fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 stated that fi values for microbially and terrestrially derived fulvic acids were around 1 4 and 1 9 respectively the average fi values of urban snow in three years were 1 69 0 07 1 78 0 15 and 1 62 0 05 respectively indicating a mixture of terrestrially and microbially derived fulvic acids cawley et al 2012 yang et al 2020 the inference obtained from fi values seemed to partially contradict that obtained from hix values the secondary rayleigh and raman scattering would occur in the fluorescence em spectrum of aqueous om solution at em 480 nm when ex was set as 254 nm to avoid this scattering phenomenon zsolnay et al 1999 selected 435 480 nm as the em wavelength range of humic like region to calculate hix however mcknight et al 2001 selected 450 and 500 this value 480 nm as the em wavelength to determine fi since fluorescence intensity at em 500 nm was basically half of the maximum intensity of fulvic acids for microbially derived sources and scattering phenomenon would not happen at these two em wavelengths 450 and 500 nm when ex was set as 370 nm considering the luminescence mechanisms of fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 fi might be more persuasive than hix in analyzing the origin of fulvic acid like materials prior to using fi hix and bix to characterize the humic like substances in aquatic system it was very essential to clarify their initial assumptions definitions and algorithms the fluorescence spectroscopic parameters of snow collected from other regions are described in table s11 wang et al 2016 feng et al 2018 2020 zhou et al 2019 yang et al 2020 su et al 2021 fi values of snow in urban area were roughly consistent with those of snow in depopulated zone implying they owned similar origin patterns of fulvic acid like materials although hix values of snow in different regions were slightly different they were all at a relatively low level indicating that the humification degree of doms in snow might be generally weak for bix values the freshness of m fluorophore in snow from urban area was commonly higher than that of m fluorophore in snow from depopulated zone another interesting result was that the fi hix and bix values of urban snow of beijing in 2015 were similar to the results of this study indicating that the source of humic like materials in urban snow of beijing was relatively stable in recent years and it was promising to extract stable features of urban snow of beijing from their eem spectra therefore eem parafac analysis was conducted to compare the similarities and differences of different fluorescent components in urban snow all eem spectra of urban snow in the same year were integrated into an independent dataset to perform eem parafac analysis n 40 for each fluorescent component their contour plots descriptions and spectral similarities are summarized in fig 1 tables s12 and s13 respectively three fluorescent components were identified in each dataset which were ascribed to tyrosine like tryptophan like and humic like materials respectively the humic like components in three datasets 2019 c3 2020 c3 2021 c3 showed favorable similarity 0 85 to each other implying that the fluorescence signals of humic like substances could be extracted as stable spectroscopic features for urban snow of beijing for protein like components associated with anthropogenic activities different datasets did not show ideal similarities to each other for instance no protein like components exhibited favorable similarity to 2020 c1 nonetheless the protein like components in different datasets were not completely unrelated for example 2019 c1 and 2021 c1 displayed high similarity 0 92 at excellent level and 2019 c2 was similar to 2020 c2 0 88 and 2021 c2 0 85 at good level the similarity analyses of protein like components indicated that the protein like components in urban snow presented differences due to anthropogenic activities but they also had some commonalities these similar fluorescence spectra of protein like components reported in this study could be used as stable spectroscopic features for urban snow of beijing 3 2 3 sec analysis the sec chromatograms with specific uv wavelength and ex em wavelength pairs for urban snow are shown in fig 2 the elution time and apparent mw of each cluster are summarized in table s14 for cdom at 254 nm fig 2a the apparent mw patterns of urban snow in different years were quite similar mainly reflected in three clusters eluted at 6 90 8 10 min besides three main species that were eluted at 7 30 8 25 min were found in humic like materials of urban snow in different years fig 2d and their apparent mw distributions were also quite similar the apparent mw distributions in cdom at 254 nm and humic like materials could be considered as stable compositional features for urban snow of beijing for protein like substances fig 2b and c the apparent mw distributions of urban snow in 2019 and 2020 were basically similar but they were quite different from those in 2021 3 2 4 ft icr ms analysis the van krevelen plots and statistical results of molecular formula for mass spectra of dom derived from urban snow samples in different years are presented in fig 3 and table s15 respectively for all urban snow samples the molecular formulas containing only c h and o presented dominance in contribution rate of molecular number n containing molecular formulas comprised 17 25 19 20 and 24 95 of total assigned formulas in urban snow of 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively for s containing molecular formulas the highest contribution rate of molecular number was found in urban snow of 2019 15 43 followed by urban snow of 2020 11 40 and 2021 0 76 antony et al 2014 pointed out that the presence of formulas associated with lipids proteins and carbohydrates correlated well with microbially derived components mainly autochthonous origin in snow in addition the presence of formulas associated with lignin and tannin indicated terrestrially derived materials mainly allochthonous origin in snow previous studies found that the total abundance of formulas related to lipids proteins and carbohydrates could reach more than 50 in snow samples from plateau and polar regions and this value was less than 40 for lignin and tannin antony et al 2014 feng et al 2018 2020 nonetheless the dom compositions of snow samples from urban area displayed an opposite composition pattern that was the total formula abundance of lipids proteins and carbohydrates was 1 20 21 00 and that of lignin and tannin was 51 60 74 52 dbe is a parameter for estimating the sum of double bonds and rings in organic compounds in this study the urban snow of 2021 presented the highest intensity weighted dbe value 9 07 followed by urban snow of 2019 6 56 and 2020 4 49 indicating that the dom in urban snow of 2021 had a higher relative content of organic molecules with rich double bonds and rings compared with other two years however dbe cannot explain which unsaturated groups are responsible for these double bonds and rings in organic molecules since o and n are also important atoms that make up unsaturated groups such as heterocyclic ring carbonyl and cyano group to solve this problem koch and dittmar 2006 proposed aimod to identify aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds in dom the intensity weighted aimod values of the three year urban snow samples showed a consistent relative relationship with the intensity weighted dbe values implying that the dom in urban snow of 2021 owned a higher relative content of aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds compared with other two years interestingly urban snow of 2021 exhibited an iconic dom composition feature that was the total formula abundance of condensed aromatic structures was much higher than that of urban snow of 2019 and 2020 which might provide a reasonable explanation for the relationships of the intensity weighted dbe and aimod values between different years koch and dittmar 2006 also stated that aimod was the most effective parameter for identifying condensed aromatic compounds compared with other materials in dom which provided a good support for the above findings the formation of condensed aromatic structures was related to the combustion of biomass and fossil fuels the o c of black carbon like materials released by combustion was generally lower than 0 2 however as shown in fig 3c the o c of most condensed aromatic formulas in urban snow of 2021 was above 0 4 indicating that these black carbon like materials might be oxidized by microorganisms or they did not come from the combustion of oc but were related to soil humic acids antony et al 2014 these phenomena implied that the proportion of molecular formula related to allochthonous source in dom of urban snow was higher than that in dom of snow from plateau and polar regions which might be associated with anthropogenic activities to extract the stable components of dom in urban snow the numbers of unique and overlapping molecular formula are counted among three samples which are visualized in fig 4 in three urban snow samples there were 1767 kinds of molecular formulas in total of which they shared 180 kinds of molecular formulas for these overlapping molecular formulas their h c o c and biochemical compound classes are summarized in table s16 about 95 6 172 of these overlapping molecular formulas were categorized into lignin component implying that these lignin like materials might be the stable components in urban snow of beijing through eem sec and ft icr ms analysis several stable features of urban snow were extracted how to use these stable features to identify the urban snow pollution and which stable features are expected to be indicators for tracking urban snow pollution from the water environment still need to be studied and verified in future engineering application 3 3 ponders and enlightenments from urban snow 3 3 1 comparison of pollution features of urban snow and urban rain in beijing precipitation is a pathway that transfers atmospheric pollutants from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere or the lithosphere in fact the pollution features of urban snow reported in this paper are also the embodiment of the characteristics of atmospheric pollutants rain as another form of precipitation its pollution features have the same importance to guide the pollution source identification of the water environment in urban areas by comparing the pollution features of urban snow and urban rain in beijing it might reflect the commonalities or differences of atmospheric pollutants deposited by these two precipitation forms to our best knowledge several studies reported the pollutant concentrations of urban rain of beijing in recent five years gao et al 2019 sun et al 2021 chen et al 2022 zeng et al 2022 however most of them investigated the composition profiles of water soluble ions in rain which was not comparable with the findings of this paper chen et al 2022 monitored the tn and tp concentrations of urban rain from 18 urban rainfall events of beijing in 2020 ranging from 1 50 7 00 and 0 03 0 47 mg l which were roughly comparable to the tn and tp concentrations of urban snow of beijing in recent three years besides they found the tn and tp concentrations in 17 and 14 urban rainfall events exceeded the class v surface water quality criteria of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 and urban rain might have negative impacts on the water environment which was in line with our results few studies systematically excavated the spectroscopic and compositional features of urban rain in beijing which implied that there was still much work to be done in the understanding of precipitation in urban areas of beijing 3 3 2 potential scenes of urban snow impact on the water environment snow and rain have different state of matter one is solid the other is liquid they have different impact patterns on the water environment for snow whether the water body is frozen or not is the primary consideration during non icebound season if the atmospheric pollutants are rich and snow intensity is strong the concentration of pollutants adsorbed in snow may be high which will give negative impacts on water bodies with poor flow velocity during icebound season pollutants in snow will deposit on the ice when the temperature rises and the ice melts these accumulated pollutants will enter the water environment in a short time causing negative impacts on water quality 3 3 3 perform pollution source identification with a systematic view it is habitual for us to find pollution sources from the anthroposphere such as industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater when the water environment is polluted since these pollution sources possess a large contribution to water pollution in most cases however it is worth noting that the pollutants produced by anthropogenic activities may not only directly input into the water environment through the anthroposphere but also indirectly input into the water environment through other spheres precipitation plays a crucial role in the cross sphere migration of anthropogenic pollutants the urban snow reported in this paper was a good example precipitation can remove the anthropogenic pms from the atmosphere to the water environment and can also form surface runoff on the lithosphere and scour agricultural non point sources related to planting and breading industry into the water environment besides precipitation may infiltrate the lithosphere and transport pollutants through groundwater to surface water evidently precipitation is a kind of route that provides motivate power for pollutants to transfer from other spheres to the hydrosphere when the pollution sources derived from the anthroposphere are effectively controlled their contributions to water pollution will decline and the water pollution degree may change from heavy to moderate or light at this time the contributions of the pollution sources derived from other spheres to water pollution will increase and they cannot be ignored any more thus the concept of pollution source identification must change from simplification to diversification for moderately or slightly polluted water bodies an important basis for supporting this idea is to gradually construct a cross sphere environmental monitoring system in densely populated regions that is an air ground integrated environmental monitoring system that can simultaneously supervise the environmental quality of surface water air and soil the construction of this monitoring system not only contributes to understanding the pollution formation processes from a stereoscopic perspective but also is expected to realize collaborative governance of cross sphere pollution sources 4 conclusions in this study the spectroscopic and compositional features of urban snow in beijing from 2019 to 2021 were comprehensively investigated from three snow events we found that snow event could remove pms from the atmosphere but might not improve the air quality the pollutants adsorbed by urban snow might enter the water environment and bring a deterioration risk for water quality the ultraviolet spectroscopic parameters suva254 and sr of urban snow in different years displayed great differences the fluorescence signals of humic like and some protein like components derived from parafac analysis were extracted as stable features for urban snow for urban snow in three years their apparent mw distributions in cdom at 254 nm and humic like substances were quite similar to each other which were regarded as their stable compositional features ft icr ms analysis found that the proportion of dom related to allochthonous sources in urban snow was higher than that in snow from plateau or polar regions the overlapping molecular formulas among urban snow in three years indicated that 180 kinds of lignin like materials might be stable components in dom of beijing urban snow the stable features of urban snow obtained from eem sec and ft icr ms techniques might be potential indicators for the identification of snow pollution snow promoted the migration of pollutants from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere which indicated that the contributions of the pollution sources derived from the atmosphere to water pollution cannot be ignored and the

15191,snow owns stronger adsorption capacity for organic pollutants compared with rain huge amounts of anthropogenic dissolved organic matters doms in the atmosphere may enter the water environment with urban snow and increase water pollution risk extracting stable pollution features of urban snow is conducive to identifying the urban snow pollution from the water environment herein we systematically explored the spectroscopic and compositional profiles of urban snow in beijing from three snow events by multiple analytical tools and extracted stable pollution features of urban snow for the first time results showed that conventional pollutants with high concentration were detected in urban snow the fluorescence signals of humic like and some protein like materials the molecular weight distributions of chromophoric dom at 254 nm and humic like materials and 172 kinds of lignin like molecular formulas were extracted as stable features for urban snow these stable features of urban snow laid the foundation for the identification of urban snow pollution and the analysis of the impact mechanisms of atmospheric pollution sources on the water environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords snow dissolved organic matter pollution features pollution source identification data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction precipitation is an important wet deposition pathway to realize matter exchange and circulation between the atmosphere and the hydrosphere gao et al 2021 during precipitation process dissolved organic matters doms in carbonaceous aerosol will depart from the atmosphere and input into the hydrosphere in dom pool dissolved organic carbon doc is the main carbon source and contributes to about 50 of the total dom vitale and guardo 2019 safieddine and heald 2017 assessed that the average total doc wet deposition flux of ocean and inland was 85 and 188 tg yr with concentration value of 0 1 1 and 1 10 mg l respectively therefore doc plays a pivotal role in the atmosphere hydrosphere carbon cycle massicotte et al 2017 niu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in carbonaceous aerosol doc is derived from natural e g volcano eruption or anthropogenic e g fossil fuel combustion sources legrand et al 2013 with rapid development of industrialization and modernization the proportion of anthropogenic activities derived doc progressively increased in total doc wet deposition flux from global perspective the wet deposition flux of doc which originated from combustion of fossil fuels was estimated to be 36 tg yr yan and kim 2012 obviously precipitation with high doc concentration may pose potential threat to the water environment in some regions with prosperous anthropogenic activities therefore sometimes precipitation can be regarded as a kind of pollution source in moderate and high latitude regions the pollution risk of precipitation for the water environment in winter is higher than that in other seasons because the form of precipitation in winter is snow instead of rain snow owns strong capacity for adsorbing organic particulate matters pms which is an efficient scavenger of organic contaminants lei and wania 2004 in addition the combustion amount of fossil fuels will significantly increase in winter simultaneously resulting the increase of various organic pollutants concentrations in the air hence snow may remove more organic pollutants from the atmosphere into the water environment compared with rain precise source governance is the core of water pollution control shen et al 2020 2021a and pollution source identification is one of the important strategies for pollution source governance the key to identify pollution sources from the water environment is to master their features a pollution source has many features some of which are easy to change with anthropogenic activities analytical instruments and environmental factors while some of which are not easy to change showing good stability the stable features are more likely to be the potential indicators to accurately track pollution sources from the water environment compared with unstable features for example compared with facial features the police prefer to use fingerprint or dna information to identify suspect since these features are stable and difficult to change thus the extraction of stable features for pollution sources is the premise to ensure the realization of pollution source identification in recent years many literatures reported various characteristics of snow including doms antony et al 2014 2018 fellman et al 2015 hu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 2020b niu et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 feng et al 2020 gao et al 2020 2021 elements mann et al 2015 calace et al 2017 thapa et al 2020 and microbial communities riedel et al 2008 qiu et al 2016 smith et al 2018 however the aims of these studies were to explicate transport and transformation mechanisms of doms including element in snow and their impacts on ecosystem functions not to generalize the stable features of snow besides the snow samples of these studies were commonly collected from the areas with sparse anthropogenic activities such as antarctica antony et al 2014 2018 calace et al 2017 arctic ocean riedel et al 2008 mann et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b tibetan plateau hu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 feng et al 2020 gao et al 2021 and other mountains and polar regions fellman et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 gao et al 2020 thapa et al 2020 which could not give valuable information on pollution source identification for the water environment in the region with large population beijing is a typical densely populated region located north of the tropic of cancer which is suitable to be selected as the study area to explore the pollution features of urban snow in previous studies yuan et al 2018 characterized the concentrations of several specific pollutants heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in snowpack and snowmelt surface runoff from different functional areas in beijing aiming to evaluate their ecological risk to the water environment rather than identify their pollution characteristics wang et al 2016 investigated the spectroscopic features of snow from beijing in 2015 the sampling period of this study was relatively short so that they could not conclude the stable features of snow in beijing evidently it was of great necessity to perform a study with long sampling period so far there was no relevant report focused on that pm is one of the major pollutants in the air of beijing the main component of which is organic matter om li et al 2021 the atmospheric pm emission potential begins to increase in autumn and remains at a relatively high level in winter which means that the beijing snow may contain rich oms thus we chose dom as a grasp and utilized various techniques about dom characterization to depict the pollution features of urban snow in beijing ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrum and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem are useful tools for describing the spectroscopic features of chromophoric dom cdom li and hur 2017 and fluorescent dom fdom carstea et al 2016 respectively eem and uv vis techniques are favored in the filed of pollution source identification because of their fast testing speed simple operation and mature analytical algorithms carstea et al 2016 li and hur 2017 however our previous work indicated that spectroscopic features of pollution sources revealed by eem and uv vis were their apparent features which might be potential deceptive and could not be used as strong evidence for pollution source identification shen et al 2021b it is also important to reveal the compositional features of pollution sources the integration of spectroscopic and compositional features for pollution sources not only strengthens the understanding of pollution sources but also improves the reliability of pollution source identification high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are common techniques for unravelling dom compositions size exclusion chromatography sec combined with ultraviolet detector uvd and fluorescence detector fld can present the apparent molecular weight mw distributions of doms and reveal their compositional characteristics at molecular level brezinski and gorczyca 2019 among various mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was recognized as the most powerful tool for composition assignment of unknown materials in dom zhang et al 2020a in this study we collected urban snow in beijing from 2019 to 2021 the pollution features of urban snow were thoroughly analyzed by uv vis eem sec and ft icr ms techniques the main purpose of this study was to excavate the stable features of urban snow from all the spectroscopic and compositional features these stable features might be the potential indicators for identification of urban snow pollution in the water environment which provided important support for the engineering application of urban snow pollution identification in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample and data collection the air masses of beijing come from siberia wen et al 2021 with the intensification of anthropogenic activities the concentration of atmospheric pm is increasing in the process of air masses migrating to the southeast of beijing li et al 2021 consequently the concentration of atmospheric pm in the south of beijing is significantly higher than that in the north of beijing it is obvious that the urban snow in the south of beijing contains rich dom which is beneficial to the analyses of spectroscopic and compositional features haidian district is located in the southcentral of beijing which is positioned as the cultural and educational area yuan et al 2018 the functional orientation of haidian district makes it one of the urban areas with the largest population vehicle ownership and fossil fuel consumption beijing municipal bureau statistics 2020 thus it is reasonable to set the sampling site in haidian district in this study the sampling points 20 in total are evenly set in tsinghua university and their locations are depicted in fig s1 the sampling was performed during the snow event on december 16th 2019 january 6th 2020 and january 19th 2021 the snowfall of these three snow events were about 3 3 4 5 and 0 2 mm respectively fresh snow samples were collected twice by 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube from 1 cm above the underlying surface before sampling all centrifuge tubes were ultrasonically cleaned with de ionized water after sampling ceased all snow samples were preserved at a 4 c refrigerator away from light and analyzed as soon as possible the atmospheric online observation site that was located at tsinghua university see fig s1 could measure and record air quality and meteorological parameters in real time the data of wind speed and the concentrations of pms pm10 and pm2 5 and carbonaceous species in pm2 5 organic carbon oc and om before and after the three snow events were extracted from this online observation site the measurement methods measurement instruments and data quality assurance quality control scenarios of wind speed pms and oc were described in previous work duan et al 2016 om concentration is equal to the oc concentration multiplied by 1 6 ma et al 2022 2 2 experimental measurement the water quality parameters wqps including ph conductivity ammonia nitrogen nh3 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod were tested based on the standard protocols proposed by the ministry of ecology and environment of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 the specific instruments for measurements of wqps are summarized in table s1 the snow samples sent for measurements of doc uv vis eem sec and ft icr ms were filtered by pre washed 0 45 μm polyethersulfone filters diameter 25 mm jinglong china in advance doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l japan with the combustion oxidation nondispersive infrared absorption method bisutti et al 2004 uv vis and eem spectra were scanned by uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa and fluorescence spectrometer hitachi fl 2700 japan respectively the scanning range and scanning interval of uv vis spectra was 200 600 and 1 nm respectively detailed scanning schemes of eem spectra are presented in table s2 the cell length for uv vis and eem measurements was 1 cm 1 cm sec was performed by infinity liquid chromatography system agilent 1260lc usa coupled with uvd and fld the sec scenarios are shown in table s3 besides the standard curve between retention time and lg mw used in this study was consistent with that in our previous study shen et al 2021b before conducting ft icr ms the snow samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe system which was composed of automatic spe instrument thermo scientific dionex autotrace 280 usa and spe column cartridge volume 6 ml agilent bond elut ppl usa the elution steps are described in table s4 the doc recovery rates of snow sample in 2019 2020 and 2021 after spe were 56 2 52 4 and 58 6 respectively ft icr ms was performed on a 15 0 t ft icr mass spectrometer bruker solarix usa with electrospray ionization esi source the concentrated snow samples were injected into esi source by syringe detailed operating parameters of ft cir ms are displayed in table s5 the time domain signal was superimposed 300 times to strengthen the signal to noise ratio s n sodium formate with concentration of 10 mmol l was utilized to externally calibrate the instrument before sample detection and internal calibration was conducted by dom with known molecular formula after sample detection in this study the measurements of wqps doc uv vis and eem were conducted for all samples considering that sec and ft icr ms were mainly used to characterize the mw distributions of fdom and compositions of dom in urban snow without focusing on the quantitative analysis or dataset integration the samples from the same year were mixed in equal amount 5 ml for testing sec and ft icr ms 2 3 analytical method in this study the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and sr were used to characterize the cdom and fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix were applied to describe the fdom the calculation methods of these spectroscopic parameters are elaborated in the supplementary material parallel factor parafac analysis was used to decompose eem spectra of urban snow into individual fluorescent components the algorithm principles and decomposition routines of which were expatiated in our previous studies shen et al 2020 2022 parafac analysis was carried out by matlab r2013a mathworks inc usa which assembled with the dreem v 2 0 toolbox compiled by murphy et al 2013 the systematic biases and inner filter effects of all eem spectra were corrected the algorithm derived by ohno 2002 was used to correct the primary and secondary inner filter effects detailed illustrations about this mathematical approach can be found in the supplementary material during exploratory phase there was not outliers in any of eem datasets all fluorescence data were normalized into raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the fluorescent component similarity was calculated by the tucker congruence coefficient tcc the algorithm of which was elaborated in the supplementary material the molecular formulas were exploited under negative esi mode and preliminarily assigned by bruker in house software dataanalysis 4 2 with s n 5 the element criteria for molecular formulas were cahbocndse the maximum numbers of n and s atoms of which were 3 and 1 respectively the exported molecular formulas were further screened via python based on the following conditions 2 h 2c 2 n o s o 0 33 h c 2 25 0 o c 1 0 n c 0 5 0 s c 0 2 mass error 0 2 ppm the van krevelen plots were used to ascribe the major biochemical compound classes of dom in urban snow the delineation of biochemical compound classes is described in table s6 liu et al 2020 the double bond equivalence dbe was determined as follows dbe 2c 2 h n 2 the modified aromaticity index aimod was calculated as follows koch and dittmar 2006 aimod 1 c 0 5o s 0 5 n p h c 0 5o s n p significant differences were estimated by variance analysis and significant level was reflected by p value 3 results and discussion 3 1 impacts of snow event on the atmospheric and water environment fig s2 presented the concentration variations of pm10 pm2 5 om and oc of the atmosphere before and after the three snow events in 2019 and 2020 the concentrations of pm10 pm2 5 om and oc collectively showed decrease trends after snow days december 16th 2019 and january 6th 2020 while the concentrations of these parameters in 2021 collectively showed increase trends after snow day january 19th 2021 wind speed is one of the important factors affecting the diffusion of pms for these three snow events the increase of wind speed after snow days in 2019 and 2020 was conducive to the diffusion of pms while the decrease of wind speed after snow day in 2021 was favorable to the accumulation of pms however the wind speed before and after the three snow events was basically at scale 1 2 light air and light breeze according to the beaufort wind scale zhang et al 2022 indicating that wind speed had very limited impacts on pm diffusion for these three snow events snow intensity is another important factor affecting the scavenging of atmospheric pms liu et al 2018 found that scavenging ratio of atmospheric pms would enhance with the increase of snow intensity the snow event in 2021 owned similar duration time 12 h to that of other two snow events but its snowfall was obviously lower than that of other two snow events 0 2 mm vs 3 3 4 5 mm which demonstrated that the snow event in 2021 had a lower snow intensity compared with other two snow events hence the scavenging ratio of atmospheric pms in 2021 might be inferior to that in other two years besides diao et al 2020 revealed that if the concentration of pms was low before the snow event the scavenging effect of atmospheric pms might be poor even a negative scavenging process fig s2 showed that the concentrations of pms om and oc on the day before the snow day in 2021 was lower than those on the day before the snow day in other two years which provided an unfavorable condition for the scavenging of atmospheric pms in 2021 the insights from snow intensity and pms concentration could preliminarily give reasonable explanations for the increase of pms concentration in the air after the snow event in 2021 snow event can remove pms from the atmosphere but may not improve the quality of atmospheric environment the impacts of wind speed snow intensity pms concentration and other factors on the diffusion and scavenging of pms should also be comprehensively considered during snow event the pms especially the organic pollutants will be adsorbed by snow lei and wania 2004 and then may enter the water environment so what is the concentration of pollutants carried by urban snow the average wqp values of urban snow are listed in table s7 it was a remarkable fact that the wqp values with bold type in table s7 cod and nh3 n values of 2021 tn values of 2019 and 2021 tp value of 2019 exceeded the class v surface water quality criteria of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 indicating that the snow in the region with large population might bring deterioration risk to surface water quality if it massively flowed into the water environment obviously the air pollutants carried by urban snow might also be one of the sources of water pollution the study on pollution characteristics of urban snow is of great importance to identify it in the water environment 3 2 study on spectroscopic and compositional features of urban snow 3 2 1 doc and uv vis analysis as shown in tables s7 and s8 the average doc concentration of urban snow collected from beijing in 2019 2020 and 2021 was 4 64 0 13 2 15 0 06 and 6 68 0 15 mg l respectively which was higher than that of fresh snow collected from regions with sparse anthropogenic activities fellman et al 2015 li et al 2016 hu et al 2018 feng et al 2020 and was basically consistent with that of fresh snow collected from other urban areas siudek et al 2015 yang et al 2020 anthropogenic processes will promote the formation of carbonaceous aerosols in the local atmosphere and consequently motivate snow to condense more doc wang et al 2016 reported that the average doc content in beijing snow was more than 20 mg l in 2015 which was much higher than the results of this study the reduction of doc content in beijing snow was closely related to the air pollution prevention and control action plan that was pursued by the beijing municipal government in recent years wen et al 2021 the typical uv vis spectra and ultraviolet spectroscopic parameters of urban snow are shown in fig s3 and table s7 respectively weishaar et al 2003 proved that suva254 was positively correlated r2 0 97 with aromaticity of cdom the average suva254 values of urban snow in three years were 1 16 0 13 2 19 0 16 and 0 58 0 08 l mg m respectively implying that the cdom of urban snow in 2020 owned the higher aromaticity compared with that of urban snow in other two years helms et al 2008 confirmed that sr was negatively correlated r2 0 86 with mw of cdom the average sr values of urban snow in three years were 1 15 0 08 1 92 0 11 and 1 26 0 04 respectively which indicated that the cdom of urban snow in 2020 had the lower mw compared with that of urban snow in other two years previously few studies reported the suva254 and sr values of snow in urban area several results about suva254 and sr of snow in glacier and polar regions are summarized in table s9 beine et al 2012 stubbins et al 2012 gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the influence mechanisms of anthropogenic activities on suva254 and sr of snow could not be clearly concluded since the current data was quite limited and the composition of cdom in snow was complex the p values for evaluating the significant level of suva254 or sr values of urban snow between different years are tabulated in table s10 all groups displayed significant differences except the sr values of 2019 and 2021 due to the variations of pollutant sources emission and other factors the cdom compositions of urban snow are reasonable to change which may lead to significant differences in suva254 or sr values between different years although suva254 and sr well described the aromaticity and mw features of cdom in urban snow they were not stable features of urban snow since they exhibited significant differences between different years 3 2 2 eem analysis the typical eem spectra and fluorescence spectroscopic parameters of urban snow are displayed in fig s4 and table s7 respectively hix was commonly used to evaluate the maturation of doms in aquatic ecosystem high hix values 10 0 were indictive of strong humification degree of doms and associated with recalcitrant humified organic materials derived from terrestrial sources mainly allochthonous origin whereas low hix values 4 0 were the sign of fresh humified oms derived from microbiological activities mainly autochthonous origin huguet et al 2009 the average hix values of urban snow in three years were 0 97 0 16 0 74 0 23 and 1 18 0 09 respectively which implied that the humification level of doms in the urban snow was weak and humic like materials in the urban snow mainly came from autochthonous microbial activities bix was proposed by huguet et al 2019 to estimate the presence of m fluorophore in humic like substances and features of autochthonous biological activity in water the average bix values of urban snow in three years were around 1 0 which corresponded to the presence of m fluorophore freshly released into the urban snow the ratiocination obtained from bix values was in accordance with that obtained from hix values fi was an indicator to distinguish the sources of aquatic fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 stated that fi values for microbially and terrestrially derived fulvic acids were around 1 4 and 1 9 respectively the average fi values of urban snow in three years were 1 69 0 07 1 78 0 15 and 1 62 0 05 respectively indicating a mixture of terrestrially and microbially derived fulvic acids cawley et al 2012 yang et al 2020 the inference obtained from fi values seemed to partially contradict that obtained from hix values the secondary rayleigh and raman scattering would occur in the fluorescence em spectrum of aqueous om solution at em 480 nm when ex was set as 254 nm to avoid this scattering phenomenon zsolnay et al 1999 selected 435 480 nm as the em wavelength range of humic like region to calculate hix however mcknight et al 2001 selected 450 and 500 this value 480 nm as the em wavelength to determine fi since fluorescence intensity at em 500 nm was basically half of the maximum intensity of fulvic acids for microbially derived sources and scattering phenomenon would not happen at these two em wavelengths 450 and 500 nm when ex was set as 370 nm considering the luminescence mechanisms of fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 fi might be more persuasive than hix in analyzing the origin of fulvic acid like materials prior to using fi hix and bix to characterize the humic like substances in aquatic system it was very essential to clarify their initial assumptions definitions and algorithms the fluorescence spectroscopic parameters of snow collected from other regions are described in table s11 wang et al 2016 feng et al 2018 2020 zhou et al 2019 yang et al 2020 su et al 2021 fi values of snow in urban area were roughly consistent with those of snow in depopulated zone implying they owned similar origin patterns of fulvic acid like materials although hix values of snow in different regions were slightly different they were all at a relatively low level indicating that the humification degree of doms in snow might be generally weak for bix values the freshness of m fluorophore in snow from urban area was commonly higher than that of m fluorophore in snow from depopulated zone another interesting result was that the fi hix and bix values of urban snow of beijing in 2015 were similar to the results of this study indicating that the source of humic like materials in urban snow of beijing was relatively stable in recent years and it was promising to extract stable features of urban snow of beijing from their eem spectra therefore eem parafac analysis was conducted to compare the similarities and differences of different fluorescent components in urban snow all eem spectra of urban snow in the same year were integrated into an independent dataset to perform eem parafac analysis n 40 for each fluorescent component their contour plots descriptions and spectral similarities are summarized in fig 1 tables s12 and s13 respectively three fluorescent components were identified in each dataset which were ascribed to tyrosine like tryptophan like and humic like materials respectively the humic like components in three datasets 2019 c3 2020 c3 2021 c3 showed favorable similarity 0 85 to each other implying that the fluorescence signals of humic like substances could be extracted as stable spectroscopic features for urban snow of beijing for protein like components associated with anthropogenic activities different datasets did not show ideal similarities to each other for instance no protein like components exhibited favorable similarity to 2020 c1 nonetheless the protein like components in different datasets were not completely unrelated for example 2019 c1 and 2021 c1 displayed high similarity 0 92 at excellent level and 2019 c2 was similar to 2020 c2 0 88 and 2021 c2 0 85 at good level the similarity analyses of protein like components indicated that the protein like components in urban snow presented differences due to anthropogenic activities but they also had some commonalities these similar fluorescence spectra of protein like components reported in this study could be used as stable spectroscopic features for urban snow of beijing 3 2 3 sec analysis the sec chromatograms with specific uv wavelength and ex em wavelength pairs for urban snow are shown in fig 2 the elution time and apparent mw of each cluster are summarized in table s14 for cdom at 254 nm fig 2a the apparent mw patterns of urban snow in different years were quite similar mainly reflected in three clusters eluted at 6 90 8 10 min besides three main species that were eluted at 7 30 8 25 min were found in humic like materials of urban snow in different years fig 2d and their apparent mw distributions were also quite similar the apparent mw distributions in cdom at 254 nm and humic like materials could be considered as stable compositional features for urban snow of beijing for protein like substances fig 2b and c the apparent mw distributions of urban snow in 2019 and 2020 were basically similar but they were quite different from those in 2021 3 2 4 ft icr ms analysis the van krevelen plots and statistical results of molecular formula for mass spectra of dom derived from urban snow samples in different years are presented in fig 3 and table s15 respectively for all urban snow samples the molecular formulas containing only c h and o presented dominance in contribution rate of molecular number n containing molecular formulas comprised 17 25 19 20 and 24 95 of total assigned formulas in urban snow of 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively for s containing molecular formulas the highest contribution rate of molecular number was found in urban snow of 2019 15 43 followed by urban snow of 2020 11 40 and 2021 0 76 antony et al 2014 pointed out that the presence of formulas associated with lipids proteins and carbohydrates correlated well with microbially derived components mainly autochthonous origin in snow in addition the presence of formulas associated with lignin and tannin indicated terrestrially derived materials mainly allochthonous origin in snow previous studies found that the total abundance of formulas related to lipids proteins and carbohydrates could reach more than 50 in snow samples from plateau and polar regions and this value was less than 40 for lignin and tannin antony et al 2014 feng et al 2018 2020 nonetheless the dom compositions of snow samples from urban area displayed an opposite composition pattern that was the total formula abundance of lipids proteins and carbohydrates was 1 20 21 00 and that of lignin and tannin was 51 60 74 52 dbe is a parameter for estimating the sum of double bonds and rings in organic compounds in this study the urban snow of 2021 presented the highest intensity weighted dbe value 9 07 followed by urban snow of 2019 6 56 and 2020 4 49 indicating that the dom in urban snow of 2021 had a higher relative content of organic molecules with rich double bonds and rings compared with other two years however dbe cannot explain which unsaturated groups are responsible for these double bonds and rings in organic molecules since o and n are also important atoms that make up unsaturated groups such as heterocyclic ring carbonyl and cyano group to solve this problem koch and dittmar 2006 proposed aimod to identify aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds in dom the intensity weighted aimod values of the three year urban snow samples showed a consistent relative relationship with the intensity weighted dbe values implying that the dom in urban snow of 2021 owned a higher relative content of aromatic and condensed aromatic compounds compared with other two years interestingly urban snow of 2021 exhibited an iconic dom composition feature that was the total formula abundance of condensed aromatic structures was much higher than that of urban snow of 2019 and 2020 which might provide a reasonable explanation for the relationships of the intensity weighted dbe and aimod values between different years koch and dittmar 2006 also stated that aimod was the most effective parameter for identifying condensed aromatic compounds compared with other materials in dom which provided a good support for the above findings the formation of condensed aromatic structures was related to the combustion of biomass and fossil fuels the o c of black carbon like materials released by combustion was generally lower than 0 2 however as shown in fig 3c the o c of most condensed aromatic formulas in urban snow of 2021 was above 0 4 indicating that these black carbon like materials might be oxidized by microorganisms or they did not come from the combustion of oc but were related to soil humic acids antony et al 2014 these phenomena implied that the proportion of molecular formula related to allochthonous source in dom of urban snow was higher than that in dom of snow from plateau and polar regions which might be associated with anthropogenic activities to extract the stable components of dom in urban snow the numbers of unique and overlapping molecular formula are counted among three samples which are visualized in fig 4 in three urban snow samples there were 1767 kinds of molecular formulas in total of which they shared 180 kinds of molecular formulas for these overlapping molecular formulas their h c o c and biochemical compound classes are summarized in table s16 about 95 6 172 of these overlapping molecular formulas were categorized into lignin component implying that these lignin like materials might be the stable components in urban snow of beijing through eem sec and ft icr ms analysis several stable features of urban snow were extracted how to use these stable features to identify the urban snow pollution and which stable features are expected to be indicators for tracking urban snow pollution from the water environment still need to be studied and verified in future engineering application 3 3 ponders and enlightenments from urban snow 3 3 1 comparison of pollution features of urban snow and urban rain in beijing precipitation is a pathway that transfers atmospheric pollutants from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere or the lithosphere in fact the pollution features of urban snow reported in this paper are also the embodiment of the characteristics of atmospheric pollutants rain as another form of precipitation its pollution features have the same importance to guide the pollution source identification of the water environment in urban areas by comparing the pollution features of urban snow and urban rain in beijing it might reflect the commonalities or differences of atmospheric pollutants deposited by these two precipitation forms to our best knowledge several studies reported the pollutant concentrations of urban rain of beijing in recent five years gao et al 2019 sun et al 2021 chen et al 2022 zeng et al 2022 however most of them investigated the composition profiles of water soluble ions in rain which was not comparable with the findings of this paper chen et al 2022 monitored the tn and tp concentrations of urban rain from 18 urban rainfall events of beijing in 2020 ranging from 1 50 7 00 and 0 03 0 47 mg l which were roughly comparable to the tn and tp concentrations of urban snow of beijing in recent three years besides they found the tn and tp concentrations in 17 and 14 urban rainfall events exceeded the class v surface water quality criteria of china ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china 2002 and urban rain might have negative impacts on the water environment which was in line with our results few studies systematically excavated the spectroscopic and compositional features of urban rain in beijing which implied that there was still much work to be done in the understanding of precipitation in urban areas of beijing 3 3 2 potential scenes of urban snow impact on the water environment snow and rain have different state of matter one is solid the other is liquid they have different impact patterns on the water environment for snow whether the water body is frozen or not is the primary consideration during non icebound season if the atmospheric pollutants are rich and snow intensity is strong the concentration of pollutants adsorbed in snow may be high which will give negative impacts on water bodies with poor flow velocity during icebound season pollutants in snow will deposit on the ice when the temperature rises and the ice melts these accumulated pollutants will enter the water environment in a short time causing negative impacts on water quality 3 3 3 perform pollution source identification with a systematic view it is habitual for us to find pollution sources from the anthroposphere such as industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater when the water environment is polluted since these pollution sources possess a large contribution to water pollution in most cases however it is worth noting that the pollutants produced by anthropogenic activities may not only directly input into the water environment through the anthroposphere but also indirectly input into the water environment through other spheres precipitation plays a crucial role in the cross sphere migration of anthropogenic pollutants the urban snow reported in this paper was a good example precipitation can remove the anthropogenic pms from the atmosphere to the water environment and can also form surface runoff on the lithosphere and scour agricultural non point sources related to planting and breading industry into the water environment besides precipitation may infiltrate the lithosphere and transport pollutants through groundwater to surface water evidently precipitation is a kind of route that provides motivate power for pollutants to transfer from other spheres to the hydrosphere when the pollution sources derived from the anthroposphere are effectively controlled their contributions to water pollution will decline and the water pollution degree may change from heavy to moderate or light at this time the contributions of the pollution sources derived from other spheres to water pollution will increase and they cannot be ignored any more thus the concept of pollution source identification must change from simplification to diversification for moderately or slightly polluted water bodies an important basis for supporting this idea is to gradually construct a cross sphere environmental monitoring system in densely populated regions that is an air ground integrated environmental monitoring system that can simultaneously supervise the environmental quality of surface water air and soil the construction of this monitoring system not only contributes to understanding the pollution formation processes from a stereoscopic perspective but also is expected to realize collaborative governance of cross sphere pollution sources 4 conclusions in this study the spectroscopic and compositional features of urban snow in beijing from 2019 to 2021 were comprehensively investigated from three snow events we found that snow event could remove pms from the atmosphere but might not improve the air quality the pollutants adsorbed by urban snow might enter the water environment and bring a deterioration risk for water quality the ultraviolet spectroscopic parameters suva254 and sr of urban snow in different years displayed great differences the fluorescence signals of humic like and some protein like components derived from parafac analysis were extracted as stable features for urban snow for urban snow in three years their apparent mw distributions in cdom at 254 nm and humic like substances were quite similar to each other which were regarded as their stable compositional features ft icr ms analysis found that the proportion of dom related to allochthonous sources in urban snow was higher than that in snow from plateau or polar regions the overlapping molecular formulas among urban snow in three years indicated that 180 kinds of lignin like materials might be stable components in dom of beijing urban snow the stable features of urban snow obtained from eem sec and ft icr ms techniques might be potential indicators for the identification of snow pollution snow promoted the migration of pollutants from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere which indicated that the contributions of the pollution sources derived from the atmosphere to water pollution cannot be ignored and the air ground integrated environmental monitoring system should be constructed to support collaborative governance of cross sphere pollution sources declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15192,the immigration of microbial communities in a synergistic partial denitrification anammox spda system was investigated in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr inoculated with partial denitrification pd and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biofilms the spda system was operated at 25 1 c over 260 days the total nitrogen tn of the effluent was only 3 71 0 92 mg l 1 in the stable phase with a tn removal efficiency of 95 23 the anammox process was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway with an average contribution of 74 31 to tn removal the results of the in situ activity and key enzymatic activity revealed that the nitrate reducing bacteria tended to immigrate to anammox biofilms correspondingly the abundance of the genus thauera the second most dominant bacteria in anammox biofilms quickly increased from 0 78 to 10 69 on day 50 and eventually to 16 45 on day 221 according to the illumina miseq sequencing data the microbial immigration might be caused by different extracellular polymeric substance eps mediated mechanisms in pd and anammox biofilms for fast growing denitrifiers pd biofilms tend to increase the ability of mass transfer by excreting more polysaccharides to form loosely bound eps at the expense of the ability to harbor the nitrate reducing bacteria however for the slow growing anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob the anammox biofilms tend to increase the retention of anaob by excreting more proteins to form enhanced tightly bound eps at the expense of the mass transfer ability thereby causing the detached nitrate reducing bacteria to immigrate into anammox biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial denitrification anammox microbial immigration hybrid biofilm system extracellular polymeric substances data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a resource efficient alternative process for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater and it has the potential to bring wastewater treatment plants wwtps close to neutral energy balance jin et al 2012 under anaerobic conditions the biological nitrogen removal reaction produces nitrogen and nitrate with ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as an electron acceptor kartal et al 2010 however the bottleneck for its wide application in wwtps still lies in the stable and sufficient supply of nitrite and the stimulation of the growth and retention of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob from the perspective of nitrogen transformation the anammox process is primarily associated with two different pathways namely partial nitrification pn oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and partial denitrification pd reduction of nitrate to nitrite chen et al 2021 although the pn anammox system has greater economic viability and environmental sustainability advantages over the pd anammox system the full scale implementation of a mainstream pn anammox system seems to be hindered by the lack of an efficient strategy to suppress the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and maintain a stable nitrite supply castro barros et al 2017 du et al 2019c le et al 2019 liu et al 2020 recently substantial high level accumulation of no2 n has been achieved in the denitrification process with low strength wastewater cao et al 2017 du et al 2019c shi et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 the emerging pd process is considered a relatively reliable bioprocess technology capable of converting nitrate to nitrite in low strength wastewater thus it provides a novel and potential way for the treatment of low strength wastewater based on the anammox process jiang et al 2021 the enrichment and retention of specific functional bacteria including nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob are crucial for the pd anammox system cao et al 2020 biofilm formation is an effective strategy to enhance biomass retention and enrich low growth biomass especially for anaob wang et al 2021 anaob biofilms are usually enriched by in situ and ex situ strategies in situ enrichment of anaob takes a longer time due to their long doubling time in fact previous findings have confirmed that the anoxic zone in wwtps might be the hotspot where the anammox reaction occurs spontaneously and the anoxic carrier biofilms could be enriched with anaob li et al 2019 however for the mainstream process the proportion of anammox process contributed relatively little to the nitrogen loss in wwtps cao et al 2020 wang et al 2015 2021 conversely the ex situ approach which usually involves inoculating mature anammox biofilms to the cultivated pd system might shorten the start up time and even achieved high nitrogen removal efficiency immediately under mainstream conditions mainly through the pd anammox pathway gao et al 2021 li et al 2021 2020a 2020b biofilm matrices are formed largely of extracellular polymeric substances eps which are a complex mixture of interlaced biopolymers secreted by microbial cells including proteins polysaccharides ps nucleic acids etc fish et al 2017 wang et al 2014 eps generally play key functions in maintaining the mechanical stability of microbial aggregates strengthening cells tolerance to desiccation and toxic substances by acting protective barriers preserving the associated enzymes for substrate degradation etc wang et al 2014 2019 notable the constituent and structure of eps depend on many factors including substrate type nutrient content growth phase external conditions etc but especially bacterial species sheng et al 2010 ras et al 2011 2013 also emphasized that eps properties are considered to be closely associated with microbial diversity of biofilms hou et al 2015 reported that there was a significant difference in the hydrophilic functional groups of eps between anammox sludge and nitrifying denitrifying sludge which further affects the hydrophobic interaction and aggregation ability of sludge thus the eps composition of two types of biofilms in the ex situ coupling system might lead to different biofilm responses during the coupling operation due to their significant difference in the microbial community then the community of nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob might undergo reconfiguration and spontaneously reaggregate to form a unique structure based on their metabolic pathway and physiological characteristics in a relatively specific environment since predicting the biofilm response and the change in community structure in the practical application of the pd anammox biofilms system has important guiding significance for the operation and maintenance of engineering systems it is necessary to determine the transformation characteristics of the biofilm microbial communities and gain an in depth insight into the interactions of functional bacteria in hybrid biofilm systems given that our current understanding of these relationships remains limited this study aimed to establish a synergistic pd anammox spda system by inoculating pd and anammox carriers to understand the major mechanisms controlling the interaction between the inoculated anammox and pd biofilms to this end this study performed the following tasks i evaluated the long term nitrogen removal performance and biofilm response ii investigated the transformation mechanisms of nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob in the spda system by activity tests and analysis of eps and key enzymatic activities and iii analyzed variations of microbial communities in both pd and anammox biofilms by illumina miseq sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and carrier inoculation a plexiglass moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with a working volume of 5 l and equipped with a thruster

02 and 31 67 0 98 mg l 1 respectively were fed into the mbbr in the form of nh4cl and nano3 a sodium acetate solution was used as the carbon source 90 mg cod l 1 and the ratio of chemical oxygen demand cod no3 n was maintained at around 1 64 the other components of the synthetic wastewater were l nahco3 0 25 g mgso4 7h2o 0 14 g cacl2 2h2o 0 14 g kh2po4 0 03 g and 1 ml of a mixture of trace elements the mineral medium composition of the mixture of trace elements used in this study is shown in table s1 section 3 of si 2 3 activity test the in situ microbial denitrification and anammox activities in the biofilm were measured on days 0 50 119 161 and 221 for the measurement of the in situ denitrification activity of pd or anammox biofilm after removing the anammox or pd carriers from the reactor at the end of one cycle the pd or anammox carriers were placed in the reactor with synthetic wastewater containing 30 mg no3 n l 1 and 90 mg cod l 1 after purging the reactor with n2 to maintain anoxic conditions samples were taken every 20 120 min the observed specific reaction rate for no3 n reduction rate and no2 n accumulation rate during the measurement of the in situ denitrification activity were denoted as rno3 obs and rno2 obs to measure the pd activity instead for the measurement of the in situ anammox activity in anammox or pd biofilms after removing the pd or anammox carriers from the mbbr the anammox or pd carriers were placed in the reactor with synthetic wastewater containing 25 mg nh4 n l 1 28 65 mg no2 n l 1 and 0 5 g l 1 nahco3 sampling was performed every 1 4 h under anaerobic conditions similarly the in situ anammox activity rnh4 obs mg l d 1 is defined as the observed specific reaction rate for nh4 n consumption rate 2 4 enzyme activity test the appropriate amounts of pd and anammox carriers were randomly selected to measure the enzyme activity after removing the biofilm sample from the carriers the crude enzyme was extracted according to a previous study yu et al 2021a using a jn 02c ultra high pressure continuous flow cell crusher guangzhou juneng nano bio technology co ltd beijing china the supernatant was used as crude enzyme solution to measure protein concentration by a modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and enzyme activities detailed description given in section 4 of si methyl viologen was used as the electron donor to avoid oxygen inhibition for the test of nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir in a 2 ml system as described by li et al 2016 the system for nar includes 5 4 mm nano3 200 mm methyl viologen 10 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 5 mm nas2o4 and an appropriate amount of enzyme the system for nir includes 1 mm nano2 1 mm methyl viologen 100 mm pbs ph 7 4 5 mm nas2o4 and an appropriate amount of enzyme to simply compare the enzymatic activity of pd and anammox biofilm in the mbbr nar and nir enzyme activities were measured and normalized as μmol no2 n min l 1 the hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh activity was determined according to the method described by shimamura et al 2007 the standard reaction mixture for the determination of hdh activity consisted of 100 mm pbs ph 8 0 50 µm horse heart cytochrome c oxidized form 25 µm hydrazine and an appropriate amount of enzyme solution the reactions were performed in 3 ml cuvettes sealed with butyl rubber stoppers at 35 c under anoxic conditions using argon to purge the oxygen after the reactions the increase in the absorbance of cytochrome c at 550 nm in the standard mixture was compared against that of the control without the enzyme the hdh enzyme activities were expressed as µmol cytochrome c min l 1 2 5 biofilm response 2 5 1 analysis of biofilm characteristics and morphology the biofilm was characterized by measuring the biofilm biomass thickness and density the biofilm thickness were quantified by optical microscopy using a nikon eclipse 50i optical microscope nikon corporation tokyo japan before measurement of thickness 3 randomly harvested biofilm samples were sectioned into 50 µm slices using a leica cm1950 microtome leica wetzlar germany five slices of three replicate carriers were used for thickness analysis followed by 20 25 thickness measurements per slice additionally the dry weight biomass of the biomass was measured using the protocol described by young et al 2017 the density of the biofilm was then determined by the biofilm biomass per volume of the biofilm biofilm volume is expressed as thickness carrier surface area arabgol et al 2022 due to its high resolution scanning electron microscopy sem has been used extensively for qualitative observation of morphology prior to the observation of the biofilm morphology the biofilm sample for sem analysis was subjected to a biofilm dehydration treatment according to a reported method hazrin chong and manefield 2012 the biofilm samples were analyzed a maximum of 4 h after harvesting and sem images were recorded using a jeol jsm 6510lv scanning electron microscope jeol ltd tokyo japan in high vacuum mode at 15 and 25 kv at least five images of four replicate carriers at least 20 total images were analyzed for biofilm morphology the images were taken at random locations across the carrier surface 2 5 2 extraction of eps the variation trends of the total eps content during the coupling process were analyzed by measuring the total eps extracted by the cation exchange resin cer method as described by frølund et al 1996 the total eps extracted was fractionated by chromatography on a non ionic microporous supelitetm dax 8 resin 40 60 mesh column milliporesigma burlington ma usa to analyze the hydrophilic hydrophobic distribution and then divided into hydrophobic acids hoa hydrophobic bases hob hydrophobic neutral substances hon and hydrophilic substances his wang et al 2014 the hydrophobic substance content was considered as the sum of the contents of hoa hob and hon the concrete operating procedures were as reported by shen et al 2010 a detailed description is given in section 5 of si the tightly bound eps t eps loosely bound eps l eps and soluble eps s eps are the sub fractions of eps which have been shown to play different roles in microbial aggregates the determination of the compositions of these sub fractions of eps could be useful to differentiate hybrid biofilms according to the binding compactness between bacteria a heat extraction method was used to divide the eps into s eps l eps and t eps du et al 2019a all the eps extracts were analyzed for the content of proteins ps and dna the ps content was detected by the anthrone method using glucose as the standard the proteins content was detected by the lowry method using bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard the dna content was determined by the diphenylamine colorimetric method chen et al 2013 2 6 other analytical methods 2 6 1 chemical analysis the no3 n nh4 n and no2 n contents were measured according to a standard method apha 2012 the cod ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a hach drb 200 portable cod measuring instrument hach company loveland co usa a leici phs 3c desktop precision ph meter shanghai leici instruments co ltd shanghai china and a mettler toledo seven2gos9 do meter mettler toledo schweiz gmbh greifensee switzerland respectively the correlations were determined by pearson s correlation analysis and a p value of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 6 2 calculations without considering the consumption for microbial synthesis the anammox and full denitrification fd were the two main nitrogen removal pathways in the spda system the ntr was calculated using eq 1 and the nitrogen removal contribution of anammox and full denitrification pathway was calculated using eqs 2 and 3 du et al 2019a respectively 1 ntr no 2 n eff 1 32 nh 4 n inf nh 4 n eff no 3 n inf 0 26 nh 4 n inf nh 4 n eff no 3 n eff 2 anammox 1 1 32

respectively no3 neff no2 neff and nh4 neff are the effluent no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations respectively tninf and tneff were the total nitrogen tn concentration in the influent and effluent respectively since there was little organic nitrogen in the synthetic wastewater the tn concentration was calculated as the sum of the inorganic nitrogen concentration of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n 2 7 illumina miseq sequencing analysis the biofilm samples which were collected from the spda system on days 0 50 119 161 and 221 were analyzed by illumina miseq sequencing allwegene technology inc beijing china to determine the microbial community compositions the v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified using primers with the sequences 515a gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa and 806 ggactachvggtwtctaat the sequencing methods used were based on those described by li fang et al 2021 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the spda system was operated for 260 days during a long term operation fig 1 the operation process of the mbbr was divided into two stages according to the reactor performance namely the adaptation stage days 1 50 and the stable stage days 51 260 during the adaptation stage fig 1a the effluent no3 n concentration rapidly decreased from 11 16 mg l 1 on day 1 to 1 13 mg l 1 on day 50 and the no3 n removal efficiency gradually increased from about 32 to 96 indicating that pd biofilms in the coupled spda system still had sufficient pd activity to convert no3 n into no2 n for the metabolism of anammox correspondingly the effluent nh4 n concentration rapidly decreased from 11 9 to 4 31 mg l 1 with a removal efficiency of 92 87 day 50 these results indicated that the inoculated pd and anammox biofilms in the coupling system could immediately work together and achieve nitrogen removal during the stable stage days 51 260 the effluent no3 n concentration remained at about 0 67 mg l 1 with an average removal efficiency of 97 the effluent cod concentration was 21 38 0 53 mg l 1 with an average cod removal efficiency of 76 24 0 58 meanwhile the no2 n produced by the pd process was almost consumed through the anammox process with an average effluent no2 n concentration of 0 93 mg l 1 fig 1a and the effluent concentration of nh4 n continued to decrease from 4 31 mg l 1 day 50 to about 2 08 mg l 1 day 260 with an average removal efficiency of 91 fig 1b these findings suggest that in the spda system the anaob could adapt to lower substrate concentration with the increase of the operation time the ntr in the spda system was maintained above 70 from days 51 260 fig 2 a and the removal efficiency of tn reached 93 fig 1c these results revealed that the denitrifiers that brought about nitrite accumulation with a relatively high ntr were able to accumulate sufficient no2 n and effectively cooperate with anaob thus the spda system could successfully achieve efficient removal of nh4 n and no3 n in the long term operation the nitrogen removal contribution of the two main nitrogen removal pathways namely the anammox and full denitrification pathways is shown in fig 1d during the operation time the contribution of the anammox pathway to tn removal in the spda system gradually increased the contribution of the anammox pathway was maintained at 74 31 4 29 and could even reach its maximum at 84 on day 195 while that of the full denitrification pathway was only maintained at 12 53 3 25 these findings indicated that the anammox pathway was the dominant pathway in tn removal and the synergy of the pd and anammox pathways to simultaneously treat the nh4 n and no3 n in synthetic wastewater was feasible in the spda system 3 2 in situ microbial activity and key enzymatic activities 3 2 1 in situ pd activity and nar nir activities the variation of the in situ pd activity shown in fig 2a revealed that the total in situ pd activity tended to increase in particular the total rno3 obs gradually increased from 521 14 5 30 mg l d 1 on day 0 to 682 61 4 86 mg l d 1 on day 221 and the total rno2 obs increased from 486 14 3 04 mg l d 1 to 605 63 5 24 mg l d 1 during the same period thus the spda system showed an excellent performance in no2 n accumulation during its operation and the operation of the coupled system could partially enhance the ability of the pd process the high total in situ pd activity was conducive to the stability of the spda system it is important to note that the in situ pd activity in pd biofilms showed a decreasing tendency throughout the experiment fig 2a on day 0 the rno3 obs and rno2 obs were 521 14 5 30 and 486 14 3 04 mg l d 1 respectively the ratio of rno3 obs to rno2 obs was 0 93 which was close to the theoretical value of 1 0 indicating that the pd biofilms had high in situ pd activity before coupling after 221 days of operation the rno3 obs contribution rate of pd biofilms decreased from 100 to 41 79 0 57 and that of rno2 obs decreased from 100 to 41 22 0 49 however between days 161 221 the in situ pd activity in pd biofilms tended to be stable the rno3 obs and rno2 obs were maintained at 281 36 3 01 and 244 87 5 00 mg l d 1 respectively indicating that the pd biofilms could reach a relatively stable state after long term operation in the spda system similarly the in situ pd activity in anammox biofilms gradually increased during the 221 days of operation the rno3 obs contribution rate of anammox biofilms increased from 0 to 58 21 0 43 and that of rno2 obs increased from 0 to 58 78 0 51 indicating that a certain amount of denitrifying microorganisms bringing about nitrate reduction indeed appeared in the anammox biofilms after coupling the variation of nar and nir activities in pd and anammox biofilms is shown in fig 2b the total nar activity increased from 57 13 1 02 to 129 79 2 58 μmol min l 1 and only a little nir activity was detected the promotion level of nir was lower than that of nar throughout the whole operation resulting in the ability of the pd biofilm to transform more nitrate with nitrite as the end product meanwhile the nar activity in pd biofilms could reach 52 25 0 64 μmol min l 1 before coupling and gradually decreased to 44 87 1 21 μmol min l 1 on day 221 in contrast the nar activity of anammox biofilms gradually increased from 4 87 0 38 μmol min l 1 on day 0 to 94 91 1 37 μmol min l 1 on day 221 which is consistent with the changing trends of the in situ pd activity in the anammox and pd biofilms as shown in fig 2a 3 2 2 in situ anammox activity and hdh activities the variation of rnh4 obs in anammox and pd biofilms shown in fig 3 a clearly reveals that total rnh4 obs gradually decreased from 174 38 4 39 mg l d 1 day 0 to 38 81 1 46 mg l d 1 day 119 and then recovered somewhat to 66 66 4 76 mg l d 1 days 161 221 similarly the total hdh activity decreased from 2 76 0 14 μmol min l 1 day 0 to 1 46 0 12 μmol min l 1 day 119 and then completely recovered to 2 70 0 13 μmol min l 1 days 161 221 as shown in fig 3b these findings indicated that anaob could gradually adapt to the new operating conditions after long term operation of the spda system in addition the rnh4 obs in anammox biofilms in the stable stage days 161 221 was 57 74 1 94 mg l d 1 with a contribution to the total rnh4 obs of 86 64 0 41 but that in pd biofilms was 8 91 2 81 mg l d 1 with a contribution of only 13 36 0 59 moreover compared with that in anammox biofilms the hdh activity in pd biofilms was almost negligible this is indicating that the anammox process before and after coupling always occurred in the anammox biofilm but not in the pd biofilm 3 3 biofilm response 3 3 1 biofilm characteristics biofilm characteristics such as biomass thickness and density were quantified for pd and anammox carriers to investigate the biofilm response before and after coupling fig 4 in the spda system the thickness biomass and density of pd biofilms showed a decreasing tendency after coupling decreasing by 14 7 24 1 and 11 01 respectively in contrast those of anammox biofilms increased by 22 78 42 64 and 16 17 respectively the calculated densities of pd biofilm before after coupling were 59 36 2 04 and 52 82 12 54 kg m 3 while those of anammox biofilms were 96 97 6 11 and 112 66 10 78 kg m 3 respectively it is evident that the pd biofilm was always looser than anammox biofilms and the density difference between pd biofilms and anammox biofilms after coupling was gradually increased a similar phenomenon occurred in the biofilm morphology fig s2 the results of sem imaging showed that compared with the anammox biofilms pd biofilms after coupling became looser and a significant number of pores and channels appeared the small upper left image in fig s2b consistent with the changes in biofilm density fig 4 3 3 2 total eps content and hydrophobicity of eps the measurement of the total eps contents in pd and anammox biofilms revealed that the average total eps content in pd biofilms was 95 74 2 07 mg g vss 1 fig 5 a and that in anammox biofilms was 114 98 2 36 mg g vss 1 fig 5b a comparison of the composition of eps in the pd and anammox biofilms clearly showed that there was almost no difference between ps and dna components but the protein content was higher in the total eps in anammox biofilms in particular the protein content in anammox biofilms 71 33 1 25 mg g vss 1 was 61 7 higher than that in pd biofilms 44 12 1 02 mg g vss 1 the proportions of hydrophobic substances in pd and anammox biofilms fig 6 revealed that before coupling these proportions were about 74 64 and 79 96 in pd and anammox biofilms respectively this indicates that both biofilms had excellent hydrophobicity which contributed to biomass aggregation different from the hydrophobic substances before coupling the proportion of hydrophobic substances in pd biofilms after coupling decreased from 74 64 day 0 to 66 56 day 221 but that in anammox biofilms increased from 79 96 day 0 to 89 02 day 221 due to the change in the hob percentage the results showed that the hob in pd biofilms was reduced by almost half from 23 on day 0 to 11 on day 221 in contrast the hob in anammox biofilms was increased 3 3 3 sub fractions of eps the percentages of each sub fractions of eps extracted from pd and anammox biofilms before coupling day 0 and after coupling for 221 days of operation day 221 are shown in fig 7 among the sub fractions of eps extracted from each sample the t eps was the highest followed by the l eps and the s eps was the lowest after coupling the s eps decreased by 20 25 in both pd and anammox biofilms compared with the data before coupling but the variation of l eps and t eps components variation in pd and anammox biofilms were different there was almost no change in the fraction of t eps in pd biofilms but the fraction of l eps increased by 12 9 after coupling meanwhile the fraction of l eps in anammox biofilms was little changed but the fraction of t eps after coupling increased by 13 fig 7a in addition the contributions of proteins ps and dna to the s eps l eps and t eps are calculated in fig 7b among all sub fractions in pd and anammox biofilms the contribution of proteins was the highest followed by ps and dna was the lowest after coupling the contribution of proteins decreased and that of ps increased in the s eps in both pd and anammox biofilms for the t eps there was almost no change in their composition in the pd biofilms while the fraction of proteins significantly increased by 12 20 and that of ps decreased by 13 34 in the anammox biofilms for the l eps there was almost no change in their composition in anammox biofilms while the fraction of proteins decreased by 3 02 and that of ps noticeably increased by 8 23 in pd biofilms 3 4 microbial community analysis the phylum level identification of the bacterial communities in pd biofilms is shown in fig 8 a members of the phylum proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial species in the five samples representing up to 54 72 of the microbial communities throughout the entire experiment other major phyla present were planctomycetota bacteroidota and acidobacteriota all of which are commonly found in wastewater treatment bioreactors chu et al 2021 du et al 2019b han et al 2021 noteworthy a slight increase was observed in the number of planctomycetota but it was still much lower than that of proteobacteria according to the statistics at the genus level in pd biofilms shown in fig 8b thauera was the dominant genus of bacteria in the high scale of the phylum proteobacteria in pd biofilms which was believed to be responsible for the high no2 n accumulation performance in pd biofilms the results revealed that the relative abundance of thauera species was about 37 22 20 84 from days 0 221 which was highly correlated with in situ pd activity in pd biofilms r 0 97 p 0 05 this showed that the downward trend of thauera could lead to a reduction in the no2 n accumulation in pd biofilms meanwhile the abundance of candidatus brocadia the dominant anaob in pd biofilms only increased from 0 on day 0 to 1 40 on day 119 and then rapidly increased up to 6 22 on day 221 indicating that there are indeed some anaob that could grow in pd biofilms the major bacterial phyla in anammox biofilms are shown in fig 8c of which planctomycetota proteobacteria and bacteroidota were the top three most abundant bacterial phyla the abundance of planctomycetota was 38 29 from days 0 221 and was highly correlated with rnh4 obs in anammox biofilms r 0 91 p 0 05 meanwhile proteobacteria gradually increased from 21 03 day 0 to 40 38 day 221 and became the dominant microbial communities after coupling the abundance of proteobacteria was highly correlated with in situ pd activity in anammox biofilms r 0 95 p 0 05 indicating that a considerable number of denitrifiers immigrated to anammox biofilms according to the statistics at the genus level in anammox biofilms shown in fig 8d among the detected anaob ca brocadia was the dominant anaob throughout during the coupling operation the abundance of ca brocadia from days 0 119 gradually decreased followed by a subsequent increase from days 119 221 and eventually was maintained at a relatively high level 33 54 22 41 also the abundance of ca brocadia was highly correlated with rnh4 obs in anammox biofilms r 0 82 p 0 05 indicating that the rnh4 obs could eventually be maintained stably in the spda system fig 3a meanwhile the abundance of thauera was up to 10 69 on day 50 and then gradually increased until 16 45 on day 221 which was also highly correlated with in situ pd activity in anammox biofilms r 0 98 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 the microbial immigration from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms in this study the results of the activity tests and enzyme activity measurements fig 2 showed that the established coupled spda system had an excellent performance in no2 n accumulation and its ability of partial denitrification after coupling was enhanced to some extent however both the in situ pd activity and nar activity in pd biofilms showed a decreasing tendency which is opposite to the tendency of the total in situ pd activity and nar activity in the spda system indicating that the detachment and immigration of the nitrate reducing bacteria might occur in the pd biofilms comparing the trends of the in situ pd activity and nar activity observed in pd and anammox biofilms fig 2 it can be inferred that the detached nitrate reducing bacteria from pd biofilms tended to immigrate to anammox biofilms which resulted in the different trends of in situ pd activity and nar activity observed in anammox and pd biofilms these phenomena were also observed in other studies for instance li et al 2020a and gao et al 2021 all confirmed that the denitrifying bacteria could grow in anammox biofilms and enhance the stability of nitrogen removal during the operation time however the rnh4 obs and hdh activity were mainly observed in anammox biofilms throughout the operation of the system fig 3 similarly compared with their contribution in anammox biofilms 86 64 0 41 and 95 22 0 74 respectively the rnh4 obs and hdh activity in pd biofilm were relatively low 13 36 0 59 and 4 78 0 26 respectively these findings showed that even if a small amount of anaob detached from the anammox biofilms it was relatively difficult to grow in pd biofilms according to the results of the illumina miseq sequencing analysis fig 8 the increasing abundance of thauera in anammox biofilms indicated that thauera could co exist with anaob provided stable nitrite for the anammox process prevented the anaob from being inhibited by lack of electron acceptor and contributed to nitrogen removal in the spda system du et al 2019b noteworthy the abundance of thauera in anammox biofilms increased rapidly from 0 78 on day 0 to 10 69 on day 50 and ultimately reached 16 45 on day 221 fig 8 which were much greater than the abundance of thauera 0 81 4 42 in anammox biofilms of the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactor with similar operating conditions yu et al 2022 likewise the increase in relative abundance of thauera in mbbr system was also much faster than the proliferation of thauera in the stable pd anammox ifas system in other studies e g 0 25 for over 300 days li et al 2020a and 8 for 190 days wang et al 2020 this indicated that the immigration of thauera from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms in the hybrid biofilm system was dominant in the anammox biofilm especially in the earlier phase days 0 50 but not the growth and proliferation of thauera in anammox biofilms meanwhile the immigration of ca brocadia from anammox biofilms to pd biofilms was much less than that of thauera from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms section 3 4 these results further confirmed the immigration trend in the spda system indicating that the nitrate reducing bacteria in pd biofilms especially thauera tend to immigrate to anammox biofilms considering that the abundance of anaob slowly increased from 0 on day 0 to 1 40 on day 119 and eventually reached 6 22 on day 221 which was likely due to the growth and proliferation of anaob on pd biofilms as a result of the slow growing anaob the immigration of anaob in anammox biofilms to pd biofilms is almost negligible 4 2 potential mechanisms of microbial immigration in the spda biofilm system eps are conducive to the adherence of microorganisms to the carrier surface and the adhesion between microorganisms wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a in this study the content ratio of ps to total eps in pd biofilms before coupling was relatively higher than that in anammox biofilms fig 5 some ps such as acetylated ps form hydrophobic pockets and provide additional capacities for london dispersion forces mayer et al 1999 which might affect the mechanical stability of biofilms moreover ps were susceptible to degradation by extracellular enzymes which would cause the release of biofilm bacteria and the spread of the organisms to new environments boyd and chakrabarty 1994 salama et al 2016 xun et al 1990 thus the relatively high levels of ps in pd biofilms might result in the detachment and immigration of nitrate reducing bacteria fig 5a however the content ratio of proteins to total eps in anammox biofilms before coupling was relatively higher than that in pd biofilms fig 5 proteins which could directly or indirectly connect ps through a multivalent cation bridge to form the three dimensional structure of a biofilm salama et al 2016 play a key role in the aggregation of bacteria increase cell density and reinforce intercellular interactions in biofilms zhang et al 2019 in this study the abundance of proteins in anammox biofilms fig 5b indicated that the anammox biofilms had a more compact biofilm structure and functional bacteria such as anaob were relatively difficult to detach from the anammox biofilms figs 4 and s2c d as a result the relatively loose structure of pd biofilms fig s2b and the relatively compact structure of anammox biofilms fig s2d might promote the detachment of nitrate reducing bacteria closely joined in anammox biofilms as revealed by the sub fractions of eps there are significant differences between pd biofilms and anammox biofilms in the variation of components of the l eps and t eps fig 7 this finding indicates that both pd and anammox biofilms will require their respective strategies to achieve a more harmonious coexistence of functional microorganisms between ca brocadia and thauera in the spda systems in order to maximize the total activity of pd and anammox the existing microbial community would regulate the metabolic pathway of the production of eps in response to changes in environmental conditions liu et al 2004 accordingly we assumed that the biofilms grown in the hybrid system would undertake to arrange the internal architecture of eps according to the environmental conditions and mediate the nutrient transport rate or the mechanical pliability needed to trap bacteria this study clearly revealed that pd and anammox biofilms might have different eps mediated mechanisms after coupling as shown in fig 9 for the fast growing denitrifiers fig 9 the microbiological activity seems to be more dependent on the nutrient transport rate i e mass transfer more ps in pd biofilm were excreted to form l eps but protein content was decreased after coupling figs 5 and 7 this study revealed that the decrease of protein content in l eps and s eps might be due to the hydrolysis of proteins or the loss of extracellular enzymes higgins and novak 1997 fig 7 in order to reduce the loss of proteins and enhance the thermostability and resistance to proteolysis more ps are released which could interact with the enzymes yu 2020 the increasing content of ps which generally contain plenty of hydrophilic components is consistent with the decreasing fractions of hob of the eps in pd biofilms fig 6 the increase in the hydrophilicity of pd biofilms might lead to the looser structure of pd biofilms and increase their nutrient transport efficiency at the expense of its ability to harbor the nitrate reducing bacteria schopf et al 2021 wäsche et al 2000 young et al 2016 these phenomena might induce the detachment of the nitrate reducing bacteria and then reduce the in situ pd activity in pd biofilms meanwhile for the slow growing anaob fig 9 the anammox activity is highly dependent on the bacteria density and the high cell density could lead to a high activity and growth rate hou et al 2015 as a result the anammox biofilms tend to secrete proteins to form more t eps fig 7 in fact it has been reported that the increase in protein content was important for the macroscopic biofilm structure and might cause a change in the detachment or sloughing behavior nielsen et al 1997 the amino and carboxyl groups in proteins can stimulate microbial aggregation by promoting the formation of hydrogen bonds wang et al 2014 in the analysis of the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity distribution fig 6 the increasing fractions of hob of the eps in anammox biofilms such as proteins with basic amino acids which is consistent with the increase in protein content the increase of t eps and hob generally plays a key role in the hydrophobicity of biofilms cell aggregation and dense biofilm formation du et al 2019a to increase its mechanical strength to harbor anaob therefore the enhanced retention ability of anaob in anammox biofilms might maintain the appropriate rnh4 and contribute to the relatively long age sludge retention time srt of anaob but at the expense of the nutrient transfer rate to deeper layers consequently some nitrate reducing bacteria are released from pd biofilms which are lost with the effluent or re attached to the surface of biofilms meanwhile the high t eps concentration of anammox biofilms could provide cells and trigger these released cells to search for more favorable environments or better access to local nutrients in the anammox biofilms ultimately the coupling system with nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob could form a new biofilm structure 5 conclusion 1 the efficient synergy of pd and anammox biofilms in an mbbr has been confirmed for simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal with a high tn removal efficiency of 93 at 25 1 c and the anammox pathway was determined to be the dominant nitrogen removal pathway 2 microbial immigration was observed in the hybrid spda system nitrate reducing bacteria that immigrated from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms were more noticeable than those anaob that immigrated from anammox biofilms to pd biofilms resulting in the appearance of in situ pd activity and nar activity in anammox biofilms the genus thauera was the second most dominant bacteria after the genus ca brocadia in anammox biofilms 3 pd and anammox biofilms might have different eps mediated mechanisms for the fast growing denitrifiers pd biofilms tended to increase the ability of mass transfer by excreting more ps to form l eps at the expense of the ability to harbor the nitrate reducing bacteria however for the slow growing anaob the anammox biofilms tended to increase the retention of anaob by excreting more proteins to form enhanced t eps at the expense of the mass transfer ability thereby inducing the detached nitrate reducing bacteria to immigrate to anammox biofilms declaration of competing interest the authors

15192,the immigration of microbial communities in a synergistic partial denitrification anammox spda system was investigated in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr inoculated with partial denitrification pd and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biofilms the spda system was operated at 25 1 c over 260 days the total nitrogen tn of the effluent was only 3 71 0 92 mg l 1 in the stable phase with a tn removal efficiency of 95 23 the anammox process was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway with an average contribution of 74 31 to tn removal the results of the in situ activity and key enzymatic activity revealed that the nitrate reducing bacteria tended to immigrate to anammox biofilms correspondingly the abundance of the genus thauera the second most dominant bacteria in anammox biofilms quickly increased from 0 78 to 10 69 on day 50 and eventually to 16 45 on day 221 according to the illumina miseq sequencing data the microbial immigration might be caused by different extracellular polymeric substance eps mediated mechanisms in pd and anammox biofilms for fast growing denitrifiers pd biofilms tend to increase the ability of mass transfer by excreting more polysaccharides to form loosely bound eps at the expense of the ability to harbor the nitrate reducing bacteria however for the slow growing anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob the anammox biofilms tend to increase the retention of anaob by excreting more proteins to form enhanced tightly bound eps at the expense of the mass transfer ability thereby causing the detached nitrate reducing bacteria to immigrate into anammox biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial denitrification anammox microbial immigration hybrid biofilm system extracellular polymeric substances data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a resource efficient alternative process for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater and it has the potential to bring wastewater treatment plants wwtps close to neutral energy balance jin et al 2012 under anaerobic conditions the biological nitrogen removal reaction produces nitrogen and nitrate with ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as an electron acceptor kartal et al 2010 however the bottleneck for its wide application in wwtps still lies in the stable and sufficient supply of nitrite and the stimulation of the growth and retention of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob from the perspective of nitrogen transformation the anammox process is primarily associated with two different pathways namely partial nitrification pn oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and partial denitrification pd reduction of nitrate to nitrite chen et al 2021 although the pn anammox system has greater economic viability and environmental sustainability advantages over the pd anammox system the full scale implementation of a mainstream pn anammox system seems to be hindered by the lack of an efficient strategy to suppress the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and maintain a stable nitrite supply castro barros et al 2017 du et al 2019c le et al 2019 liu et al 2020 recently substantial high level accumulation of no2 n has been achieved in the denitrification process with low strength wastewater cao et al 2017 du et al 2019c shi et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 the emerging pd process is considered a relatively reliable bioprocess technology capable of converting nitrate to nitrite in low strength wastewater thus it provides a novel and potential way for the treatment of low strength wastewater based on the anammox process jiang et al 2021 the enrichment and retention of specific functional bacteria including nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob are crucial for the pd anammox system cao et al 2020 biofilm formation is an effective strategy to enhance biomass retention and enrich low growth biomass especially for anaob wang et al 2021 anaob biofilms are usually enriched by in situ and ex situ strategies in situ enrichment of anaob takes a longer time due to their long doubling time in fact previous findings have confirmed that the anoxic zone in wwtps might be the hotspot where the anammox reaction occurs spontaneously and the anoxic carrier biofilms could be enriched with anaob li et al 2019 however for the mainstream process the proportion of anammox process contributed relatively little to the nitrogen loss in wwtps cao et al 2020 wang et al 2015 2021 conversely the ex situ approach which usually involves inoculating mature anammox biofilms to the cultivated pd system might shorten the start up time and even achieved high nitrogen removal efficiency immediately under mainstream conditions mainly through the pd anammox pathway gao et al 2021 li et al 2021 2020a 2020b biofilm matrices are formed largely of extracellular polymeric substances eps which are a complex mixture of interlaced biopolymers secreted by microbial cells including proteins polysaccharides ps nucleic acids etc fish et al 2017 wang et al 2014 eps generally play key functions in maintaining the mechanical stability of microbial aggregates strengthening cells tolerance to desiccation and toxic substances by acting protective barriers preserving the associated enzymes for substrate degradation etc wang et al 2014 2019 notable the constituent and structure of eps depend on many factors including substrate type nutrient content growth phase external conditions etc but especially bacterial species sheng et al 2010 ras et al 2011 2013 also emphasized that eps properties are considered to be closely associated with microbial diversity of biofilms hou et al 2015 reported that there was a significant difference in the hydrophilic functional groups of eps between anammox sludge and nitrifying denitrifying sludge which further affects the hydrophobic interaction and aggregation ability of sludge thus the eps composition of two types of biofilms in the ex situ coupling system might lead to different biofilm responses during the coupling operation due to their significant difference in the microbial community then the community of nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob might undergo reconfiguration and spontaneously reaggregate to form a unique structure based on their metabolic pathway and physiological characteristics in a relatively specific environment since predicting the biofilm response and the change in community structure in the practical application of the pd anammox biofilms system has important guiding significance for the operation and maintenance of engineering systems it is necessary to determine the transformation characteristics of the biofilm microbial communities and gain an in depth insight into the interactions of functional bacteria in hybrid biofilm systems given that our current understanding of these relationships remains limited this study aimed to establish a synergistic pd anammox spda system by inoculating pd and anammox carriers to understand the major mechanisms controlling the interaction between the inoculated anammox and pd biofilms to this end this study performed the following tasks i evaluated the long term nitrogen removal performance and biofilm response ii investigated the transformation mechanisms of nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob in the spda system by activity tests and analysis of eps and key enzymatic activities and iii analyzed variations of microbial communities in both pd and anammox biofilms by illumina miseq sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and carrier inoculation a plexiglass moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr with a working volume of 5 l and equipped with a thruster

demand cod no3 n was maintained at around 1 64 the other components of the synthetic wastewater were l nahco3 0 25 g mgso4 7h2o 0 14 g cacl2 2h2o 0 14 g kh2po4 0 03 g and 1 ml of a mixture of trace elements the mineral medium composition of the mixture of trace elements used in this study is shown in table s1 section 3 of si 2 3 activity test the in situ microbial denitrification and anammox activities in the biofilm were measured on days 0 50 119 161 and 221 for the measurement of the in situ denitrification activity of pd or anammox biofilm after removing the anammox or pd carriers from the reactor at the end of one cycle the pd or anammox carriers were placed in the reactor with synthetic wastewater containing 30 mg no3 n l 1 and 90 mg cod l 1 after purging the reactor with n2 to maintain anoxic conditions samples were taken every 20 120 min the observed specific reaction rate for no3 n reduction rate and no2 n accumulation rate during the measurement of the in situ denitrification activity were denoted as rno3 obs and rno2 obs to measure the pd activity instead for the measurement of the in situ anammox activity in anammox or pd biofilms after removing the pd or anammox carriers from the mbbr the anammox or pd carriers were placed in the reactor with synthetic wastewater containing 25 mg nh4 n l 1 28 65 mg no2 n l 1 and 0 5 g l 1 nahco3 sampling was performed every 1 4 h under anaerobic conditions similarly the in situ anammox activity rnh4 obs mg l d 1 is defined as the observed specific reaction rate for nh4 n consumption rate 2 4 enzyme activity test the appropriate amounts of pd and anammox carriers were randomly selected to measure the enzyme activity after removing the biofilm sample from the carriers the crude enzyme was extracted according to a previous study yu et al 2021a using a jn 02c ultra high pressure continuous flow cell crusher guangzhou juneng nano bio technology co ltd beijing china the supernatant was used as crude enzyme solution to measure protein concentration by a modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 and enzyme activities detailed description given in section 4 of si methyl viologen was used as the electron donor to avoid oxygen inhibition for the test of nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir in a 2 ml system as described by li et al 2016 the system for nar includes 5 4 mm nano3 200 mm methyl viologen 10 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 5 mm nas2o4 and an appropriate amount of enzyme the system for nir includes 1 mm nano2 1 mm methyl viologen 100 mm pbs ph 7 4 5 mm nas2o4 and an appropriate amount of enzyme to simply compare the enzymatic activity of pd and anammox biofilm in the mbbr nar and nir enzyme activities were measured and normalized as μmol no2 n min l 1 the hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh activity was determined according to the method described by shimamura et al 2007 the standard reaction mixture for the determination of hdh activity consisted of 100 mm pbs ph 8 0 50 µm horse heart cytochrome c oxidized form 25 µm hydrazine and an appropriate amount of enzyme solution the reactions were performed in 3 ml cuvettes sealed with butyl rubber stoppers at 35 c under anoxic conditions using argon to purge the oxygen after the reactions the increase in the absorbance of cytochrome c at 550 nm in the standard mixture was compared against that of the control without the enzyme the hdh enzyme activities were expressed as µmol cytochrome c min l 1 2 5 biofilm response 2 5 1 analysis of biofilm characteristics and morphology the biofilm was characterized by measuring the biofilm biomass thickness and density the biofilm thickness were quantified by optical microscopy using a nikon eclipse 50i optical microscope nikon corporation tokyo japan before measurement of thickness 3 randomly harvested biofilm samples were sectioned into 50 µm slices using a leica cm1950 microtome leica wetzlar germany five slices of three replicate carriers were used for thickness analysis followed by 20 25 thickness measurements per slice additionally the dry weight biomass of the biomass was measured using the protocol described by young et al 2017 the density of the biofilm was then determined by the biofilm biomass per volume of the biofilm biofilm volume is expressed as thickness carrier surface area arabgol et al 2022 due to its high resolution scanning electron microscopy sem has been used extensively for qualitative observation of morphology prior to the observation of the biofilm morphology the biofilm sample for sem analysis was subjected to a biofilm dehydration treatment according to a reported method hazrin chong and manefield 2012 the biofilm samples were analyzed a maximum of 4 h after harvesting and sem images were recorded using a jeol jsm 6510lv scanning electron microscope jeol ltd tokyo japan in high vacuum mode at 15 and 25 kv at least five images of four replicate carriers at least 20 total images were analyzed for biofilm morphology the images were taken at random locations across the carrier surface 2 5 2 extraction of eps the variation trends of the total eps content during the coupling process were analyzed by measuring the total eps extracted by the cation exchange resin cer method as described by frølund et al 1996 the total eps extracted was fractionated by chromatography on a non ionic microporous supelitetm dax 8 resin 40 60 mesh column milliporesigma burlington ma usa to analyze the hydrophilic hydrophobic distribution and then divided into hydrophobic acids hoa hydrophobic bases hob hydrophobic neutral substances hon and hydrophilic substances his wang et al 2014 the hydrophobic substance content was considered as the sum of the contents of hoa hob and hon the concrete operating procedures were as reported by shen et al 2010 a detailed description is given in section 5 of si the tightly bound eps t eps loosely bound eps l eps and soluble eps s eps are the sub fractions of eps which have been shown to play different roles in microbial aggregates the determination of the compositions of these sub fractions of eps could be useful to differentiate hybrid biofilms according to the binding compactness between bacteria a heat extraction method was used to divide the eps into s eps l eps and t eps du et al 2019a all the eps extracts were analyzed for the content of proteins ps and dna the ps content was detected by the anthrone method using glucose as the standard the proteins content was detected by the lowry method using bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard the dna content was determined by the diphenylamine colorimetric method chen et al 2013 2 6 other analytical methods 2 6 1 chemical analysis the no3 n nh4 n and no2 n contents were measured according to a standard method apha 2012 the cod ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a hach drb 200 portable cod measuring instrument hach company loveland co usa a leici phs 3c desktop precision ph meter shanghai leici instruments co ltd shanghai china and a mettler toledo seven2gos9 do meter mettler toledo schweiz gmbh greifensee switzerland respectively the correlations were determined by pearson s correlation analysis and a p value of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant 2 6 2 calculations without considering the consumption for microbial synthesis the anammox and full denitrification fd were the two main nitrogen removal pathways in the spda system the ntr was calculated using eq 1 and the nitrogen removal contribution of anammox and full denitrification pathway was calculated using eqs 2 and 3 du et al 2019a respectively 1 ntr no 2 n eff 1 32 nh 4 n inf nh 4 n eff no 3 n inf 0 26 nh 4 n inf nh 4 n eff no 3 n eff 2 anammox 1 1 32

respectively no3 neff no2 neff and nh4 neff are the effluent no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations respectively tninf and tneff were the total nitrogen tn concentration in the influent and effluent respectively since there was little organic nitrogen in the synthetic wastewater the tn concentration was calculated as the sum of the inorganic nitrogen concentration of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n 2 7 illumina miseq sequencing analysis the biofilm samples which were collected from the spda system on days 0 50 119 161 and 221 were analyzed by illumina miseq sequencing allwegene technology inc beijing china to determine the microbial community compositions the v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified using primers with the sequences 515a gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa and 806 ggactachvggtwtctaat the sequencing methods used were based on those described by li fang et al 2021 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the spda system was operated for 260 days during a long term operation fig 1 the operation process of the mbbr was divided into two stages according to the reactor performance namely the adaptation stage days 1 50 and the stable stage days 51 260 during the adaptation stage fig 1a the effluent no3 n concentration rapidly decreased from 11 16 mg l 1 on day 1 to 1 13 mg l 1 on day 50 and the no3 n removal efficiency gradually increased from about 32 to 96 indicating that pd biofilms in the coupled spda system still had sufficient pd activity to convert no3 n into no2 n for the metabolism of anammox correspondingly the effluent nh4 n concentration rapidly decreased from 11 9 to 4 31 mg l 1 with a removal efficiency of 92 87 day 50 these results indicated that the inoculated pd and anammox biofilms in the coupling system could immediately work together and achieve nitrogen removal during the stable stage days 51 260 the effluent no3 n concentration remained at about 0 67 mg l 1 with an average removal efficiency of 97 the effluent cod concentration was 21 38 0 53 mg l 1 with an average cod removal efficiency of 76 24 0 58 meanwhile the no2 n produced by the pd process was almost consumed through the anammox process with an average effluent no2 n concentration of 0 93 mg l 1 fig 1a and the effluent concentration of nh4 n continued to decrease from 4 31 mg l 1 day 50 to about 2 08 mg l 1 day 260 with an average removal efficiency of 91 fig 1b these findings suggest that in the spda system the anaob could adapt to lower substrate concentration with the increase of the operation time the ntr in the spda system was maintained above 70 from days 51 260 fig 2 a and the removal efficiency of tn reached 93 fig 1c these results revealed that the denitrifiers that brought about nitrite accumulation with a relatively high ntr were able to accumulate sufficient no2 n and effectively cooperate with anaob thus the spda system could successfully achieve efficient removal of nh4 n and no3 n in the long term operation the nitrogen removal contribution of the two main nitrogen removal pathways namely the anammox and full denitrification pathways is shown in fig 1d during the operation time the contribution of the anammox pathway to tn removal in the spda system gradually increased the contribution of the anammox pathway was maintained at 74 31 4 29 and could even reach its maximum at 84 on day 195 while that of the full denitrification pathway was only maintained at 12 53 3 25 these findings indicated that the anammox pathway was the dominant pathway in tn removal and the synergy of the pd and anammox pathways to simultaneously treat the nh4 n and no3 n in synthetic wastewater was feasible in the spda system 3 2 in situ microbial activity and key enzymatic activities 3 2 1 in situ pd activity and nar nir activities the variation of the in situ pd activity shown in fig 2a revealed that the total in situ pd activity tended to increase in particular the total rno3 obs gradually increased from 521 14 5 30 mg l d 1 on day 0 to 682 61 4 86 mg l d 1 on day 221 and the total rno2 obs increased from 486 14 3 04 mg l d 1 to 605 63 5 24 mg l d 1 during the same period thus the spda system showed an excellent performance in no2 n accumulation during its operation and the operation of the coupled system could partially enhance the ability of the pd process the high total in situ pd activity was conducive to the stability of the spda system it is important to note that the in situ pd activity in pd biofilms showed a decreasing tendency throughout the experiment fig 2a on day 0 the rno3 obs and rno2 obs were 521 14 5 30 and 486 14 3 04 mg l d 1 respectively the ratio of rno3 obs to rno2 obs was 0 93 which was close to the theoretical value of 1 0 indicating that the pd biofilms had high in situ pd activity before coupling after 221 days of operation the rno3 obs contribution rate of pd biofilms decreased from 100 to 41 79 0 57 and that of rno2 obs decreased from 100 to 41 22 0 49 however between days 161 221 the in situ pd activity in pd biofilms tended to be stable the rno3 obs and rno2 obs were maintained at 281 36 3 01 and 244 87 5 00 mg l d 1 respectively indicating that the pd biofilms could reach a relatively stable state after long term operation in the spda system similarly the in situ pd activity in anammox biofilms gradually increased during the 221 days of operation the rno3 obs contribution rate of anammox biofilms increased from 0 to 58 21 0 43 and that of rno2 obs increased from 0 to 58 78 0 51 indicating that a certain amount of denitrifying microorganisms bringing about nitrate reduction indeed appeared in the anammox biofilms after coupling the variation of nar and nir activities in pd and anammox biofilms is shown in fig 2b the total nar activity increased from 57 13 1 02 to 129 79 2 58 μmol min l 1 and only a little nir activity was detected the promotion level of nir was lower than that of nar throughout the whole operation resulting in the ability of the pd biofilm to transform more nitrate with nitrite as the end product meanwhile the nar activity in pd biofilms could reach 52 25 0 64 μmol min l 1 before coupling and gradually decreased to 44 87 1 21 μmol min l 1 on day 221 in contrast the nar activity of anammox biofilms gradually increased from 4 87 0 38 μmol min l 1 on day 0 to 94 91 1 37 μmol min l 1 on day 221 which is consistent with the changing trends of the in situ pd activity in the anammox and pd biofilms as shown in fig 2a 3 2 2 in situ anammox activity and hdh activities the variation of rnh4 obs in anammox and pd biofilms shown in fig 3 a clearly reveals that total rnh4 obs gradually decreased from 174 38 4 39 mg l d 1 day 0 to 38 81 1 46 mg l d 1 day 119 and then recovered somewhat to 66 66 4 76 mg l d 1 days 161 221 similarly the total hdh activity decreased from 2 76 0 14 μmol min l 1 day 0 to 1 46 0 12 μmol min l 1 day 119 and then completely recovered to 2 70 0 13 μmol min l 1 days 161 221 as shown in fig 3b these findings indicated that anaob could gradually adapt to the new operating conditions after long term operation of the spda system in addition the rnh4 obs in anammox biofilms in the stable stage days 161 221 was 57 74 1 94 mg l d 1 with a contribution to the total rnh4 obs of 86 64 0 41 but that in pd biofilms was 8 91 2 81 mg l d 1 with a contribution of only 13 36 0 59 moreover compared with that in anammox biofilms the hdh activity in pd biofilms was almost negligible this is indicating that the anammox process before and after coupling always occurred in the anammox biofilm but not in the pd biofilm 3 3 biofilm response 3 3 1 biofilm characteristics biofilm characteristics such as biomass thickness and density were quantified for pd and anammox carriers to investigate the biofilm response before and after coupling fig 4 in the spda system the thickness biomass and density of pd biofilms showed a decreasing tendency after coupling decreasing by 14 7 24 1 and 11 01 respectively in contrast those of anammox biofilms increased by 22 78 42 64 and 16 17 respectively the calculated densities of pd biofilm before after coupling were 59 36 2 04 and 52 82 12 54 kg m 3 while those of anammox biofilms were 96 97 6 11 and 112 66 10 78 kg m 3 respectively it is evident that the pd biofilm was always looser than anammox biofilms and the density difference between pd biofilms and anammox biofilms after coupling was gradually increased a similar phenomenon occurred in the biofilm morphology fig s2 the results of sem imaging showed that compared with the anammox biofilms pd biofilms after coupling became looser and a significant number of pores and channels appeared the small upper left image in fig s2b consistent with the changes in biofilm density fig 4 3 3 2 total eps content and hydrophobicity of eps the measurement of the total eps contents in pd and anammox biofilms revealed that the average total eps content in pd biofilms was 95 74 2 07 mg g vss 1 fig 5 a and that in anammox biofilms was 114 98 2 36 mg g vss 1 fig 5b a comparison of the composition of eps in the pd and anammox biofilms clearly showed that there was almost no difference between ps and dna components but the protein content was higher in the total eps in anammox biofilms in particular the protein content in anammox biofilms 71 33 1 25 mg g vss 1 was 61 7 higher than that in pd biofilms 44 12 1 02 mg g vss 1 the proportions of hydrophobic substances in pd and anammox biofilms fig 6 revealed that before coupling these proportions were about 74 64 and 79 96 in pd and anammox biofilms respectively this indicates that both biofilms had excellent hydrophobicity which contributed to biomass aggregation different from the hydrophobic substances before coupling the proportion of hydrophobic substances in pd biofilms after coupling decreased from 74 64 day 0 to 66 56 day 221 but that in anammox biofilms increased from 79 96 day 0 to 89 02 day 221 due to the change in the hob percentage the results showed that the hob in pd biofilms was reduced by almost half from 23 on day 0 to 11 on day 221 in contrast the hob in anammox biofilms was increased 3 3 3 sub fractions of eps the percentages of each sub fractions of eps extracted from pd and anammox biofilms before coupling day 0 and after coupling for 221 days of operation day 221 are shown in fig 7 among the sub fractions of eps extracted from each sample the t eps was the highest followed by the l eps and the s eps was the lowest after coupling the s eps decreased by 20 25 in both pd and anammox biofilms compared with the data before coupling but the variation of l eps and t eps components variation in pd and anammox biofilms were different there was almost no change in the fraction of t eps in pd biofilms but the fraction of l eps increased by 12 9 after coupling meanwhile the fraction of l eps in anammox biofilms was little changed but the fraction of t eps after coupling increased by 13 fig 7a in addition the contributions of proteins ps and dna to the s eps l eps and t eps are calculated in fig 7b among all sub fractions in pd and anammox biofilms the contribution of proteins was the highest followed by ps and dna was the lowest after coupling the contribution of proteins decreased and that of ps increased in the s eps in both pd and anammox biofilms for the t eps there was almost no change in their composition in the pd biofilms while the fraction of proteins significantly increased by 12 20 and that of ps decreased by 13 34 in the anammox biofilms for the l eps there was almost no change in their composition in anammox biofilms while the fraction of proteins decreased by 3 02 and that of ps noticeably increased by 8 23 in pd biofilms 3 4 microbial community analysis the phylum level identification of the bacterial communities in pd biofilms is shown in fig 8 a members of the phylum proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial species in the five samples representing up to 54 72 of the microbial communities throughout the entire experiment other major phyla present were planctomycetota bacteroidota and acidobacteriota all of which are commonly found in wastewater treatment bioreactors chu et al 2021 du et al 2019b han et al 2021 noteworthy a slight increase was observed in the number of planctomycetota but it was still much lower than that of proteobacteria according to the statistics at the genus level in pd biofilms shown in fig 8b thauera was the dominant genus of bacteria in the high scale of the phylum proteobacteria in pd biofilms which was believed to be responsible for the high no2 n accumulation performance in pd biofilms the results revealed that the relative abundance of thauera species was about 37 22 20 84 from days 0 221 which was highly correlated with in situ pd activity in pd biofilms r 0 97 p 0 05 this showed that the downward trend of thauera could lead to a reduction in the no2 n accumulation in pd biofilms meanwhile the abundance of candidatus brocadia the dominant anaob in pd biofilms only increased from 0 on day 0 to 1 40 on day 119 and then rapidly increased up to 6 22 on day 221 indicating that there are indeed some anaob that could grow in pd biofilms the major bacterial phyla in anammox biofilms are shown in fig 8c of which planctomycetota proteobacteria and bacteroidota were the top three most abundant bacterial phyla the abundance of planctomycetota was 38 29 from days 0 221 and was highly correlated with rnh4 obs in anammox biofilms r 0 91 p 0 05 meanwhile proteobacteria gradually increased from 21 03 day 0 to 40 38 day 221 and became the dominant microbial communities after coupling the abundance of proteobacteria was highly correlated with in situ pd activity in anammox biofilms r 0 95 p 0 05 indicating that a considerable number of denitrifiers immigrated to anammox biofilms according to the statistics at the genus level in anammox biofilms shown in fig 8d among the detected anaob ca brocadia was the dominant anaob throughout during the coupling operation the abundance of ca brocadia from days 0 119 gradually decreased followed by a subsequent increase from days 119 221 and eventually was maintained at a relatively high level 33 54 22 41 also the abundance of ca brocadia was highly correlated with rnh4 obs in anammox biofilms r 0 82 p 0 05 indicating that the rnh4 obs could eventually be maintained stably in the spda system fig 3a meanwhile the abundance of thauera was up to 10 69 on day 50 and then gradually increased until 16 45 on day 221 which was also highly correlated with in situ pd activity in anammox biofilms r 0 98 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 the microbial immigration from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms in this study the results of the activity tests and enzyme activity measurements fig 2 showed that the established coupled spda system had an excellent performance in no2 n accumulation and its ability of partial denitrification after coupling was enhanced to some extent however both the in situ pd activity and nar activity in pd biofilms showed a decreasing tendency which is opposite to the tendency of the total in situ pd activity and nar activity in the spda system indicating that the detachment and immigration of the nitrate reducing bacteria might occur in the pd biofilms comparing the trends of the in situ pd activity and nar activity observed in pd and anammox biofilms fig 2 it can be inferred that the detached nitrate reducing bacteria from pd biofilms tended to immigrate to anammox biofilms which resulted in the different trends of in situ pd activity and nar activity observed in anammox and pd biofilms these phenomena were also observed in other studies for instance li et al 2020a and gao et al 2021 all confirmed that the denitrifying bacteria could grow in anammox biofilms and enhance the stability of nitrogen removal during the operation time however the rnh4 obs and hdh activity were mainly observed in anammox biofilms throughout the operation of the system fig 3 similarly compared with their contribution in anammox biofilms 86 64 0 41 and 95 22 0 74 respectively the rnh4 obs and hdh activity in pd biofilm were relatively low 13 36 0 59 and 4 78 0 26 respectively these findings showed that even if a small amount of anaob detached from the anammox biofilms it was relatively difficult to grow in pd biofilms according to the results of the illumina miseq sequencing analysis fig 8 the increasing abundance of thauera in anammox biofilms indicated that thauera could co exist with anaob provided stable nitrite for the anammox process prevented the anaob from being inhibited by lack of electron acceptor and contributed to nitrogen removal in the spda system du et al 2019b noteworthy the abundance of thauera in anammox biofilms increased rapidly from 0 78 on day 0 to 10 69 on day 50 and ultimately reached 16 45 on day 221 fig 8 which were much greater than the abundance of thauera 0 81 4 42 in anammox biofilms of the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactor with similar operating conditions yu et al 2022 likewise the increase in relative abundance of thauera in mbbr system was also much faster than the proliferation of thauera in the stable pd anammox ifas system in other studies e g 0 25 for over 300 days li et al 2020a and 8 for 190 days wang et al 2020 this indicated that the immigration of thauera from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms in the hybrid biofilm system was dominant in the anammox biofilm especially in the earlier phase days 0 50 but not the growth and proliferation of thauera in anammox biofilms meanwhile the immigration of ca brocadia from anammox biofilms to pd biofilms was much less than that of thauera from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms section 3 4 these results further confirmed the immigration trend in the spda system indicating that the nitrate reducing bacteria in pd biofilms especially thauera tend to immigrate to anammox biofilms considering that the abundance of anaob slowly increased from 0 on day 0 to 1 40 on day 119 and eventually reached 6 22 on day 221 which was likely due to the growth and proliferation of anaob on pd biofilms as a result of the slow growing anaob the immigration of anaob in anammox biofilms to pd biofilms is almost negligible 4 2 potential mechanisms of microbial immigration in the spda biofilm system eps are conducive to the adherence of microorganisms to the carrier surface and the adhesion between microorganisms wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a in this study the content ratio of ps to total eps in pd biofilms before coupling was relatively higher than that in anammox biofilms fig 5 some ps such as acetylated ps form hydrophobic pockets and provide additional capacities for london dispersion forces mayer et al 1999 which might affect the mechanical stability of biofilms moreover ps were susceptible to degradation by extracellular enzymes which would cause the release of biofilm bacteria and the spread of the organisms to new environments boyd and chakrabarty 1994 salama et al 2016 xun et al 1990 thus the relatively high levels of ps in pd biofilms might result in the detachment and immigration of nitrate reducing bacteria fig 5a however the content ratio of proteins to total eps in anammox biofilms before coupling was relatively higher than that in pd biofilms fig 5 proteins which could directly or indirectly connect ps through a multivalent cation bridge to form the three dimensional structure of a biofilm salama et al 2016 play a key role in the aggregation of bacteria increase cell density and reinforce intercellular interactions in biofilms zhang et al 2019 in this study the abundance of proteins in anammox biofilms fig 5b indicated that the anammox biofilms had a more compact biofilm structure and functional bacteria such as anaob were relatively difficult to detach from the anammox biofilms figs 4 and s2c d as a result the relatively loose structure of pd biofilms fig s2b and the relatively compact structure of anammox biofilms fig s2d might promote the detachment of nitrate reducing bacteria closely joined in anammox biofilms as revealed by the sub fractions of eps there are significant differences between pd biofilms and anammox biofilms in the variation of components of the l eps and t eps fig 7 this finding indicates that both pd and anammox biofilms will require their respective strategies to achieve a more harmonious coexistence of functional microorganisms between ca brocadia and thauera in the spda systems in order to maximize the total activity of pd and anammox the existing microbial community would regulate the metabolic pathway of the production of eps in response to changes in environmental conditions liu et al 2004 accordingly we assumed that the biofilms grown in the hybrid system would undertake to arrange the internal architecture of eps according to the environmental conditions and mediate the nutrient transport rate or the mechanical pliability needed to trap bacteria this study clearly revealed that pd and anammox biofilms might have different eps mediated mechanisms after coupling as shown in fig 9 for the fast growing denitrifiers fig 9 the microbiological activity seems to be more dependent on the nutrient transport rate i e mass transfer more ps in pd biofilm were excreted to form l eps but protein content was decreased after coupling figs 5 and 7 this study revealed that the decrease of protein content in l eps and s eps might be due to the hydrolysis of proteins or the loss of extracellular enzymes higgins and novak 1997 fig 7 in order to reduce the loss of proteins and enhance the thermostability and resistance to proteolysis more ps are released which could interact with the enzymes yu 2020 the increasing content of ps which generally contain plenty of hydrophilic components is consistent with the decreasing fractions of hob of the eps in pd biofilms fig 6 the increase in the hydrophilicity of pd biofilms might lead to the looser structure of pd biofilms and increase their nutrient transport efficiency at the expense of its ability to harbor the nitrate reducing bacteria schopf et al 2021 wäsche et al 2000 young et al 2016 these phenomena might induce the detachment of the nitrate reducing bacteria and then reduce the in situ pd activity in pd biofilms meanwhile for the slow growing anaob fig 9 the anammox activity is highly dependent on the bacteria density and the high cell density could lead to a high activity and growth rate hou et al 2015 as a result the anammox biofilms tend to secrete proteins to form more t eps fig 7 in fact it has been reported that the increase in protein content was important for the macroscopic biofilm structure and might cause a change in the detachment or sloughing behavior nielsen et al 1997 the amino and carboxyl groups in proteins can stimulate microbial aggregation by promoting the formation of hydrogen bonds wang et al 2014 in the analysis of the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity distribution fig 6 the increasing fractions of hob of the eps in anammox biofilms such as proteins with basic amino acids which is consistent with the increase in protein content the increase of t eps and hob generally plays a key role in the hydrophobicity of biofilms cell aggregation and dense biofilm formation du et al 2019a to increase its mechanical strength to harbor anaob therefore the enhanced retention ability of anaob in anammox biofilms might maintain the appropriate rnh4 and contribute to the relatively long age sludge retention time srt of anaob but at the expense of the nutrient transfer rate to deeper layers consequently some nitrate reducing bacteria are released from pd biofilms which are lost with the effluent or re attached to the surface of biofilms meanwhile the high t eps concentration of anammox biofilms could provide cells and trigger these released cells to search for more favorable environments or better access to local nutrients in the anammox biofilms ultimately the coupling system with nitrate reducing bacteria and anaob could form a new biofilm structure 5 conclusion 1 the efficient synergy of pd and anammox biofilms in an mbbr has been confirmed for simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal with a high tn removal efficiency of 93 at 25 1 c and the anammox pathway was determined to be the dominant nitrogen removal pathway 2 microbial immigration was observed in the hybrid spda system nitrate reducing bacteria that immigrated from pd biofilms to anammox biofilms were more noticeable than those anaob that immigrated from anammox biofilms to pd biofilms resulting in the appearance of in situ pd activity and nar activity in anammox biofilms the genus thauera was the second most dominant bacteria after the genus ca brocadia in anammox biofilms 3 pd and anammox biofilms might have different eps mediated mechanisms for the fast growing denitrifiers pd biofilms tended to increase the ability of mass transfer by excreting more ps to form l eps at the expense of the ability to harbor the nitrate reducing bacteria however for the slow growing anaob the anammox biofilms tended to increase the retention of anaob by excreting more proteins to form enhanced t eps at the expense of the mass transfer ability thereby inducing the detached nitrate reducing bacteria to immigrate to anammox biofilms declaration of competing interest the authors

15193,aquatic fate models and risk assessment require experimental information on the potential of contaminants to interact with riverine suspended particulate matter spm while for dissolved contaminants partition or sorption coefficients are used the underlying assumption of chemical equilibrium is invalid for particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials incidental nanoparticles micro or nanoplastics their interactions with spm are governed by physicochemical forces between contaminant particle and spm surfaces the availability of a standard spm material is thus highly relevant for the development of reproducible test systems to evaluate the fate of particulate contaminants in aquatic systems finding suitable spm analogues however is challenging considering the complex composition of natural spm which features floc like structures comprising minerals and organic components from the molecular to the microorganism level complex composition comes with a heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties that cannot be neglected we developed a procedure to generate spm analogue flocs from components selected to represent the most abundant and crucial constituents of natural riverine spm and the process relevant spm surface characteristics regarding interactions with particulate contaminants four components i e illite hematite quartz and tryptophan combined at environmentally realistic mass ratios were associated to complex flocs flocculation was reproducible regarding floc size and fractal dimension and multiple tests on floc resilience towards

available on request 1 introduction river systems are among the major contaminant receiving waters and constitute potential long range environmental transport routes contaminant transport and fate depend on their interactions with natural materials which are present in all forms from truly dissolved through colloidal and suspended particulate matter to bed load and bottom sediments within this continuum of matter a crucial role can be attributed to suspended particulate matter spm because 1 spm is in constant exchange with all other phases through adsorption desorption attachment detachment de agglomeration flocculation rupture and sedimentation resuspension 2 spm is mobile and links the pelagic and benthic zones by sedimentation and resuspension rivers to lakes and oceans by advective transport and terrestrial to aquatic environments via erosion and runoff or flooding and 3 spm provides habitat and feed to aquatic organisms walch et al 2022 the affinity of contaminants for spm depends on both their respective properties and governs their transport behavior bioavailability uptake and fate geitner et al 2016 hofmann and von der kammer 2009 schulze et al 2015 a quantification of contaminant spm interactions is needed for exposure assessment in the framework of environmental risk assessment for dissolved contaminants classical solid liquid partition coefficients k d can be employed to describe the affinity of a contaminant for water versus solid phases over the past decades however particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials micro or nanoplastics received increased attention and chemical legislation e g reach tsca requiring environmental risk assessment is adapted to cover these contaminants this has triggered scientific debate about suitable fate descriptors for particulate contaminants dale et al 2015 praetorius et al 2014b svendsen et al 2020 westerhoff and nowack 2013 praetorius et al 2014 emphasized that partition coefficients cannot be employed for particulate contaminants as the underlying thermodynamic equilibrium assumption is only applicable for dissolved substances consequently calls for harmonized testing protocols specific to particulate contaminants baun et al 2017 stone et al 2010 can only be responded to while accounting for the process relevant interaction mechanisms interactions between particulate contaminants and spm i e heteroagglomeration are kinetically driven praetorius et al 2014b and governed by short range physicochemical surface interactions as depicted in fig 1 interaction forces mainly electrostatic hydrophobic and van der waals forces or nom interactions arise from the interplay of intrinsic material properties of both particulate contaminants and spm and hydrochemical conditions mainly ph electrolytes and nom natural organic matter elimelech et al 1995 gregory 2005 the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors cannot be easily disentangled especially regarding more complex multi component systems praetorius et al 2020 consequently protocols to test particulate contaminants affinity for spm require accounting for both the process relevant physicochemical surface properties of natural spm and the relevant hydrochemical conditions freshwater hydrochemical conditions were recently operationalized within the oecd test guideline no 318 dispersion stability of nanomaterials in simulated environmental media oecd 2017 and the rationale beyond the selected hydrochemical test parameter ranges abdolahpur monikh et al 2018 is directly applicable to heteroagglomeration hence the selection of suitable counterparts for heteroagglomeration ideally spm analogues which represent the agglomeration relevant natural properties remains one major gap to fill praetorius et al 2020 achieving this task is hampered by the complexity and spatiotemporal variability of natural riverine spm walch et al 2022 spm is operationally defined and comprises any materials that do not sediment under the given hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions and get retained by 0 45 or 0 22 µm filtration membranes eisma 1993 spm typically exhibits agglomerate or floc like structures integrating minerals and organic components from molecules via detritus up to microorganisms of alloch and autochthonous origins droppo 2001 henning et al 2001 zimmermann timm 2002 with each component contributing distinct physicochemical surface properties to a floc walch et al 2022 most heteroagglomeration studies either employed simple mineral spm surrogates e g gallego urrea et al 2016 labille et al 2015 oriekhova and stoll 2018 praetorius et al 2014a yu et al 2021 zhou et al 2012 or natural water samples e g quik et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 adam et al 2016 li et al 2019 surette and nason 2019 but neither meet the need for environmentally relevant and yet standardizable test conditions simple minerals do not reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of natural spm while natural samples do not allow for reproducibility since the properties of natural spm are specific to a certain sampling location and time so far the only publication reporting near natural spm is slomberg et al 2016 who tried to assemble spm analogues based on the mineralogical composition of spm from the rhône catchment however they included only major negatively charged mineral fractions neglecting minor but functionally important components such as positively charged oxide and oxy hydroxide minerals or microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps walch et al 2022 standardization requires simplification but a valid model test system needs to cover the most relevant factors which control the process under observation hence we took a conceptual approach to select key components for the generation of complex spm analogue flocs developed a simple protocol for their association and finally evaluated their robustness and handling in the laboratory the detailed rationale beyond component selection is given in the conceptual framework supporting information s1 briefly we aimed at tailoring spm analogues that represent those characteristics of natural riverine spm which are most relevant for heteroagglomeration analogues should reflect the complex composition structure of natural spm as well as its heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties while comprising only few components to allow for reproducible generation our component selection is based on an extensive literature review walch et al 2022 looking at the mineralogical and organic composition of natural riverine spm and crucial components governing the dynamics of spm formation selected minerals comprise illite quartz and hematite and the amino acid tryptophan was chosen as a proxy substance to mimic some properties of microbial eps based on screening tests s2 illite and quartz are representatives for the most abundant mineral constituents of natural riverine spm and hematite for minor but functionally important iron oxide and oxy hydroxide minerals feox similarly microbial eps are mostly less abundant in spm than refractory humic like substances but due to their heterogeneous properties eps are considered more relevant for flocculation being combined in realistic mass ratios the selected components not only reflect the composition of natural spm but also add to an increased heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties which is probably the most relevant feature of natural spm when it comes to interactions with particulate contaminants the aim of this study was to develop and test reproducible spm analogue flocs we show that using illite quartz hematite and tryptophan in realistic mass ratios it is possible to generate complex spm analogues which are consistent regarding floc size and fractal dimension and exhibit the desired robustness towards physical impacts and hydrochemical changes to allow proper handling in experimental setups 2

zetasizer nano zs malvern before use hematite suspensions were stable for 6 months figure s3 1 illite and quartz can be stored for at least one year with quartz requiring 15 20 min ultrasonic probe sonication before use after resting for more than a few days organic stocks were replaced every two months 2 3 spm analogue generation for spm analogue flocculation and characterization a batch setup consisting of two stirred batch reactors connected to a laser diffractometer mastersizer 2000 malvern was designed where the sample was passed through the measurement cell in freefall 6 ml s 1 to avoid any change in floc size or fractal dimension with a peristaltic pump closing the circuit between the two batch reactors s4 a spm analogue composition table 1 was based on typical riverine spm compositions see s1 and walch et al 2022 and screening tests s2 and refined within the mastersizer setup s4 b starting from quartz and illite in ultrapure water at ph 5 to maintain the positive surface charge of hematite upon addition dilutions of hematite tryptophan electrolyte and sr nom stocks were quickly added 15 s in this sequence to both stirred batches simultaneously establishing the spm component concentrations given in table 1 as well as the targeted hydrochemical background concentrations in a final volume of 800 ml for each batch for details see s4 c two procedures to generate spm analogues were followed 1 association procedure preparation directly in the two stirred batches connected to the mastersizer where circulation through the system and measurement of the sample were started right before the addition of hematite tryptophan electrolytes and sr nom which allowed investigating the flocculation process 2 shaker equilibration components were added into two magnetically stirred bottles 1 l centrifuge bottles heraeus and then left on an overhead shaker for 1 24 h 16 rpm reax 20 heidolph before introducing the suspension into the mastersizer setup for characterization 2 4 spm analogue protocol validation hydrochemical conditions employed for protocol validation were 0 1 mm electrolytes at ph 5 without sr nom addition for reasoning see s5 a the association procedure was repeated 4 times using the same component stocks for within batch reproducibility and 3 times employing different component stock batches for between batches reproducibility the shaker equilibration was validated only within batch 4 replicates to test storability spm was prepared by shaker equilibration shaken for 1 h and stored in the dark fridge at 4 c three batches were repeatedly resuspended at increasing time intervals 1 h 1 4 8 20 and 48 d by three different means overhead shaking 1 h 16 rpm reax 20 heidolph ultrasonic bath sonication 20 min and ultrasonic probe sonication 10 min 40 w tt13 tip sonoplus 3200 bandelin applied to each storage bottle containing 800 ml four additional parallel batches were resuspended by overhead shaking after 0 5 9 and 15 days of storage respectively to investigate storability without interim resuspension robustness towards changes in spm concentration and stirring speed was tested by halving the concentration from 45 to 22 5 ppm and by varying the stirring speed between 50 100 and 150 rpm both during spm association and after storage and resuspension spm analogue reproducibility storability and robustness were evaluated regarding stability and resilience of floc size and fractal dimension by means of laser diffractometry mastersizer 2000 malvern the fractal dimension describes the structural compactness of an agglomerate and takes values between 1 and 3 with 3 describing a solid sphere we employ the fractal dimension for relative comparisons absolute values might differ as a mix of minerals at different concentrations with different refractive indices particle sizes and shapes is considered and all these properties impact the light scattering behavior volume based median diameters dv0 5 and mass fractal dimensions df were recorded and plotted in a time resolved manner volume based size distributions and mode diameters mode dv were employed to compare samples at a specific time point details are given in s5 b additionally spm analogue floc morphology was investigated by sem imaging as described in s3 c 2 5 spm analogues in changing hydrochemistry the formation of spm analogues in varying hydrochemical backgrounds was evaluated regarding floc size and fractal dimension in the mastersizer setup after overnight shaker equilibration electrolyte 0 1 1 10 mm and sr nom concentrations 0 0 1 1 10 ppmc were varied at ph 5 and zeta potentials were measured according to s3 c the impact of ph values 5 7 8 5 was investigated in batches prepared at 0 1 mm electrolytes without any sr nom and at 10 mm with 1 ppmc sr nom adjustments of ph were done during spm preparation before overnight shaking and continuously during measurement to evaluate whether flocs keep their integrity when hydrochemistry is changed after floc formation and may be transferred into different hydrochemistries spm was generated at ph 5 without any electrolytes or sr nom added spmzero after association the hydrochemistry was adjusted by adding diluted electrolyte and sr nom stocks to reach a hydrochemical background of 0 1 mm and 1 ppmc while halving the spm concentration to 22 5 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 complex near natural spm analogue flocs can be reproducibly prepared flocs formed within minutes with diameters consistently around 7 µm and fractal dimensions slightly above 2 5 signals in the size range of the individual components were not recorded by the mastersizer 2000 the generated flocs can be considered primary flocs characterized by rather small floc sizes and compact structures indicated by high fractal dimensions primary flocs constitute base units that can assemble to larger more loose secondary flocs increasingly colonized by microorganisms within a recent floc structure hierarchy spencer et al 2021 microflocs and particle particle associations flocculi would be the corresponding classes considering structural floc dynamics throughout the year zimmermann timm 2002 type 3 densely packed mineral particles and detritus 150 µm often spherical which is typical in winter autumn and during flood would correspond the individual component preparations were highly consistent table s3 1 meeting the criteria to allow a reproducible spm analogue generation which was confirmed regarding floc size and fractal dimension whether the same figure s6 1 or different component batches fig 2 were employed after an initial floc association phase the diameter and fractal dimension reached an interim plateau size distributions were stable during that time narrow and consistent between replicates fig 2b figure s6 1 b the relative standard deviations rsds of the volume based mode diameters mode dv compared after 1 h were 4 8 mode dv 7 3 µm n 4 and 6 7 mode dv 7 9 µm n 3 for within batch and between batches replicates see 2 4 respectively the size of the flocs falls within the range of natural riverine floc sizes covering 1 to 1000 µm zimmermann timm 2002 with typical values from few µm up to few hundred µm guo and he 2011 lartiges et al 2001 woodward and walling 2007 fractal dimensions exhibited values within the predetermined range for shear flow i e 2 4 conchuir et al 2014 with rsds of 0 9 df 2 56 n 4 within batch and 5 1 df 2 7 n 3 between batches these quite high fractal dimensions partly result from the way laser scattering data were fit see s5 b however the optimization of the floc composition to yield stable robust flocs probably also entailed compact structures spm analogue preparation by 24 h shaker equilibration was also well reproducible fig 3 a exhibiting within batch rsds n 4 compared at 60 min of 11 1 and 1 4 for size mode dv 6 6 µm and fractal dimension df 2 65 respectively both parameters were similar to freshly associated flocs compared at 60 min fig 3b for size distributions see figure s6 2 sem images fig 4 a show complex spm analogue floc structures that incorporate all constituents generating heterogeneous surfaces images resemble those of natural spm buffle et al 1998 le meur et al 2016 slomberg et al 2016 wheatland et al 2017 with hematite being the smallest and quartz the largest component fig 4b their relative sizes reflect trends observed for natural spm where quartz shares increase in the larger size fraction and feox mainly form nanoparticles or patchy coatings on larger particles walch et al 2022 as expected from the positive surface charge of hematite figure s3 2 in the given hydrochemistry ph 5 0 1 mm electrolytes no sr nom sem images show hematite to act as bridging agent between illite and quartz figure s6 3 hematite mainly distributes on the negative edges of illite figure s6 4 where it is likely associated with tryptophan as nom feox associations seaming clay edges have been previously reported poulton and raiswell 2005 quartz mostly distributes on the floc surface while the core is composed of illite hematite associations figure s6 5 this reflects modeling results frungieri et al 2020 which showed that agglomeration of imbalanced mixtures of positively and negatively charged particles depleted minority particles first while majority particles cover the agglomerate surface in our case positive surface charges on hematite and illite edges represent the minority and negative charges on quartz and illite basal planes the majority as confirmed by an overall negative floc zeta potential of 18 1 2 mv 3 2 floc size evolution is controlled by particle concentration and stirring speed floc association and size evolution proceeds in three phases 1 quick diffusion limited association governed by electrostatic forces 2 a shear and concentration dependent restructuring and compaction phase 3 further floc growth approaching a flocculation rupture regime initial association is fueled by a high primary particle number allowing for a high collision frequency due to opposite charges of the components figure s3 2 in the present hydrochemistry ph 5 0 1 mm electrolytes association is probably diffusion limited attachment efficiency α 1 and attachment governed by electrostatic attractions neutralization of negative charges on illite and quartz by addition of positive hematite ca2 and mg2 the dominance of electrochemical mechanisms in primary floc formation was also inferred from 3d structural observations of natural flocs spencer et al 2021 collision dependance is confirmed by a slower and slightly retarded association at halved concentrations fig 5 a lower stirring should also reduce collisions but had little impact on the early association phase this is because the collision rate is proportional to the concentration squared while proportional to the mean shear rate tran et al 2018 additionally all primary particles quartz illite hematite were nano sized and diffusion driven collisions prevail over orthokinetic advection driven collisions figure s7 1 a resulting in an insignificance of shear han and lawler 1992 praetorius et al 2020 with a decreasing primary particle number the collision frequency decreases while simultaneously charge heterogeneities are neutralized letting floc size plateau according to the model by frungieri et al 2020 size stabilizes when minority particles in terms of surface charge are used up and floc surfaces are covered by majority particles establishing an electrostatic energy barrier the model showed good stabilization at 85 majority particles while growth was self accelerating at equal shares a rough calculation of the positive and negative surface areas in the present spm component mix yields 92 5 negative and 7 5 positive surface table s7 1 since the composition was based on natural spm composition future research should address if natural flocs require a certain composition ratio to persist as stable flocs at 45 ppm spm size peaked and slightly decreased before plateauing fig 5a size reduction was suggested to result from floc compaction and restructuring selomulya et al 2003 which is supported by observations of an increase in floc circularity during that phase vlieghe et al 2014 a zoom into the fractal dimension axis fig 5b reveals that size peaks and dips before df reaches its maximum and df continues to slowly increase indicating compaction until the floc size plateaus restructuring can proceed in two ways 1 as a consequence of charge neutralization the attachment efficiency has dropped and collision energy is dissipated by slowly continued compaction rather than flocculation 2 flocs have reached a size range where shear forces start to act on them and induce restructuring which was demonstrated by a model by becker et al 2009 since in the case of halved spm concentrations a size peak dip sequence was not observed a ballistic effect is more likely than a shear effect at some point flocs resume growth see size at 50 rpm in fig 5a for two possible reasons 1 floc restructuring reduces the suggested surface enrichment of negatively charged majority particles frungieri et al 2020 lowering the electrostatic energy barrier 2 compaction increases the components coordination number and floc stability conchuir et al 2014 selomulya et al 2003 inhibiting dissipation of collision energy by deformation and allowing energy barriers to be overcome when flocculation is resumed df slowly decreases again see df at 50 rpm in fig 5b this coincides with the clear proliferation of a second peak in the size distribution figure s7 2 confirming that primary spm flocs flocculate to larger again less compact secondary flocs which finally approach a flocculation rupture regime see size at 50 rpm in fig 5a due to shear induced rupture of loose flocs becker et al 2009 the extension of the interim size plateau was clearly shorter at reduced stirring speed 50 instead of 100 rpm fig 5a as spm flocs have reached several µm in size orthokinetic advective collisions dominate figure s7 1 b lower stirring speed lowers the approach velocity of flocs and thus their mutual repulsion by hydrodynamic effects gregory 2005 as flocs are fractal agglomerates not solid spheres a less turbulent flow allows permeation of flocs and induces a transition from curvilinear towards rectilinear floc trajectories which increases the collision frequency bäbler et al 2006 han and lawler 1992 li and logan 1997 veerapaneni and wiesner 1996 lower shear stress and lower ballistic stress tran et al 2018 additionally reduce floc rupture and allow for quicker resumption of growth halving the concentrations 22 5 instead of 45 ppm spm at 100 rpm stirring prolonged the plateauing phase fig 5a as explained by a reduced collision frequency slowing down compaction and the onset of further floc growth together with relatively high shear forces sustaining floc rupture and or hydrodynamic effects i e curvilinearity of collision trajectories 3 3 spm analogues are storable resilient and robust upon resuspension storage and resuspension tests revealed that flocs can be stored for at least 8 d without any significant change in fractal dimension volume based diameter fig 6 or size distribution figure s8 1 no matter if batches were repeatedly resuspended or stored for a certain time without interim resuspension parallel batches the different resuspension techniques applied had no impact on floc size after a stabilization time of 60 min fig 6a while the fractal dimension was generally lower for sonication treatments the latter reflects observations of partial floc rupture through sonication and regrowth within the stabilization time shaker resuspended samples in turn exhibited breakage of initial larger clusters to original floc size when introduced into the stirred batch system within treatment rsds over 8 or 9 storage days ranged from 0 9 to 1 4 for df and from 4 ultrasonic probe via 5 5 shaker to 13 ultrasonic bath for size dv0 5 at 15 or 20 days of storage deviations of dv0 5 and df fig 6 as well as size distributions figure s8 1 were clearly pronounced for shaker resuspension employing ultrasound storability may be extended beyond 8 days close to 20 days varying stirring speeds between 50 100 150 rpm after resuspension by ultrasonic probe hardly influenced the volume based median spm floc diameter the rsd of floc size among speeds compared after 60 min of stirring was only 7 which confirms results of yu et al yu et al 2011 showing that after floc breakage and regrowth shear conditions had little impact on size the concentration effect on floc size was also concealed by resuspension during floc association halved spm concentration 22 5 ppm yielded a higher plateau size mode dv 11 1 µm than 45 ppm mode dv 7 3 µm figure s8 2 a after resuspension batches prepared at 22 5 and 45 ppm as well as 45 ppm batches diluted 1 1 either before or after 24 h shaking all approached similar floc sizes when exposed to controlled stirring conditions 100 rpm in the mastersizer setup for about 1 5 h mode dv 9 1 10 4 µm figure s8 2 b 3 4 spm formation size and fractal dimension depend on hydrochemistry when being prepared in the respective target hydrochemistry not all combinations of electrolyte and sr nom concentrations led to floc formation fig 7 a this can be explained by electrostatic stabilization through nom sr nom is dominated by hydrophobic acids 66 70 of the carbon mass ratpukdi et al 2009 which are rich in carboxyl groups ihss 2020b schumacher et al 2006 the latter exhibit a low pk a making sr nom highly negatively charged electrolytes counteracted nom stabilization and the more sr nom was present the more electrolytes were required to induce flocculation fig 7a electrolytes act in several ways sorption of counterions and strong electrical double layer compression destabilize suspensions gregory 2005 and multivalent ions especially ca2 may induce interparticle bridging wang et al 2017 or bridging flocculation involving nom philippe and schaumann 2014 fig 1 combinations of 0 1 mm electrolytes with 0 1 and 1 ppmc sr nom and 1 mm electrolytes with 0 1 ppmc sr nom yielded no flocs this allows to predict that even higher 10 ppmc sr nom concentrations would as well prohibit floc formation at 0 1 mm and 1 mm electrolytes regarding floc size combined effects of sr nom and electrolyte concentrations were not linear a smaller size of flocs at 10 mm electrolytes with 1 ppmc than with 10 ppmc sr nom figure 7 a for example may either indicate that ca2 induced bridging flocculation is limited by sr nom concentrations or that at higher electrolyte concentrations so4 2 competes with sr nom for sorption sites on hematite gu et al 1995 tan and kilduff 2007 the latter is likely as both high electrolytes and sr nom strongly reduced or inversed the positive surface charge of hematite figure s3 2 an effect of so4 2 is also supported by a slightly decreasing df from 2 86 down to 2 56 with increasing electrolyte concentrations figure 7 a of the tested combinations the largest flocs at ph 5 resulted at 0 1 ppmc sr nom and 1 mm electrolytes fig 7a concentrations at which hematite was at its isoelectric point for sr nom or exhibited low positive charge for electrolytes figure s3 2 generally flocculation will be favored by an optimum ratio of sr nom available favorable sorption sites and sorption or bridging enhancing electrolyte ions for mechanistic insights further research is required an impact of ph was observed at low electrolyte concentrations 0 1 mm and in the absence of sr nom fig 7b floc compactness df decreased with increasing ph and finally resulted in smaller flocs at ph 8 5 as explained by stronger electrostatic repulsion between spm components at increasing ph especially when hematite turns negative at ph 8 5 figure s3 2 in presence of 10 mm electrolytes and 1 ppmc sr nom the ph effect was probably masked by overriding impacts of electrolytes and sr nom fig 7b 3 5 spm analogues remain stable upon transfer into unfavorable hydrochemistries as flocculation was prohibited by some hydrochemical conditions spm analogues were generated without any electrolyte or sr nom addition spmzero and adjusted to target hydrochemistries unfavorable for flocculation spmzero association at ph 5 positive charge of hematite yielded a larger plateau floc size at 60 min mode dv 15 42 0 96 µm within batch than flocs associated at 0 1 mm electrolytes mode dv 7 3 0 4 µm in accordance with hematite being more positively charged in absence of electrolytes figure s3 2 the modification of hydrochemistry to 0 1 mm electrolytes 1 ppmc sr nom in course of a 1 1 dilution of both freshly associated and overnight shaker equilibrated spmzero did not induce disintegration of flocs figures s8 3 and s8 4 even though these hydrochemical conditions prohibited flocculation fig 7a agglomeration is frequently reported to not be fully reversible and de agglomeration by unfavorable hydrochemistry produces fragments rather than single particles baalousha 2009 loosli et al 2013 mohd omar et al 2014 as probably mainly weak bonds secondary minima are broken philippe and schaumann 2014 wang et al 2016 still the extent of de agglomeration was found to increase with concentration of stabilizing nom and with reaction time as molecules slowly migrate into agglomerates baalousha et al 2009 loosli et al 2013 however even after storage for 6 d and resuspension by shaking over night for 18 h spmzero floc integrity was not affected by the modified hydrochemistry and resuspended flocs approached the sizes of freshly hydrochemistry adjusted flocs after about 1 5 h in controlled stirring conditions figures s8 3 and s8 4 consequently after every physical or chemical impact a conditioning phase in the final experimental stirring conditions should be allowed 4 conclusions in this study we developed spm analogues which can be used to investigate interactions of spm with particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials nano and microplastics soot or others at environmentally relevant freshwater conditions natural spm composition is complex and characterized by heterogeneous physicochemical surface properties hence interactions of contaminant particles with spm will be governed by multiple co occurring interaction mechanisms which are even more tortuous considering naturally occurring hydrochemistries while simple test systems are highly important to gain in depth mechanistic understanding complexity cannot be neglected when trying to properly represent natural systems and informed simplifications should guide the development of environmentally relevant and standardizable test systems our spm analogues were designed to represent those physicochemical surface properties of natural spm relevant for interactions with particulate contaminants selected components not only represent the most abundant components of natural riverine spm in realistic mass ratios but also maximize heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties and the resultant spm analogue flocs reflect the complex composition and structure of natural riverine spm these analogues could be reproducibly generated at different agitation conditions shaking stirring as association is controlled by surface chemistry the primary role of surface chemistry for flocculation was confirmed by inhibition when component surfaces are repulsive in hydrochemistries unfavorable for floc formation however flocs associated under favorable conditions did not disintegrate upon subjection to hydrochemistries suppressing flocculation and spm analogues can be transferred into unfavorable hydrochemistries for follow up experiments for direct use of freshly associated flocs in experiments the experiment duration should not exceed the extent of the stable size plateau which depends on shear forces and spm concentrations in the system for flocculation conditions tested here the plateauing phase lasted for at least 1 5 h while floc association was somewhat sensitive to varying stirring speeds and spm concentrations analogues which had sedimented and rested during storage exhibited extended stability and higher robustness to modified stirring speeds and spm concentrations upon resuspension physical or chemical impacts such as changed agitation stirring or shaking sedimentation and storage resuspension by shaking ultrasonic bath or probe dilution or changed hydrochemistry induced elastic changes and the spm flocs returned to a stable size when exposed to controlled stirring for 1 1 5 h the resilience of spm analogues to sedimentation and resuspension and the storability for at least 8 days eases handling in the lab and allows for flexibility when planning experiments the flocs also seem to be quite robust to varying stirring speeds however if a different agitation regime is employed stability of size should be reevaluated and may be tuned via stirring speed and spm concentration the presented spm analogues constitute the missing link between complex natural systems and simplistic approaches providing the prerequisite for the development of standardizable and yet environmentally relevant experimental protocols to assess the behavior and fate of particulate contaminants in the presence of spm employing these analogues fate processes like heteroagglomeration oecd 2020 spm assisted transport or sedimentation bioavailability and uptake in the presence of spm may be investigated in a comparable manner for various types of particulate contaminants funding

15193,aquatic fate models and risk assessment require experimental information on the potential of contaminants to interact with riverine suspended particulate matter spm while for dissolved contaminants partition or sorption coefficients are used the underlying assumption of chemical equilibrium is invalid for particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials incidental nanoparticles micro or nanoplastics their interactions with spm are governed by physicochemical forces between contaminant particle and spm surfaces the availability of a standard spm material is thus highly relevant for the development of reproducible test systems to evaluate the fate of particulate contaminants in aquatic systems finding suitable spm analogues however is challenging considering the complex composition of natural spm which features floc like structures comprising minerals and organic components from the molecular to the microorganism level complex composition comes with a heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties that cannot be neglected we developed a procedure to generate spm analogue flocs from components selected to represent the most abundant and crucial constituents of natural riverine spm and the process relevant spm surface characteristics regarding interactions with particulate contaminants four components i e illite hematite quartz and tryptophan combined at environmentally realistic mass ratios were associated to complex flocs flocculation was reproducible regarding floc size and fractal dimension and multiple tests on floc resilience towards

available on request 1 introduction river systems are among the major contaminant receiving waters and constitute potential long range environmental transport routes contaminant transport and fate depend on their interactions with natural materials which are present in all forms from truly dissolved through colloidal and suspended particulate matter to bed load and bottom sediments within this continuum of matter a crucial role can be attributed to suspended particulate matter spm because 1 spm is in constant exchange with all other phases through adsorption desorption attachment detachment de agglomeration flocculation rupture and sedimentation resuspension 2 spm is mobile and links the pelagic and benthic zones by sedimentation and resuspension rivers to lakes and oceans by advective transport and terrestrial to aquatic environments via erosion and runoff or flooding and 3 spm provides habitat and feed to aquatic organisms walch et al 2022 the affinity of contaminants for spm depends on both their respective properties and governs their transport behavior bioavailability uptake and fate geitner et al 2016 hofmann and von der kammer 2009 schulze et al 2015 a quantification of contaminant spm interactions is needed for exposure assessment in the framework of environmental risk assessment for dissolved contaminants classical solid liquid partition coefficients k d can be employed to describe the affinity of a contaminant for water versus solid phases over the past decades however particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials micro or nanoplastics received increased attention and chemical legislation e g reach tsca requiring environmental risk assessment is adapted to cover these contaminants this has triggered scientific debate about suitable fate descriptors for particulate contaminants dale et al 2015 praetorius et al 2014b svendsen et al 2020 westerhoff and nowack 2013 praetorius et al 2014 emphasized that partition coefficients cannot be employed for particulate contaminants as the underlying thermodynamic equilibrium assumption is only applicable for dissolved substances consequently calls for harmonized testing protocols specific to particulate contaminants baun et al 2017 stone et al 2010 can only be responded to while accounting for the process relevant interaction mechanisms interactions between particulate contaminants and spm i e heteroagglomeration are kinetically driven praetorius et al 2014b and governed by short range physicochemical surface interactions as depicted in fig 1 interaction forces mainly electrostatic hydrophobic and van der waals forces or nom interactions arise from the interplay of intrinsic material properties of both particulate contaminants and spm and hydrochemical conditions mainly ph electrolytes and nom natural organic matter elimelech et al 1995 gregory 2005 the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors cannot be easily disentangled especially regarding more complex multi component systems praetorius et al 2020 consequently protocols to test particulate contaminants affinity for spm require accounting for both the process relevant physicochemical surface properties of natural spm and the relevant hydrochemical conditions freshwater hydrochemical conditions were recently operationalized within the oecd test guideline no 318 dispersion stability of nanomaterials in simulated environmental media oecd 2017 and the rationale beyond the selected hydrochemical test parameter ranges abdolahpur monikh et al 2018 is directly applicable to heteroagglomeration hence the selection of suitable counterparts for heteroagglomeration ideally spm analogues which represent the agglomeration relevant natural properties remains one major gap to fill praetorius et al 2020 achieving this task is hampered by the complexity and spatiotemporal variability of natural riverine spm walch et al 2022 spm is operationally defined and comprises any materials that do not sediment under the given hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions and get retained by 0 45 or 0 22 µm filtration membranes eisma 1993 spm typically exhibits agglomerate or floc like structures integrating minerals and organic components from molecules via detritus up to microorganisms of alloch and autochthonous origins droppo 2001 henning et al 2001 zimmermann timm 2002 with each component contributing distinct physicochemical surface properties to a floc walch et al 2022 most heteroagglomeration studies either employed simple mineral spm surrogates e g gallego urrea et al 2016 labille et al 2015 oriekhova and stoll 2018 praetorius et al 2014a yu et al 2021 zhou et al 2012 or natural water samples e g quik et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 adam et al 2016 li et al 2019 surette and nason 2019 but neither meet the need for environmentally relevant and yet standardizable test conditions simple minerals do not reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of natural spm while natural samples do not allow for reproducibility since the properties of natural spm are specific to a certain sampling location and time so far the only publication reporting near natural spm is slomberg et al 2016 who tried to assemble spm analogues based on the mineralogical composition of spm from the rhône catchment however they included only major negatively charged mineral fractions neglecting minor but functionally important components such as positively charged oxide and oxy hydroxide minerals or microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps walch et al 2022 standardization requires simplification but a valid model test system needs to cover the most relevant factors which control the process under observation hence we took a conceptual approach to select key components for the generation of complex spm analogue flocs developed a simple protocol for their association and finally evaluated their robustness and handling in the laboratory the detailed rationale beyond component selection is given in the conceptual framework supporting information s1 briefly we aimed at tailoring spm analogues that represent those characteristics of natural riverine spm which are most relevant for heteroagglomeration analogues should reflect the complex composition structure of natural spm as well as its heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties while comprising only few components to allow for reproducible generation our component selection is based on an extensive literature review walch et al 2022 looking at the mineralogical and organic composition of natural riverine spm and crucial components governing the dynamics of spm formation selected minerals comprise illite quartz and hematite and the amino acid tryptophan was chosen as a proxy substance to mimic some properties of microbial eps based on screening tests s2 illite and quartz are representatives for the most abundant mineral constituents of natural riverine spm and hematite for minor but functionally important iron oxide and oxy hydroxide minerals feox similarly microbial eps are mostly less abundant in spm than refractory humic like substances but due to their heterogeneous properties eps are considered more relevant for flocculation being combined in realistic mass ratios the selected components not only reflect the composition of natural spm but also add to an increased heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties which is probably the most relevant feature of natural spm when it comes to interactions with particulate contaminants the aim of this study was to develop and test reproducible spm analogue flocs we show that using illite quartz hematite and tryptophan in realistic mass ratios it is possible to generate complex spm analogues which are consistent regarding floc size and fractal dimension and exhibit the desired robustness towards physical impacts and hydrochemical changes to allow proper handling in experimental setups 2

zetasizer nano zs malvern before use hematite suspensions were stable for 6 months figure s3 1 illite and quartz can be stored for at least one year with quartz requiring 15 20 min ultrasonic probe sonication before use after resting for more than a few days organic stocks were replaced every two months 2 3 spm analogue generation for spm analogue flocculation and characterization a batch setup consisting of two stirred batch reactors connected to a laser diffractometer mastersizer 2000 malvern was designed where the sample was passed through the measurement cell in freefall 6 ml s 1 to avoid any change in floc size or fractal dimension with a peristaltic pump closing the circuit between the two batch reactors s4 a spm analogue composition table 1 was based on typical riverine spm compositions see s1 and walch et al 2022 and screening tests s2 and refined within the mastersizer setup s4 b starting from quartz and illite in ultrapure water at ph 5 to maintain the positive surface charge of hematite upon addition dilutions of hematite tryptophan electrolyte and sr nom stocks were quickly added 15 s in this sequence to both stirred batches simultaneously establishing the spm component concentrations given in table 1 as well as the targeted hydrochemical background concentrations in a final volume of 800 ml for each batch for details see s4 c two procedures to generate spm analogues were followed 1 association procedure preparation directly in the two stirred batches connected to the mastersizer where circulation through the system and measurement of the sample were started right before the addition of hematite tryptophan electrolytes and sr nom which allowed investigating the flocculation process 2 shaker equilibration components were added into two magnetically stirred bottles 1 l centrifuge bottles heraeus and then left on an overhead shaker for 1 24 h 16 rpm reax 20 heidolph before introducing the suspension into the mastersizer setup for characterization 2 4 spm analogue protocol validation hydrochemical conditions employed for protocol validation were 0 1 mm electrolytes at ph 5 without sr nom addition for reasoning see s5 a the association procedure was repeated 4 times using the same component stocks for within batch reproducibility and 3 times employing different component stock batches for between batches reproducibility the shaker equilibration was validated only within batch 4 replicates to test storability spm was prepared by shaker equilibration shaken for 1 h and stored in the dark fridge at 4 c three batches were repeatedly resuspended at increasing time intervals 1 h 1 4 8 20 and 48 d by three different means overhead shaking 1 h 16 rpm reax 20 heidolph ultrasonic bath sonication 20 min and ultrasonic probe sonication 10 min 40 w tt13 tip sonoplus 3200 bandelin applied to each storage bottle containing 800 ml four additional parallel batches were resuspended by overhead shaking after 0 5 9 and 15 days of storage respectively to investigate storability without interim resuspension robustness towards changes in spm concentration and stirring speed was tested by halving the concentration from 45 to 22 5 ppm and by varying the stirring speed between 50 100 and 150 rpm both during spm association and after storage and resuspension spm analogue reproducibility storability and robustness were evaluated regarding stability and resilience of floc size and fractal dimension by means of laser diffractometry mastersizer 2000 malvern the fractal dimension describes the structural compactness of an agglomerate and takes values between 1 and 3 with 3 describing a solid sphere we employ the fractal dimension for relative comparisons absolute values might differ as a mix of minerals at different concentrations with different refractive indices particle sizes and shapes is considered and all these properties impact the light scattering behavior volume based median diameters dv0 5 and mass fractal dimensions df were recorded and plotted in a time resolved manner volume based size distributions and mode diameters mode dv were employed to compare samples at a specific time point details are given in s5 b additionally spm analogue floc morphology was investigated by sem imaging as described in s3 c 2 5 spm analogues in changing hydrochemistry the formation of spm analogues in varying hydrochemical backgrounds was evaluated regarding floc size and fractal dimension in the mastersizer setup after overnight shaker equilibration electrolyte 0 1 1 10 mm and sr nom concentrations 0 0 1 1 10 ppmc were varied at ph 5 and zeta potentials were measured according to s3 c the impact of ph values 5 7 8 5 was investigated in batches prepared at 0 1 mm electrolytes without any sr nom and at 10 mm with 1 ppmc sr nom adjustments of ph were done during spm preparation before overnight shaking and continuously during measurement to evaluate whether flocs keep their integrity when hydrochemistry is changed after floc formation and may be transferred into different hydrochemistries spm was generated at ph 5 without any electrolytes or sr nom added spmzero after association the hydrochemistry was adjusted by adding diluted electrolyte and sr nom stocks to reach a hydrochemical background of 0 1 mm and 1 ppmc while halving the spm concentration to 22 5 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 complex near natural spm analogue flocs can be reproducibly prepared flocs formed within minutes with diameters consistently around 7 µm and fractal dimensions slightly above 2 5 signals in the size range of the individual components were not recorded by the mastersizer 2000 the generated flocs can be considered primary flocs characterized by rather small floc sizes and compact structures indicated by high fractal dimensions primary flocs constitute base units that can assemble to larger more loose secondary flocs increasingly colonized by microorganisms within a recent floc structure hierarchy spencer et al 2021 microflocs and particle particle associations flocculi would be the corresponding classes considering structural floc dynamics throughout the year zimmermann timm 2002 type 3 densely packed mineral particles and detritus 150 µm often spherical which is typical in winter autumn and during flood would correspond the individual component preparations were highly consistent table s3 1 meeting the criteria to allow a reproducible spm analogue generation which was confirmed regarding floc size and fractal dimension whether the same figure s6 1 or different component batches fig 2 were employed after an initial floc association phase the diameter and fractal dimension reached an interim plateau size distributions were stable during that time narrow and consistent between replicates fig 2b figure s6 1 b the relative standard deviations rsds of the volume based mode diameters mode dv compared after 1 h were 4 8 mode dv 7 3 µm n 4 and 6 7 mode dv 7 9 µm n 3 for within batch and between batches replicates see 2 4 respectively the size of the flocs falls within the range of natural riverine floc sizes covering 1 to 1000 µm zimmermann timm 2002 with typical values from few µm up to few hundred µm guo and he 2011 lartiges et al 2001 woodward and walling 2007 fractal dimensions exhibited values within the predetermined range for shear flow i e 2 4 conchuir et al 2014 with rsds of 0 9 df 2 56 n 4 within batch and 5 1 df 2 7 n 3 between batches these quite high fractal dimensions partly result from the way laser scattering data were fit see s5 b however the optimization of the floc composition to yield stable robust flocs probably also entailed compact structures spm analogue preparation by 24 h shaker equilibration was also well reproducible fig 3 a exhibiting within batch rsds n 4 compared at 60 min of 11 1 and 1 4 for size mode dv 6 6 µm and fractal dimension df 2 65 respectively both parameters were similar to freshly associated flocs compared at 60 min fig 3b for size distributions see figure s6 2 sem images fig 4 a show complex spm analogue floc structures that incorporate all constituents generating heterogeneous surfaces images resemble those of natural spm buffle et al 1998 le meur et al 2016 slomberg et al 2016 wheatland et al 2017 with hematite being the smallest and quartz the largest component fig 4b their relative sizes reflect trends observed for natural spm where quartz shares increase in the larger size fraction and feox mainly form nanoparticles or patchy coatings on larger particles walch et al 2022 as expected from the positive surface charge of hematite figure s3 2 in the given hydrochemistry ph 5 0 1 mm electrolytes no sr nom sem images show hematite to act as bridging agent between illite and quartz figure s6 3 hematite mainly distributes on the negative edges of illite figure s6 4 where it is likely associated with tryptophan as nom feox associations seaming clay edges have been previously reported poulton and raiswell 2005 quartz mostly distributes on the floc surface while the core is composed of illite hematite associations figure s6 5 this reflects modeling results frungieri et al 2020 which showed that agglomeration of imbalanced mixtures of positively and negatively charged particles depleted minority particles first while majority particles cover the agglomerate surface in our case positive surface charges on hematite and illite edges represent the minority and negative charges on quartz and illite basal planes the majority as confirmed by an overall negative floc zeta potential of 18 1 2 mv 3 2 floc size evolution is controlled by particle concentration and stirring speed floc association and size evolution proceeds in three phases 1 quick diffusion limited association governed by electrostatic forces 2 a shear and concentration dependent restructuring and compaction phase 3 further floc growth approaching a flocculation rupture regime initial association is fueled by a high primary particle number allowing for a high collision frequency due to opposite charges of the components figure s3 2 in the present hydrochemistry ph 5 0 1 mm electrolytes association is probably diffusion limited attachment efficiency α 1 and attachment governed by electrostatic attractions neutralization of negative charges on illite and quartz by addition of positive hematite ca2 and mg2 the dominance of electrochemical mechanisms in primary floc formation was also inferred from 3d structural observations of natural flocs spencer et al 2021 collision dependance is confirmed by a slower and slightly retarded association at halved concentrations fig 5 a lower stirring should also reduce collisions but had little impact on the early association phase this is because the collision rate is proportional to the concentration squared while proportional to the mean shear rate tran et al 2018 additionally all primary particles quartz illite hematite were nano sized and diffusion driven collisions prevail over orthokinetic advection driven collisions figure s7 1 a resulting in an insignificance of shear han and lawler 1992 praetorius et al 2020 with a decreasing primary particle number the collision frequency decreases while simultaneously charge heterogeneities are neutralized letting floc size plateau according to the model by frungieri et al 2020 size stabilizes when minority particles in terms of surface charge are used up and floc surfaces are covered by majority particles establishing an electrostatic energy barrier the model showed good stabilization at 85 majority particles while growth was self accelerating at equal shares a rough calculation of the positive and negative surface areas in the present spm component mix yields 92 5 negative and 7 5 positive surface table s7 1 since the composition was based on natural spm composition future research should address if natural flocs require a certain composition ratio to persist as stable flocs at 45 ppm spm size peaked and slightly decreased before plateauing fig 5a size reduction was suggested to result from floc compaction and restructuring selomulya et al 2003 which is supported by observations of an increase in floc circularity during that phase vlieghe et al 2014 a zoom into the fractal dimension axis fig 5b reveals that size peaks and dips before df reaches its maximum and df continues to slowly increase indicating compaction until the floc size plateaus restructuring can proceed in two ways 1 as a consequence of charge neutralization the attachment efficiency has dropped and collision energy is dissipated by slowly continued compaction rather than flocculation 2 flocs have reached a size range where shear forces start to act on them and induce restructuring which was demonstrated by a model by becker et al 2009 since in the case of halved spm concentrations a size peak dip sequence was not observed a ballistic effect is more likely than a shear effect at some point flocs resume growth see size at 50 rpm in fig 5a for two possible reasons 1 floc restructuring reduces the suggested surface enrichment of negatively charged majority particles frungieri et al 2020 lowering the electrostatic energy barrier 2 compaction increases the components coordination number and floc stability conchuir et al 2014 selomulya et al 2003 inhibiting dissipation of collision energy by deformation and allowing energy barriers to be overcome when flocculation is resumed df slowly decreases again see df at 50 rpm in fig 5b this coincides with the clear proliferation of a second peak in the size distribution figure s7 2 confirming that primary spm flocs flocculate to larger again less compact secondary flocs which finally approach a flocculation rupture regime see size at 50 rpm in fig 5a due to shear induced rupture of loose flocs becker et al 2009 the extension of the interim size plateau was clearly shorter at reduced stirring speed 50 instead of 100 rpm fig 5a as spm flocs have reached several µm in size orthokinetic advective collisions dominate figure s7 1 b lower stirring speed lowers the approach velocity of flocs and thus their mutual repulsion by hydrodynamic effects gregory 2005 as flocs are fractal agglomerates not solid spheres a less turbulent flow allows permeation of flocs and induces a transition from curvilinear towards rectilinear floc trajectories which increases the collision frequency bäbler et al 2006 han and lawler 1992 li and logan 1997 veerapaneni and wiesner 1996 lower shear stress and lower ballistic stress tran et al 2018 additionally reduce floc rupture and allow for quicker resumption of growth halving the concentrations 22 5 instead of 45 ppm spm at 100 rpm stirring prolonged the plateauing phase fig 5a as explained by a reduced collision frequency slowing down compaction and the onset of further floc growth together with relatively high shear forces sustaining floc rupture and or hydrodynamic effects i e curvilinearity of collision trajectories 3 3 spm analogues are storable resilient and robust upon resuspension storage and resuspension tests revealed that flocs can be stored for at least 8 d without any significant change in fractal dimension volume based diameter fig 6 or size distribution figure s8 1 no matter if batches were repeatedly resuspended or stored for a certain time without interim resuspension parallel batches the different resuspension techniques applied had no impact on floc size after a stabilization time of 60 min fig 6a while the fractal dimension was generally lower for sonication treatments the latter reflects observations of partial floc rupture through sonication and regrowth within the stabilization time shaker resuspended samples in turn exhibited breakage of initial larger clusters to original floc size when introduced into the stirred batch system within treatment rsds over 8 or 9 storage days ranged from 0 9 to 1 4 for df and from 4 ultrasonic probe via 5 5 shaker to 13 ultrasonic bath for size dv0 5 at 15 or 20 days of storage deviations of dv0 5 and df fig 6 as well as size distributions figure s8 1 were clearly pronounced for shaker resuspension employing ultrasound storability may be extended beyond 8 days close to 20 days varying stirring speeds between 50 100 150 rpm after resuspension by ultrasonic probe hardly influenced the volume based median spm floc diameter the rsd of floc size among speeds compared after 60 min of stirring was only 7 which confirms results of yu et al yu et al 2011 showing that after floc breakage and regrowth shear conditions had little impact on size the concentration effect on floc size was also concealed by resuspension during floc association halved spm concentration 22 5 ppm yielded a higher plateau size mode dv 11 1 µm than 45 ppm mode dv 7 3 µm figure s8 2 a after resuspension batches prepared at 22 5 and 45 ppm as well as 45 ppm batches diluted 1 1 either before or after 24 h shaking all approached similar floc sizes when exposed to controlled stirring conditions 100 rpm in the mastersizer setup for about 1 5 h mode dv 9 1 10 4 µm figure s8 2 b 3 4 spm formation size and fractal dimension depend on hydrochemistry when being prepared in the respective target hydrochemistry not all combinations of electrolyte and sr nom concentrations led to floc formation fig 7 a this can be explained by electrostatic stabilization through nom sr nom is dominated by hydrophobic acids 66 70 of the carbon mass ratpukdi et al 2009 which are rich in carboxyl groups ihss 2020b schumacher et al 2006 the latter exhibit a low pk a making sr nom highly negatively charged electrolytes counteracted nom stabilization and the more sr nom was present the more electrolytes were required to induce flocculation fig 7a electrolytes act in several ways sorption of counterions and strong electrical double layer compression destabilize suspensions gregory 2005 and multivalent ions especially ca2 may induce interparticle bridging wang et al 2017 or bridging flocculation involving nom philippe and schaumann 2014 fig 1 combinations of 0 1 mm electrolytes with 0 1 and 1 ppmc sr nom and 1 mm electrolytes with 0 1 ppmc sr nom yielded no flocs this allows to predict that even higher 10 ppmc sr nom concentrations would as well prohibit floc formation at 0 1 mm and 1 mm electrolytes regarding floc size combined effects of sr nom and electrolyte concentrations were not linear a smaller size of flocs at 10 mm electrolytes with 1 ppmc than with 10 ppmc sr nom figure 7 a for example may either indicate that ca2 induced bridging flocculation is limited by sr nom concentrations or that at higher electrolyte concentrations so4 2 competes with sr nom for sorption sites on hematite gu et al 1995 tan and kilduff 2007 the latter is likely as both high electrolytes and sr nom strongly reduced or inversed the positive surface charge of hematite figure s3 2 an effect of so4 2 is also supported by a slightly decreasing df from 2 86 down to 2 56 with increasing electrolyte concentrations figure 7 a of the tested combinations the largest flocs at ph 5 resulted at 0 1 ppmc sr nom and 1 mm electrolytes fig 7a concentrations at which hematite was at its isoelectric point for sr nom or exhibited low positive charge for electrolytes figure s3 2 generally flocculation will be favored by an optimum ratio of sr nom available favorable sorption sites and sorption or bridging enhancing electrolyte ions for mechanistic insights further research is required an impact of ph was observed at low electrolyte concentrations 0 1 mm and in the absence of sr nom fig 7b floc compactness df decreased with increasing ph and finally resulted in smaller flocs at ph 8 5 as explained by stronger electrostatic repulsion between spm components at increasing ph especially when hematite turns negative at ph 8 5 figure s3 2 in presence of 10 mm electrolytes and 1 ppmc sr nom the ph effect was probably masked by overriding impacts of electrolytes and sr nom fig 7b 3 5 spm analogues remain stable upon transfer into unfavorable hydrochemistries as flocculation was prohibited by some hydrochemical conditions spm analogues were generated without any electrolyte or sr nom addition spmzero and adjusted to target hydrochemistries unfavorable for flocculation spmzero association at ph 5 positive charge of hematite yielded a larger plateau floc size at 60 min mode dv 15 42 0 96 µm within batch than flocs associated at 0 1 mm electrolytes mode dv 7 3 0 4 µm in accordance with hematite being more positively charged in absence of electrolytes figure s3 2 the modification of hydrochemistry to 0 1 mm electrolytes 1 ppmc sr nom in course of a 1 1 dilution of both freshly associated and overnight shaker equilibrated spmzero did not induce disintegration of flocs figures s8 3 and s8 4 even though these hydrochemical conditions prohibited flocculation fig 7a agglomeration is frequently reported to not be fully reversible and de agglomeration by unfavorable hydrochemistry produces fragments rather than single particles baalousha 2009 loosli et al 2013 mohd omar et al 2014 as probably mainly weak bonds secondary minima are broken philippe and schaumann 2014 wang et al 2016 still the extent of de agglomeration was found to increase with concentration of stabilizing nom and with reaction time as molecules slowly migrate into agglomerates baalousha et al 2009 loosli et al 2013 however even after storage for 6 d and resuspension by shaking over night for 18 h spmzero floc integrity was not affected by the modified hydrochemistry and resuspended flocs approached the sizes of freshly hydrochemistry adjusted flocs after about 1 5 h in controlled stirring conditions figures s8 3 and s8 4 consequently after every physical or chemical impact a conditioning phase in the final experimental stirring conditions should be allowed 4 conclusions in this study we developed spm analogues which can be used to investigate interactions of spm with particulate contaminants such as engineered nanomaterials nano and microplastics soot or others at environmentally relevant freshwater conditions natural spm composition is complex and characterized by heterogeneous physicochemical surface properties hence interactions of contaminant particles with spm will be governed by multiple co occurring interaction mechanisms which are even more tortuous considering naturally occurring hydrochemistries while simple test systems are highly important to gain in depth mechanistic understanding complexity cannot be neglected when trying to properly represent natural systems and informed simplifications should guide the development of environmentally relevant and standardizable test systems our spm analogues were designed to represent those physicochemical surface properties of natural spm relevant for interactions with particulate contaminants selected components not only represent the most abundant components of natural riverine spm in realistic mass ratios but also maximize heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties and the resultant spm analogue flocs reflect the complex composition and structure of natural riverine spm these analogues could be reproducibly generated at different agitation conditions shaking stirring as association is controlled by surface chemistry the primary role of surface chemistry for flocculation was confirmed by inhibition when component surfaces are repulsive in hydrochemistries unfavorable for floc formation however flocs associated under favorable conditions did not disintegrate upon subjection to hydrochemistries suppressing flocculation and spm analogues can be transferred into unfavorable hydrochemistries for follow up experiments for direct use of freshly associated flocs in experiments the experiment duration should not exceed the extent of the stable size plateau which depends on shear forces and spm concentrations in the system for flocculation conditions tested here the plateauing phase lasted for at least 1 5 h while floc association was somewhat sensitive to varying stirring speeds and spm concentrations analogues which had sedimented and rested during storage exhibited extended stability and higher robustness to modified stirring speeds and spm concentrations upon resuspension physical or chemical impacts such as changed agitation stirring or shaking sedimentation and storage resuspension by shaking ultrasonic bath or probe dilution or changed hydrochemistry induced elastic changes and the spm flocs returned to a stable size when exposed to controlled stirring for 1 1 5 h the resilience of spm analogues to sedimentation and resuspension and the storability for at least 8 days eases handling in the lab and allows for flexibility when planning experiments the flocs also seem to be quite robust to varying stirring speeds however if a different agitation regime is employed stability of size should be reevaluated and may be tuned via stirring speed and spm concentration the presented spm analogues constitute the missing link between complex natural systems and simplistic approaches providing the prerequisite for the development of standardizable and yet environmentally relevant experimental protocols to assess the behavior and fate of particulate contaminants in the presence of spm employing these analogues fate processes like heteroagglomeration oecd 2020 spm assisted transport or sedimentation bioavailability and uptake in the presence of spm may be investigated in a comparable manner for various types of particulate contaminants funding

15194,non target screening of suspended particulate matter spm collected from the german rivers rhine and saar was conducted with the goal of identifying organic permanent cationic contaminants and of estimating their temporal trends over an extended period therefore annual composite samples of spm provided by the german environmental specimen bank were extracted and analyzed with high resolution lc qtof ms ms to facilitate the identification of substances belonging to the class permanent cations prioritization methods were applied utilizing the physicochemical properties of these compounds these methods include both interactions of the analyte molecules with cation exchange resins and analyzing mass deviations when changing from non deuterated to deuterated mobile phase solvents during lc ms analysis by applying both methods in a combined approach 123 of the initially detected 2695 features were prioritized corresponding to a 95 data reduction this led to the identification of 22 permanent cationic species the organic dyes basic yellow 28 and fluorescent brightener 363 as well as two quaternary ammonium compounds qacs were detected in environmental samples for the first time to best of or knowledge the other compounds include additional qacs as well as quaternary tri phenylphosphonium compounds qpc tpp in addition to identification we determined temporal trends of all compounds over a period of 13 years and assessed their ecotoxicological relevance based on estimated concentrations the two qacs oleyltrimethylammonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium show significant increasing trends in the rhine spm and maximum concentrations in the saar spm of about 900 and 1400 µg kg respectively in the case of the dyes constant trends have been observed at the end of the studied period but also maximum concentrations of 400 µg kg for basic yellow 28 in 2006 and 1000 µg kg for fluorescent brightener 363 in 2015 potentially indicating a strong ecotoxicological risk graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords non target screening identification suspended particulate matter spm qac deuterium oxide d2o lc qtof ms 1 introduction pollution by organic chemicals in rivers is a well known issue and encompasses a variety of compound classes with wide ranging physicochemical properties such as polarity biodegradability and ionic charge one class of contaminants of particular interest for river basin and sediment management are compounds which are cationic at ambient ph or permanent cations since they often have an elevated sorption capacity to sediments and suspended particulate matter spm due to their positive charge suter et al 1997 droge and goss 2013 different subclasses of permanent cations are occurring in rivers and streams quaternary ammonium compounds qac are permanent cations with wide dispersive use of many tons per year in the eu for example in a broad range of disinfectants and personal care products such as fabric softeners and shampoos li 2009 boethling and lynch 1992 benzalkonium chloride bac a mixture of different n alkyl benzyldimethyl ammonium chloride derivates is a component of eye drops disinfectants and biocides martinez carballo et al 2007b kreuzinger et al 2007 showed that qacs can pose a significant risk for the aquatic environment due to their high potential to sorb to particulate matter which is highly relevant for microphagous filter feeding and sediment dwelling organisms in addition to qacs quaternary phosphonium compounds qpc have been identified in recent years in the aquatic environment schlüsener et al 2015 compounds of this class are used for example for the synthesis of olefinic products such as vitamin a or β carotene by the wittig reaction reif and grassner 1973 brand et al 2018 monitored qpcs in the river elbe and elucidated their environmental fate and eco toxicity the determined partition coefficients indicated a strong sorption to sediments in addition cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were identified for qpcs such as methoxymethyl triphenylphosphonium tpp or tetraphenylphosphonium which have been detected in german rivers ionic liquids il are another example for permanent organic cations sun and armstrong 2010 swatloski et al 2002 ibrahim et al 2011 for instance derivatives of imidazolium pyridinium or pyrrolidinium are often used as the cationic components in hydrometallurgy park et al 2014 and the chemical industry in general plechkova and seddon 2008 they can be discharged into surface water through wastewater treatment plants pati and arnold 2020 with potential environmental consequences due to their high sorption affinity to sediments and spm pham et al 2010 in the study by costa et al 2015 ec50 values of 0 08 mg l to 600 mg l were reported for aquatic microorganisms exposed to ionic liquids the current studies raise the question if further compound classes with permanent positive charges can be detected in the aquatic environment and if they and their environmental relevance can be identified using comprehensive analytical methods such as non target screening nts and substance databases such as norman 2020 or pubchem kim et al 2015 the application of full scan analytical techniques such as nts has been steadily growing over the last decade and has been increasingly applied in modern water management approaches hollender et al 2014 alygizakis et al 2018 krauss et al 2010 the usage of nts for the analysis of sediment and spm extracts was initially performed via gc ei ms systems schwarzbauer et al 2000 whereas the use of lc ms ms systems has been applied only in a limited number of studies terzic and ahel 2011 sibiya et al 2019 the nts of sediment or spm extracts is associated with a larger number of signals due to the more complex matrix compared to the analysis of surface water making data filtering and prioritization particularly important vazquez roig et al 2012 li et al 2014 sobek et al 2016 to overcome this challenge an approach was followed to utilize the physicochemical properties of permanent cations in the process of sample pretreatment and combine this with the filtering and prioritization techniques of nts in order to assess the relevance of cationic contaminants for the environment it is necessary to investigate their fate and potential risks several studies have already shown that annual composite samples of spm can provide reliable spatial and trend analysis of organic compounds to estimate future concentration levels assess the effectiveness of chemical management and use restrictions nagorka and koschorreck 2020 rüdel et al 2013 and identify chemicals of emerging concern yuan et al 2022 spatial and temporal monitoring data of new compounds with ecotoxicological relevance are crucial for the management of rivers and sediments e g by directing preventative actions if the concentrations of the identified contaminants are increasing over time in the current study we identified permanent cationic compounds sorbed to spm at two sites located on the rivers rhine and saar using nts and studied their temporal trends using annual spm samples from 2005 to 2018 two prioritization strategies including sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis as well as filtering of non target mass spectrometry data were applied the physicochemical properties of permanent cations were decisive for the steps prior to data filtering as a first strategy to identify cationic species a cation exchanger was used to retain cationic species stepnowski and mrozik 2005 using nts the unaltered samples without contact to the cation exchanger were compared to the eluates to infer which species sorbed onto the exchanger and thus could be permanent cations secondly in a strategy analogous to a deuterium exchange reaction hug et al 2014 adduct formation during lc ms ms analysis was developed utilizing deuterated hplc eluents allowing for the differentiation between adduct forming species and permanent cations 2 methods 2 1 chemicals acetonitrile and formic acid both lc ms grade were purchased from merck darmstadt germany and sigma aldrich seelze germany respectively deuterium oxide 99 9 and deuterated formic acid 95 in d2o were purchased from deutero kastellaun germany chemsolute quartz sand was received from th geyer renningen germany ultrapure water was prepared with a milli q water purification system merck millipore darmstadt germany reference standards used in this study were acquired from various vendors and are listed in table s1 2 2 sampling for this study annual suspended particulate matter spm composite samples from the river rhine near koblenz measurement station at river km 590 3 and from the river saar near rehlingen measurement station at river km 54 2 from 2005 2006 to 2018 were provided by the german environmental specimen bank umweltbundesamt 2020b the sampling of the spm was carried out monthly with sedimentation boxes schulze et al 2007 permanently deployed and placed 0 5 2 m below the water s surface after sampling the spm was sieved to a particle size 2 µm and frozen under liquid nitrogen for transport at the end of each year the monthly samples were combined to an annual homogenate and stored above liquid nitrogen a more detailed description of sampling and storage was given by ricking et al 2017 2 3 extraction the extraction of spm samples was performed with a dionex ase 350 from thermo fisher scientific waltham usa according to boulard et al 2020 exactly 0 5 g of the samples were weighed into stainless steel extraction cells 10 ml filled with quartz sand and subsequently extracted first with 10 ml methanol milli q 1 1 v v and subsequently two times with 10 ml methanol with 2 formic acid milli q 1 1 v v to a final volume of 30 ml more information on the method is included in the si for the analysis with deuterated hplc solvents separate samples were prepared by replacing ultrapure water with deuterium oxide d2o in all steps after evaporating the extraction solvent 2 4 ion exchange the first prioritization of permanent cationic compounds utilized the physicochemical interaction of compounds with a cation exchanger mcx plus short cartridges from waters milford ma usa were used for the cation exchange for the liquid phase transfer 2 5 ml gastight syringes with luer tip ends from hamilton bonaduz switzerland were used prior to cation exchange the cartridges were conditioned with 1 5 ml methanol and equilibrated with 1 5 ml ultrapure water samples obtained from the extraction 1 5 ml spm extract ❶ fig 1 were pressed dropwise approx 1 5 ml min through the cartridges and the treated sample was collected in hplc vials treated sample ❷ fig 1 to elute neutral or protonated cationic compounds conjugate acids of brønsted lowry bases from the sulfonate groups of the mcx phase the cartridges were eluted with 1 5 ml methanol ammonia 2 v v increasing the ph value led to the acid base dissociation when pka 9 25 nh4 causing these compounds to elute and to be collected as eluate ❸ the fractions ❶ ❷ and ❸ were analyzed by lc esi ms ms in positive mode 2 5 data acquisition the data acquisition was performed according to köppe et al 2020 table s2 the injected sample volume of spm extracts was 50 µl for analyses with deuterated solvents the data acquisition was carried out using d2o with 0 1 v v deuterated formic acid phase a and acetonitrile with 0 1 v v deuterated formic acid phase b for chromatography analyst tf 1 7 was used as the control software for data acquisition to be able to perform data processing steps in r 4 0 4 r core team 2018 the measured data were converted to the open data format mzxml with proteowizard 3 0 kessner et al 2008 this was associated with a change in intensity scale approximately by a factor of 1400 downwards which is why the intensity is given the unit count in the following 2 6 data pre processing the steps of the data pre processing were performed with algorithms written in r 4 0 4 analogous to köppe et al 2020 adjustments of parameters and algorithms are described briefly peak picking the algorithm used was based on dietrich et al 2021 the parameters used were m z binning step da 0 02 minimum intensity count 5 minimum signal to noise s n 3 peak width s 5 to 60 for samples after the ion exchange treatment fractions ❷ and ❸ fig 1 and those defined as blanks the parameters for minimum intensity and s n were reduced to 0 5 and 1 5 respectively this additional tolerance ensured that features in cartridge treated fractions and blanks were not ignored if they were near the cut off and had a slightly lower intensity than in the untreated sample removing false positives a reduction of false positives was carried out by extracting and analyzing every spm sample three times and only keeping features detected in all three replicates parameters for comparing triplicate features were m z 5 mda and t r 3 s componentization the grouping of adducts isotopologues in source fragments and other related features of a compound into a single component was performed by comparing the retention times and peak shapes of features köppe et al 2020 table s3 alignment by aligning the data the same features across the different samples were linked within the tolerances of m z 10 ppm t r 20 s blank correction three method blanks were treated in the same way as environmental samples the treatment steps included the extraction of quartz sand the preparation of the extracts the ion exchange spe the sample storage and the analysis features were removed whose intensity difference in the samples and in the blank was less than a factor of five this limit was applied since some blank features could be detected with varying intensity up to a factor of four 2 7 prioritization of permanent cations 2 7 1 prioritization by ion exchange a first prioritization of permanent cationic compounds was achieved by comparing the data of spm extracts before treatment with the cation exchanger referred to here as untreated sample and after the feature lists of treated samples and eluates ❷ and ❸ fig 1 were required in addition to those from of the untreated samples ❶ fig 1 for comparison all three fractions were aligned and features detected in the treated samples ❷ or the eluates ❸ were removed deleted from the feature lists of the untreated samples ❶ unless the intensity in ❶ was more than a factor 10 higher than ❷ or ❸ a 90 retention of a compound was considered adequate to indicate that it was a permanent cation through this process the remaining features in the untreated sample s feature lists were considered to represent permanent cations 2 7 2 complementary analysis with non deuterated and deuterated solvents the second step for the prioritization of permanent cationic compounds was looking for equal masses during mass comparison in complementary analyses with non deuterated and deuterated hplc solvents compounds of variable charge must be ionized for mass spectrometric detection by adduct formation esi positive normally by h but by using deuterated hplc solvents ions with a m z ratio of molecular mass m plus 2 m d occurred instead of ions with a m z ratio of m plus 1 m h compounds that were cationic from the outset do not need to be ionized and therefore would have the same mass with both solvents fig s2 changing to a deuterated solvent was additionally associated with a shift of retention time of permanent cations towards a later elution in reversed phase chromatography the size of the shift depended on the retention time of a compound itself i e a higher retention time led to a greater shift this systematic shift was not observed when m h adducts changed to m d where the shift was more variable olsen et al 2000 reported the retention time shift in their work when using d2o as a mobile phase but a systematic study of the shift of permanent cations has not been reported so far regardless of the physical processes leading to this observation by comparing feature lists from measurements using non deuterated solvents with those using deuterated solvents it was possible to distinguish permanent cations from cations originating from compounds with variable charge though adduct formation using this predictable retention time shift and the noted m z changes the shift of the retention time was first modelled based on a mix of 46 permanent cationic reference standards il qacs and qpcs which were spiked to ten samples three samples of ultrapure water three samples of extracted chemsolute quartz sand and four spm extracts and analyzed with both solvent compositions fig 2 a retention times and shifts were determined fig s1 table s4 and subjected to linear modeling using a least squares regression 1 y m x n w h e r e x t r h 2 o a n d y t r d 2 o t r h 2 o an average coefficient of determination r² of 0 981 0 005 was achieved considering the regression for the examined 46 cations in the sample pairs of non deuterated and deuterated measurements this model was applied to all features in the deuterated measurement to correct their retention times fig 2b however to perform a mass comparison of features from non deuterated and deuterated measurements a suitable retention time tolerance for an alignment needed to be determined first in order to determine the optimal tolerance all differences of retention times of the permanent cationic reference standards between the non deuterated measurements and the deuterated solvents previously corrected with equation 1 were determined looking at the distribution it was evident that 95 of all compounds had an absolute retention time difference between deuterated and non deuterated measurements of less than 30 s and 75 were less than 15 s fig 2c according to these results a retention time tolerance of 30 s was chosen for the alignment to prioritize permanent cations features detected with similar m z 10 ppm and tr values 30 s in the aligned feature lists were considered to be permanent cationic compounds without exchangeable hydrogens furthermore permanent cationic compounds with exchangeable hydrogens would still be detected with a higher mass with deuterated solvents therefore in a second step the m z of all features in the measurements with non deuterated solvents were increased by 1 0063 m d m h to simulate a single h d exchange in this case the distinction between permanent and non permanent cationic compounds was mainly based on the correlated retention time since neutral compounds without exchangeable hydrogens were detected with a mass increase of 1 0063 as well since extending this procedure to multi step h d exchanges potentially favors an increase in the uncertainty of prioritization permanent cations with more than one exchangeable hydrogen were not prioritized 2 8 identification permanent cationic compounds are charged without adduct formation so the identification was performed assuming the m ion for the calculation of the monoisotopic mass 2 8 1 calculation of the molecular formula for the calculation of the molecular formula the program genform meringer et al 2011 was used for the assumed m molecules the ionization settings e was used and the experimental mass was corrected by 1 0073 da m h these parameters were necessary to take advantage of the inclusion of fragmentation in the formula calculation all parameters used for the calculation of the molecular formulae are given in the si table s7 2 8 2 search in online databases first an in house database with the m z retention time and ms2 spectra of 861 compounds was used for identification jewell et al 2020 if the unknown compound could not be identified in this way the next step was to search in chemical substance databases the online tool metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 was used as it offers an automated database search in combination with an in silico fragmentation and ms2 comparison with the observed data the parameters mzppm 5 mzabs 0 005 and the assumed ionization m were used the search was conducted in the databases for ident letzel et al 2016 norman susdat norman network et al 2020 and the comptox of the us epa williams et al 2017 as they are specifically oriented to organic contaminants in the aquatic environment significantly more extensive but also more unspecific was the database pubchem kim et al 2015 with over 100 million entries this was used if no identification could be achieved with the more specific databases in the final step of identification reference standards of the potentially identified compounds were purchased analyzed with the identical data acquisition method and the identity verified by m z tr and ms2 comparison 2 9 time trends time trends were assessed using the loess trend tool 1 1 based on microsoft excel from the german federal environment agency umweltbundesamt uba this tool fitted a locally weighted scatterplot smoother loess with a constant width of 7 years to the annual data points tests of significance for linear and non linear trend components were performed using an analysis of variance anova following the approach of fryer and nicholson 1999 chromatographic peak areas relative to the area of the internal standard bezafibrate d4 were used for this analysis and provide an indication of load changes in spm 2 10 risk characterization in order to assess the ecotoxicological relevance of the identified permanent cations their concentration in spm was estimated to take the maximum level of contamination into consideration the highest relative peak areas of each compound were used to estimate the concentration based on an external calibration with respective reference standards calibration points with concentrations of 0 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 10 µg l were used and the concentrations in eluate samples were calculated using a linear calibration curve least squares regression to estimate the limit of quantification loq a signal to noise ratio s n of 10 was used subsequently the concentrations in the eluates were converted to the sorbed concentration tables s8 s9 the estimated concentrations were compared with predicted no effect concentrations pnec from laboratory tests in the reach registration dossiers table 2 where ecotoxicological data for sediment dwelling organisms were missing pnecs were predicted from concentrations on a porewater basis and a sediment water sorption coefficient and toxicity to d magna from water only exposure the risk characterization was carried out by applying the risk quotient rq predicted environmental concentration pec pnec european commission 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing the prioritization strategy to examine the prioritization of permanent cations a mix of 161 reference standards was prepared in spm extracts c 1 µg l of these 46 compounds were permanent cationic il qac and qpc the positive charge of permanent cationic compounds is based on quaternary structures of nitrogen or phosphorus atoms while the charge of the other 115 compounds is dependent on the ambient ph table s5 the pka range from 0 7 metolachlor esa to 13 5 n desmethylvenlafaxine a list of pka values is reported in table s3 hermes et al 2019 chemaxon 2021 for simplification substances without a permanent positive charge will be called variable charge compounds in all further chapters of this publication the two prioritization approaches were tested first individually and subsequently in combination in all cases the same reference mix was used and the success was evaluated by the number of prioritized cations and deprioritized variable charge compounds 3 1 1 prioritization by ion exchange following the procedure described in section 2 4 and data evaluation as described above 53 of 161 compounds 33 were prioritized by ion exchange 40 of them were true permanent cationic species 75 however 13 variable charge compounds were prioritized incorrectly giving a false positive error rate of 25 while 6 permanent cationic species were not prioritized giving a false negative error rate of 13 by a closer look at the cationic compounds detected in the treated sample ❷ fig 1 false negatives it could be seen that steric availability of the positive charge seems to have had an impact on this prioritization step for example cations detected in treated samples ❷ showed that space filling alkyl groups shield the positive charge against the exchange groups on the resin and prevent ionic interactions croes et al 1995 this was the case for compounds such as tributyltetradecyl tpp or trimethyloctadecylammonium in addition to steric hindrance of binding interactions repulsive forces could have also occurred mimini et al 2019 the occurrence of such interactions was possible for tpp carboxylic acids which were also found in the false negative group eluate fraction ❸ due to the change from an acidic to a basic milieu the carboxyl group was deprotonated causing a zwitterion molecule which is neutral in total thus the positive charge at the central phosphorus was opposed by a terminal negative charge interfering with binding to the cation exchanger regarding the false positives a ph of 11 5 was calculated for elution with meoh nh3 allowing for prediction of charge states of the false prioritized compounds using pka values according to this 8 compounds were present in their neutral and 5 in their negatively charged form table s6 therefore possible explanations for the false prioritization could be intermolecular interactions of molecules with the hydrophilic matrix of the mcx phase these might cause a retention of compounds on the cartridge even though they were not cations finally splitting the quantity of analytes between the two treated fractions ❷ and ❸ might have led to a dilution and thus reduced the concentrations slightly below the limit of detection lod despite these challenges a partial prioritization was achieved 3 1 2 complementary analysis with non deuterated and deuterated solvents the 46 permanent cationic compounds of the reference mix were considered 39 of which did not have exchangeable hydrogens out of these 35 could be prioritized in the first iteration considering both similar mass δm z 10 ppm and a difference in retention time below 30 s as described in section 2 7 2 in the second iteration coincident detections in both measurements led to the prioritization of 6 out of 7 permanent cations with one exchangeable hydrogen in total 41 of 46 of the cationic reference compounds examined were correctly assigned leading to a final true positive rate of 89 missed assignments could be caused by poor chromatographic separation with solvents containing d2o resulting in non gaussian shaped peaks or two retention time differences outside the calculated 30 s threshold out of 115 examined variable charge reference standards no compound was marked as matching with the same retention time and m z during the first iteration however 6 variable charge compounds were falsely prioritized as permanent cations with one exchangeable hydrogen corresponding to a false positive rate of 5 3 1 3 combining both prioritization strategies due to the considerable time needed for identifying unknown compounds a low false positive rate was the main goal of our study to improve the prioritization of permanent cations and reduce the number of false positives the two prioritization strategies were successively combined the prioritization via ion exchange was done first followed by the prioritization based on complementary measurements with non deuterated and deuterated solvents the initial number of spiked reference standards was reduced during the first prioritization by ion exchange to a total of 53 compounds assigned to the group of permanent cationic compounds fig s3 the remaining 53 compounds were further prioritized based on measurements in non deuterated and deuterated solvents confining to permanent cationic compounds with a maximum of one exchangeable hydrogen 36 cationic compounds 22 of all features with a true positive rate of 78 were prioritized in the combined process of prioritization these included 34 cationic compounds without and two with one exchangeable hydrogen in contrast none of the variable charge compounds were prioritized 0 false positive table s5 the combination of both prioritization strategies noticeably lowered the true positive rate but at the same time also significantly reduced the false positive rate when analyzing complex environmental samples such as spm our focus was on keeping the false positive rate as low as possible even if this causes a reduction in true positives schulze et al 2020 since identification of new compounds is the rate determining step in non target analysis ideally only features derived from permanent cations are pre selected for that step in the workflow 3 2 analysis of environmental samples the analysis of riverine exposure was performed with spm samples from the rhine at koblenz river km 590 3 and the saar at rehlingen river km 54 2 prior to prioritizing permanent cationic compounds the results of the full scan qtof ms measurements were cleaned from false positive detections by deleting all features not present in each triplicate sample alignment and blank correction initially the number of aligned features added up to 18 446 and was reduced to 2695 distinct features across all samples by the pre processing steps in the first prioritization step the interactions of the analyte molecules with the cation exchanger were considered in the treated samples and eluates ❷ ❸ 1722 of 2695 features were detected correspondingly this means that 973 features from the spm extracts could not be detected in the treated samples due to their strong interactions with the ion exchanger and were therefore prioritized this corresponds to 36 of the features whereas 64 were removed from the data the prioritization was refined by comparative analyses with non deuterated and deuterated solvents therefore the retention times of all features in the samples with deuterated solvents were first corrected see section 2 7 2 in the following alignment and mass correction steps a total number of 123 13 features were prioritized as permanent cationic compounds from this total 76 were detected in both river spms 32 only in the rhine spm and 15 only in the saar spm combining both prioritization steps a final fraction of 4 potentially permanent cationic features was prioritized considering the number of exchangeable hydrogens 83 features indicated no exchangeable hydrogen and 40 features indicated one exchangeable hydrogen this distinction could help in the subsequent identification of unknown compounds to elucidate their chemical structure tolonen et al 2005 therefore by applying sample pretreatment and filtering of nts data in a combinatorial approach a large reduction in feature number and predictive prioritization of permanent cations was achieved 3 3 identification 3 3 1 qacs and qpcs out of 123 prioritized features the 100 most intense ones were selected for identification since for low intensities the ms2 spectra are either incomplete or not recorded at all by annotation with an in house spectra database 7 qac and 6 qpc could be directly identified table 1 this was done by comparing the measured data with those of analytical reference standards according to the characteristics m z ms2 and retention time jewell et al 2020 figs s4 s16 more compounds were identified by a workflow with genform and metfrag in a first step the ms1 and ms2 spectra were used to calculate the molecular formulae of the candidates between one and 25 different molecular formulae were obtained for each feature considered for four features fragmentation patterns were observed that were comparable to those of tpp compounds and typical for this compound class brand et al 2018 schlüsener et al 2015 the fragmentation pattern resulted from the separation of the fourth group followed by the successive separation of phenyl groups fragments with m z 263 0984 c18h16p 185 0515 c12h10p and 108 0123 c6h5p were detected for all tpp compounds known so far for this reason the presence of phosphorus was assumed for calculating the molecular formulae for these compounds reducing the number of possible molecular formulae for each of these four features to between one and seven subsequently potential structures for the unknown compounds were elucidated by in silico fragmentation and database searches and if possible tentative chemical structures were further supported by information regarding their use or consumption production volumes final candidates were identified using first the database norman susdat 6 identified compounds maximum 3 structures each suggested and second pubchem 1 identified compound maximum 36 structures suggested reference standards for all seven candidates were obtained figs s17 s22 three qacs dioctyldimethylammonium oleyltrimethylammonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium were finally confirmed by comparison with purchased reference standards the remaining four candidates c6h11o2 c5h9 c4h7o c5h11 tpp were tentatively identified as qpcs this level 3 classification schymanski et al 2014 was based on the fact that no reference standards were available for these compounds but i the ms1 spectra of similar reference standards with the same molecular formula were consistent with the experimental data and ii the fragmentation pattern of tpp compounds could be observed in the ms2 spectra figs s23 s26 some of the compounds have already been reported in environmental studies and identified quantified in surface waters sediments or spm li and brownawell 2009 martinez carballo et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge not reported so far is the occurrence of the two qacs oleyltrimethylammonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium fig 3 furthermore oleyltrimethylammonium is possibly the first qac with an olefinic side chain identified in an environmental sample eicosyltrimethylammonium and oleyltrimethylammonium are used in the european union with a volume of approx 10 t a per registrant echa 2021e 2021d the compounds are used in personal care products e g in cosmetics disinfectants and cleaning agents but also in industry as non reactive processing or corrosion inhibitor aids additionally we are not aware of any information on the four other qpcs in the river rhine with the molecular formulae identified and this warrants further studies to confirm their proposed structures 3 3 2 dyes in addition to the qacs and qpcs described above two other permanent cations were identified which are described as organic dyes the feature with the m z of 371 1063 was one of the 10 most intense detections and as with all permanent cations shows no esi adducts only a 13c isotopologue in the component group in addition the comparative measurements with d2o revealed that no exchangeable hydrogen was present the formula calculation with genform resulted in nine suitable candidates considering the calculated formulae c19h19n2o4s showed the lowest mass deviation and the highest score with respect to the ms1 and ms2 spectra with metfrag and the pubchem database 155 possible candidates but only two positively charged compounds with a score 0 7 were suggested furthermore the fragmentation indicated the separation of a methylsulfonyl group ch3o2s m z 78 9854 which was only possible with the candidate substance fluorescent brightener 363 2 6 methoxy 2 benzofuranyl 1 3 dimethyl 5 methylsulfonobenzimidazolium the identification of this candidate was finally confirmed by comparison with a commercially available reference standard figs 3 s27 s28 fluorescent brightener 363 is used in the industry for the production of textiles dyes and impregnation products the annual production import volumes are approx 10 tons per registrant echa 2021a the feature with m z 322 1907 was ranked 41st in intensity among the prioritized features within the component just the 13c isotopologue was assigned to the signal and in d2o chromatography no mass change occurred which suggested no exchangeable hydrogens for the detected m z twelve potential molecular formulae were calculated and checked the formula c20h24n3o showed the lowest mass deviation and a high score with respect to the ms1 and ms2 spectra using norman susdat with metfrag resulted in two equally rated potential candidates for the second listed molecular formula only for one of these candidates was a reference standard commercially available and measurements with this standard led to the unambiguous identification of the cationic dye basic yellow 28 2 4 methoxyphenyl methylhydrazono methyl 1 3 3 trimethyl 3h indolium figs 3 s29 s30 basic yellow 28 is used as a dye in the manufacture of paper products polymers and textiles the quantities used are recorded to be less than 10 t a per registrant echa 2021b to the best of our knowledge neither dye has been detected in the aquatic environment so far 3 4 temporal trends of identified compounds due to the high sorption affinity of cationic compounds to sediments and spm temporal monitoring in these riverine compartments is very important especially for the recently identified compounds or those not included in routine monitoring programs the evaluation of temporal trends can provide important results with respect to sediment management increasing trends can be identified and counteracted by regulatory steps in order to assess which of the identified compounds might gain relevance due to increasing loads temporal trends examined from annual composite samples of rhine spm at koblenz and saar spm at rehlingen between 2006 and 2018 were evaluated 3 4 1 qacs for the identified qacs eicosyltrimethylammonium and oleyltrimethylammonium which have not been described as environmental contaminants so far a significant linear increase p 0 01 was observed in the rhine spm fig 4 based on the loess treated data a high and significant percentage increase of 329 increase by factor 4 p 0 01 was calculated for eicosyltrimethylammonium and 67 p 0 01 for oleyltrimethylammonium for the rehlingen spm using both linear and non linear models a significant fit p 0 02 for oleyltrimethylammonium was observed although a 161 increase was determined the percentage change was not significant the trend of eicosyltrimethylammonium for the rehlingen spm showed no significant changes either 16 p 0 64 significant increasing linear trends p 0 02 in the rhine spm could also be observed for the qacs dimethyldioctylammonium change 63 p 0 01 and octyldecyldimethylammonium change 55 p 0 01 in addition the load of the bitter substance denatonium increased significantly by 222 p 0 01 in contrast the same compounds in saar spm showed linear decreasing trends in peak areas with changes of 54 p 0 01 and 37 not significant indicating decreasing loads of these qacs in the spm an exception was denatonium which showed a strong significant linear increase in the saar spm p 0 01 with a percentage change of 274 p 0 01 in summary all identified qacs in the rhine spm with the exception of benzyldimethyldecylammonium showed a significant increasing linear trend resulting in an increasing contamination of the rhine spm with different qacs from 2006 to 2018 for the river saar we found opposite trends with the exception of denatonium and oleyltrimethylammonium all compounds considered showed a decreasing trend of their concentrations from 2006 to 2018 the study of lege et al 2017 suggested that the bitter substance denatonium is ubiquitously discharged into the environment via wastewater treatment plants that may imply that increasing trends in the rhine and saar might also be observed in the spm of other rivers additional trend plots can be found in fig s31 in the si the comparison of the spm samples from the rivers rhine and saar revealed large differences in the detected normalized peak areas of the qacs qacs in the saar spm showed peak areas that are on average a factor of 5 for oleyltrimethylammonium a factor of 13 higher than in the rhine spm a possible reason for this difference could be the different proportion of treated wastewater in the two rivers for the river rhine the wastewater proportion at annual mean flow rate was reported at about 5 schlüsener et al 2015 using the persistent substance carbamazepine as indicator for treated wastewater the proportion for the river saar was calculated to be about 15 boulard et al 2020 in addition different matrix effects of the spm samples could have an impact on the results making further investigations necessary at this point nevertheless despite this uncertainty it seems likely that the saar is more exposed to the qacs studied than the other site especially oleyltrimethylammonium however the opposing trends of the substance in the two rivers could reverse this situation in the near future 3 4 2 qpcs all identified qpcs with the exception of methoxymethyl tpp showed significant increases in temporal trends in the rhine spm fig 5 this was most evident for c5h9 tpp 410 increase by factor 5 p 0 01 furthermore average increases of more than 190 0 01 p 0 02 were observed for the other qpcs as well fig 6 shows strongly increasing levels for almost all qpcs in the years 2015 to 2018 in the river rhine at koblenz with the exception of methoxymethyl tpp with lower normalized peak areas in recent years in particular the two qpcs ethyl tpp and butyl tpp showed percentage increase rates of 110 and 76 respectively whereas in the period 2006 to 2014 changes of 35 and 13 were observed in contrast for methoxymethyl tpp an increase of 678 was calculated in the first period of comparison but a decrease of 69 was observed from 2015 onwards this was unexpected based on the observations of brand et al 2018 which at that time reached to the year 2015 only methyl tpp continues the trend stated there fig s31 no significant change according to schlüsener et al 2015 the emission of qpcs is mainly caused by chemical processes such as the wittig reaction or by phase transfer catalysis weidlich and martínková 2012 therefore these trend changes could be due to modifications in production processes for example the substitution of methoxymethyl tpp with other qpcs however the short time frame 2015 2018 requires continuing trend analysis to support the hypothesis of trend reversal the consistently increasing time trends for the other qpcs indicate that further monitoring of these compounds should be considered in the future in the saar spm ethyl tpp was the only qpc identified no significant trend could be observed during the studied period however the detected peak areas indicate a negative tendency additional trend plots can be found in fig s31 in the si 3 4 3 dyes the temporal trends of the organic dye basic yellow 28 showed decreasing trends in the annual spm samples of the rivers rhine and saar fig 6 a significant linear and non linear fit as well as a decrease of 80 p 0 01 was observed for the rhine spm indicating a reduction of the concentrations especially from 2006 to 2010 the negative trend was very pronounced while no significant changes occurred from 2011 onwards the significant decrease of the dye in the rhine spm at the beginning of the period might indicate a reduced production or use of the dye in the chemical industry located in the rhine catchment area echa 2021b for the saar spm a significant linear decrease p 0 03 was observed over the entire study period but without statistically significant change of peak areas both the trend patterns in the two rivers after 2011 as well as similar normalized peak areas suggest a comparable loading of the substance to the spm in the upcoming years fluorescent brightener 363 was detected exclusively in the rhine spm whereby no significant changes in the trend were observed fluorescent brightener 363 is used as a fluorescent whitening agent fwa for example for polyacrylonitrile fibers gruetter et al 2014 and manufactured processed in the range of 10 100 t a in the european economic area echa 2021a this suggests a discharge by the chemical industry and could explain the strong deviation due to production alteration 3 5 ecotoxicological relevance compared to other chemical groups few data are available for the effects of the cationic compounds in the environment tables s12 s13 this is particularly evident in ecotoxicity data for sediment dwelling organisms because the testing requirements are in general higher than for freshwater organisms echa 2017 an experimentally derived pnec for sediment dwelling organisms was only available for eicosyltrimethylammonium with respect to all qacs detected in the suspended solids based on this estimated value i e 1250 µg kg weight a risk to sediment organisms was rated by comparison to the highest estimated concentration 1400 µg kg 2011 evaluated for the saar time series table s11 a risk quotient of 1 1 rq was calculated from these numbers indicating a potential risk for sediment communities for all other qacs risks were estimated using pnecs from d magna based on an equilibrium partitioning approach the pnec values tables 2 s14 of the individual qacs showed a high variability between 16 4 and 68 000 µg kg and did not indicate a risk compared to the pec in comparison the pnecs for the phosphonium compounds ranged from 8 4 to 1700 µg kg respectively from these data a risk was derived for ethyl triphenylphosphonium rq 12 and methoxymethyl triphenylphosphonium rq 3 3 in spm from the river rhine table s10 whereas all other estimated qpc concentrations from the rivers saar and rhine were below the respective derived pnecs for the two dyes basic yellow 28 and fluorescent brightener 363 maximum concentrations of 400 and 1000 µg kg were estimated in the spm time series from the river rhine in contrast in spm from river saar only basic yellow 28 was detected with a lower concentration of 30 µg kg interestingly compared to the sorption coefficients of the previously mentioned qacs and qpcs rather low koc values of 19 1 estimated according to oecd 121 and 0 55 l kg estimated by using euses v 2 1 2 were reported for basic yellow 28 echa 2021b and fluorescent brightener 363 echa 2021a respectively an underestimation cannot be excluded but other experimentally derived partitioning coefficients from batch experiments with sediments were not available considering the low available estimated koc and applying the equilibrium partitioning led to low pnecs for sediment dwelling organisms and the estimated concentrations in spm indicated a potentially strong risk for the environment with respect to organisms in the benthic zone for the river rhine basic yellow 28 exceeded the pnec by a factor of 500 rq and fluorescent brightener 363 by a factor of almost 50 rq 48 the risk quotient for basic yellow 28 in the saar was 38 in the same way as for the qacs and qpcs meaningful data on adsorption coefficients and toxicity to sediment dwellers are required for the cationic dyes as well as data on concentration in the water phase that allow comparison with aquatic organisms 4 conclusion the application of this nts based prioritization strategy for organic cationic compounds to suspended particulate matter has shown that in addition to the two qacs eicosyl and oleyltrimethylammonium the organic dyes basic yellow 28 and fluorescent brightener 363 are present in river basins which to the best of our knowledge have not yet been observed previously in environmental samples sediments and spm in particular offer a good opportunity to focus on compounds of this special class with their unique physicochemical properties however the complex matrix required a strict prioritization due to the large number of background detections even though the results of tests with spiked standards showed that permanent cations especially those with the positive charge being protected by space filling groups or those with more than one exchangeable hydrogen might be overlooked the selected approach provided an efficient prioritization and successful identification of 22 permanent cationic compounds the temporal trend analyses for spm time series from the rhine indicate that contamination with a range of qacs and qpcs has increased since 2005 which may lead to a long lasting pollution of sediments and spm in addition the estimated concentrations in the spm of rhine and saar rivers exceeded the pnecs of basic yellow 28 fluorescent brightener 363 ethyltriphenylphosphonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium partially to a considerable extent indicating potential risks for the aquatic environment despite this knowledge ecotoxicological data for these environmental compartments hyporheic zone are often poorly available making it difficult to assess the consequences of increasing trends therefore the applied method is a useful approach to expand the knowledge of permanently cationic compounds in the environment by identifying unknown compounds and examining their temporal trends thereby prioritizing research into their ecotoxicological relevance although similar observations have been made in several studies of sediment cores heyde et al 2021 chiaia hernandez et al 2013 to our knowledge trend analysis of annual spm samples for qacs and qpcs over a period greater than 10 years is currently unprecedented in this regard this study highlights the potential of the combined use of nts and both retrospective and prospective trend monitoring and its

15194,non target screening of suspended particulate matter spm collected from the german rivers rhine and saar was conducted with the goal of identifying organic permanent cationic contaminants and of estimating their temporal trends over an extended period therefore annual composite samples of spm provided by the german environmental specimen bank were extracted and analyzed with high resolution lc qtof ms ms to facilitate the identification of substances belonging to the class permanent cations prioritization methods were applied utilizing the physicochemical properties of these compounds these methods include both interactions of the analyte molecules with cation exchange resins and analyzing mass deviations when changing from non deuterated to deuterated mobile phase solvents during lc ms analysis by applying both methods in a combined approach 123 of the initially detected 2695 features were prioritized corresponding to a 95 data reduction this led to the identification of 22 permanent cationic species the organic dyes basic yellow 28 and fluorescent brightener 363 as well as two quaternary ammonium compounds qacs were detected in environmental samples for the first time to best of or knowledge the other compounds include additional qacs as well as quaternary tri phenylphosphonium compounds qpc tpp in addition to identification we determined temporal trends of all compounds over a period of 13 years and assessed their ecotoxicological relevance based on estimated concentrations the two qacs oleyltrimethylammonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium show significant increasing trends in the rhine spm and maximum concentrations in the saar spm of about 900 and 1400 µg kg respectively in the case of the dyes constant trends have been observed at the end of the studied period but also maximum concentrations of 400 µg kg for basic yellow 28 in 2006 and 1000 µg kg for fluorescent brightener 363 in 2015 potentially indicating a strong ecotoxicological risk

chemicals in rivers is a well known issue and encompasses a variety of compound classes with wide ranging physicochemical properties such as polarity biodegradability and ionic charge one class of contaminants of particular interest for river basin and sediment management are compounds which are cationic at ambient ph or permanent cations since they often have an elevated sorption capacity to sediments and suspended particulate matter spm due to their positive charge suter et al 1997 droge and goss 2013 different subclasses of permanent cations are occurring in rivers and streams quaternary ammonium compounds qac are permanent cations with wide dispersive use of many tons per year in the eu for example in a broad range of disinfectants and personal care products such as fabric softeners and shampoos li 2009 boethling and lynch 1992 benzalkonium chloride bac a mixture of different n alkyl benzyldimethyl ammonium chloride derivates is a component of eye drops disinfectants and biocides martinez carballo et al 2007b kreuzinger et al 2007 showed that qacs can pose a significant risk for the aquatic environment due to their high potential to sorb to particulate matter which is highly relevant for microphagous filter feeding and sediment dwelling organisms in addition to qacs quaternary phosphonium compounds qpc have been identified in recent years in the aquatic environment schlüsener et al 2015 compounds of this class are used for example for the synthesis of olefinic products such as vitamin a or β carotene by the wittig reaction reif and grassner 1973 brand et al 2018 monitored qpcs in the river elbe and elucidated their environmental fate and eco toxicity the determined partition coefficients indicated a strong sorption to sediments in addition cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were identified for qpcs such as methoxymethyl triphenylphosphonium tpp or tetraphenylphosphonium which have been detected in german rivers ionic liquids il are another example for permanent organic cations sun and armstrong 2010 swatloski et al 2002 ibrahim et al 2011 for instance derivatives of imidazolium pyridinium or pyrrolidinium are often used as the cationic components in hydrometallurgy park et al 2014 and the chemical industry in general plechkova and seddon 2008 they can be discharged into surface water through wastewater treatment plants pati and arnold 2020 with potential environmental consequences due to their high sorption affinity to sediments and spm pham et al 2010 in the study by costa et al 2015 ec50 values of 0 08 mg l to 600 mg l were reported for aquatic microorganisms exposed to ionic liquids the current studies raise the question if further compound classes with permanent positive charges can be detected in the aquatic environment and if they and their environmental relevance can be identified using comprehensive analytical methods such as non target screening nts and substance databases such as norman 2020 or pubchem kim et al 2015 the application of full scan analytical techniques such as nts has been steadily growing over the last decade and has been increasingly applied in modern water management approaches hollender et al 2014 alygizakis et al 2018 krauss et al 2010 the usage of nts for the analysis of sediment and spm extracts was initially performed via gc ei ms systems schwarzbauer et al 2000 whereas the use of lc ms ms systems has been applied only in a limited number of studies terzic and ahel 2011 sibiya et al 2019 the nts of sediment or spm extracts is associated with a larger number of signals due to the more complex matrix compared to the analysis of surface water making data filtering and prioritization particularly important vazquez roig et al 2012 li et al 2014 sobek et al 2016 to overcome this challenge an approach was followed to utilize the physicochemical properties of permanent cations in the process of sample pretreatment and combine this with the filtering and prioritization techniques of nts in order to assess the relevance of cationic contaminants for the environment it is necessary to investigate their fate and potential risks several studies have already shown that annual composite samples of spm can provide reliable spatial and trend analysis of organic compounds to estimate future concentration levels assess the effectiveness of chemical management and use restrictions nagorka and koschorreck 2020 rüdel et al 2013 and identify chemicals of emerging concern yuan et al 2022 spatial and temporal monitoring data of new compounds with ecotoxicological relevance are crucial for the management of rivers and sediments e g by directing preventative actions if the concentrations of the identified contaminants are increasing over time in the current study we identified permanent cationic compounds sorbed to spm at two sites located on the rivers rhine and saar using nts and studied their temporal trends using annual spm samples from 2005 to 2018 two prioritization strategies including sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis as well as filtering of non target mass spectrometry data were applied the physicochemical properties of permanent cations were decisive for the steps prior to data filtering as a first strategy to identify cationic species a cation exchanger was used to retain cationic species stepnowski and mrozik 2005 using nts the unaltered samples without contact to the cation exchanger were compared to the eluates to infer which species sorbed onto the exchanger and thus could be permanent cations secondly in a strategy analogous to a deuterium exchange reaction hug et al 2014 adduct formation during lc ms ms analysis was developed utilizing deuterated hplc eluents allowing for the differentiation between adduct forming species and permanent cations 2 methods 2 1 chemicals acetonitrile and formic acid both lc ms grade were purchased from merck darmstadt germany and sigma aldrich seelze germany respectively deuterium oxide 99 9 and deuterated formic acid 95 in d2o were purchased from deutero kastellaun germany chemsolute quartz sand was received from th geyer renningen germany ultrapure water was prepared with a milli q water purification system merck millipore darmstadt germany reference standards used in this study were acquired from various vendors and are listed in table s1 2 2 sampling for this study annual suspended particulate matter spm composite samples from the river rhine near koblenz measurement station at river km 590 3 and from the river saar near rehlingen measurement station at river km 54 2 from 2005 2006 to 2018 were provided by the german environmental specimen bank umweltbundesamt 2020b the sampling of the spm was carried out monthly with sedimentation boxes schulze et al 2007 permanently deployed and placed 0 5 2 m below the water s surface after sampling the spm was sieved to a particle size 2 µm and frozen under liquid nitrogen for transport at the end of each year the monthly samples were combined to an annual homogenate and stored above liquid nitrogen a more detailed description of sampling and storage was given by ricking et al 2017 2 3 extraction the extraction of spm samples was performed with a dionex ase 350 from thermo fisher scientific waltham usa according to boulard et al 2020 exactly 0 5 g of the samples were weighed into stainless steel extraction cells 10 ml filled with quartz sand and subsequently extracted first with 10 ml methanol milli q 1 1 v v and subsequently two times with 10 ml methanol with 2 formic acid milli q 1 1 v v to a final volume of 30 ml more information on the method is included in the si for the analysis with deuterated hplc solvents separate samples were prepared by replacing ultrapure water with deuterium oxide d2o in all steps after evaporating the extraction solvent 2 4 ion exchange the first prioritization of permanent cationic compounds utilized the physicochemical interaction of compounds with a cation exchanger mcx plus short cartridges from waters milford ma usa were used for the cation exchange for the liquid phase transfer 2 5 ml gastight syringes with luer tip ends from hamilton bonaduz switzerland were used prior to cation exchange the cartridges were conditioned with 1 5 ml methanol and equilibrated with 1 5 ml ultrapure water samples obtained from the extraction 1 5 ml spm extract ❶ fig 1 were pressed dropwise approx 1 5 ml min through the cartridges and the treated sample was collected in hplc vials treated sample ❷ fig 1 to elute neutral or protonated cationic compounds conjugate acids of brønsted lowry bases from the sulfonate groups of the mcx phase the cartridges were eluted with 1 5 ml methanol ammonia 2 v v increasing the ph value led to the acid base dissociation when pka 9 25 nh4 causing these compounds to elute and to be collected as eluate ❸ the fractions ❶ ❷ and ❸ were analyzed by lc esi ms ms in positive mode 2 5 data acquisition the data acquisition was performed according to köppe et al 2020 table s2 the injected sample volume of spm extracts was 50 µl for analyses with deuterated solvents the data acquisition was carried out using d2o with 0 1 v v deuterated formic acid phase a and acetonitrile with 0 1 v v deuterated formic acid phase b for chromatography analyst tf 1 7 was used as the control software for data acquisition to be able to perform data processing steps in r 4 0 4 r core team 2018 the measured data were converted to the open data format mzxml with proteowizard 3 0 kessner et al 2008 this was associated with a change in intensity scale approximately by a factor of 1400 downwards which is why the intensity is given the unit count in the following 2 6 data pre processing the steps of the data pre processing were performed with algorithms written in r 4 0 4 analogous to köppe et al 2020 adjustments of parameters and algorithms are described briefly peak picking the algorithm used was based on dietrich et al 2021 the parameters used were m z binning step da 0 02 minimum intensity count 5 minimum signal to noise s n 3 peak width s 5 to 60 for samples after the ion exchange treatment fractions ❷ and ❸ fig 1 and those defined as blanks the parameters for minimum intensity and s n were reduced to 0 5 and 1 5 respectively this additional tolerance ensured that features in cartridge treated fractions and blanks were not ignored if they were near the cut off and had a slightly lower intensity than in the untreated sample removing false positives a reduction of false positives was carried out by extracting and analyzing every spm sample three times and only keeping features detected in all three replicates parameters for comparing triplicate features were m z 5 mda and t r 3 s componentization the grouping of adducts isotopologues in source fragments and other related features of a compound into a single component was performed by comparing the retention times and peak shapes of features köppe et al 2020 table s3 alignment by aligning the data the same features across the different samples were linked within the tolerances of m z 10 ppm t r 20 s blank correction three method blanks were treated in the same way as environmental samples the treatment steps included the extraction of quartz sand the preparation of the extracts the ion exchange spe the sample storage and the analysis features were removed whose intensity difference in the samples and in the blank was less than a factor of five this limit was applied since some blank features could be detected with varying intensity up to a factor of four 2 7 prioritization of permanent cations 2 7 1 prioritization by ion exchange a first prioritization of permanent cationic compounds was achieved by comparing the data of spm extracts before treatment with the cation exchanger referred to here as untreated sample and after the feature lists of treated samples and eluates ❷ and ❸ fig 1 were required in addition to those from of the untreated samples ❶ fig 1 for comparison all three fractions were aligned and features detected in the treated samples ❷ or the eluates ❸ were removed deleted from the feature lists of the untreated samples ❶ unless the intensity in ❶ was more than a factor 10 higher than ❷ or ❸ a 90 retention of a compound was considered adequate to indicate that it was a permanent cation through this process the remaining features in the untreated sample s feature lists were considered to represent permanent cations 2 7 2 complementary analysis with non deuterated and deuterated solvents the second step for the prioritization of permanent cationic compounds was looking for equal masses during mass comparison in complementary analyses with non deuterated and deuterated hplc solvents compounds of variable charge must be ionized for mass spectrometric detection by adduct formation esi positive normally by h but by using deuterated hplc solvents ions with a m z ratio of molecular mass m plus 2 m d occurred instead of ions with a m z ratio of m plus 1 m h compounds that were cationic from the outset do not need to be ionized and therefore would have the same mass with both solvents fig s2 changing to a deuterated solvent was additionally associated with a shift of retention time of permanent cations towards a later elution in reversed phase chromatography the size of the shift depended on the retention time of a compound itself i e a higher retention time led to a greater shift this systematic shift was not observed when m h adducts changed to m d where the shift was more variable olsen et al 2000 reported the retention time shift in their work when using d2o as a mobile phase but a systematic study of the shift of permanent cations has not been reported so far regardless of the physical processes leading to this observation by comparing feature lists from measurements using non deuterated solvents with those using deuterated solvents it was possible to distinguish permanent cations from cations originating from compounds with variable charge though adduct formation using this predictable retention time shift and the noted m z changes the shift of the retention time was first modelled based on a mix of 46 permanent cationic reference standards il qacs and qpcs which were spiked to ten samples three samples of ultrapure water three samples of extracted chemsolute quartz sand and four spm extracts and analyzed with both solvent compositions fig 2 a retention times and shifts were determined fig s1 table s4 and subjected to linear modeling using a least squares regression 1 y m x n w h e r e x t r h 2 o a n d y t r d 2 o t r h 2 o an average coefficient of determination r² of 0 981 0 005 was achieved considering the regression for the examined 46 cations in the sample pairs of non deuterated and deuterated measurements this model was applied to all features in the deuterated measurement to correct their retention times fig 2b however to perform a mass comparison of features from non deuterated and deuterated measurements a suitable retention time tolerance for an alignment needed to be determined first in order to determine the optimal tolerance all differences of retention times of the permanent cationic reference standards between the non deuterated measurements and the deuterated solvents previously corrected with equation 1 were determined looking at the distribution it was evident that 95 of all compounds had an absolute retention time difference between deuterated and non deuterated measurements of less than 30 s and 75 were less than 15 s fig 2c according to these results a retention time tolerance of 30 s was chosen for the alignment to prioritize permanent cations features detected with similar m z 10 ppm and tr values 30 s in the aligned feature lists were considered to be permanent cationic compounds without exchangeable hydrogens furthermore permanent cationic compounds with exchangeable hydrogens would still be detected with a higher mass with deuterated solvents therefore in a second step the m z of all features in the measurements with non deuterated solvents were increased by 1 0063 m d m h to simulate a single h d exchange in this case the distinction between permanent and non permanent cationic compounds was mainly based on the correlated retention time since neutral compounds without exchangeable hydrogens were detected with a mass increase of 1 0063 as well since extending this procedure to multi step h d exchanges potentially favors an increase in the uncertainty of prioritization permanent cations with more than one exchangeable hydrogen were not prioritized 2 8 identification permanent cationic compounds are charged without adduct formation so the identification was performed assuming the m ion for the calculation of the monoisotopic mass 2 8 1 calculation of the molecular formula for the calculation of the molecular formula the program genform meringer et al 2011 was used for the assumed m molecules the ionization settings e was used and the experimental mass was corrected by 1 0073 da m h these parameters were necessary to take advantage of the inclusion of fragmentation in the formula calculation all parameters used for the calculation of the molecular formulae are given in the si table s7 2 8 2 search in online databases first an in house database with the m z retention time and ms2 spectra of 861 compounds was used for identification jewell et al 2020 if the unknown compound could not be identified in this way the next step was to search in chemical substance databases the online tool metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 was used as it offers an automated database search in combination with an in silico fragmentation and ms2 comparison with the observed data the parameters mzppm 5 mzabs 0 005 and the assumed ionization m were used the search was conducted in the databases for ident letzel et al 2016 norman susdat norman network et al 2020 and the comptox of the us epa williams et al 2017 as they are specifically oriented to organic contaminants in the aquatic environment significantly more extensive but also more unspecific was the database pubchem kim et al 2015 with over 100 million entries this was used if no identification could be achieved with the more specific databases in the final step of identification reference standards of the potentially identified compounds were purchased analyzed with the identical data acquisition method and the identity verified by m z tr and ms2 comparison 2 9 time trends time trends were assessed using the loess trend tool 1 1 based on microsoft excel from the german federal environment agency umweltbundesamt uba this tool fitted a locally weighted scatterplot smoother loess with a constant width of 7 years to the annual data points tests of significance for linear and non linear trend components were performed using an analysis of variance anova following the approach of fryer and nicholson 1999 chromatographic peak areas relative to the area of the internal standard bezafibrate d4 were used for this analysis and provide an indication of load changes in spm 2 10 risk characterization in order to assess the ecotoxicological relevance of the identified permanent cations their concentration in spm was estimated to take the maximum level of contamination into consideration the highest relative peak areas of each compound were used to estimate the concentration based on an external calibration with respective reference standards calibration points with concentrations of 0 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 5 and 10 µg l were used and the concentrations in eluate samples were calculated using a linear calibration curve least squares regression to estimate the limit of quantification loq a signal to noise ratio s n of 10 was used subsequently the concentrations in the eluates were converted to the sorbed concentration tables s8 s9 the estimated concentrations were compared with predicted no effect concentrations pnec from laboratory tests in the reach registration dossiers table 2 where ecotoxicological data for sediment dwelling organisms were missing pnecs were predicted from concentrations on a porewater basis and a sediment water sorption coefficient and toxicity to d magna from water only exposure the risk characterization was carried out by applying the risk quotient rq predicted environmental concentration pec pnec european commission 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing the prioritization strategy to examine the prioritization of permanent cations a mix of 161 reference standards was prepared in spm extracts c 1 µg l of these 46 compounds were permanent cationic il qac and qpc the positive charge of permanent cationic compounds is based on quaternary structures of nitrogen or phosphorus atoms while the charge of the other 115 compounds is dependent on the ambient ph table s5 the pka range from 0 7 metolachlor esa to 13 5 n desmethylvenlafaxine a list of pka values is reported in table s3 hermes et al 2019 chemaxon 2021 for simplification substances without a permanent positive charge will be called variable charge compounds in all further chapters of this publication the two prioritization approaches were tested first individually and subsequently in combination in all cases the same reference mix was used and the success was evaluated by the number of prioritized cations and deprioritized variable charge compounds 3 1 1 prioritization by ion exchange following the procedure described in section 2 4 and data evaluation as described above 53 of 161 compounds 33 were prioritized by ion exchange 40 of them were true permanent cationic species 75 however 13 variable charge compounds were prioritized incorrectly giving a false positive error rate of 25 while 6 permanent cationic species were not prioritized giving a false negative error rate of 13 by a closer look at the cationic compounds detected in the treated sample ❷ fig 1 false negatives it could be seen that steric availability of the positive charge seems to have had an impact on this prioritization step for example cations detected in treated samples ❷ showed that space filling alkyl groups shield the positive charge against the exchange groups on the resin and prevent ionic interactions croes et al 1995 this was the case for compounds such as tributyltetradecyl tpp or trimethyloctadecylammonium in addition to steric hindrance of binding interactions repulsive forces could have also occurred mimini et al 2019 the occurrence of such interactions was possible for tpp carboxylic acids which were also found in the false negative group eluate fraction ❸ due to the change from an acidic to a basic milieu the carboxyl group was deprotonated causing a zwitterion molecule which is neutral in total thus the positive charge at the central phosphorus was opposed by a terminal negative charge interfering with binding to the cation exchanger regarding the false positives a ph of 11 5 was calculated for elution with meoh nh3 allowing for prediction of charge states of the false prioritized compounds using pka values according to this 8 compounds were present in their neutral and 5 in their negatively charged form table s6 therefore possible explanations for the false prioritization could be intermolecular interactions of molecules with the hydrophilic matrix of the mcx phase these might cause a retention of compounds on the cartridge even though they were not cations finally splitting the quantity of analytes between the two treated fractions ❷ and ❸ might have led to a dilution and thus reduced the concentrations slightly below the limit of detection lod despite these challenges a partial prioritization was achieved 3 1 2 complementary analysis with non deuterated and deuterated solvents the 46 permanent cationic compounds of the reference mix were considered 39 of which did not have exchangeable hydrogens out of these 35 could be prioritized in the first iteration considering both similar mass δm z 10 ppm and a difference in retention time below 30 s as described in section 2 7 2 in the second iteration coincident detections in both measurements led to the prioritization of 6 out of 7 permanent cations with one exchangeable hydrogen in total 41 of 46 of the cationic reference compounds examined were correctly assigned leading to a final true positive rate of 89 missed assignments could be caused by poor chromatographic separation with solvents containing d2o resulting in non gaussian shaped peaks or two retention time differences outside the calculated 30 s threshold out of 115 examined variable charge reference standards no compound was marked as matching with the same retention time and m z during the first iteration however 6 variable charge compounds were falsely prioritized as permanent cations with one exchangeable hydrogen corresponding to a false positive rate of 5 3 1 3 combining both prioritization strategies due to the considerable time needed for identifying unknown compounds a low false positive rate was the main goal of our study to improve the prioritization of permanent cations and reduce the number of false positives the two prioritization strategies were successively combined the prioritization via ion exchange was done first followed by the prioritization based on complementary measurements with non deuterated and deuterated solvents the initial number of spiked reference standards was reduced during the first prioritization by ion exchange to a total of 53 compounds assigned to the group of permanent cationic compounds fig s3 the remaining 53 compounds were further prioritized based on measurements in non deuterated and deuterated solvents confining to permanent cationic compounds with a maximum of one exchangeable hydrogen 36 cationic compounds 22 of all features with a true positive rate of 78 were prioritized in the combined process of prioritization these included 34 cationic compounds without and two with one exchangeable hydrogen in contrast none of the variable charge compounds were prioritized 0 false positive table s5 the combination of both prioritization strategies noticeably lowered the true positive rate but at the same time also significantly reduced the false positive rate when analyzing complex environmental samples such as spm our focus was on keeping the false positive rate as low as possible even if this causes a reduction in true positives schulze et al 2020 since identification of new compounds is the rate determining step in non target analysis ideally only features derived from permanent cations are pre selected for that step in the workflow 3 2 analysis of environmental samples the analysis of riverine exposure was performed with spm samples from the rhine at koblenz river km 590 3 and the saar at rehlingen river km 54 2 prior to prioritizing permanent cationic compounds the results of the full scan qtof ms measurements were cleaned from false positive detections by deleting all features not present in each triplicate sample alignment and blank correction initially the number of aligned features added up to 18 446 and was reduced to 2695 distinct features across all samples by the pre processing steps in the first prioritization step the interactions of the analyte molecules with the cation exchanger were considered in the treated samples and eluates ❷ ❸ 1722 of 2695 features were detected correspondingly this means that 973 features from the spm extracts could not be detected in the treated samples due to their strong interactions with the ion exchanger and were therefore prioritized this corresponds to 36 of the features whereas 64 were removed from the data the prioritization was refined by comparative analyses with non deuterated and deuterated solvents therefore the retention times of all features in the samples with deuterated solvents were first corrected see section 2 7 2 in the following alignment and mass correction steps a total number of 123 13 features were prioritized as permanent cationic compounds from this total 76 were detected in both river spms 32 only in the rhine spm and 15 only in the saar spm combining both prioritization steps a final fraction of 4 potentially permanent cationic features was prioritized considering the number of exchangeable hydrogens 83 features indicated no exchangeable hydrogen and 40 features indicated one exchangeable hydrogen this distinction could help in the subsequent identification of unknown compounds to elucidate their chemical structure tolonen et al 2005 therefore by applying sample pretreatment and filtering of nts data in a combinatorial approach a large reduction in feature number and predictive prioritization of permanent cations was achieved 3 3 identification 3 3 1 qacs and qpcs out of 123 prioritized features the 100 most intense ones were selected for identification since for low intensities the ms2 spectra are either incomplete or not recorded at all by annotation with an in house spectra database 7 qac and 6 qpc could be directly identified table 1 this was done by comparing the measured data with those of analytical reference standards according to the characteristics m z ms2 and retention time jewell et al 2020 figs s4 s16 more compounds were identified by a workflow with genform and metfrag in a first step the ms1 and ms2 spectra were used to calculate the molecular formulae of the candidates between one and 25 different molecular formulae were obtained for each feature considered for four features fragmentation patterns were observed that were comparable to those of tpp compounds and typical for this compound class brand et al 2018 schlüsener et al 2015 the fragmentation pattern resulted from the separation of the fourth group followed by the successive separation of phenyl groups fragments with m z 263 0984 c18h16p 185 0515 c12h10p and 108 0123 c6h5p were detected for all tpp compounds known so far for this reason the presence of phosphorus was assumed for calculating the molecular formulae for these compounds reducing the number of possible molecular formulae for each of these four features to between one and seven subsequently potential structures for the unknown compounds were elucidated by in silico fragmentation and database searches and if possible tentative chemical structures were further supported by information regarding their use or consumption production volumes final candidates were identified using first the database norman susdat 6 identified compounds maximum 3 structures each suggested and second pubchem 1 identified compound maximum 36 structures suggested reference standards for all seven candidates were obtained figs s17 s22 three qacs dioctyldimethylammonium oleyltrimethylammonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium were finally confirmed by comparison with purchased reference standards the remaining four candidates c6h11o2 c5h9 c4h7o c5h11 tpp were tentatively identified as qpcs this level 3 classification schymanski et al 2014 was based on the fact that no reference standards were available for these compounds but i the ms1 spectra of similar reference standards with the same molecular formula were consistent with the experimental data and ii the fragmentation pattern of tpp compounds could be observed in the ms2 spectra figs s23 s26 some of the compounds have already been reported in environmental studies and identified quantified in surface waters sediments or spm li and brownawell 2009 martinez carballo et al 2007 to the best of our knowledge not reported so far is the occurrence of the two qacs oleyltrimethylammonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium fig 3 furthermore oleyltrimethylammonium is possibly the first qac with an olefinic side chain identified in an environmental sample eicosyltrimethylammonium and oleyltrimethylammonium are used in the european union with a volume of approx 10 t a per registrant echa 2021e 2021d the compounds are used in personal care products e g in cosmetics disinfectants and cleaning agents but also in industry as non reactive processing or corrosion inhibitor aids additionally we are not aware of any information on the four other qpcs in the river rhine with the molecular formulae identified and this warrants further studies to confirm their proposed structures 3 3 2 dyes in addition to the qacs and qpcs described above two other permanent cations were identified which are described as organic dyes the feature with the m z of 371 1063 was one of the 10 most intense detections and as with all permanent cations shows no esi adducts only a 13c isotopologue in the component group in addition the comparative measurements with d2o revealed that no exchangeable hydrogen was present the formula calculation with genform resulted in nine suitable candidates considering the calculated formulae c19h19n2o4s showed the lowest mass deviation and the highest score with respect to the ms1 and ms2 spectra with metfrag and the pubchem database 155 possible candidates but only two positively charged compounds with a score 0 7 were suggested furthermore the fragmentation indicated the separation of a methylsulfonyl group ch3o2s m z 78 9854 which was only possible with the candidate substance fluorescent brightener 363 2 6 methoxy 2 benzofuranyl 1 3 dimethyl 5 methylsulfonobenzimidazolium the identification of this candidate was finally confirmed by comparison with a commercially available reference standard figs 3 s27 s28 fluorescent brightener 363 is used in the industry for the production of textiles dyes and impregnation products the annual production import volumes are approx 10 tons per registrant echa 2021a the feature with m z 322 1907 was ranked 41st in intensity among the prioritized features within the component just the 13c isotopologue was assigned to the signal and in d2o chromatography no mass change occurred which suggested no exchangeable hydrogens for the detected m z twelve potential molecular formulae were calculated and checked the formula c20h24n3o showed the lowest mass deviation and a high score with respect to the ms1 and ms2 spectra using norman susdat with metfrag resulted in two equally rated potential candidates for the second listed molecular formula only for one of these candidates was a reference standard commercially available and measurements with this standard led to the unambiguous identification of the cationic dye basic yellow 28 2 4 methoxyphenyl methylhydrazono methyl 1 3 3 trimethyl 3h indolium figs 3 s29 s30 basic yellow 28 is used as a dye in the manufacture of paper products polymers and textiles the quantities used are recorded to be less than 10 t a per registrant echa 2021b to the best of our knowledge neither dye has been detected in the aquatic environment so far 3 4 temporal trends of identified compounds due to the high sorption affinity of cationic compounds to sediments and spm temporal monitoring in these riverine compartments is very important especially for the recently identified compounds or those not included in routine monitoring programs the evaluation of temporal trends can provide important results with respect to sediment management increasing trends can be identified and counteracted by regulatory steps in order to assess which of the identified compounds might gain relevance due to increasing loads temporal trends examined from annual composite samples of rhine spm at koblenz and saar spm at rehlingen between 2006 and 2018 were evaluated 3 4 1 qacs for the identified qacs eicosyltrimethylammonium and oleyltrimethylammonium which have not been described as environmental contaminants so far a significant linear increase p 0 01 was observed in the rhine spm fig 4 based on the loess treated data a high and significant percentage increase of 329 increase by factor 4 p 0 01 was calculated for eicosyltrimethylammonium and 67 p 0 01 for oleyltrimethylammonium for the rehlingen spm using both linear and non linear models a significant fit p 0 02 for oleyltrimethylammonium was observed although a 161 increase was determined the percentage change was not significant the trend of eicosyltrimethylammonium for the rehlingen spm showed no significant changes either 16 p 0 64 significant increasing linear trends p 0 02 in the rhine spm could also be observed for the qacs dimethyldioctylammonium change 63 p 0 01 and octyldecyldimethylammonium change 55 p 0 01 in addition the load of the bitter substance denatonium increased significantly by 222 p 0 01 in contrast the same compounds in saar spm showed linear decreasing trends in peak areas with changes of 54 p 0 01 and 37 not significant indicating decreasing loads of these qacs in the spm an exception was denatonium which showed a strong significant linear increase in the saar spm p 0 01 with a percentage change of 274 p 0 01 in summary all identified qacs in the rhine spm with the exception of benzyldimethyldecylammonium showed a significant increasing linear trend resulting in an increasing contamination of the rhine spm with different qacs from 2006 to 2018 for the river saar we found opposite trends with the exception of denatonium and oleyltrimethylammonium all compounds considered showed a decreasing trend of their concentrations from 2006 to 2018 the study of lege et al 2017 suggested that the bitter substance denatonium is ubiquitously discharged into the environment via wastewater treatment plants that may imply that increasing trends in the rhine and saar might also be observed in the spm of other rivers additional trend plots can be found in fig s31 in the si the comparison of the spm samples from the rivers rhine and saar revealed large differences in the detected normalized peak areas of the qacs qacs in the saar spm showed peak areas that are on average a factor of 5 for oleyltrimethylammonium a factor of 13 higher than in the rhine spm a possible reason for this difference could be the different proportion of treated wastewater in the two rivers for the river rhine the wastewater proportion at annual mean flow rate was reported at about 5 schlüsener et al 2015 using the persistent substance carbamazepine as indicator for treated wastewater the proportion for the river saar was calculated to be about 15 boulard et al 2020 in addition different matrix effects of the spm samples could have an impact on the results making further investigations necessary at this point nevertheless despite this uncertainty it seems likely that the saar is more exposed to the qacs studied than the other site especially oleyltrimethylammonium however the opposing trends of the substance in the two rivers could reverse this situation in the near future 3 4 2 qpcs all identified qpcs with the exception of methoxymethyl tpp showed significant increases in temporal trends in the rhine spm fig 5 this was most evident for c5h9 tpp 410 increase by factor 5 p 0 01 furthermore average increases of more than 190 0 01 p 0 02 were observed for the other qpcs as well fig 6 shows strongly increasing levels for almost all qpcs in the years 2015 to 2018 in the river rhine at koblenz with the exception of methoxymethyl tpp with lower normalized peak areas in recent years in particular the two qpcs ethyl tpp and butyl tpp showed percentage increase rates of 110 and 76 respectively whereas in the period 2006 to 2014 changes of 35 and 13 were observed in contrast for methoxymethyl tpp an increase of 678 was calculated in the first period of comparison but a decrease of 69 was observed from 2015 onwards this was unexpected based on the observations of brand et al 2018 which at that time reached to the year 2015 only methyl tpp continues the trend stated there fig s31 no significant change according to schlüsener et al 2015 the emission of qpcs is mainly caused by chemical processes such as the wittig reaction or by phase transfer catalysis weidlich and martínková 2012 therefore these trend changes could be due to modifications in production processes for example the substitution of methoxymethyl tpp with other qpcs however the short time frame 2015 2018 requires continuing trend analysis to support the hypothesis of trend reversal the consistently increasing time trends for the other qpcs indicate that further monitoring of these compounds should be considered in the future in the saar spm ethyl tpp was the only qpc identified no significant trend could be observed during the studied period however the detected peak areas indicate a negative tendency additional trend plots can be found in fig s31 in the si 3 4 3 dyes the temporal trends of the organic dye basic yellow 28 showed decreasing trends in the annual spm samples of the rivers rhine and saar fig 6 a significant linear and non linear fit as well as a decrease of 80 p 0 01 was observed for the rhine spm indicating a reduction of the concentrations especially from 2006 to 2010 the negative trend was very pronounced while no significant changes occurred from 2011 onwards the significant decrease of the dye in the rhine spm at the beginning of the period might indicate a reduced production or use of the dye in the chemical industry located in the rhine catchment area echa 2021b for the saar spm a significant linear decrease p 0 03 was observed over the entire study period but without statistically significant change of peak areas both the trend patterns in the two rivers after 2011 as well as similar normalized peak areas suggest a comparable loading of the substance to the spm in the upcoming years fluorescent brightener 363 was detected exclusively in the rhine spm whereby no significant changes in the trend were observed fluorescent brightener 363 is used as a fluorescent whitening agent fwa for example for polyacrylonitrile fibers gruetter et al 2014 and manufactured processed in the range of 10 100 t a in the european economic area echa 2021a this suggests a discharge by the chemical industry and could explain the strong deviation due to production alteration 3 5 ecotoxicological relevance compared to other chemical groups few data are available for the effects of the cationic compounds in the environment tables s12 s13 this is particularly evident in ecotoxicity data for sediment dwelling organisms because the testing requirements are in general higher than for freshwater organisms echa 2017 an experimentally derived pnec for sediment dwelling organisms was only available for eicosyltrimethylammonium with respect to all qacs detected in the suspended solids based on this estimated value i e 1250 µg kg weight a risk to sediment organisms was rated by comparison to the highest estimated concentration 1400 µg kg 2011 evaluated for the saar time series table s11 a risk quotient of 1 1 rq was calculated from these numbers indicating a potential risk for sediment communities for all other qacs risks were estimated using pnecs from d magna based on an equilibrium partitioning approach the pnec values tables 2 s14 of the individual qacs showed a high variability between 16 4 and 68 000 µg kg and did not indicate a risk compared to the pec in comparison the pnecs for the phosphonium compounds ranged from 8 4 to 1700 µg kg respectively from these data a risk was derived for ethyl triphenylphosphonium rq 12 and methoxymethyl triphenylphosphonium rq 3 3 in spm from the river rhine table s10 whereas all other estimated qpc concentrations from the rivers saar and rhine were below the respective derived pnecs for the two dyes basic yellow 28 and fluorescent brightener 363 maximum concentrations of 400 and 1000 µg kg were estimated in the spm time series from the river rhine in contrast in spm from river saar only basic yellow 28 was detected with a lower concentration of 30 µg kg interestingly compared to the sorption coefficients of the previously mentioned qacs and qpcs rather low koc values of 19 1 estimated according to oecd 121 and 0 55 l kg estimated by using euses v 2 1 2 were reported for basic yellow 28 echa 2021b and fluorescent brightener 363 echa 2021a respectively an underestimation cannot be excluded but other experimentally derived partitioning coefficients from batch experiments with sediments were not available considering the low available estimated koc and applying the equilibrium partitioning led to low pnecs for sediment dwelling organisms and the estimated concentrations in spm indicated a potentially strong risk for the environment with respect to organisms in the benthic zone for the river rhine basic yellow 28 exceeded the pnec by a factor of 500 rq and fluorescent brightener 363 by a factor of almost 50 rq 48 the risk quotient for basic yellow 28 in the saar was 38 in the same way as for the qacs and qpcs meaningful data on adsorption coefficients and toxicity to sediment dwellers are required for the cationic dyes as well as data on concentration in the water phase that allow comparison with aquatic organisms 4 conclusion the application of this nts based prioritization strategy for organic cationic compounds to suspended particulate matter has shown that in addition to the two qacs eicosyl and oleyltrimethylammonium the organic dyes basic yellow 28 and fluorescent brightener 363 are present in river basins which to the best of our knowledge have not yet been observed previously in environmental samples sediments and spm in particular offer a good opportunity to focus on compounds of this special class with their unique physicochemical properties however the complex matrix required a strict prioritization due to the large number of background detections even though the results of tests with spiked standards showed that permanent cations especially those with the positive charge being protected by space filling groups or those with more than one exchangeable hydrogen might be overlooked the selected approach provided an efficient prioritization and successful identification of 22 permanent cationic compounds the temporal trend analyses for spm time series from the rhine indicate that contamination with a range of qacs and qpcs has increased since 2005 which may lead to a long lasting pollution of sediments and spm in addition the estimated concentrations in the spm of rhine and saar rivers exceeded the pnecs of basic yellow 28 fluorescent brightener 363 ethyltriphenylphosphonium and eicosyltrimethylammonium partially to a considerable extent indicating potential risks for the aquatic environment despite this knowledge ecotoxicological data for these environmental compartments hyporheic zone are often poorly available making it difficult to assess the consequences of increasing trends therefore the applied method is a useful approach to expand the knowledge of permanently cationic compounds in the environment by identifying unknown compounds and examining their temporal trends thereby prioritizing research into their ecotoxicological relevance although similar observations have been made in several studies of sediment cores heyde et al 2021 chiaia hernandez et al 2013 to our knowledge trend analysis of annual spm samples for qacs and qpcs over a period greater than 10 years is currently unprecedented in this regard this study highlights the potential of the combined use of nts and both retrospective and prospective trend monitoring and its
