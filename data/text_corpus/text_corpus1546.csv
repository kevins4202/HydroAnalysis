7730,study region the southern hills aquifer system shas in the louisiana capital area groundwater conservation district cagcd usa study focus the shas provides abundant groundwater for public and industrial supplies in the cagcd groundwater depletion saltwater intrusion and land subsidence are potential concerns due to prolonged excessive groundwater withdrawals this study develops a high fidelity groundwater flow model utilizing a complex unstructured grid to investigate groundwater flow and storage responses to excessive groundwater withdrawals for the shas in the cagcd the groundwater model incorporates the mississippi river alluvial aquifer down to the miocene sands extending to depths around 1 km new hydrological insights groundwater modeling results indicate large cones of depression in the evangeline and jasper formations in the baton rouge area due to prolonged groundwater withdrawals low permeability faults are inferred by significant groundwater level difference across the faults while local groundwater storage depletion in deeper aquifers is evident overall estimated groundwater storage changes of the shas in the cagcd are close to zero in the past two decades indicating insignificant groundwater storage changes this is attributed to dominant interactions between the major rivers and the shallower alluvial aquifer in addition the simulated groundwater storage changes exhibit patterns similar to those derived by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace model that has been used in evaluation of groundwater depletion in many

mississippi river alluvial aquifer shas southern hills aquifer system shas mraa shas excluding mraa δgws groundwater storage change 1 introduction the southern hills aquifer system shas one of three most heavily pumped aquifer systems in the state of louisiana along the gulf of mexico coast of the united states prakken and wright 2009 is the primary source of freshwater for public and industrial supply for the louisiana capital area groundwater conservation district cagcd or district in southeastern louisiana buono 1983 in 2015 767 000 cubic meters 203 million gallons of groundwater were withdrawn every day of which 44 were used for public supply and 40 were used for industries collier and sargent 2018 the shas was established as a sole source aquifer by the u s environmental protection agency owing to its essentiality to drinking water the shas is a part of the coastal lowlands aquifer system clas along the gulf of mexico weiss 1990 and comprises a series of intricately interbedded sandy and clayey formations that generally range in age from pleistocene at the top pliocene in the middle to miocene at the base buono 1983 the formations extend from the miocene aquifer system and citronelle formation in the southwestern mississippi and thicken as they dip toward the baton rouge area the permeable citronelle formation in the southwestern mississippi and pinch out formations in the northern parishes of the southeastern louisiana form recharge zones that are the source of groundwater for the shas boswell 1979 in the baton rouge area the major reactivated growth fault namely baton rouge br fault acts as a leaky barrier to the northward groundwater movement and saltwater intrusion morgan and winner 1964 tomaszewski 1996 prior to the groundwater development in the 1940 s groundwater flowed toward the surface due to its upward hydraulic gradient morgan 1963 in the subsequent decades however extracting large amounts of groundwater from the shas for public and industrial supplies caused significant groundwater level declines as much as 108 m in the 2000 foot sand heywood et al 2014 reduced upward groundwater flow from deep aquifers and created hydraulic gradients conducive to saltwater encroachment toward pumping centers in north of the br fault where freshwater was previously contained rollo 1969 tomaszewski 1996 whiteman 1979 furthermore groundwater level declines led to compaction of interbedded clay resulting in irreversible land subsidence in the baton rouge area during 1934 1976 whiteman 1980 to thoroughly investigate saltwater intrusion mitigation and land subsidence induced by excessive groundwater withdrawals it is imperative to first understand groundwater flow dynamics and how groundwater flow responds to the withdrawals from the shas past studies have pointed out that decreasing water levels were observed at multiple wells in the baton rouge area with respect to increasing pumping rates morgan 1961 prakken and wright 2009 renken 1998 tomaszewski et al 2002 while the variations of groundwater storage induced by groundwater withdrawals for the shas have rarely been discussed it is essential to quantify volumetric groundwater storage change to understand the severity of groundwater depletion numerical groundwater flow modeling is commonly used to evaluate the flow dynamics and storage change in aquifer systems cao et al 2013 döll et al 2014 de graaf et al 2017 pham and tsai 2017 scanlon et al 2012 the clas regional groundwater flow models detect discharge areas in the shas and upward groundwater flow from lower pleistocene and miocene deposits to upper pleistocene and holocene deposits for pre development conditions martin and whiteman 1989 williamson et al 1990 under development conditions of 1980 most of the discharge areas turned into recharge areas and downward groundwater flow was created as a result of excessive groundwater withdrawals from deep aquifers martin and whiteman 1989 a previous shas groundwater flow model also confirms the downward groundwater flow and indicates that groundwater storage responds to groundwater withdrawals heywood et al 2014 however the model structure could be too simple to have a realistic estimate of groundwater fluxes for the deep confined aquifers de graaf et al 2017 in addition implicit simulation of upper aquifers surficial recharge and river aquifer interactions could affect estimation of groundwater flow and storage associated with groundwater withdrawals pham and tsai 2017 constructed a complex groundwater flow model to investigate groundwater storage and flow patterns in the br aquifer system and demonstrate a significant groundwater storage loss in 2014 relative to 1975 due to large groundwater withdrawals and limited recharges through leaky faults nevertheless the evaluations are limited to lateral flow exchanges rather than exchanges in vertical direction that could be crucial for local groundwater resources management this study thoroughly investigates groundwater flow and storage responses to excessive groundwater withdrawals for the shas in the cagcd by developing a high fidelity three dimensional groundwater flow model based on a complex model structure that improves the simplicity of the past model structures the model structure is constructed using lithological modeling vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 and comprises of non uniform discretization both in horizontal and vertical directions a high resolution horizontal grid along the br fault system is nested within a coarser parent grid to reduce computational costs utilization of an unstructured grid in the complex model structure potentially provides the benefit of reducing computational cost with respect to use of a regular uniform grid panday et al 2013 unstructured vertical discretization represented directly by hydrogeological layers can replicate complex geological features e g faults unconformities and pinch outs more efficiently than uniform model layers fischer et al 2015 pham and tsai 2017 this study adopts the united states geological survey s usgs modflow usg model which is capable of handling flow simulation in non uniform unstructured grids panday et al 2013 this study evaluates the groundwater responses under parameter uncertainty and verifies groundwater storage change with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data that have been used in evaluation of groundwater depletion in many regional studies feng et al 2013 rodell et al 2007 rateb et al 2020 yeh et al 2006 it is also noted that groundwater modeling tools capable of handling unstructured grid would not be limited to modflow usg which is utilized in this study 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area includes the five parishes of east baton rouge ebr west baton rouge wbr pointe coupee pc east feliciana ef and west feliciana wf in the southeastern louisiana fig 1 which covers five of the six parishes in the cagcd the topography of the study area varies from 124 m navd 88 in the north to 0 m navd 88 in the south the study area located in the southwest of the shas encompasses a sequence of intricately interbedded interconnected alluvial freshwater bearing clayey and sandy strata varying in age from miocene to holocene dipping south toward the gulf of mexico griffith 2003 the hydrogeologic framework of the study area comprises four clas hydrogeologic units regional scale to the depth of 1000 m which are the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa the chicot formation chct the evangeline formation evgl and the jasper formation jsp in the stratigraphic sequence order teeple et al 2020 the geological formations refer to permeable sands interbedded by clays with their depth of occurrence however clays can be thick enough to form low permeable layers in some places aquifers in the study area were named based on the depths that they are observed in the baton rouge area for a subregional scale meyer and turcan 1955 a regional scale hydrogeologic unit can include a number of subregional scale aquifers table 1 shows the stratigraphic relationship between the regional scale hydrogeologic units and the subregional scale aquifers in the study area two major west to east trending growth faults the denham springs scotlandville fault and the baton rouge fault across the east baton rouge and west baton rouge parishes fig 1a were reactivated in the late pleistocene with increasing displacements in depth hanor 1982 mcculloh and heinrich 2013 the fault surface traces west of the mississippi river were eroded mcculloh and heinrich 2013 approximated the extent of the disappeared traces the baton rouge fault is a leaky barrier that impedes northward movement of saltwater on the south side of the baton rouge fault tomaszewski 1996 whiteman 1979 the denham springs scotlandville fault is also conjectured to be a leaky fault elshall et al 2013 pham and tsai 2017 this study collected monthly groundwater level data from 310 usgs observation wells as well as river lake water level data from 20 gage stations fig 1c between 2004 and 2020 four rivers mississippi river atchafalaya river amite river and comite river and two oxbow lakes false river and raccourci old river were considered in the groundwater model monthly pumping rates of 577 pumping wells fig 1d were collected from the cagcd the usgs and the agricultural center at louisiana state university most of the public supply and industrial wells are concentrated in the east baton rouge and west baton rouge parishes about 8 of the pumping wells are deeper than 700 m navd 88 2 2 lithofacies modeling on unstructured grid to build a high fidelity groundwater model this study interpreted 727 electric logs figs 1a and 4577 drillers logs fig 1b into sequences of high permeability sand facies and low permeability clay facies to build a lithology model more than 90 of the drillers logs are above 200 m navd 88 north american vertical datum of 1988 about 14 of the electric logs are deeper than 800 m navd 88 the majority of which are in the east baton rouge parish to provide subsurface geologic information for deep aquifers the process of building a lithology model includes tessellation of the domain discretization translation of data interpolation and back translation of the results vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 the usgs national hydrogeologic grid nhg clark et al 2018 was employed as the parent grid for the study area the nhg cell size is 1 km the grid resolution was gradually decreased to a cell size of 32 m around the fault traces mcculloh and heinrich 2013 as shown in fig 2a to form a horizontal unstructured grid the number of 2d cells is 34 246 voronoi cells were used to refine the grid around the faults the study area was tessellated into four tiles to account for unconformity between the mraa and its underlying chicot formation as well as discontinuity at the fault traces fig 2b the structural dip slope for the mraa is about 0 0005 and about 0 005 for the chicot evangeline and jasper formations hosman 1996 weiss 1990 the shas without mraa was split into three tiles the denham springs scotlandville fault separates the north tile and the middle tile the baton rouge fault separates the middle tile and the south tile the mraa tile envelopes the three tiles in the west the unstructured grid was mapped to the four tiles such that each tile has its own grid the drillers logs up to a depth of around 120 m 400 ft and electric logs in their full lengths were used to construct a sub lithology model of sands and clays for each tile readers are referred to vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 for details of constructing a lithology model all of the four sub lithology models were assembled into the final lithology model each 3d cell in the model has a different number of surrounding 3d cells to connect to therefore the lithology model is built on a 3d unstructured grid of 1 145 363 cells each 3d cell is labelled as either a sand or a clay cell the lithology model developed in this study is available on hydroshare org chen et al 2022 2 3 groundwater flow model development a modflow usg groundwater model was developed to capture the complexity of the lithology model through an unstructured grid the groundwater model contains a total of 1 145 363 active cells each computational cell may have a different number of connections and may share different faces in contact areas with its neighboring cells therefore unlike typical groundwater models with model layers the model developed in this study did not have model layers an unstructured discretization disu package was generated purely based on the configurations of the computational cells to develop a non layered model then each computational cell was given a cell identification number to build other model packages table 2 lists the key packages used in the groundwater model with additional related information the nearest natural neighbor zonation method combined with pilot points doherty et al 2010 was adopted to parameterize hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s of sands in the layer property flow lpf package the number of pilot points assigned to each hydrologic unit varies the hydrogeologic unit bedding surfaces were delineated based on the published data teeple et al 2020 this study considers homogeneous k and s s for the mraa 2 pilot points homogeneous k and s s for clays 2 pilot points and heterogeneous k and s s with various number of pilot points for the chicot evangeline and jasper formations table 1 isotropic hydraulic conductivity was assumed values at the pilot points were estimated through model calibration explained in a next section hydraulic conductivity values are bounded by the usgs aquifer test data of the gulf coastal regional aquifer system prudic 1991 specific storage values are bounded by field values from aquifer properties kuang et al 2020 this study aims to investigate groundwater conditions in the deep confined aquifers where a major amount of groundwater was withdrawn thus a confined aquifer system was assumed such that specific yield was not considered in the groundwater model four rivers of mississippi river atchafalaya river amite river and comite river as well as two oxbow lakes of false river and raccourci old river were modeled utilizing the general head boundary ghb package supplementary materials fig s2 shows the locations where the rivers and lakes connect to their underlying aquifer based on the lithology model and bathymetry information these connections were the major consideration in developing the ghb package each connection was assigned with monthly river lake stage data either from usgs or usace gage stations and a riverbed lakebed leakance value individual riverbed and lakebed leakance were assumed homogenous and each was assigned one pilot point riverbed and lakebed leakance values ranging from 0 001 to 4 52 day 1 were determined based on published case studies cherkauer and taylor 1990 chen and chen 2003 dysart et al 1999 the time variant specified head chd package was applied to the model boundaries specified groundwater levels at boundaries were estimated based on historical groundwater levels and pilot points placed at the model boundaries table 2 shows the number of chd pilot points for different hydrogeologic units the horizontal flow barrier hfb package was used to simulate the low permeability baton rouge fault and denham springs scotlandville fault pilot points for different hydrogeologic units were placed along the fault traces to estimate zonal hydraulic characteristics of faults table 2 hydraulic characteristic values ranging from 1 10 7 to 4 3 10 1 day 1 were based on the past modeling results elshall et al 2015 pham and tsai 2017 the monthly recharge rates reitz and sanford 2019 were applied to the surficial sand cells to build a recharge rch package unavailable recharge rates after 2015 were estimated by averaging the corresponding monthly recharge rates from 2003 to 2015 the drain drn package was applied to surficial sands to avoid the issue of flooding cells by removing excessive recharge rates from reitz and sanford 2019 by this way effective surficial recharge can be estimated this study employed the connected linear network cln package to obtain simulated groundwater levels at observation wells for the model calibration purpose a connector well that conveys groundwater from the 800 foot sand to the 1500 foot sand was also modeled in the cln package pumping wells with single screen and multiple screens were modeled by combining the well wel package and the cln package well configurations were obtained from the louisiana department of natural resources ldnr monthly groundwater pumpage data from 2004 to 2020 were provided by the cagcd the usgs and the lsu agricultural center groundwater is supplied to the public industry agriculture aquaculture livestock and power generation supplementary materials fig s3 the major users are public and industry which consume groundwater on a monthly average of 10 3 million m3 and 8 5 million m3 respectively the monthly average of the total pumpage is 20 8 million m3 2 4 model calibration and validation historical monthly groundwater levels from 2004 to 2020 4964 data points were used for model calibration and validation coefficient of variation at each observation well was calculated to evaluate the variability of the groundwater level data it was found that 90 of the observation wells exhibit coefficient of variation less than 10 the low variability of data indicates a limited impact on model calibration results by choices of splitting into calibration dataset and validation dataset thus this study used 1516 groundwater levels from 2004 to 2008 30 of observed data to estimate 148 pilot point values through the model calibration process then the groundwater model was validated by 3448 groundwater levels from 2009 to 2020 70 of observed data monthly stress periods were adopted in the groundwater model to maintain consistency with available monthly pumpage records from 2004 to 2020 values of 148 pilot points are estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse using eq 1 1 min p rmse 1 n i 1 n h i o b s h i p 2 where h i o b s and h i are the observed and simulated groundwater levels respectively n is the number of the observed groundwater levels and p is the vector of values of pilot points to be estimated the dimension of p is the number of pilot points nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is also calculated using eq 2 to evaluate the model performance 2 nse 1 i 1 n h i o b s h i 2 i 1 n h i o b s h o b s 2 where h o b s is the average of observed groundwater levels each groundwater model run took about 0 5 an hour to expedite the model calibration the groundwater model was calibrated through a steady state model in the first stress period and then through a transient model for the rest of the stress periods using the steady state model the values of 123 pilot points without 25 pilot points associated with specific storage were estimated first this study utilized the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy cma es hansen et al 2003 a stochastic and derivative free search algorithm to minimize the rmse the cma es has been implemented to parallel computing and has the capability of providing a full covariance matrix of estimated parameters to quantify uncertainty for high fidelity groundwater models elshall et al 2015 pham and tsai 2017 vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 the cma es search algorithm was paralleled on lsu s supermike ii cluster with 440 computing nodes 2 5 water budget analysis monthly groundwater storage change in the shas was estimated using eq 3 3 δ gws r q q chd q ghb where δgws is the monthly groundwater storage change r is the effective surficial recharge q is the groundwater pumping rate q chd is the net flux from the time variant specified head boundaries a positive q chd value represents that the shas receives groundwater from the model boundaries and a negative value represents that the shas discharges groundwater to the model boundaries q ghb is the net river lake aquifer interaction flux a positive q ghb value represents that river lake recharge the shas whereas a negative value represents that the shas discharges groundwater to river lake 2 6 grace derived groundwater storage change monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies data landerer 2021 measured by grace mission tapley et al 2004 was scaled and used to estimate groundwater storage anomalies this study followed the approach in rodell and famiglietti 2002 to isolate groundwater storage anomalies by removing land water storage anomalies derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah model rodell et al 2020 to compare with the grace derived groundwater storage change month groundwater storage change δgws from the shas model was converted to uniform groundwater depth cm over the entire 1 degree grid cell 3 results 3 1 lithology model several hydrogeologic features are revealed in the lithology model shown in fig 3 first 19 of the study area is covered by surficial sands most of which are situated in the north fig 3a this indicates that surficial recharge in both the east baton rouge and west baton rouge parishes is limited as it is also in the entire mraa area second the cross sections confirm complex interconnected sand depositions interbedded with clays fig 3b d many clays are vertically extensive within individual hydrogeologic units a distinct confining unit separates the evangeline and jasper formations griffith 2003 third distinct displacements up to around 100 m around the denham springs scotlandville fault and the baton rouge fault are also revealed in the lithology model displacements at the baton rouge fault are greater than those at the denham springs scotlandville fault elshall et al 2013 more cross sections of the lithology model are provided in the supplementary materials fig s1 juxtaposition of the sub lithology models of the middle tile and the south tile creates the leaky windows along the baton rouge fault fig 3e color blue where groundwater can flow from the sand on the south side to the sand on the north side and vice versa color white represents either clay on both the south and north sides or clay on the south side which restricts horizontal groundwater flow similarly juxtaposition of the sub lithology models of the north tile and the middle tile creates the leaky windows along the denham springs scotlandville fault fig 3 f it cannot be emphasized enough the complexity of the leaky windows at these two faults 3 2 model calibration and validation the values of 123 pilot points were first estimated through the steady state model and an rmse of 2 82 m was achieved then using the transient model and prior information from the steady state model the values of all the 148 pilot points were estimated by the cma es and an rmse of 2 86 was achieved fig 4a which is satisfactory in comparison to the past developed groundwater models for areas smaller than the study area in this article a range of rmse of 1 44 2 95 m from elshall et al 2015 an rmse of 3 76 m from pham and tsai 2017 an nse value of 0 983 was obtained which indicates a very small estimation error variance the estimated values or range of values of the pilot points associated with model parameters in the hydrogeologic units and the rivers are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively the groundwater model was validated by 3448 groundwater levels from 2009 to 2020 fig 4b an rmse value of 3 31 m and nse value of 0 981 were obtained indicating good model performance in this period 3 3 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses the means and the covariance matrix of estimated parameters from the cma es were used to generate 150 realizations through the latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 uncertainty analysis was conducted to evaluate the variability of the groundwater model output associated with model parameter uncertainties as shown in fig 4c f at four observation wells in the four hydrogeologic units observed groundwater levels are generally within one standard deviation bound in the model calibration period 2004 2008 and in the model verification period 2009 2020 indicating that the groundwater model is capable of replicating the historical behaviors of groundwater it is also interesting to see that the width of the one standard deviation bound increases in deeper formations at these four wells indicating that simulated groundwater levels in the shallower mraa formation are less sensitive than those in the deeper jasper formation to the corresponding parameter uncertainties composite scaled sensitivities css hill 1998 were calculated to compare the importance of model parameters with respect to spatial and temporal variation of simulated groundwater levels for the observation wells the css values of the 148 pilot points supplementary materials fig s4 confirm that hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers except for the mraa are the most sensitive parameters to the simulated groundwater levels followed by the specified groundwater levels at the model boundaries high sensitivity in hydraulic conductivity impacted by long term pumping is also found in the sensitivity analysis by chen and chen 2003 the hydraulic characteristic of the baton rouge fault in the jasper formation also shows a noticeable sensitivity value due to adjacent pumping effect otherwise the rest of the parameters have relatively low sensitivity values 3 4 groundwater conditions in the shas averaged groundwater levels in 2004 2020 fig 5a as high as 38 50 m below navd 88 in the east and west feliciana parishes are due to the surficial recharge to the outcrop zones of the shas and citronelle aquifers boswell 1979 groundwater flow direction is generally from northeast to the south and southwest which is consistent with the geological information on dip direction the distinct cone of depression in between the baton rouge fault and the denham springs scotlandville fault with groundwater level as low as 10 35 m below navd 88 is the result of prolonged groundwater pumping for the public supply and industrial uses collier and sargent 2018 based on the 150 parameter realizations groundwater levels in the area between the two faults show high uncertainties up to 4 7 m in terms of standard deviation especially along the baton rouge fault fig 5b these high uncertainties are likely attributable to the high sensitivities of hydraulic conductivity in the evangeline and jasper formations and the hydraulic characteristic of the baton rouge fault in the jasper formation where significant groundwater pumping activities are conducted supplementary materials fig s4 detailed averaged groundwater levels 2004 2020 in each hydrogeologic unit shows that flow directions are generally from north to south and from east to west fig 5c as shown in the cross sections groundwater levels are significantly low in the evangeline and jasper formations due to substantial groundwater withdrawals for industrial use and public supply the groundwater levels declined to 30 60 m below navd 88 groundwater level differences across the baton rouge fault with a maximum of 58 m are remarkable as shown in these cross sections due to low fault permeability table 3 and significant fault throws fig 3b groundwater level differences across the denham springs scotlandville fault are also noticeable 38 m maximum more cross sections of the simulated groundwater levels are provided in supplementary materials fig s5 3 5 groundwater storage change in the shas monthly groundwater storage change δgws relative to january 2004 and their uncertainties based on the standard deviation bounds are shown in fig 6a the δgws uncertainty estimated using the 150 parameter realizations is negligible which provides confidence in the monthly cumulative δgws the line chart in fig 6a the monthly cumulative δgws represents either gaining or losing storage of that month relative to the storage in january 2004 the monthly δgws is generally within 5 million m3 day and its fluctuations align with the variations of net fluxes between the river lake and aquifer indicating that river lake aquifer interactions dominate the groundwater storage changes consecutive groundwater storage depletion between 2005 and 2008 and through 2013 2015 were due to the low river stages in these years the huge storage gains in the years 2019 and 2020 were the result of prolonged high water stages in the mississippi river the river stage was above the flood stage for 222 days of 2019 and 165 days of 2020 at the gage station of the red river landing overall the groundwater model estimates that the shas gained about 203 million m3 of groundwater at the end of 2020 with respect to the year 2004 largely from the rivers the river lake impact on the δgws in the shas is shown in fig 6b the net river lake aquifer fluxes vary in a wide range and have a high pearson s correlation coefficient value r 0 87 with the δgws as a result δgws varies according to the net fluxes passing the model boundaries which results in a negative r 0 61 nevertheless the positive net boundary fluxes imply the effect of the reversed flow direction caused by pumping in the south groundwater withdrawals have low negative pearson s correlation coefficient value r 0 23 with δgws indicating that groundwater pumping has a significant local effect in the baton rouge area but has a limited impact in terms of the entire district this is evident as the pumping rate about 1 million m3 day is a fraction of the δgws up to 6 million m3 day effective surficial recharge was estimated only 5 of the recharge rates provided by reitz and sanford 2019 relatively small in comparison to the other flux components the effective surficial recharge rate has negligible pearson s correlation coefficient value r 0 07 river aquifer flow direction depends on local hydraulic gradient across the interface in general mississippi river and atchafalaya river recharge the mraa during the flood season fig 7a and receive groundwater during the non flood season fig 7b while the false river and raccourci old river oxbow lakes constantly recharge the mraa amite river in the north constantly receives groundwater from the shas fig 7 due to high groundwater levels in the citronelle aquifer boswell 1979 comite river has negligible interactions with aquifers 3 6 comparisons with grace derived δgws the targeted 1 degree grid cell in grace model is shown in fig 8a 65 of which covered by the current groundwater model simulation years 2004 2020 and a small part of the chicot aquifer groundwater model simulation years 2004 2014 vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 the area between the two groundwater models is the atchafalaya river basin with low pumping activity the magnitude of simulated δgws in 2004 2014 for the two groundwater models is similar to that in 2015 2020 for the shas groundwater model indicating that the δgws in the chicot aquifer portion is insignificant fig 8b the grace derived δgws generally exhibits higher magnitudes than the simulated δgws the interquartile ranges of the grace derived δgws in 2004 2014 and 2015 2020 are about 3 5 and 4 5 times greater than those of the simulated δgws respectively fig 8c nevertheless pearson s correlation coefficient values r 0 62 for 2004 2014 and r 0 63 for 2015 2020 show moderate correlations between the grace data and the modeled data the good similarity of the δgws pattern supports that groundwater storage change of the shas in the district is majorly dominated by the river aquifer interactions the δgws averages for both grace data and the groundwater model during 2004 2020 are close to zero indicating that groundwater storage of the shas in the district has varied insignificantly for almost the last two decades 3 7 groundwater condition in the mraa groundwater flow direction in the mraa is generally from northeast to south and southwest fig 9a b which is consistent with the general flow direction in the shas fig 5a and with the fact that the river stage in the mississippi river is usually higher than the river stage in the atchafalaya river the cone of depression close to the southern boundary is a result of the pumping activity from march to september in the region the net river lake aquifer fluxes vary in a wide range fig 10a and are highly correlated with δgws in the mraa r 0 91 the δgws has moderate negative correlation with net fluxes passing through mraa boundaries r 0 52 the negative net boundary fluxes are the result of low groundwater levels at the south boundary due to groundwater withdrawals groundwater pumping and surficial recharge have negligible impact on δgws in the mraa groundwater fluxes across the interface of the mraa and the shas excluding mraa denoted as shas mraa indicates that the mraa constantly receives net groundwater fluxes about 698 000 m3 day fig 10a from the shas mraa through the eastern boundary 3 8 groundwater condition in the shas mraa surficial recharge is the driving force behind δgws in the shas mraa with high correlation r 0 84 as shown in fig 10b increase in surficial recharge yields higher groundwater storage which also results in higher net groundwater discharge to the amite river and vice versa this phenomenon explains the high positive correlation r 0 83 between the net discharge fluxes to the amite river and δgws in the shas mraa the shas mraa constantly gains high amounts of groundwater around 2 3 million m3 day in median from the boundaries on the other hand the shas mraa constantly outfluxes higher amounts of groundwater to amite river about 0 8 million m3 day in median and the mraa about 0 7 million m3 day than to pumping wells about 0 6 million m3 day in median 3 9 groundwater condition in baton rouge area this study particularly examined the groundwater condition in the baton rouge area as groundwater levels are significantly low compared to the other areas in the district averaged groundwater levels during 2004 2020 for different hydrogeologic units between the two geological faults are shown in fig 11 groundwater level in mraa is generally above 4 m above navd 88 fig 11a and is above 8 m below navd 88 in the chicot formation fig 11b which are higher than the groundwater level in underlying aquifers because of relatively low groundwater withdrawal rates the upper evangeline formation includes the 800 foot sand 1 000 foot sand and 1 200 foot sand fig 11c where public supply pumping in the 1 200 foot sand causes a distinct cone of depression centered in the industrial district on the other hand the lower evangeline formation fig 11d including 1 500 foot sand and 1 700 foot sand shows multiple cones of depression centered in public supply well fields absence of a large sand restricts groundwater flow in the west of lower evangeline formation upper jasper formation includes the 2 000 foot sand and 2 400 foot sand fig 11e averaged groundwater level can be as low as 62 m below navd 88 due to substantial pumping in the last several decades centered in the industrial district the wide cone of depression and low groundwater level extend from the denham springs scotlandville fault to the baton rouge fault lower jasper formation is majorly the 2 800 foot sand between the two faults where the groundwater is saline which means groundwater level is much higher due to lack of withdrawals fig 11 f however lower jasper formation in the north of the denham springs scotlandville fault contains fresh water and is normally pumped prakken and wright 2009 the periodic pattern of cumulative δgws in the mraa fig 12a aligns with the water stage pattern in the mississippi river however δgws is small maximum 700 m3 day the chicot formation had a slightly increasing trend in groundwater storage fig 12b because of decreasing groundwater withdrawals from 2004 to 2019 and mraa recharges however large groundwater withdrawals and low mraa recharges in year 2020 caused a groundwater storage drop below the level calculated for 2004 groundwater withdrawals in the evangeline formation were high with an average of 196 000 m3 day fig 12c shows that groundwater withdrawal rate increased about 50 000 m3 day from 2004 to 2010 and then remained almost constant afterwards however groundwater storage was increasing about 5 000 m3 day marginally this is because the deficit caused by high withdrawals was offset by the groundwater inflows from the chicot formation and the surrounding boundaries with an average of 21 000 m3 day the small δgws indicates that the evangeline formation has reached an equilibrium the model shows that the jasper formation lost a considerable amount of groundwater between 2005 and 2013 fig 12d which is about 20 of groundwater withdrawals of 145000 m3 day in average groundwater storage loss was quickly replenished to the 2004 condition after a significant reduction in the groundwater pumping in 2014 indicating that the jasper formation is a prolific aquifer groundwater pumping was also substantially reduced in 2019 2020 such that there was 20 000 m3 day of groundwater storage gain in 2020 3 10 groundwater budget analysis in baton rouge area groundwater flow directions and net fluxes of water budget components in the baton rouge area are shown in fig 13 the mraa is mainly recharged by the mississippi river up to 140 000 m3 d with great variation however the δgws is negligible because the majority of groundwater flows out to the west and to the south through the baton rouge fault and to the chicot formation through sand connection fig 13a the chicot formation is recharged by the net groundwater inflows from the south through the baton rouge fault from the north through the denham springs scotlandville fault and from the chicot formation in the east a big portion of the groundwater in the chicot formation is either pumped discharged to the evangeline formation or outflowed to the west as a result the δgws varies within 5000 m3 d fig 13b owing to significant groundwater pumping from the evangeline formation groundwater flows from all directions toward the centers of the cones of depression fig 13c except from the jasper formation due to confining units between the two formations fig 3b c as discussed previously the very small δgws variation indicates that the evangeline formation is in the equilibrium condition the jasper formation has a similar flow pattern fig 13d as that of the evangeline formation because of substantial groundwater pumping in the industrial district due to negligible groundwater recharge from the evangeline formation the δgws variation is noticeable between 20 000 m3 d and 10 000 m3 d majorly influenced by groundwater withdrawals r 0 77 and minorly influenced by recharges from adjacent aquifers through the dss fault r 0 37 and the br fault r 0 34 4 discussion groundwater flow patterns under anthropogenic pumping in the shas model generally support previous knowledge buono 1983 griffith 2003 prakken and wright 2009 and past modeling results martin and whiteman 1989 williamson et al 1990 heywood et al 2014 which include the north east to south west groundwater flow direction downward groundwater flow from shallow to deep aquifers discontinuity of groundwater level across the faults and groundwater level declines in the baton rouge area cones of depression induced by significant groundwater withdrawals validate the br modeling study pham and tsai 2017 and the saltwater encroachment from the south of the br fault rollo 1969 whiteman 1979 tomaszewski 1996 however it is noted that surficial recharge area in this study is determined based on surficial geological formations of the shas which could be different from the recharge estimation considering climatic and land surface factors beigi and tsai 2014 also isotropic hydraulic conductivity in the shas model was assumed which would be less realistic than anisotropic hydraulic conductivity the developed shas model reveals that groundwater storage change is dominated by the interactions between the mraa and the major rivers of mississippi river and atchafalaya river which indicates that the impacts of excessive groundwater withdrawals are limited to the shas in the district the results are validated by grace derived δgws with moderate pearson s correlation coefficient values of r 0 62 and r 0 63 which is comparable to the study of rateb et al 2020 that compared grace derived groundwater storage anomalies with estimations from regional groundwater models however the simulated δgws is 3 5 4 5 times less than grace derived values in terms of interquartile range a possible explanation for the lower simulated value is that riverbed leakances are underestimated with limited groundwater level data in the mraa which only accounts for about 2 of calibration data this study found a moderate correlation r 0 63 between the shas model and the br model pham and tsai 2017 in terms of groundwater storage change in the baton rouge area during 2004 2014 however the br model estimates a higher groundwater storage loss of 10 000 m3 d in 2005 and 2006 than that estimated by the shas model this lower estimate is plausible because the estimated hcs of the dss fault for the jasper formation by the shas model 3 6 10 3 to 6 6 10 1 1 d are higher than the br model s estimation of 10 6 1 d which restricts about 50 groundwater flow from the north of the dss fault low hc of the dss fault is also estimated by another br groundwater model elshall et al 2015 this discrepancy may be because the previous br models were developed and calibrated with limited groundwater level observations north of the dss fault this study investigated groundwater storage responses in four hydrogeologic units in the baton rouge area with respect to corresponding groundwater withdrawals the similarity between the patterns of δgws in mraa and chicot formation supports that they are hydraulically connected griffith 2003 and influenced by interaction with the mississippi river the jasper formation is more responsive to the groundwater pumping than the evangeline formation due mostly to the confining unit between the two formations and the lack of groundwater recharge from the evangeline formation as a consequence in 2014 however the jasper formation receives recharges from adjacent aquifers via the denham springs scotlandville fault and the baton rouge fault while a significant reduction in groundwater pumping is in effect the groundwater storage is overturned from losing to gaining after about a year fig 12d and fig 13d this indicates that the jasper is a prolific aquifer although the estimated groundwater storage in the baton rouge area was greater in 2020 than storage in 2004 the 2020 amount is not sufficient to slow down saltwater inflows from south of the baton rouge fault which remains the urgent issue for the evangeline and jasper formations in the baton rouge area whiteman 1979 tomaszewski 1996 several potential studies could be anticipated based on the shas model for model improvements the assumption of anisotropic aquifers would provide more realistic groundwater simulations considering climatic e g temperature and solar radiation and land surface factors e g topography and land use with surficial geological formations could improve estimations of surficial recharge besides data assimilation could be utilized with available grace data or other data sources such as land subsidence and groundwater levels to constrain river aquifer interactions effective groundwater withdrawals or groundwater level predictions uncertainty of the shas model originating from model parameters were analyzed while uncertainties originating from model structure e g boundary condition and geologic structure and input data have not been discussed quantifying individual sources of uncertainty could provide more reliable groundwater predictions for the shas in addition the shas model could be expanded to a groundwater transport model to evaluate saltwater intrusion in the evangeline and jasper formations furthermore subsidence could be considered to simulate clay compaction in the baton rouge area under anthropogenic impacts nunn 2003 5 conclusions this study successfully developed a high fidelity groundwater flow model to investigate groundwater flow and storage responses to excessive groundwater withdrawals for the complex shas in the cagcd utilization of an unstructured grid in the complex model structure potentially provides the benefit of reducing computational cost with respect to use of a regular uniform grid unstructured vertical discretization represented directly by hydrogeological layers does not require any uniform model layers to capture unconformity and discontinuity of hydrogeologic features e g fault displacements and pinch outs it is also noted that groundwater modeling tools capable of handling unstructured grid would not be limited to modflow usg which is utilized in this study monthly groundwater storage changes within the cagcd during 2004 2020 are estimated within 5 million m3 day and are dominated by the interactions between the major rivers mississippi river and atchafalaya river and the mraa the simulated groundwater storage changes are moderately correlated with the grace data while the variations are three to five times smaller than the grace data groundwater withdrawals have a significant local effect e g distinct cones of depression in the baton rouge area however groundwater storage of the shas in the district remains similar over the last decade or two groundwater inflows to the cagcd are from the northern and eastern boundaries but its groundwater storage change is primarily driven by river aquifer interactions consequently the shas constantly discharges groundwater to the amite river about 0 8 million m3 day loses groundwater to anthropogenic pumping about 0 6 million m3 day and recharges groundwater to the mraa about 0 7 million m3 day groundwater budget analysis of the baton rouge area reveals historical groundwater depletion and saltwater intrusion caused by substantial and prolonged groundwater withdrawals the jasper formation lost considerable groundwater between 2005 and 2013 about 20 of pumpage compared to the mraa chicot and evangeline formations groundwater storage change in 2004 2020 in the evangeline formation is small because of groundwater inflows from the surrounding areas and from the chicot formation although groundwater storage in the cagcd majorly driven by river aquifer interactions and has altered insignificantly in the past decade or two northward saltwater inflow through the br fault remains an urgent issue to the evangeline and jasper formations in the baton rouge area overall the high fidelity groundwater model with unstructured grid allows us to perform regional evaluation on the shas while investigating the significant local impact induced by excessive pumping in the baton rouge area credit authorship contribution statement ye hong chen

industrial supplies in the cagcd groundwater depletion saltwater intrusion and land subsidence are potential concerns due to prolonged excessive groundwater withdrawals this study develops a high fidelity groundwater flow model utilizing a complex unstructured grid to investigate groundwater flow and storage responses to excessive groundwater withdrawals for the shas in the cagcd the groundwater model incorporates the mississippi river alluvial aquifer down to the miocene sands extending to depths around 1 km new hydrological insights groundwater modeling results indicate large cones of depression in the evangeline and jasper formations in the baton rouge area due to prolonged groundwater withdrawals low permeability faults are inferred by significant groundwater level difference across the faults while local groundwater storage depletion in deeper aquifers is evident overall estimated groundwater storage changes of the shas in the cagcd are close to zero in the past two decades indicating insignificant groundwater storage changes this is attributed to dominant interactions between the major rivers and the shallower alluvial aquifer in addition the simulated

mississippi river alluvial aquifer shas southern hills aquifer system shas mraa shas excluding mraa δgws groundwater storage change 1 introduction the southern hills aquifer system shas one of three most heavily pumped aquifer systems in the state of louisiana along the gulf of mexico coast of the united states prakken and wright 2009 is the primary source of freshwater for public and industrial supply for the louisiana capital area groundwater conservation district cagcd or district in southeastern louisiana buono 1983 in 2015 767 000 cubic meters 203 million gallons of groundwater were withdrawn every day of which 44 were used for public supply and 40 were used for industries collier and sargent 2018 the shas was established as a sole source aquifer by the u s environmental protection agency owing to its essentiality to drinking water the shas is a part of the coastal lowlands aquifer system clas along the gulf of mexico weiss 1990 and comprises a series of intricately interbedded sandy and clayey formations that generally range in age from pleistocene at the top pliocene in the middle to miocene at the base buono 1983 the formations extend from the miocene aquifer system and citronelle formation in the southwestern mississippi and thicken as they dip toward the baton rouge area the permeable citronelle formation in the southwestern mississippi and pinch out formations in the northern parishes of the southeastern louisiana form recharge zones that are the source of groundwater for the shas boswell 1979 in the baton rouge area the major reactivated growth fault namely baton rouge br fault acts as a leaky barrier to the northward groundwater movement and saltwater intrusion morgan and winner 1964 tomaszewski 1996 prior to the groundwater development in the 1940 s groundwater flowed toward the surface due to its upward hydraulic gradient morgan 1963 in the subsequent decades however extracting large amounts of groundwater from the shas for public and industrial supplies caused significant groundwater level declines as much as 108 m in the 2000 foot sand heywood et al 2014 reduced upward groundwater flow from deep aquifers and created hydraulic gradients conducive to saltwater encroachment toward pumping centers in north of the br fault where freshwater was previously contained rollo 1969 tomaszewski 1996 whiteman 1979 furthermore groundwater level declines led to compaction of interbedded clay resulting in irreversible land subsidence in the baton rouge area during 1934 1976 whiteman 1980 to thoroughly investigate saltwater intrusion mitigation and land subsidence induced by excessive groundwater withdrawals it is imperative to first understand groundwater flow dynamics and how groundwater flow responds to the withdrawals from the shas past studies have pointed out that decreasing water levels were observed at multiple wells in the baton rouge area with respect to increasing pumping rates morgan 1961 prakken and wright 2009 renken 1998 tomaszewski et al 2002 while the variations of groundwater storage induced by groundwater withdrawals for the shas have rarely been discussed it is essential to quantify volumetric groundwater storage change to understand the severity of groundwater depletion numerical groundwater flow modeling is commonly used to evaluate the flow dynamics and storage change in aquifer systems cao et al 2013 döll et al 2014 de graaf et al 2017 pham and tsai 2017 scanlon et al 2012 the clas regional groundwater flow models detect discharge areas in the shas and upward groundwater flow from lower pleistocene and miocene deposits to upper pleistocene and holocene deposits for pre development conditions martin and whiteman 1989 williamson et al 1990 under development conditions of 1980 most of the discharge areas turned into recharge areas and downward groundwater flow was created as a result of excessive groundwater withdrawals from deep aquifers martin and whiteman 1989 a previous shas groundwater flow model also confirms the downward groundwater flow and indicates that groundwater storage responds to groundwater withdrawals heywood et al 2014 however the model structure could be too simple to have a realistic estimate of groundwater fluxes for the deep confined aquifers de graaf et al 2017 in addition implicit simulation of upper aquifers surficial recharge and river aquifer interactions could affect estimation of groundwater flow and storage associated with groundwater withdrawals pham and tsai 2017 constructed a complex groundwater flow model to investigate groundwater storage and flow patterns in the br aquifer system and demonstrate a significant groundwater storage loss in 2014 relative to 1975 due to large groundwater withdrawals and limited recharges through leaky faults nevertheless the evaluations are limited to lateral flow exchanges rather than exchanges in vertical direction that could be crucial for local groundwater resources management this study thoroughly investigates groundwater flow and storage responses to excessive groundwater withdrawals for the shas in the cagcd by developing a high fidelity three dimensional groundwater flow model based on a complex model structure that improves the simplicity of the past model structures the model structure is constructed using lithological modeling vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 and comprises of non uniform discretization both in horizontal and vertical directions a high resolution horizontal grid along the br fault system is nested within a coarser parent grid to reduce computational costs utilization of an unstructured grid in the complex model structure potentially provides the benefit of reducing computational cost with respect to use of a regular uniform grid panday et al 2013 unstructured vertical discretization represented directly by hydrogeological layers can replicate complex geological features e g faults unconformities and pinch outs more efficiently than uniform model layers fischer et al 2015 pham and tsai 2017 this study adopts the united states geological survey s usgs modflow usg model which is capable of handling flow simulation in non uniform unstructured grids panday et al 2013 this study evaluates the groundwater responses under parameter uncertainty and verifies groundwater storage change with gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data that have been used in evaluation of groundwater depletion in many regional studies feng et al 2013 rodell et al 2007 rateb et al 2020 yeh et al 2006 it is also noted that groundwater modeling tools capable of handling unstructured grid would not be limited to modflow usg which is utilized in this study 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area includes the five parishes of east baton rouge ebr west baton rouge wbr pointe coupee pc east feliciana ef and west feliciana wf in the southeastern louisiana fig 1 which covers five of the six parishes in the cagcd the topography of the study area varies from 124 m navd 88 in the north to 0 m navd 88 in the south the study area located in the southwest of the shas encompasses a sequence of intricately interbedded interconnected alluvial freshwater bearing clayey and sandy strata varying in age from miocene to holocene dipping south toward the gulf of mexico griffith 2003 the hydrogeologic framework of the study area comprises four clas hydrogeologic units regional scale to the depth of 1000 m which are the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa the chicot formation chct the evangeline formation evgl and the jasper formation jsp in the stratigraphic sequence order teeple et al 2020 the geological formations refer to permeable sands interbedded by clays with their depth of occurrence however clays can be thick enough to form low permeable layers in some places aquifers in the study area were named based on the depths that they are observed in the baton rouge area for a subregional scale meyer and turcan 1955 a regional scale hydrogeologic unit can include a number of subregional scale aquifers table 1 shows the stratigraphic relationship between the regional scale hydrogeologic units and the subregional scale aquifers in the study area two major west to east trending growth faults the denham springs scotlandville fault and the baton rouge fault across the east baton rouge and west baton rouge parishes fig 1a were reactivated in the late pleistocene with increasing displacements in depth hanor 1982 mcculloh and heinrich 2013 the fault surface traces west of the mississippi river were eroded mcculloh and heinrich 2013 approximated the extent of the disappeared traces the baton rouge fault is a leaky barrier that impedes northward movement of saltwater on the south side of the baton rouge fault tomaszewski 1996 whiteman 1979 the denham springs scotlandville fault is also conjectured to be a leaky fault elshall et al 2013 pham and tsai 2017 this study collected monthly groundwater level data from 310 usgs observation wells as well as river lake water level data from 20 gage stations fig 1c between 2004 and 2020 four rivers mississippi river atchafalaya river amite river and comite river and two oxbow lakes false river and raccourci old river were considered in the groundwater model monthly pumping rates of 577 pumping wells fig 1d were collected from the cagcd the usgs and the agricultural center at louisiana state university most of the public supply and industrial wells are concentrated in the east baton rouge and west baton rouge parishes about 8 of the pumping wells are deeper than 700 m navd 88 2 2 lithofacies modeling on unstructured grid to build a high fidelity groundwater model this study interpreted 727 electric logs figs 1a and 4577 drillers logs fig 1b into sequences of high permeability sand facies and low permeability clay facies to build a lithology model more than 90 of the drillers logs are above 200 m navd 88 north american vertical datum of 1988 about 14 of the electric logs are deeper than 800 m navd 88 the majority of which are in the east baton rouge parish to provide subsurface geologic information for deep aquifers the process of building a lithology model includes tessellation of the domain discretization translation of data interpolation and back translation of the results vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 the usgs national hydrogeologic grid nhg clark et al 2018 was employed as the parent grid for the study area the nhg cell size is 1 km the grid resolution was gradually decreased to a cell size of 32 m around the fault traces mcculloh and heinrich 2013 as shown in fig 2a to form a horizontal unstructured grid the number of 2d cells is 34 246 voronoi cells were used to refine the grid around the faults the study area was tessellated into four tiles to account for unconformity between the mraa and its underlying chicot formation as well as discontinuity at the fault traces fig 2b the structural dip slope for the mraa is about 0 0005 and about 0 005 for the chicot evangeline and jasper formations hosman 1996 weiss 1990 the shas without mraa was split into three tiles the denham springs scotlandville fault separates the north tile and the middle tile the baton rouge fault separates the middle tile and the south tile the mraa tile envelopes the three tiles in the west the unstructured grid was mapped to the four tiles such that each tile has its own grid the drillers logs up to a depth of around 120 m 400 ft and electric logs in their full lengths were used to construct a sub lithology model of sands and clays for each tile readers are referred to vahdat aboueshagh and tsai 2021 for details of constructing a lithology model all of the four sub lithology models were assembled into the final lithology model each 3d cell in the model has a different number of surrounding 3d cells to connect to therefore the lithology model is built on a 3d unstructured grid of 1 145 363 cells each 3d cell is labelled as either a sand or a clay cell the lithology model developed in this study is available on hydroshare org chen et al 2022 2 3 groundwater flow model development a modflow usg groundwater model was developed to capture the complexity of the lithology model through an unstructured grid the groundwater model contains a total of 1 145 363 active cells each computational cell may have a different number of connections and may share different faces in contact areas with its neighboring cells therefore unlike typical groundwater models with model layers the model developed in this study did not have model layers an unstructured discretization disu package was generated purely based on the configurations of the computational cells to develop a non layered model then each computational cell was given a cell identification number to build other model packages table 2 lists the key packages used in the groundwater model with additional related information the nearest natural neighbor zonation method combined with pilot points doherty et al 2010 was adopted to parameterize hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s of sands in the layer property flow lpf package the number of pilot points assigned to each hydrologic unit varies the hydrogeologic unit bedding surfaces were delineated based on the published data teeple et al 2020 this study considers homogeneous k and s s for the mraa 2 pilot points homogeneous k and s s for clays 2 pilot points and heterogeneous k and s s with various number of pilot points for the chicot evangeline and jasper formations table 1 isotropic hydraulic conductivity was assumed values at the pilot points were estimated through model calibration explained in a next section hydraulic conductivity values are bounded by the usgs aquifer test data of the gulf coastal regional aquifer system prudic 1991 specific storage values are bounded by field values from aquifer properties kuang et al 2020 this study aims to investigate groundwater conditions in the deep confined aquifers where a major amount of groundwater was withdrawn thus a confined aquifer system was assumed such that specific yield was not considered in the groundwater model four rivers of mississippi river atchafalaya river amite river and comite river as well as two oxbow lakes of false river and raccourci old river were modeled utilizing the general head boundary ghb package supplementary materials fig s2 shows the locations where the rivers and lakes connect to their underlying aquifer based on the lithology model and bathymetry information these connections were the major consideration in developing the ghb package each connection was assigned with monthly river lake stage data either from usgs or usace gage stations and a riverbed lakebed leakance value individual riverbed and lakebed leakance were assumed homogenous and each was assigned one pilot point riverbed and lakebed leakance values ranging from 0 001 to 4 52 day 1 were determined based on published case studies cherkauer and taylor 1990 chen and chen 2003 dysart et al 1999 the time variant specified head chd package was applied to the model boundaries specified groundwater levels at boundaries were estimated based on historical groundwater levels and pilot points placed at the model boundaries table 2 shows the number of chd pilot points for different hydrogeologic units the horizontal flow barrier hfb package was used to simulate the low permeability baton rouge fault and denham springs scotlandville fault pilot points for different hydrogeologic units were placed along the fault traces to estimate zonal hydraulic characteristics of faults table 2 hydraulic characteristic values ranging from 1 10 7 to 4 3 10 1 day 1 were based on the past modeling results elshall et al 2015 pham and tsai 2017 the monthly recharge rates reitz and sanford 2019 were applied to the surficial sand cells to build a recharge rch package unavailable recharge rates after 2015 were estimated by averaging the corresponding monthly recharge rates from 2003 to 2015 the drain drn package was applied to surficial sands to avoid the issue of flooding cells by removing excessive recharge rates from reitz and sanford 2019 by this way effective surficial recharge can be estimated this study employed the connected linear network cln package to obtain simulated groundwater levels at observation wells for the model calibration purpose a connector well that conveys groundwater from the 800 foot sand to the 1500 foot sand was also modeled in the cln package pumping wells with single screen and multiple screens were modeled by combining the well wel package and the cln package well configurations were obtained from the louisiana department of natural resources ldnr monthly groundwater pumpage data from 2004 to 2020 were provided by the cagcd the usgs and the lsu agricultural center groundwater is supplied to the public industry agriculture aquaculture livestock and power generation supplementary materials fig s3 the major users are public and industry which consume groundwater on a monthly average of 10 3 million m3 and 8 5 million m3 respectively the monthly average of the total pumpage is 20 8 million m3 2 4 model calibration and validation historical monthly groundwater levels from 2004 to 2020 4964 data points were used for model calibration and validation coefficient of variation at each observation well was calculated to evaluate the variability of the groundwater level data it was found that 90 of the observation wells exhibit coefficient of variation less than 10 the low variability of data indicates a limited impact on model calibration results by choices of splitting into calibration dataset and validation dataset thus this study used 1516 groundwater levels from 2004 to 2008 30 of observed data to estimate 148 pilot point values through the model calibration process then the groundwater model was validated by 3448 groundwater levels from 2009 to 2020 70 of observed data monthly stress periods were adopted in the groundwater model to maintain consistency with available monthly pumpage records from 2004 to 2020 values of 148 pilot points are estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse using eq 1 1 min p rmse 1 n i 1 n h i o b s h i p 2 where h i o b s and h i are the observed and simulated groundwater levels respectively n is the number of the observed groundwater levels and p is the vector of values of pilot points to be estimated the dimension of p is the number of pilot points nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse is also calculated using eq 2 to evaluate the model performance 2 nse 1 i 1 n h i o b s h i 2 i 1 n h i o b s h o b s 2 where h o b s is the average of observed groundwater levels each groundwater model run took about 0 5 an hour to expedite the model calibration the groundwater model was calibrated through a steady state model in the first stress period and then through a transient model for the rest of the stress periods using the steady state model the values of 123 pilot points without 25 pilot points associated with specific storage were estimated first this study utilized the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy cma es hansen et al 2003 a stochastic and derivative free search algorithm to minimize the rmse the cma es has been implemented to parallel computing and has the capability of providing a full covariance matrix of estimated parameters to quantify uncertainty for high fidelity groundwater models elshall et al 2015 pham and tsai 2017 vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 the cma es search algorithm was paralleled on lsu s supermike ii cluster with 440 computing nodes 2 5 water budget analysis monthly groundwater storage change in the shas was estimated using eq 3 3 δ gws r q q chd q ghb where δgws is the monthly groundwater storage change r is the effective surficial recharge q is the groundwater pumping rate q chd is the net flux from the time variant specified head boundaries a positive q chd value represents that the shas receives groundwater from the model boundaries and a negative value represents that the shas discharges groundwater to the model boundaries q ghb is the net river lake aquifer interaction flux a positive q ghb value represents that river lake recharge the shas whereas a negative value represents that the shas discharges groundwater to river lake 2 6 grace derived groundwater storage change monthly terrestrial water storage anomalies data landerer 2021 measured by grace mission tapley et al 2004 was scaled and used to estimate groundwater storage anomalies this study followed the approach in rodell and famiglietti 2002 to isolate groundwater storage anomalies by removing land water storage anomalies derived from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah model rodell et al 2020 to compare with the grace derived groundwater storage change month groundwater storage change δgws from the shas model was converted to uniform groundwater depth cm over the entire 1 degree grid cell 3 results 3 1 lithology model several hydrogeologic features are revealed in the lithology model shown in fig 3 first 19 of the study area is covered by surficial sands most of which are situated in the north fig 3a this indicates that surficial recharge in both the east baton rouge and west baton rouge parishes is limited as it is also in the entire mraa area second the cross sections confirm complex interconnected sand depositions interbedded with clays fig 3b d many clays are vertically extensive within individual hydrogeologic units a distinct confining unit separates the evangeline and jasper formations griffith 2003 third distinct displacements up to around 100 m around the denham springs scotlandville fault and the baton rouge fault are also revealed in the lithology model displacements at the baton rouge fault are greater than those at the denham springs scotlandville fault elshall et al 2013 more cross sections of the lithology model are provided in the supplementary materials fig s1 juxtaposition of the sub lithology models of the middle tile and the south tile creates the leaky windows along the baton rouge fault fig 3e color blue where groundwater can flow from the sand on the south side to the sand on the north side and vice versa color white represents either clay on both the south and north sides or clay on the south side which restricts horizontal groundwater flow similarly juxtaposition of the sub lithology models of the north tile and the middle tile creates the leaky windows along the denham springs scotlandville fault fig 3 f it cannot be emphasized enough the complexity of the leaky windows at these two faults 3 2 model calibration and validation the values of 123 pilot points were first estimated through the steady state model and an rmse of 2 82 m was achieved then using the transient model and prior information from the steady state model the values of all the 148 pilot points were estimated by the cma es and an rmse of 2 86 was achieved fig 4a which is satisfactory in comparison to the past developed groundwater models for areas smaller than the study area in this article a range of rmse of 1 44 2 95 m from elshall et al 2015 an rmse of 3 76 m from pham and tsai 2017 an nse value of 0 983 was obtained which indicates a very small estimation error variance the estimated values or range of values of the pilot points associated with model parameters in the hydrogeologic units and the rivers are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively the groundwater model was validated by 3448 groundwater levels from 2009 to 2020 fig 4b an rmse value of 3 31 m and nse value of 0 981 were obtained indicating good model performance in this period 3 3 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses the means and the covariance matrix of estimated parameters from the cma es were used to generate 150 realizations through the latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 uncertainty analysis was conducted to evaluate the variability of the groundwater model output associated with model parameter uncertainties as shown in fig 4c f at four observation wells in the four hydrogeologic units observed groundwater levels are generally within one standard deviation bound in the model calibration period 2004 2008 and in the model verification period 2009 2020 indicating that the groundwater model is capable of replicating the historical behaviors of groundwater it is also interesting to see that the width of the one standard deviation bound increases in deeper formations at these four wells indicating that simulated groundwater levels in the shallower mraa formation are less sensitive than those in the deeper jasper formation to the corresponding parameter uncertainties composite scaled sensitivities css hill 1998 were calculated to compare the importance of model parameters with respect to spatial and temporal variation of simulated groundwater levels for the observation wells the css values of the 148 pilot points supplementary materials fig s4 confirm that hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers except for the mraa are the most sensitive parameters to the simulated groundwater levels followed by the specified groundwater levels at the model boundaries high sensitivity in hydraulic conductivity impacted by long term pumping is also found in the sensitivity analysis by chen and chen 2003 the hydraulic characteristic of the baton rouge fault in the jasper formation also shows a noticeable sensitivity value due to adjacent pumping effect otherwise the rest of the parameters have relatively low sensitivity values 3 4 groundwater conditions in the shas averaged groundwater levels in 2004 2020 fig 5a as high as 38 50 m below navd 88 in the east and west feliciana parishes are due to the surficial recharge to the outcrop zones of the shas and citronelle aquifers boswell 1979 groundwater flow direction is generally from northeast to the south and southwest which is consistent with the geological information on dip direction the distinct cone of depression in between the baton rouge fault and the denham springs scotlandville fault with groundwater level as low as 10 35 m below navd 88 is the result of prolonged groundwater pumping for the public supply and industrial uses collier and sargent 2018 based on the 150 parameter realizations groundwater levels in the area between the two faults show high uncertainties up to 4 7 m in terms of standard deviation especially along the baton rouge fault fig 5b these high uncertainties are likely attributable to the high sensitivities of hydraulic conductivity in the evangeline and jasper formations and the hydraulic characteristic of the baton rouge fault in the jasper formation where significant groundwater pumping activities are conducted supplementary materials fig s4 detailed averaged groundwater levels 2004 2020 in each hydrogeologic unit shows that flow directions are generally from north to south and from east to west fig 5c as shown in the cross sections groundwater levels are significantly low in the evangeline and jasper formations due to substantial groundwater withdrawals for industrial use and public supply the groundwater levels declined to 30 60 m below navd 88 groundwater level differences across the baton rouge fault with a maximum of 58 m are remarkable as shown in these cross sections due to low fault permeability table 3 and significant fault throws fig 3b groundwater level differences across the denham springs scotlandville fault are also noticeable 38 m maximum more cross sections of the simulated groundwater levels are provided in supplementary materials fig s5 3 5 groundwater storage change in the shas monthly groundwater storage change δgws relative to january 2004 and their uncertainties based on the standard deviation bounds are shown in fig 6a the δgws uncertainty estimated using the 150 parameter realizations is negligible which provides confidence in the monthly cumulative δgws the line chart in fig 6a the monthly cumulative δgws represents either gaining or losing storage of that month relative to the storage in january 2004 the monthly δgws is generally within 5 million m3 day and its fluctuations align with the variations of net fluxes between the river lake and aquifer indicating that river lake aquifer interactions dominate the groundwater storage changes consecutive groundwater storage depletion between 2005 and 2008 and through 2013 2015 were due to the low river stages in these years the huge storage gains in the years 2019 and 2020 were the result of prolonged high water stages in the mississippi river the river stage was above the flood stage for 222 days of 2019 and 165 days of 2020 at the gage station of the red river landing overall the groundwater model estimates that the shas gained about 203 million m3 of groundwater at the end of 2020 with respect to the year 2004 largely from the rivers the river lake impact on the δgws in the shas is shown in fig 6b the net river lake aquifer fluxes vary in a wide range and have a high pearson s correlation coefficient value r 0 87 with the δgws as a result δgws varies according to the net fluxes passing the model boundaries which results in a negative r 0 61 nevertheless the positive net boundary fluxes imply the effect of the reversed flow direction caused by pumping in the south groundwater withdrawals have low negative pearson s correlation coefficient value r 0 23 with δgws indicating that groundwater pumping has a significant local effect in the baton rouge area but has a limited impact in terms of the entire district this is evident as the pumping rate about 1 million m3 day is a fraction of the δgws up to 6 million m3 day effective surficial recharge was estimated only 5 of the recharge rates provided by reitz and sanford 2019 relatively small in comparison to the other flux components the effective surficial recharge rate has negligible pearson s correlation coefficient value r 0 07 river aquifer flow direction depends on local hydraulic gradient across the interface in general mississippi river and atchafalaya river recharge the mraa during the flood season fig 7a and receive groundwater during the non flood season fig 7b while the false river and raccourci old river oxbow lakes constantly recharge the mraa amite river in the north constantly receives groundwater from the shas fig 7 due to high groundwater levels in the citronelle aquifer boswell 1979 comite river has negligible interactions with aquifers 3 6 comparisons with grace derived δgws the targeted 1 degree grid cell in grace model is shown in fig 8a 65 of which covered by the current groundwater model simulation years 2004 2020 and a small part of the chicot aquifer groundwater model simulation years 2004 2014 vahdat aboueshagh et al 2021 the area between the two groundwater models is the atchafalaya river basin with low pumping activity the magnitude of simulated δgws in 2004 2014 for the two groundwater models is similar to that in 2015 2020 for the shas groundwater model indicating that the δgws in the chicot aquifer portion is insignificant fig 8b the grace derived δgws generally exhibits higher magnitudes than the simulated δgws the interquartile ranges of the grace derived δgws in 2004 2014 and 2015 2020 are about 3 5 and 4 5 times greater than those of the simulated δgws respectively fig 8c nevertheless pearson s correlation coefficient values r 0 62 for 2004 2014 and r 0 63 for 2015 2020 show moderate correlations between the grace data and the modeled data the good similarity of the δgws pattern supports that groundwater storage change of the shas in the district is majorly dominated by the river aquifer interactions the δgws averages for both grace data and the groundwater model during 2004 2020 are close to zero indicating that groundwater storage of the shas in the district has varied insignificantly for almost the last two decades 3 7 groundwater condition in the mraa groundwater flow direction in the mraa is generally from northeast to south and southwest fig 9a b which is consistent with the general flow direction in the shas fig 5a and with the fact that the river stage in the mississippi river is usually higher than the river stage in the atchafalaya river the cone of depression close to the southern boundary is a result of the pumping activity from march to september in the region the net river lake aquifer fluxes vary in a wide range fig 10a and are highly correlated with δgws in the mraa r 0 91 the δgws has moderate negative correlation with net fluxes passing through mraa boundaries r 0 52 the negative net boundary fluxes are the result of low groundwater levels at the south boundary due to groundwater withdrawals groundwater pumping and surficial recharge have negligible impact on δgws in the mraa groundwater fluxes across the interface of the mraa and the shas excluding mraa denoted as shas mraa indicates that the mraa constantly receives net groundwater fluxes about 698 000 m3 day fig 10a from the shas mraa through the eastern boundary 3 8 groundwater condition in the shas mraa surficial recharge is the driving force behind δgws in the shas mraa with high correlation r 0 84 as shown in fig 10b increase in surficial recharge yields higher groundwater storage which also results in higher net groundwater discharge to the amite river and vice versa this phenomenon explains the high positive correlation r 0 83 between the net discharge fluxes to the amite river and δgws in the shas mraa the shas mraa constantly gains high amounts of groundwater around 2 3 million m3 day in median from the boundaries on the other hand the shas mraa constantly outfluxes higher amounts of groundwater to amite river about 0 8 million m3 day in median and the mraa about 0 7 million m3 day than to pumping wells about 0 6 million m3 day in median 3 9 groundwater condition in baton rouge area this study particularly examined the groundwater condition in the baton rouge area as groundwater levels are significantly low compared to the other areas in the district averaged groundwater levels during 2004 2020 for different hydrogeologic units between the two geological faults are shown in fig 11 groundwater level in mraa is generally above 4 m above navd 88 fig 11a and is above 8 m below navd 88 in the chicot formation fig 11b which are higher than the groundwater level in underlying aquifers because of relatively low groundwater withdrawal rates the upper evangeline formation includes the 800 foot sand 1 000 foot sand and 1 200 foot sand fig 11c where public supply pumping in the 1 200 foot sand causes a distinct cone of depression centered in the industrial district on the other hand the lower evangeline formation fig 11d including 1 500 foot sand and 1 700 foot sand shows multiple cones of depression centered in public supply well fields absence of a large sand restricts groundwater flow in the west of lower evangeline formation upper jasper formation includes the 2 000 foot sand and 2 400 foot sand fig 11e averaged groundwater level can be as low as 62 m below navd 88 due to substantial pumping in the last several decades centered in the industrial district the wide cone of depression and low groundwater level extend from the denham springs scotlandville fault to the baton rouge fault lower jasper formation is majorly the 2 800 foot sand between the two faults where the groundwater is saline which means groundwater level is much higher due to lack of withdrawals fig 11 f however lower jasper formation in the north of the denham springs scotlandville fault contains fresh water and is normally pumped prakken and wright 2009 the periodic pattern of cumulative δgws in the mraa fig 12a aligns with the water stage pattern in the mississippi river however δgws is small maximum 700 m3 day the chicot formation had a slightly increasing trend in groundwater storage fig 12b because of decreasing groundwater withdrawals from 2004 to 2019 and mraa recharges however large groundwater withdrawals and low mraa recharges in year 2020 caused a groundwater storage drop below the level calculated for 2004 groundwater withdrawals in the evangeline formation were high with an average of 196 000 m3 day fig 12c shows that groundwater withdrawal rate increased about 50 000 m3 day from 2004 to 2010 and then remained almost constant afterwards however groundwater storage was increasing about 5 000 m3 day marginally this is because the deficit caused by high withdrawals was offset by the groundwater inflows from the chicot formation and the surrounding boundaries with an average of 21 000 m3 day the small δgws indicates that the evangeline formation has reached an equilibrium the model shows that the jasper formation lost a considerable amount of groundwater between 2005 and 2013 fig 12d which is about 20 of groundwater withdrawals of 145000 m3 day in average groundwater storage loss was quickly replenished to the 2004 condition after a significant reduction in the groundwater pumping in 2014 indicating that the jasper formation is a prolific aquifer groundwater pumping was also substantially reduced in 2019 2020 such that there was 20 000 m3 day of groundwater storage gain in 2020 3 10 groundwater budget analysis in baton rouge area groundwater flow directions and net fluxes of water budget components in the baton rouge area are shown in fig 13 the mraa is mainly recharged by the mississippi river up to 140 000 m3 d with great variation however the δgws is negligible because the majority of groundwater flows out to the west and to the south through the baton rouge fault and to the chicot formation through sand connection fig 13a the chicot formation is recharged by the net groundwater inflows from the south through the baton rouge fault from the north through the denham springs scotlandville fault and from the chicot formation in the east a big portion of the groundwater in the chicot formation is either pumped discharged to the evangeline formation or outflowed to the west as a result the δgws varies within 5000 m3 d fig 13b owing to significant groundwater pumping from the evangeline formation groundwater flows from all directions toward the centers of the cones of depression fig 13c except from the jasper formation due to confining units between the two formations fig 3b c as discussed previously the very small δgws variation indicates that the evangeline formation is in the equilibrium condition the jasper formation has a similar flow pattern fig 13d as that of the evangeline formation because of substantial groundwater pumping in the industrial district due to negligible groundwater recharge from the evangeline formation the δgws variation is noticeable between 20 000 m3 d and 10 000 m3 d majorly influenced by groundwater withdrawals r 0 77 and minorly influenced by recharges from adjacent aquifers through the dss fault r 0 37 and the br fault r 0 34 4 discussion groundwater flow patterns under anthropogenic pumping in the shas model generally support previous knowledge buono 1983 griffith 2003 prakken and wright 2009 and past modeling results martin and whiteman 1989 williamson et al 1990 heywood et al 2014 which include the north east to south west groundwater flow direction downward groundwater flow from shallow to deep aquifers discontinuity of groundwater level across the faults and groundwater level declines in the baton rouge area cones of depression induced by significant groundwater withdrawals validate the br modeling study pham and tsai 2017 and the saltwater encroachment from the south of the br fault rollo 1969 whiteman 1979 tomaszewski 1996 however it is noted that surficial recharge area in this study is determined based on surficial geological formations of the shas which could be different from the recharge estimation considering climatic and land surface factors beigi and tsai 2014 also isotropic hydraulic conductivity in the shas model was assumed which would be less realistic than anisotropic hydraulic conductivity the developed shas model reveals that groundwater storage change is dominated by the interactions between the mraa and the major rivers of mississippi river and atchafalaya river which indicates that the impacts of excessive groundwater withdrawals are limited to the shas in the district the results are validated by grace derived δgws with moderate pearson s correlation coefficient values of r 0 62 and r 0 63 which is comparable to the study of rateb et al 2020 that compared grace derived groundwater storage anomalies with estimations from regional groundwater models however the simulated δgws is 3 5 4 5 times less than grace derived values in terms of interquartile range a possible explanation for the lower simulated value is that riverbed leakances are underestimated with limited groundwater level data in the mraa which only accounts for about 2 of calibration data this study found a moderate correlation r 0 63 between the shas model and the br model pham and tsai 2017 in terms of groundwater storage change in the baton rouge area during 2004 2014 however the br model estimates a higher groundwater storage loss of 10 000 m3 d in 2005 and 2006 than that estimated by the shas model this lower estimate is plausible because the estimated hcs of the dss fault for the jasper formation by the shas model 3 6 10 3 to 6 6 10 1 1 d are higher than the br model s estimation of 10 6 1 d which restricts about 50 groundwater flow from the north of the dss fault low hc of the dss fault is also estimated by another br groundwater model elshall et al 2015 this discrepancy may be because the previous br models were developed and calibrated with limited groundwater level observations north of the dss fault this study investigated groundwater storage responses in four hydrogeologic units in the baton rouge area with respect to corresponding groundwater withdrawals the similarity between the patterns of δgws in mraa and chicot formation supports that they are hydraulically connected griffith 2003 and influenced by interaction with the mississippi river the jasper formation is more responsive to the groundwater pumping than the evangeline formation due mostly to the confining unit between the two formations and the lack of groundwater recharge from the evangeline formation as a consequence in 2014 however the jasper formation receives recharges from adjacent aquifers via the denham springs scotlandville fault and the baton rouge fault while a significant reduction in groundwater pumping is in effect the groundwater storage is overturned from losing to gaining after about a year fig 12d and fig 13d this indicates that the jasper is a prolific aquifer although the estimated groundwater storage in the baton rouge area was greater in 2020 than storage in 2004 the 2020 amount is not sufficient to slow down saltwater inflows from south of the baton rouge fault which remains the urgent issue for the evangeline and jasper formations in the baton rouge area whiteman 1979 tomaszewski 1996 several potential studies could be anticipated based on the shas model for model improvements the assumption of anisotropic aquifers would provide more realistic groundwater simulations considering climatic e g temperature and solar radiation and land surface factors e g topography and land use with surficial geological formations could improve estimations of surficial recharge besides data assimilation could be utilized with available grace data or other data sources such as land subsidence and groundwater levels to constrain river aquifer interactions effective groundwater withdrawals or groundwater level predictions uncertainty of the shas model originating from model parameters were analyzed while uncertainties originating from model structure e g boundary condition and geologic structure and input data have not been discussed quantifying individual sources of uncertainty could provide more reliable groundwater predictions for the shas in addition the shas model could be expanded to a groundwater transport model to evaluate saltwater intrusion in the evangeline and jasper formations furthermore subsidence could be considered to simulate clay compaction in the baton rouge area under anthropogenic impacts nunn 2003 5 conclusions this study successfully developed a high fidelity groundwater flow model to investigate groundwater flow and storage responses to excessive groundwater withdrawals for the complex shas in the cagcd utilization of an unstructured grid in the complex model structure potentially provides the benefit of reducing computational cost with respect to use of a regular uniform grid unstructured vertical discretization represented directly by hydrogeological layers does not require any uniform model layers to capture unconformity and discontinuity of hydrogeologic features e g fault displacements and pinch outs it is also noted that groundwater modeling tools capable of handling unstructured grid would not be limited to modflow usg which is utilized in this study monthly groundwater storage changes within the cagcd during 2004 2020 are estimated within 5 million m3 day and are dominated by the interactions between the major rivers mississippi river and atchafalaya river and the mraa the simulated groundwater storage changes are moderately correlated with the grace data while the variations are three to five times smaller than the grace data groundwater withdrawals have a significant local effect e g distinct cones of depression in the baton rouge area however groundwater storage of the shas in the district remains similar over the last decade or two groundwater inflows to the cagcd are from the northern and eastern boundaries but its groundwater storage change is primarily driven by river aquifer interactions consequently the shas constantly discharges groundwater to the amite river about 0 8 million m3 day loses groundwater to anthropogenic pumping about 0 6 million m3 day and recharges groundwater to the mraa about 0 7 million m3 day groundwater budget analysis of the baton rouge area reveals historical groundwater depletion and saltwater intrusion caused by substantial and prolonged groundwater withdrawals the jasper formation lost considerable groundwater between 2005 and 2013 about 20 of pumpage compared to the mraa chicot and evangeline formations groundwater storage change in 2004 2020 in the evangeline formation is small because of groundwater inflows from the surrounding areas and from the chicot formation although groundwater storage in the cagcd majorly driven by river aquifer interactions and has altered insignificantly in the past decade or two northward saltwater inflow through the br fault remains an urgent issue to the evangeline and jasper formations in the baton rouge area overall the high fidelity groundwater model with unstructured grid allows us to perform regional evaluation on the shas while investigating the significant local impact induced by excessive pumping in the baton rouge area credit authorship contribution statement ye hong chen

7731,study region two typical landforms in the eastern loess plateau china study focus hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in precipitation are highly efficient tracers for quantitatively identifying the regional water cycle based on 237 precipitation event data points from seven precipitation stable isotope monitoring stations in the eastern loess plateau eclp this study first presented the spatial temporal variation of precipitation isotopes it explored the mainly controlling factor and source of water vapor for regional precipitation new hydrological insights for the region this research found a consistent temporal trend was observed in the eclp except for the jiexiu station characterized by enrichment from december to may and depletion from june to october signals of the summer monsoon reaching the eclp were recorded using precipitation δ18o δ18op especially in july relatively smaller slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl of summer precipitation reflects that sub cloud evaporation strongly influences regional precipitation process δ18op values did not exhibited significant relationships with air temperature and an apparent precipitation amount effect was observed in precipitation samples with precipitation amount less than 10 mm an apparent anti altitude effect appeared in precipitation samples with the elevation between 400 and 750 m of the eclp the sub cloud evaporation had stronger influence on the precipitation process of the the fenhe river basin valley frv especially in the jiexiu station the water vapor of precipitation in the eclp mainly originated from the bohai sea and the east china sea in the near surface and southeast path directions especially in summer these studies are essential in regional water resources allocation

isotopes spatial distribution mode eof controlling factor water vapor source data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a source of land water resources atmospheric precipitation is important for sustainable regional economic and social development as well as ecological environmental security by providing the necessary water sources particularly in arid areas its variability determines the temporal and spatial distributions of regional water resources zhu et al 2019 wang et al 2021a 2021b stable isotopes are components of water molecules that participate in the entire water cycle their variability ratio can reflect the environmental variation in precipitation formation and is widely used in the quantitative study of hydrological processes such as exploring the environmental variation in water vapor transmission and quantification of water vapor sources galewsky et al 2016 tulley cordova et al 2021 wu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 therefore systematically exploring the spatiotemporal distribution of stable atmospheric precipitation isotopes can effectively quantify regional water circulation and help manage regional water resources allen et al 2018 fluctuations in precipitation stable isotopes have been proven to be closely related to the variability of local environmental factors zhou et al 2019 some studies have indicated that fluctuations in environmental factors such as water vapor source meteorological factors during transmission underlying surface properties altitude and location lead to apparent variations in the fractionation of stable isotopes during atmospheric precipitation kong et al 2019 li et al 2020 adhikari et al 2020 sun et al 2020a the isotope fractionation mechanism in the rainfall process which is closely related to air temperature variability during the precipitation phase transition has been investigated wang et al 2016 sun et al 2020a when the air temperature increases and evaporation strengthens the lighter isotope in precipitation enters the atmosphere with water vapor evaporation the heavy isotope is enriched and the regional precipitation δ18o δ18op value increases when the temperature decreases and evaporation weakens the δ18op value also decreases this temperature effect i e gradual enrichment of precipitation δ18o with increasing air temperature is regarded as a valuable indicator of paleotemperature and was widely documented zhou et al 2019 however the amount effect i e gradual enrichment of precipitation δ18o with local precipitation amount reduction has been used to reconstruct humidity characteristics in historical periods dansgaard 1964 zhou et al 2019 the altitude effect i e gradual enrichment of precipitation δ18o with increasing local altitude was used to explore the regional water cycle especially in arid land kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2019 in addition the variability of the source of moisture is closely related to variations in the stable isotope composition of regional precipitation crawford et al 2013 hu and dominguez 2015 zhou et al 2019 tulley cordova et al 2021 xu et al 2022 crawford et al 2013 indicated that large scale rainfall was a key controlling factor for the precipitation δ18o of the blue mountains near sydney australia during moisture transport in central china the variability in the precipitation isotopic signal of changsha city was closely linked to the position and intensity of upstream rainout activity zhou et al 2019 in south china the variability in the isotopic signal of water vapor during extreme winter precipitation reflects rapid shifts in moisture source regions xu et al 2022 atmospheric precipitation δ18o and δ2h could effectively record the variability in regional meteorological factors and provide important background information masbruch et al 2016 with the intensification of climate change stations for monitoring precipitation stable isotopes have been established in many typical regions of the world over the past few decades providing additional reference information on regional water circulation research and crucial theoretical support for exploring regional climate change yang et al 2018 in recent years precipitation stable isotopes have been observed in five lakes in north america corcoran et al 2019 greenland cluett et al 2021 england loader et al 2020 the mekong river in asia lone et al 2019 and the indus river basin laonamsai et al 2020 the studies preliminarily explored the temporal spatial distribution of precipitation stable isotopes in these regions and further strengthened our understanding of the regional water cycles in china some researchers have built precipitation stable isotope monitoring networks in northwestern china zhang and wang 2018 kong et al 2022 the central and western loess plateau sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and the eastern monsoon region of china zhang and wang 2018 zhao et al 2019 kong et al 2019 several researchers have pointed out that air temperature is an important controlling factor for δ18op variability in the northwest arid area whereas the fluctuation of δ18op in the eastern monsoon region of china is related to the vital roles of convective activity water vapor convergence and condensation processes along air mass trajectories zhang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2019 kong et al 2019 indicated that δ18op in most regions of china was enriched in summer and negative in winter based on 68 stations around china in the loess plateau clp δ18op of the western region of the clp presented gradually enriched from high altitude to low altitude sun et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 in the source region of the haihe river basin a significant correlation has been observed between monsoon variability and fluctuations in precipitation stable isotopes zhao et al 2018 regional precipitation isotope projects are currently being conducted worldwide the relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation stable isotopes and meteorological controlling factors has become the focus of studies on regional water cycle chen et al 2021a 2021b sun et al 2018 in recent years as the influence of climate change has deepened the composition of the water vapor sources of precipitation has received more attention the influence of recycled water vapor caused by regional secondary evaporation on the regional precipitation process has been quantitatively evaluated based on precipitation stable isotopes in specific regions of china kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in xinjiang the contribution of regional recycled moisture to regional precipitation accounts for 8 12 kong et al 2013 in the fenhe river basin regional recycled vapor accounts for up to 28 of regional precipitation sun et al 2020a in guyuan on the western clp the weighted annual average recycling ratio is more than 14 and the transpiration process plays an important role in regional precipitation the advance and retreat of the monsoon also improved which strongly influenced the variability of precipitation δ18o liu et al 2011 hua et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 tulley cordova et al 2021 in the north american monsoon region long term precipitation observations indicated that isotopic enrichment of precipitation is closely related to monsoonal precipitation tulley cordova et al 2021 in the monsoon region of eastern china the southeast and southwest monsoons from the sea had a significant impact on the precipitation in the eastern region of china liu et al 2011 hua et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 the monsoons have been confirmed in the stalagmite records and have been defined by researchers as the upstream effect of stable isotopes of precipitation however few studies have focused on the clp which has a fragile ecological environment and experiences severe water and soil erosion few studies on regional precipitation isotope distribution have focused valley areas or tableland regions sun et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 little is known about the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of precipitation isotopes in mountainous regions particularly in the eastern clp eclp xia et al 2019 sun et al 2020a the eclp which crosses the yellow and haihe river basins is affected by the east asian winter monsoon in winter and the east asian summer monsoon in summer li et al 2017 sun et al 2020a as two typical geomorphic units in the eclp climate patterns including air temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration between the valley and mountain regions display obvious heterogeneity sun et al 2020b precipitation is the most crucial source of surface water resources in valley regions and plays a critical role in controlling regional soil and water loss in mountainous regions however owing to the lack of in situ precipitation isotope observations the mechanisms determining the spatially heterogeneous precipitation isotope composition of the two typical landform regions are still unclear further exploration of the influence of the complexity of regional precipitation processes caused by climate change on the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation stable isotopes in these two typical landforms is needed in summary to explore the mechanisms determining the spatially heterogeneous characteristics of the precipitation isotope composition of the landform regions of the eclp the fenhe river basin valley frv and the rocky mountain areas of taihang rmt were selected as two typical landforms regions based on long term observational data of regional precipitation stable isotopes over an entire hydrological year the variation in regional precipitation stable isotopes was systematically analyzed the relationship between regional precipitation stable isotopes and the main environmental parameters was explored and the original moisture source region of precipitation was determined these results will benefit the interpretation of paleoclimate records and the application of atmospheric simulations to quantify the paleoclimate these research results can also have crucial implications for the efficient utilization of water resources and high quality development of the regional economy 2 sampling and methods 2 1 site description an observation network of precipitation stable isotope was established in the eastern loess plateau between 34 34 40 43

study area present significant spatial variation and show increasing from northwest to southeast with a range of precipitation amount is between 400 700 mm the variability of regional precipitation

integrated trajectory hysplit model has been widely used to identify diffusion trajectories and moisture tracing wang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 this study used the hysplit model to qualitatively judge the water vapor source according to the track path and change in water vapor content this study used era5 reanalysis data horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 as driving data the monthly mean specific humidity meridional and zonal wind and surface pressure data of the study period were also used in this study guan et al 2019 because of the average altitude of 700 1100 m in the study area the operating altitude in the hysplit model was 1500 m agl and the tracking time was set to 240 h kostrova et al 2020 to more intuitively and clearly distinguish the direction and proportion of water vapor at the target point cluster analysis was used to combine and group many tracks according to the closest principle the number of track clusters was determined according to the change diagram of the total spatial variance tsv and the total spatial variance change rate the hysplit model tracked the backward trajectory of the study site and performed a further diagnostic analysis of water vapor sources kleist et al 2009 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial distribution of stable isotopes of precipitation in this study clear seasonal and spatial variability was observed in precipitation δ2h δ2hp and precipitation δ18o δ18op fig 2 the variability range of δ2hp in the eclp during the observation period was 122 60 0 26 with an average of 75 89 table 2 the highest value was recorded at the jiexiu station of the frv in july and the lowest value was recorded at the datong station of the rmt in september δ18op varied greatly from 16 36 0 46 with an average of 10 70 the highest value was recorded at jiexiu station in july and the lowest value was recorded at datong station in september fig 2 the empirical orthogonal function eof model was used to analyze the regional δ2hp δ18op and precipitation d excess d excessp signals of the eclp wang and an 2005 freund and henley 2019 and to present the spatiotemporal variation of stable regional isotopes of atmospheric precipitation fig 3 shows the spatial distribution mode eof of monthly mean values of δ2hp δ18op and d excessp in the study period and its corresponding time series pc among them the spatial modes of δ2hp and δ18op eof δ2h eof δ18o explain the variance change of 52 37 and 46 52 respectively thus indicating the seasonal variation of precipitation isotopic composition that is well represented by the first eof in the region the results of the eof modes indicate that the regional precipitation isotopic composition present a consistent temporal trend enrichment from december to may and depletion from june to october in the rmt a similar seasonal trend was observed at southern frv stations however the precipitation isotopic composition at the jiexiu station located north of the frv showed an inconsistent seasonal trend in comparison with that shown by the other stations figs 2 and 3 in general the seasonal fluctuations in the precipitation stable isotopic composition in the rmt were relatively obvious and showed a gradually increasing trend from the southern to the northern part of the eclp during the observation period the variation range of d excessp in the study area was 12 57 27 61 with an average of 9 67 table 2 and fig 2 the highest value was recorded at yangquan station in april and the lowest at jiexiu station in september the fluctuation of d excessp at jiexiu station was the largest and the fluctuation of d excessp at zhaocheng station was relatively small the eof modes of d excessp showed that the d excessp at the yangquan and changzhi stations had relatively smaller seasonal fluctuations moreover inconsistent seasonal trends were observed in these stations compared with those of other regions of the study area fig 3c unlike δ2hp and δ18op notable seasonal fluctuations of d excessp appeared at the zhaocheng station in the southern part of the frv and the d excessp of the datong station also displayed obvious variability the significantly greater seasonal fluctuations in d excessp compared to those of δ2hp and δ18op were related to the complicated composition of the water vapor sources wang et al 2017 li et al 2018 3 2 local meteoric waterline for the eclp the local meteoric water line lmwl can reflect the variation of environmental elements and the mixing of different water vapor during the fall of raindrops sun et al 2020a the lmwl in the eclp was fitted according to the equation δ2hp 7 99δ18op 9 27 r2 0 98 fig 4 compared with the gmwl globe meteoric water line the lmwl of the eclp had a similar slope and intercept suggesting a balanced regional precipitation isotope dynamic fractionation in this study the lmwls for different seasons were fitted fig 4 the lmwl in summer april october was δ2hp 7 70δ18op 4 45 r2 0 97 while that in winter november march was δ2hp 8 02δ18op 12 25 r2 0 94 fig 4a the smaller slope and intercept of the lmwl in summer may be related to the strong sub cloud evaporation caused by higher air temperatures under varied geomorphological conditions the lmwl at the different stations showed inconsistent slopes and intercept characteristics the slope ranking order was yangquan station changzhi station jincheng station datong station linfen station 8 gmwl jiexiu station zhaocheng station the intercept ranking order was yangquan jincheng linfen changzhi datong 10 gmwl jiexiu station zhaocheng station fig 4 the inconsistency in the lmwl slopes reflects spatial differences in water vapor sources and water cycle patterns putman et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 differences in the precipitation isotope fluctuations of the two regions compared with the δ18op values of the two typical regions a relatively larger variation range of δ18op was observed in the rmt while a larger d excessp variability appeared in the frv fig 2 among all the study regions a relatively larger variation range of δ18op was observed in the datong station δ18op varied greatly from 3 44 to 11 66 with a standard deviation of 3 70 which suggested had a noticeably seasonal fluctuation of precipitation isotope in the datong station during the study period the datong station is in the northern part of the eclp at the junction of monsoon and non monsoon areas mostly summer monsoon rainfall as observed in the northern part of the haihe river basin where datong station is located begins in july and extends through september with peak rainfall occurring during this period however the advance and retreat of the summer monsoon significantly impact the regional precipitation and water source moisture of the monsoon marginal zone which may be a reason for the apparent seasonal fluctuation of precipitation stable isotopes in the datong station li et al 2017 the lmwls in the two distinct regions also displayed significant heterogeneity based on the stable isotopes in local precipitation events the lmwls of the two distinct regions in this study were fitted the lmwl of the frv was δ2hp 7 61δ18op 4 88 r2 0 95 and the lmwl of the rmt was δ2hp 8 48δ18op 15 41 r2 0 98 between the two regions the slope of the lmwlfrv was lower than that of the gmwl in contrast the slope of lmwlrmt was significantly higher than that of gmwl previous studies wang et al 2016 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020a indicated that raindrops fall from the bottom of clouds to the ground surface under higher air temperature environments often leading to a decrease in raindrop volume and heavy isotope enrichment which is reflected in the slope lower slope of the lmwl the lower slope of the lmwl of the frv suggests that local precipitation is affected by stronger sub cloud evaporation whereas a higher slope of the rmt lmwl indicates a stronger influence of recycling water vapor on the regional precipitation process sun et al 2019 2020a smith et al 2021 generally stronger evaporation dominated precipitation tends to be heavy isotope enriched along the evaporation line with a slope less than 8 and the d excess would reduce 10 simultaneously conversely following the mass balance concept the precipitation formed by evaporated vapor with a higher d excess would lead to a rainfall d excess greater than 10 therefore relatively high intercepts commonly indicate the addition of recycled vapor to local precipitation sun et al 2019 2020a smith et al 2021 the slope and intercept of the lmwls at the datong yangquan jincheng changzhi and linfen stations were greater than those of the gmwl indicating that the precipitation at these stations was affected by the local impression of the circulating water vapor however the slope and intercept of the lmwls at the jiexiu and zhaocheng stations were lower than those of the gmwl suggesting that sub evaporation strongly influenced the regional precipitation process in the frv the slopes of three stations linfen zhaocheng and jiexiu displayed significant inconsistencies the increased contribution of plant transpiration to regional precipitation caused by the cultivation of large scale crops in the linfen region may be an important reason for the larger slope of the lmwls of linfen than those of the other stations in the fvr the results showed that precipitation stable isotopes in the eclp were relatively enriched before july except at the jiexiu station in the northern part of the frv whereas stable isotopes of precipitation in the study area were rapidly depleted after july which is considered a signal of monsoon movement yu et al 2015 sun et al 2020a in the monsoon region of eastern china a noticeable depletion effect was observed on monsoonal precipitation isotopes with an increasing precipitation amount when observing precipitation isotopes during the summer monsoonal season zhou et al 2018 li et al 2020 this significant depletion effect of the summer monsoon on local precipitation stable isotopes was also observed in the cities of nanjing li et al 2020 and changsha zhou et al 2019 in eastern china in the eclp summer monsoon signals of δ18op were observed at the mrt especially in the datong station unlike that in the rmt the summer monsoon signal of δ18op was weakened in the frv except for the linfen station southern part of the frv suggesting a lower impact of water vapor carried by the summer monsoon on the regional precipitation of the frv 4 2 main environmental controlling factors for δ18op of the eclp understanding the key influences that dominate precipitation δ18o variations is very important for the interpretation of the regional paleoclimatic records to further analyze the relationship between regional precipitation stable isotopes and the main meteorological controlling factors we fitted the regional δ18op t δ18op p δ18op altitude δ18op latitude and δ18op longitude values based on the mean values of δ18op mean air temperature t precipitation amount p and location information during the study period at each station fig 5 the results displayed a negative correlation between δ18op and mean air temperature in the study area when the regional average air temperature was lower than 15 c in contrast a positive correlation between δ18op and the air temperature was observed when the average air temperature was above 15 c the opposite temperature effects suggest that complex factors control precipitation processes in this region which may be related to its location at the joint control region of continental and marine air masses zhou et al 2019 sun et al 2020a we observed a negative relationship between precipitation amount and δ18op especially for precipitation amounts less than 10 mm this suggests that the variation in precipitation amount directly affected the precipitation isotope fluctuations during small and medium sized rainfall processes some studies have indicated that the regional precipitation amount is related to the influence of the monsoon on the regional precipitation process zhou et al 2019 although the eclp is located at the boundary of monsoon affected areas the precipitation amount effect indicate that precipitation stable isotopes could still record monsoon information this indicates that the precipitation process in this region is affected by the summer monsoon the altitude effect gradual depletion of δ18op gradually with altitude increase was observed in different mountainous areas kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2019 fig 5 shows the relationship between the mean δ18op and each station s geographical location longitude latitude and altitude the results indicate an anti altitude effect where δ18op increases as altitude increases in the regions with an elevation between 400 and 750 m while the altitude effect was seen in regions higher than 750 m however many anti altitude effects have been reported previously in alpine areas at much higher elevations approximately 2000 5000 m a s l or in regions with air masses of different origins holdsworth et al 1991 cruz et al 1992 luo et al 2011 kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2019 nevertheless in this study the altitudes of all stations were less than 1500 m and anti altitude effect was observed in stations with altitude less than 750 m primarily the frv similar phenomena have been observed in the urumqi basin of the tianshan mountains of northwestern china and have been reported to be related to local moisture recycling kong and pang 2016 wang et al 2016 the complex terrain with an intricate distribution of ravines and hills in the eclp easily leads to the mixing of external water vapor and recycled water vapor further resulting in the contribution of recycled moisture to regional precipitation this causes drastic fluctuations in precipitation isotopes and obvious anti altitude effects kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2020a in addition the unique valley topography in this region causes inversion layers to appear frequently in the valley region which may be the main reason for the anti altitude effect appearing in the frv kong et al 2016 2019 sun et al 2020a we observed a positive correlation of δ18op latitude in regions between 35 and 37 n in contrast a negative correlation of δ18op latitude was observed in regions between 37 and 41 n δ18op across all stations displayed a gradual enrichment trend with increasing latitude except for the jiexiu station indicating an obvious latitudinal effect of precipitation in this region the uneven air temperature distribution caused by a decrease in solar radiation at each station with increasing latitude may be the main reason for this generally precipitation δ18o gradually depletes from seacoasts to inland called the continental effect kong et al 2019 however none of the stable isotopes of precipitation at the stations in the study area complied with this trend δ18o and δ2h gradually depleted from inland to the seaside and a positive correlation was observed between δ18op and longitude in the fvc and rmt regions the complex topographic conditions of the eclp may result in the ocean water vapor mass being blocked and mixed with local water vapor groups when transported inland causing changes in the stable isotopic diversion process of precipitation fig 5c displays the relationship of δδ18o surface ground δ18op cloudbase δ18o f the residual evaporation ratio of raindrops the effect sub cloud evaporation was stronger and the f values were smaller for regional precipitation the results show that sub cloud evaporation notably influenced the precipitation process in both the typical landforms among which the precipitation of the frv region was affected by stronger sub cloud evaporation larger δδ18o values and smaller f values than that of the rmt fig 5c comparing the two regions the effect of sub cloud evaporation on the stations in the rmt region presented obvious spatial consistency while significant spatial inconsistency was observed in the effect of sub cloud evaporation on regional precipitation in the fvc region the relatively higher f values of the jiexiu and zhaocheng stations indicate that precipitation was strongly affected by subcloud evaporation which is consistent with the conclusion represented by the lower slopes of the lmwls of the two stations 4 3 water vapor flux and transmission channel of the two typical regions of the eclp water vapor transport in the atmosphere is closely related to atmospheric circulation and critical controls of the regional water balance such as energy input parameters and water circulation processes steen larsen et al 2013 fig 6 presents the wind vector and water vapor flux at a potential height of 700 hpa and an analysis of the general circulation characteristics of atmospheric precipitation in the eclp westerly and southwest winds were the predominant winds in the eclp and there was an evident water vapor channel at the southwest boundary of the eclp from january to march fig 6a c based on the geographical location of the eclp and the regional atmospheric general circulation system the water vapor channel in the southwest mainly originates from mid latitude westerly winds from april to may the northern area till 38 n was controlled by westerly winds and the southeast monsoon wind controlled the southern area in june another water vapor channel entered the eclp from the northwest border and the range of the water vapor transmission channel in the northeast expanded to the entire eastern part of the study area whereas the range of the water vapor channel gradually subsided in september figs 6f 6i from june to september the southeast monsoon became the prevailing regional wind in the study area and the water vapor transport path from the southeast mainly controlled the regional water vapor water vapor transport in the northwestern region of the eclp was still mainly controlled by westerly winds at mid latitudes figs 6f 6i from october to december the northern region till 38 n was controlled by westerly winds and the southwest monsoon was the prevailing wind in the southern region the westerly wind at mid latitudes was the prevailing wind for the southwest boundary of the study area and its influence on the water vapor channel gradually subsided fig 6j l in general westerly winds had an important influence on water vapor transport in the northern part of the study area in contrast the water vapor transport in the central and southern parts of the study area was more complex and the water vapor transport originating from the southeastern monsoon had an important influence on the eclp during summer 4 4 sources of precipitation water vapor based on specific humidity calibration the water vapor transport path variation usually results in precipitation δ2h and δ18o variability galewsky et al 2016 this study identified the transport paths of water vapor in two distinct geomorphological areas of the eclp using ear reanalysis data based on the water vapor transport path 240 h 10 d before precipitation the influence of various water vapor transport paths on the eclp has been revealed xu et al 2020 some researchers have demonstrated that not all water vapor transport trajectories are regional water vapor sources wang et al 2016 xu et al 2020 significant changes in specific humidity are often accompanied by natural precipitation therefore only water vapor paths with significant specific humidity changes can be defined as the source of regional precipitation zhu et al 2019 based on the change in specific humidity along the backward trajectory to represent the precipitation or evaporation process effective trajectories with specific humidity were chosen to determine the position of water vapor when entering the air mass the water vapor entering the backward trajectory contributed to precipitation in the eclp fig 7 shows the compositional characteristics of the monthly water vapor sources of the eclp calibrated using specific humidity the results showed obvious inconsistencies in the composition of the monthly water vapor sources of the eclp between january and march the back trajectories tended to indicate near surface land origin vapor sources in april the water vapor for regional precipitation mainly originated from nearby land sources the southeastern coast xinjiang in the northwest and balkhsh lake in kazakhstan the water vapor content in the northwest direction decreased and in the southeast direction the nearer source increased in this period the presented δ18op value gradually decreased and the d excess gradually increased from the frv to the rmt from june to september the water vapor sources for regional precipitation mainly come from the near sources the southeast bohai sea east china sea and south china sea among them the water vapor content contributed by the near source and bohai directions increased during this period the contribution of southeastern monsoon water vapor under the northward path accounted for a large proportion of the study area except for the influence of westerly winds as the influence of the southeastern monsoon became stronger precipitation in the eclp gradually increased regional precipitation isotopes rapidly declined and precipitation d excess gradually decreased ocean air mass humidity was higher in the eclp the moisture sourced from strong southerly flows was slightly reduced in october relative to that in september whereas near land flows continued to dominate regional precipitation similar to that in april precipitation in november in the eclp carried more westerly flow vapor into this region as indicated by the back trajectories fig 7 between the two regions the water vapor of the rmt in the study period mainly originated from a near land source in the southeast coastal direction of the bohai sea however water vapor from the northern path also contributed significantly to regional precipitation in the rmt especially in july in the frv the water sources for monthly precipitation were mainly controlled by the northwest mongolian continental air mass in may in june and september the water vapor sources in the frv were mainly controlled by the southeastern direction of the near source and the western path water vapor over long distances the various water vapor sources in the frv in august indicated the complex composition of the regional water vapor sources overall the water moisture of regional precipitation in the eclp mainly originated from the bohai and east china sea in the near surface and southeast path directions and was accompanied by a small amount of water vapor in the western path in august and september which was significantly different from the water vapor transport trajectory 5 conclusions in this study we presents the daily observations of δ2hp δ18op and d excessp from january 2019 to january 2020 in the two types of eclp region we also investigated the factors controlling precipitation isotope variability and water vapor sources of the eclp an apparent spatial temporal variability was observed in precipitation stable isotopes δ2hp and δ18op and regional precipitation isotopic composition was enriched from december to may and depleted in the period from june to october except for the jiexiu station signals of the summer monsoon reaching the eclp were recorded using δ18op especially in july the lmwl of the eclp was fitted as δ2hp 7 99δ18op 9 27 r2 0 98 the inconsistency in the lmwl slope reflected spatial differences in water vapor sources and water cycle patterns the smaller slope of the lmwl for summer precipitation indicated that subcloud evaporation strongly influences regional precipitation a negative relationship between precipitation and δ18op was observed especially for precipitation amounts less than 10 mm a prominent anti altitude effect was observed at elevations between 400 and 750 m of the eclp subcloud evaporation had a stronger influence on the precipitation process of the frv especially at jiexiu station the vapor source regions varied in different months and the westerly wind influenced the water vapor transport in the northern part of the study area in contrast the water vapor transport systems in the central and southern parts of the study area were more complex and the water vapor transport originating from the southeastern monsoon had an important influence on the eclp in summer in the summer half of the year the water vapor of regional precipitation in the eclp mainly originated from the bohai sea and east china sea in the near surface land and southeast path directions spatial inconsistencies were observed in the composition of water vapor sources in the two typical regions of the eclp the findings of this study will benefit the interpretation of regional paleoclimatic records the efficient utilization of water resources and the high quality development of regional economies in the edge areas of monsoon regions credit authorship contribution statement

the entire water cycle their variability ratio can reflect the environmental variation in precipitation formation and is widely used in the quantitative study of hydrological processes such as exploring the environmental variation in water vapor transmission and quantification of water vapor sources galewsky et al 2016 tulley cordova et al 2021 wu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 therefore systematically exploring the spatiotemporal distribution of stable atmospheric precipitation isotopes can effectively quantify regional water circulation and help manage regional water resources allen et al 2018 fluctuations in precipitation stable isotopes have been proven to be closely related to the variability of local environmental factors zhou et al 2019 some studies have indicated that fluctuations in environmental factors such as water vapor source meteorological factors during transmission underlying surface properties altitude and location lead to apparent variations in the fractionation of stable isotopes during atmospheric precipitation kong et al 2019 li et al 2020 adhikari et al 2020 sun et al 2020a the isotope fractionation mechanism in the rainfall process which is closely related to air temperature variability during the precipitation phase transition has been investigated wang et al 2016 sun et al 2020a when the air temperature increases and evaporation strengthens the lighter isotope in precipitation enters the atmosphere with water vapor evaporation the heavy isotope is enriched and the regional precipitation δ18o δ18op value increases when the temperature decreases and evaporation weakens the δ18op value also decreases this temperature effect i e gradual enrichment of precipitation δ18o with increasing air temperature is regarded as a valuable indicator of paleotemperature and was widely documented zhou et al 2019 however the amount effect i e gradual enrichment of precipitation δ18o with local precipitation amount reduction has been used to reconstruct humidity characteristics in historical periods dansgaard 1964 zhou et al 2019 the altitude effect i e gradual enrichment of precipitation δ18o with increasing local altitude was used to explore the regional water cycle especially in arid land kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2019 in addition the variability of the source of moisture is closely related to variations in the stable isotope composition of regional precipitation crawford et al 2013 hu and dominguez 2015 zhou et al 2019 tulley cordova et al 2021 xu et al 2022 crawford et al 2013 indicated that large scale rainfall was a key controlling factor for the precipitation δ18o of the blue mountains near sydney australia during moisture transport in central china the variability in the precipitation isotopic signal of changsha city was closely linked to the position and intensity of upstream rainout activity zhou et al 2019 in south china the variability in the isotopic signal of water vapor during extreme winter precipitation reflects rapid shifts in moisture source regions xu et al 2022 atmospheric precipitation δ18o and δ2h could effectively record the variability in regional meteorological factors and provide important background information masbruch et al 2016 with the intensification of climate change stations for monitoring precipitation stable isotopes have been established in many typical regions of the world over the past few decades providing additional reference information on regional water circulation research and crucial theoretical support for exploring regional climate change yang et al 2018 in recent years precipitation stable isotopes have been observed in five lakes in north america corcoran et al 2019 greenland cluett et al 2021 england loader et al 2020 the mekong river in asia lone et al 2019 and the indus river basin laonamsai et al 2020 the studies preliminarily explored the temporal spatial distribution of precipitation stable isotopes in these regions and further strengthened our understanding of the regional water cycles in china some researchers have built precipitation stable isotope monitoring networks in northwestern china zhang and wang 2018 kong et al 2022 the central and western loess plateau sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and the eastern monsoon region of china zhang and wang 2018 zhao et al 2019 kong et al 2019 several researchers have pointed out that air temperature is an important controlling factor for δ18op variability in the northwest arid area whereas the fluctuation of δ18op in the eastern monsoon region of china is related to the vital roles of convective activity water vapor convergence and condensation processes along air mass trajectories zhang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2019 kong et al 2019 indicated that δ18op in most regions of china was enriched in summer and negative in winter based on 68 stations around china in the loess plateau clp δ18op of the western region of the clp presented gradually enriched from high altitude to low altitude sun et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 in the source region of the haihe river basin a significant correlation has been observed between monsoon variability and fluctuations in precipitation stable isotopes zhao et al 2018 regional precipitation isotope projects are currently being conducted worldwide the relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation stable isotopes and meteorological controlling factors has become the focus of studies on regional water cycle chen et al 2021a 2021b sun et al 2018 in recent years as the influence of climate change has deepened the composition of the water vapor sources of precipitation has received more attention the influence of recycled water vapor caused by regional secondary evaporation on the regional precipitation process has been quantitatively evaluated based on precipitation stable isotopes in specific regions of china kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in xinjiang the contribution of regional recycled moisture to regional precipitation accounts for 8 12 kong et al 2013 in the fenhe river basin regional recycled vapor accounts for up to 28 of regional precipitation sun et al 2020a in guyuan on the western clp the weighted annual average recycling ratio is more than 14 and the transpiration process plays an important role in regional precipitation the advance and retreat of the monsoon also improved which strongly influenced the variability of precipitation δ18o liu et al 2011 hua et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 tulley cordova et al 2021 in the north american monsoon region long term precipitation observations indicated that isotopic enrichment of precipitation is closely related to monsoonal precipitation tulley cordova et al 2021 in the monsoon region of eastern china the southeast and southwest monsoons from the sea had a significant impact on the precipitation in the eastern region of china liu et al 2011 hua et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 the monsoons have been confirmed in the stalagmite records and have been defined by researchers as the upstream effect of stable isotopes of precipitation however few studies have focused on the clp which has a fragile ecological environment and experiences severe water and soil erosion few studies on regional precipitation isotope distribution have focused valley areas or tableland regions sun et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 little is known about the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of precipitation isotopes in mountainous regions particularly in the eastern clp eclp xia et al 2019 sun et al 2020a the eclp which crosses the yellow and haihe river basins is affected by the east asian winter monsoon in winter and the east asian summer monsoon in summer li et al 2017 sun et al 2020a as two typical geomorphic units in the eclp climate patterns including air temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration between the valley and mountain regions display obvious heterogeneity sun et al 2020b precipitation is the most crucial source of surface water resources in valley regions and plays a critical role in controlling regional soil and water loss in mountainous regions however owing to the lack of in situ precipitation isotope observations the mechanisms determining the spatially heterogeneous precipitation isotope composition of the two typical landform regions are still unclear further exploration of the influence of the complexity of regional precipitation processes caused by climate change on the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation stable isotopes in these two typical landforms is needed in summary to explore the mechanisms determining the spatially heterogeneous characteristics of the precipitation isotope composition of the landform regions of the eclp the fenhe river basin valley frv and the rocky mountain areas of taihang rmt were selected as two typical landforms regions based on long term observational data of regional precipitation stable isotopes over an entire hydrological year the variation in regional precipitation stable isotopes was systematically analyzed the relationship between regional precipitation stable isotopes and the main environmental parameters was explored and the original moisture source region of precipitation was determined these results will benefit the interpretation of paleoclimate records and the application of atmospheric simulations to quantify the paleoclimate these research results can also have crucial implications for the efficient utilization of water resources and high quality development of the regional economy 2 sampling and methods 2 1 site description an observation network of precipitation stable isotope was established in the eastern loess plateau between 34 34 40 43

higher and its spatial variation is relatively smaller table 1 regional precipitation patterns and ecological and environmental problems are characterized by concentrated precipitation mainly in summer frequent extreme precipitation in summer poor ecological environment and severe water and soil loss falster et al 2021 precipitation concentrated in the summer year accounting for 50 65 of the study area present significant spatial variation and show increasing from northwest to southeast with a range of precipitation amount is between 400 700 mm the variability of regional precipitation was related to the variation of geographical location and monsoon circulation han et al 2020 the prevailing wind in the summer year is mainly the southeast monsoon the soil in the study area is loose and deep and mainly belongs to black loam soil and yellow loam soil the vegetation is mainly drought tolerant herbs pine and cypress sun et al 2020b this study area has serious soil erosion and poor ecological environment and is the main sediment source area in the yellow river basin zhang et al 2020 in recent years it has become urgent to explore further the regional precipitation process and the temporal spatial distribution of stable isotopes for the restoration of regional ecology prevention and control of soil and water loss efficient utilization of water resources and high quality development of the regional economy tappa et al 2016 2 2 information on sampling and measurement a total of 237 precipitation samples were collected from 7 sites of two typical regions based on precipitation event in the eastern loess plateau eclp during the period of january 2019 to january 2020 fig 1 the meteorological elements start and end time air temperature relative humidity precipitation amount etc were numbered and recorded and then precipitation samples were put into the refrigerator for refrigeration 4 0c the detailed sampling information of each station was shown in table 1 stable isotope of water samples was measured by the liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research inc type gla431 lwia at the ecological environment research center in the middle reaches of the in the yellow river of the shanxi normal university the measurement precision was 0 2 and 0 03 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the v smow vienna standard mean ocean water were used to revise the

integrated trajectory hysplit model has been widely used to identify diffusion trajectories and moisture tracing wang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 this study used the hysplit model to qualitatively judge the water vapor source according to the track path and change in water vapor content this study used era5 reanalysis data horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 as driving data the monthly mean specific humidity meridional and zonal wind and surface pressure data of the study period were also used in this study guan et al 2019 because of the average altitude of 700 1100 m in the study area the operating altitude in the hysplit model was 1500 m agl and the tracking time was set to 240 h kostrova et al 2020 to more intuitively and clearly distinguish the direction and proportion of water vapor at the target point cluster analysis was used to combine and group many tracks according to the closest principle the number of track clusters was determined according to the

analysis of water vapor sources kleist et al 2009 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial distribution of stable isotopes of precipitation in this study clear seasonal and spatial variability was observed in precipitation δ2h δ2hp and precipitation δ18o δ18op fig 2 the variability range of δ2hp in the eclp during the observation period was 122 60 0 26 with an average of 75 89 table 2 the highest value was recorded at the jiexiu station of the frv in july and the lowest value was recorded at the datong station of the rmt in september δ18op varied greatly from 16 36 0 46 with an average of 10 70 the highest value was recorded at jiexiu station in july and the lowest value was recorded at datong station in september fig 2 the empirical orthogonal function eof model was used to analyze the regional δ2hp δ18op and precipitation d excess d excessp signals of the eclp wang and an 2005 freund and henley 2019 and to present the spatiotemporal variation of stable regional isotopes of atmospheric precipitation fig 3 shows the spatial distribution mode eof of monthly mean values of δ2hp δ18op and d excessp in the study period and its corresponding time series pc among them the spatial modes of δ2hp and δ18op eof δ2h eof δ18o explain the variance change of 52 37 and 46 52 respectively thus indicating the seasonal variation of precipitation isotopic composition that is well represented by the first eof in the region the results of the eof modes indicate that the regional precipitation isotopic composition present a consistent temporal trend enrichment from december to may and depletion from june to october in the rmt a similar seasonal trend was observed at southern frv stations however the precipitation isotopic composition at the jiexiu station located north of the frv showed an inconsistent seasonal trend in comparison with that shown by the other stations figs 2 and 3 in general the seasonal fluctuations in the precipitation stable isotopic composition in the rmt were relatively obvious and showed a gradually increasing trend from the southern to the northern part of the eclp during the observation period the variation range of d excessp in the study area was 12 57 27 61 with an average of 9 67 table 2 and fig 2 the highest value was recorded at yangquan station in april and the lowest at jiexiu station in september the fluctuation of d excessp at jiexiu station was the largest and the fluctuation of d excessp at zhaocheng station was relatively small the eof modes of d excessp showed that the d excessp at the yangquan and changzhi stations had relatively smaller seasonal fluctuations moreover inconsistent seasonal trends were observed in these stations compared with those of other regions of the study area fig 3c unlike δ2hp and δ18op notable seasonal fluctuations of d excessp appeared at the zhaocheng station in the southern part of the frv and the d excessp of the datong station also displayed obvious variability the significantly greater seasonal fluctuations in d excessp compared to those of δ2hp and δ18op were related to the complicated composition of the water vapor sources wang et al 2017 li et al 2018 3 2 local meteoric waterline for the eclp the local meteoric water line lmwl can reflect the variation of environmental elements and the mixing of different water vapor during the fall of raindrops sun et al 2020a the lmwl in the eclp was fitted according to the equation δ2hp 7 99δ18op 9 27 r2 0 98 fig 4 compared with the gmwl globe meteoric water line the lmwl of the eclp had a similar slope and intercept suggesting a balanced regional precipitation isotope dynamic fractionation in this study the lmwls for different seasons were fitted fig 4 the lmwl in summer april october was δ2hp 7 70δ18op 4 45 r2 0 97 while that in winter november march was δ2hp 8 02δ18op 12 25 r2 0 94 fig 4a the smaller slope and intercept of the lmwl in summer may be related to the strong sub cloud evaporation caused by higher air temperatures under varied geomorphological conditions the lmwl at the different stations showed inconsistent slopes and intercept characteristics the slope ranking order was yangquan station changzhi station jincheng station datong station linfen station 8 gmwl jiexiu station zhaocheng station the intercept ranking order was yangquan jincheng linfen changzhi datong 10 gmwl jiexiu station zhaocheng station fig 4 the inconsistency in the lmwl slopes reflects spatial differences in water vapor sources and water cycle patterns putman et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 differences in the precipitation isotope fluctuations of the two regions compared with the δ18op values of the two typical regions a relatively larger variation range of δ18op was observed in the rmt while a larger d excessp variability appeared in the frv fig 2 among all the study regions a relatively larger variation range of δ18op was observed in the datong station δ18op varied greatly from 3 44 to 11 66 with a standard deviation of 3 70 which suggested had a noticeably seasonal fluctuation of precipitation isotope in the datong station during the study period the datong station is in the northern part of the eclp at the junction of monsoon and non monsoon areas mostly summer monsoon rainfall as observed in the northern part of the haihe river basin where datong station is located begins in july and extends through september with peak rainfall occurring during this period however the advance and retreat of the summer monsoon significantly impact the regional precipitation and water source moisture of the monsoon marginal zone which may be a reason for the apparent seasonal fluctuation of precipitation stable isotopes in the datong station li et al 2017 the lmwls in the two distinct regions also displayed significant heterogeneity based on the stable isotopes in local precipitation events the lmwls of the two distinct regions in this study were fitted the lmwl of the frv was δ2hp 7 61δ18op 4 88 r2 0 95 and the lmwl of the rmt was δ2hp 8 48δ18op 15 41 r2 0 98 between the two regions the slope of the lmwlfrv was lower than that of the gmwl in contrast the slope of lmwlrmt was significantly higher than that of gmwl previous studies wang et al 2016 sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020a indicated that raindrops fall from the bottom of clouds to the ground surface under higher air temperature environments often leading to a decrease in raindrop volume and heavy isotope enrichment which is reflected in the slope lower slope of the lmwl the lower slope of the lmwl of the frv suggests that local precipitation is affected by stronger sub cloud evaporation whereas a higher slope of the rmt lmwl indicates a stronger influence of recycling water vapor on the regional precipitation process sun et al 2019 2020a smith et al 2021 generally stronger evaporation dominated precipitation tends to be heavy isotope enriched along the evaporation line with a slope less than 8 and the d excess would reduce 10 simultaneously conversely following the mass balance concept the precipitation formed by evaporated vapor with a higher d excess would lead to a rainfall d excess greater than 10 therefore relatively high intercepts commonly indicate the addition of recycled vapor to local precipitation sun et al 2019 2020a smith et al 2021 the slope and intercept of the lmwls at the datong yangquan jincheng changzhi and linfen stations were greater than those of the gmwl indicating that the precipitation at these stations was affected by the local impression of the circulating water vapor however the slope and intercept of the lmwls at the jiexiu and zhaocheng stations were lower than those of the gmwl suggesting that sub evaporation strongly influenced the regional precipitation process in the frv the slopes of three stations linfen zhaocheng and jiexiu displayed significant inconsistencies the increased contribution of plant transpiration to regional precipitation caused by the cultivation of large scale crops in the linfen region may be an important reason for the larger slope of the lmwls of linfen than those of the other stations in the fvr the results showed that precipitation stable isotopes in the eclp were relatively enriched before july except at the jiexiu station in the northern part of the frv whereas stable isotopes of precipitation in the study area were rapidly depleted after july which is considered a signal of monsoon movement yu et al 2015 sun et al 2020a in the monsoon region of eastern china a noticeable depletion effect was observed on monsoonal precipitation isotopes with an increasing precipitation amount when observing precipitation isotopes during the summer monsoonal season zhou et al 2018 li et al 2020 this significant depletion effect of the summer monsoon on local precipitation stable isotopes was also observed in the cities of nanjing li et al 2020 and changsha zhou et al 2019 in eastern china in the eclp summer monsoon signals of δ18op were observed at the mrt especially in the datong station unlike that in the rmt the summer monsoon signal of δ18op was weakened in the frv except for the linfen station southern part of the frv suggesting a lower impact of water vapor carried by the summer monsoon on the regional precipitation of the frv 4 2 main environmental controlling factors for δ18op of the eclp understanding the key influences that dominate precipitation δ18o variations is very important for the interpretation of the regional paleoclimatic records to further analyze the relationship between regional precipitation stable isotopes and the main meteorological controlling factors we fitted the regional δ18op t δ18op p δ18op altitude δ18op latitude and δ18op longitude values based on the mean values of δ18op mean air temperature t precipitation amount p and location information during the study period at each station fig 5 the results displayed a negative correlation between δ18op and mean air temperature in the study area when the regional average air temperature was lower than 15 c in contrast a positive correlation between δ18op and the air temperature was observed when the average air temperature was above 15 c the opposite temperature effects suggest that complex factors control precipitation processes in this region which may be related to its location at the joint control region of continental and marine air masses zhou et al 2019 sun et al 2020a we observed a negative relationship between precipitation amount and δ18op especially for precipitation amounts less than 10 mm this suggests that the variation in precipitation amount directly affected the precipitation isotope fluctuations during small and medium sized rainfall processes some studies have indicated that the regional precipitation amount is related to the influence of the monsoon on the regional precipitation process zhou et al 2019 although the eclp is located at the boundary of monsoon affected areas the precipitation amount effect indicate that precipitation stable isotopes could still record monsoon information this indicates that the precipitation process in this region is affected by the summer monsoon the altitude effect gradual depletion of δ18op gradually with altitude increase was observed in different mountainous areas kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2019 fig 5 shows the relationship between the mean δ18op and each station s geographical location longitude latitude and altitude the results indicate an anti altitude effect where δ18op increases as altitude increases in the regions with an elevation between 400 and 750 m while the altitude effect was seen in regions higher than 750 m however many anti altitude effects have been reported previously in alpine areas at much higher elevations approximately 2000 5000 m a s l or in regions with air masses of different origins holdsworth et al 1991 cruz et al 1992 luo et al 2011 kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2019 nevertheless in this study the altitudes of all stations were less than 1500 m and anti altitude effect was observed in stations with altitude less than 750 m primarily the frv similar phenomena have been observed in the urumqi basin of the tianshan mountains of northwestern china and have been reported to be related to local moisture recycling kong and pang 2016 wang et al 2016 the complex terrain with an intricate distribution of ravines and hills in the eclp easily leads to the mixing of external water vapor and recycled water vapor further resulting in the contribution of recycled moisture to regional precipitation this causes drastic fluctuations in precipitation isotopes and obvious anti altitude effects kong and pang 2016 sun et al 2020a in addition the unique valley topography in this region causes inversion layers to appear frequently in the valley region which may be the main reason for the anti altitude effect appearing in the frv kong et al 2016 2019 sun et al 2020a we observed a positive correlation of δ18op latitude in regions between 35 and 37 n in contrast a negative correlation of δ18op latitude was observed in regions between 37 and 41 n δ18op across all stations displayed a gradual enrichment trend with increasing latitude except for the jiexiu station indicating an obvious latitudinal effect of precipitation in this region the uneven air temperature distribution caused by a decrease in solar radiation at each station with increasing latitude may be the main reason for this generally precipitation δ18o gradually depletes from seacoasts to inland called the continental effect kong et al 2019 however none of the stable isotopes of precipitation at the stations in the study area complied with this trend δ18o and δ2h gradually depleted from inland to the seaside and a positive correlation was observed between δ18op and longitude in the fvc and rmt regions the complex topographic conditions of the eclp may result in the ocean water vapor mass being blocked and mixed with local water vapor groups when transported inland causing changes in the stable isotopic diversion process of precipitation fig 5c displays the relationship of δδ18o surface ground δ18op cloudbase δ18o f the residual evaporation ratio of raindrops the effect sub cloud evaporation was stronger and the f values were smaller for regional precipitation the results show that sub cloud evaporation notably influenced the precipitation process in both the typical landforms among which the precipitation of the frv region was affected by stronger sub cloud evaporation larger δδ18o values and smaller f values than that of the rmt fig 5c comparing the two regions the effect of sub cloud evaporation on the stations in the rmt region presented obvious spatial consistency while significant spatial inconsistency was observed in the effect of sub cloud evaporation on regional precipitation in the fvc region the relatively higher f values of the jiexiu and zhaocheng stations indicate that precipitation was strongly affected by subcloud evaporation which is consistent with the conclusion represented by the lower slopes of the lmwls of the two stations 4 3 water vapor flux and transmission channel of the two typical regions of the eclp water vapor transport in the atmosphere is closely related to atmospheric circulation and critical controls of the regional water balance such as energy input parameters and water circulation processes steen larsen et al 2013 fig 6 presents the wind vector and water vapor flux at a potential height of 700 hpa and an analysis of the general circulation characteristics of atmospheric precipitation in the eclp westerly and southwest winds were the predominant winds in the eclp and there was an evident water vapor channel at the southwest boundary of the eclp from january to march fig 6a c based on the geographical location of the eclp and the regional atmospheric general circulation system the water vapor channel in the southwest mainly originates from mid latitude westerly winds from april to may the northern area till 38 n was controlled by westerly winds and the southeast monsoon wind controlled the southern area in june another water vapor channel entered the eclp from the northwest border and the range of the water vapor transmission channel in the northeast expanded to the entire eastern part of the study area whereas the range of the water vapor channel gradually subsided in september figs 6f 6i from june to september the southeast monsoon became the prevailing regional wind in the study area and the water vapor transport path from the southeast mainly controlled the regional water vapor water vapor transport in the northwestern region of the eclp was still mainly controlled by westerly winds at mid latitudes figs 6f 6i from october to december the northern region till 38 n was controlled by westerly winds and the southwest monsoon was the prevailing wind in the southern region the westerly wind at mid latitudes was the prevailing wind for the southwest boundary of the study area and its influence on the water vapor channel gradually subsided fig 6j l in general westerly winds had an important influence on water vapor transport in the northern part of the study area in contrast the water vapor transport in the central and southern parts of the study area was more complex and the water vapor transport originating from the southeastern monsoon had an important influence on the eclp during summer 4 4 sources of precipitation water vapor based on specific humidity calibration the water vapor transport path variation usually results in precipitation δ2h and δ18o variability galewsky et al 2016 this study identified the transport paths of water vapor in two distinct geomorphological areas of the eclp using ear reanalysis data based on the water vapor transport path 240 h 10 d before precipitation the influence of various water vapor transport paths on the eclp has been revealed xu et al 2020 some researchers have demonstrated that not all water vapor transport trajectories are regional water vapor sources wang et al 2016 xu et al 2020 significant changes in specific humidity are often accompanied by natural precipitation therefore only water vapor paths with significant specific humidity changes can be defined as the source of regional precipitation zhu et al 2019 based on the change in specific humidity along the backward trajectory to represent the precipitation or evaporation process effective trajectories with specific humidity were chosen to determine the position of water vapor when entering the air mass the water vapor entering the backward trajectory contributed to precipitation in the eclp fig 7 shows the compositional characteristics of the monthly water vapor sources of the eclp calibrated using specific humidity the results showed obvious inconsistencies in the composition of the monthly water vapor sources of the eclp between january and march the back trajectories tended to indicate near surface land origin vapor sources in april the water vapor for regional precipitation mainly originated from nearby land sources the southeastern coast xinjiang in the northwest and balkhsh lake in kazakhstan the water vapor content in the northwest direction decreased and in the southeast direction the nearer source increased in this period the presented δ18op value gradually decreased and the d excess gradually increased from the frv to the rmt from june to september the water vapor sources for regional precipitation mainly come from the near sources the southeast bohai sea east china sea and south china sea among them the water vapor content contributed by the near source and bohai directions increased during this period the contribution of southeastern monsoon water vapor under the northward path accounted for a large proportion of the study area except for the influence of westerly winds as the influence of the southeastern monsoon became stronger precipitation in the eclp gradually increased regional precipitation isotopes rapidly declined and precipitation d excess gradually decreased ocean air mass humidity was higher in the eclp the moisture sourced from strong southerly flows was slightly reduced in october relative to that in september whereas near land flows continued to dominate regional precipitation similar to that in april precipitation in november in the eclp carried more westerly flow vapor into this region as indicated by the back trajectories fig 7 between the two regions the water vapor of the rmt in the study period mainly originated from a near land source in the southeast coastal direction of the bohai sea however water vapor from the northern path also contributed significantly to regional precipitation in the rmt especially in july in the frv the water sources for monthly precipitation were mainly controlled by the northwest mongolian continental air mass in may in june and september the water vapor sources in the frv were mainly controlled by the southeastern direction of the near source and the western path water vapor over long distances the various water vapor sources in the frv in august indicated the complex composition of the regional water vapor sources overall the water moisture of regional precipitation in the eclp mainly originated from the bohai and east china sea in the near surface and southeast path directions and was accompanied by a small amount of water vapor in the western path in august and september which was significantly different from the water vapor transport trajectory 5 conclusions in this study we presents the daily observations of δ2hp δ18op and d excessp from january 2019 to january 2020 in the two types of eclp region we also investigated the factors controlling precipitation isotope variability and water vapor sources of the eclp an apparent spatial temporal variability was observed in precipitation stable isotopes δ2hp and δ18op and regional precipitation isotopic composition was enriched from december to may and depleted in the period from june to october except for the jiexiu station signals of the summer monsoon reaching the eclp were recorded using δ18op especially in july the lmwl of the eclp was fitted as δ2hp 7 99δ18op 9 27 r2 0 98 the inconsistency in the lmwl slope reflected spatial differences in water vapor sources and water cycle patterns the smaller slope of the lmwl for summer precipitation indicated that subcloud evaporation strongly influences regional precipitation a negative relationship between precipitation and δ18op was observed especially for precipitation amounts less than 10 mm a prominent anti altitude effect was observed at elevations between 400 and 750 m of the eclp subcloud evaporation had a stronger influence on the precipitation process of the frv especially at jiexiu station the vapor source regions varied in different months and the westerly wind influenced the water vapor transport in the northern part of the study area in contrast the water vapor transport systems in the central and southern parts of the study area were more complex and the water vapor transport originating from the southeastern monsoon had an important influence on the eclp in summer in the summer half of the year the water vapor of regional precipitation in the eclp mainly originated from the bohai sea and east china sea in the near surface land and southeast path directions spatial inconsistencies were observed in the composition of water vapor sources in the two typical regions of the eclp the findings of this study will benefit the interpretation of regional paleoclimatic records the efficient utilization of water resources and the high quality development of regional economies in the edge areas of monsoon regions credit authorship contribution statement

7732,study region the zambezi river basin in southern africa study focus modelling global freshwater systems is difficult because of the complexities of climate and anthropogenic influence on hydrological systems especially at local scales the rapid changes in hydrological systems caused by the influence of global climate trigger complex processes that make traditional machine learning algorithms limited in quantifying impacts of climate variability on freshwater in this study we developed a novel machine learning routine based on the gaussian process regression gpr technique to improve understanding of the interaction of non linear climatic variables with hydrological stores includes surface water and terrestrial water storage tws the gpr is built on the principle of the gaussian process which is a stochastic process that simplifies multivariate gaussian distribution to infinite dimensional space such that the distributions over function values can be defined the prediction of the gpr is tested using twenty three independent climate variables against satellite observations of tws between april 2002 and june 2017 we explored the use of a characteristic length scale for the kernels which we tagged as first order kernels and another set of kernels having a separate length scale for each discrete predictor the latter was implemented using the automatic relevance determination ard tagged as higher order kernels the first and higher order kernels of the gpr technique were further examined using multivariate statistical indices to reveal the close relationship among hydro climatic similarity and predictability new hydrological insights for the region our results indicate that the large fluctuations of tws in our tentative test bed the zambezi basin for the gpr technique are largely caused by strong changes in sea surface temperature and global teleconnection patterns of the nearby oceans the gpr introduced in this study provides an improved modelling framework to keep track on the influence of these global climate teleconnection patterns on major hydrological systems like the zambezi basin which contributes to global hydro climatology but currently showing large amplitudes of land water storage loss graphical abstract ga1 keywords gaussian process regression machine learning theory surface water hydrology zambezi river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global interest in climate dynamics is intensifying because of its anticipated impacts on economic growth agriculture and water security tall et al 2017 as projected climate impacts are expected to have profound negative effects on freshwater availability through its direct effect on surface water hydrology especially in large river basins understanding the effect of climate dynamics on surface water hydrology is therefore needed to forecast the aftermath and implications on several ecological assets freshwater habitats as well as wetland functions ndehedehe et al 2022 however modelling global freshwater systems is difficult because of the complexities of climate and anthropogenic influence on hydrological systems especially at local scales the rapid changes in hydrological systems caused by the influence of global climate trigger complex processes that make traditional machine learning algorithms limited in quantifying impacts of climate variability on freshwater over the past decade there has been an increase in the application of machine learning in hydrology with several experiments attempting to uncover hidden patterns in non linear hydro climatic systems and improving forecast procedures for example the application of data driven stochastic models in understanding surface water interactions over large sub regions especially due to its simplicity in development and implementation has been reported ndehedehe et al 2022 kraft et al 2022 amaranto et al 2020 data driven techniques such as gene expression programming shah et al 2021 support vector machines rehana 2019 boosted regression trees tisseuil et al 2012 random forest and m5 model trees ardabili et al 2019 neural networks khan and coulibaly 2010 kalu et al 2022c among others have been widely applied in surface water related climate studies the simplicity of the above mentioned data driven models is easily noticed in its parameter estimation calibration techniques and its efficiency in handling different sources of uncertainties better than their physically based counterparts gianni et al 2019 burrows and doherty 2016 okwuashi et al 2020 the utilization of these data driven procedure however are not largely developed for systems models with many missing data points like the terrestrial water storage tws datasets gotten from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace missions ahi and cekim 2021 nevertheless the gaussian process regression gpr has been reported to accommodate this anomaly through its probabilistic mode of approximating a target function by maintaining the capability of denoting complex input and output interactions even without predefining a set of basis functions which enables the machine to predict a target output with uncertainty quantification however studies on novel methodologies like the gpr in understanding the influence of climate change on land water hydrology is still largely insufficient thus the intent behind this study the gpr process is a probabilistic supervised learning algorithm that originates the learning of a regressor within a bayesian framework rasmussen 2003 endo et al 2020 it allows the reconstruction of its underlying functions by removing contaminating factors when solving a regression problem it maintains the advantage of performing such regressions exactly using matrix operations past studies have implemented the gpr technique in satellite remote sensing and climate studies however its application towards understanding the dynamics of terrestrial water hydrology in large freshwater basins is yet to be fully explored nevertheless past studies that applied gpr in climate and hydrological analysis reported significant results to warrant a full scale analysis as undertaken in this literature e g kalu et al 2023 for example endo et al 2020 applied a gaussian process based temporal interpolation technique to a series of sentinel 1 images that capture wetlands in washington united states and reported a significant potential of the algorithm in detecting severe changes in a system as well as its strong contribution to operational wetland monitoring liang and liu 2021 employed the gpr procedure in capturing the relationship between modis derived water index and landsat derived water fraction the authors reported that the gpr model outperformed the decision tree and support vector machine regression model used for the same analysis in approximately 8 44 and 10 01 in terms of root mean square error rmse respectively shadrin et al 2021 on the other hand discussed the approach to water quality spatial prediction based on a modified gpr procedure and a thorough assessment based on its overall variance the authors utilized the gpr algorithm as a kriging tool and explored the automatic kernel structure search to achieve detailed results for geological modeling exercises which proved to be better when compared to ordinary and universal kriging methods lal and datta 2018 compared genetic programming gp and gpr in estimating density dependent saltwater intrusion process and forecast salinity concentrations in an illustrative coastal aquifer system their results show that the gpr models outperformed the gp algorithm and even suggested that the gpr technique can serve as a substitute for the complex numerical simulation model in a chain simulation optimization approach the study undertaken by grbić et al 2013 presented the probabilistic approach for stream water temperature prediction based on the gpr technique and produced better results than those obtained by the linear regression model logistic model and stochastic modeling techniques other climate related studies including groundwater analysis and predictions have equally corroborated the superiority of the gpr model to other probabilistic supervised machine learning algorithms e g see raghavendra and deka 2016 the gpr model presents a formal way of solving regression and classification problems e g bishop and nasrabadi 2006 grbić et al 2013 in this study we present this probabilistic supervised learning approach in understanding the influence of climate dynamics on surface water hydrology using the zambezi river basin as a test bed for the implementation of a gpr framework in line with the need to evaluate the dynamics of global freshwater resources the study undertaken by kalu et al 2021 recorded a consistent loss of 9 9 2 6 mm in freshwater over the zambezi river basin from the period of 2002 2017 other reports have highlighted the dominant hydrological features and uniqueness of the zambezi river basin s terrestrial water hydrology and hydrodynamics nyatsanza et al 2015 hughes and farinosi 2020 inasmuch as extreme hydro climatic events in the sub saharan african region are largely dominated by natural events and interannual variability studies have also dwelled on the direct influence of oceanic variabilities such as the el nino southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and indian ocean dipole iod phenomena in regulating surface water hydrology in the zambezi river basin see e g mehrnegar et al 2020 yan et al 2020 abd elbaky and jin 2019 however recent variations in tws in some parts of the zambezi basin have been linked to anthropogenic influences ahmed and wiese 2019 and was attributed to the decline in the levels of lake malawi as reports on the negative trends in tws over the zambezi river basin converge a broader perspective of surface water relationships with extreme climatic conditions could provide better understanding of the consequences of intense climatic events on hydro ecological assets and biodiversity of the zambezi river basin given the complexities of climate and anthropogenic influence on hydrological systems especially at local scales a novel machine learning is warranted to improve our capability in tracking the influence of global climate on such systems the goal of the proposed gpr technique is in the similitude of other stochastic models such that the estimation is generated as an integration of two gpr models the first gpr model is used for the prediction of tws while the other gpr model is modeling the impact of the independent input parameters that are thought to contribute significantly to the tws dynamics of the study region the latter model can be further disintegrated into multiple gpr models aimed at constructively modeling the non linear relationships existing between the original input predictors and the predictand the suitable input parameters and their respective lags are determined by the evaluation of complementary information between lagged input variables and the terrestrial water storage of the zambezi river basin our study objectives are i understanding the influence of river discharge and surface water estimates as key predictors of grace tws over the zambezi river basin ii predicting grace tws of the study region from 2002 to 2017 using the gpr model by training the non linear climate datasets which served as our predictors and iii validating the robustness of our proposed model in predicting grace tws for our study period using independent river discharge estimates this remainder of this study is segmented as follows section 2 gives a brief summary of the study area section 3 provides an overview on the materials and methods employed in this study section 4 gives a thorough outline of the results while we discuss and conclude the study in section 5 2 study area the zambezi river basin formed the study area and test bed of our new model located in south eastern africa the basin has a catchment area of 1 39 million km2 fig 1 the source of the river is the kalene hills in north west zambia and it flows through nine riparian countries over a length of 2750 km before it empties into the indian ocean in mozambique the hydrological conditions of the basin are characterized by a high degree of variability due to its large size and diverse topography the basin witnesses a high flow during the rainy season and low flow during the dry season generally rainfall starts between september and november peaks around december to february and ends between march and may kalu et al 2021 the basin witnesses dry season between june and august though occasionally the northern parts of the basin receives rainfall as early as august as a result of growing global climate fluctuations over the past decades the zambezi river basin witnessed severe hydrological anomalies which resulted in record water loss and drought episodes for example one of the longest grace identified hydrological drought events was experienced from jan 2003 to dec 2007 with a peak deficit of 222 km3 below climatology occurring in april 2005 thomas et al 2014 a more recent drought episode occurred in 2019 and was reported to have the lowest basin averaged annual precipitation pattern the most severe local precipitation deficit in the north of the basin and the lowest reservoir levels since 1995 hulsman et al 2021 the basin is also affected by a number of human activities such as dam constructions mining and irrigation which can have a significant impact on the hydrological conditions of the basin overall the hydrological conditions of the zambezi river basin are complex and can vary substantially depending on location and season 3 materials and methods 3 1 data and data processing 3 1 1 terrestrial water storage predictand this study used the grace mascon mass concentration solution assessed from the center for space research csr at the university of texas through http www csr utexas edu grace rl05 mascons html to assess tws over the zambezi river basin from april 2002 to june 2017 the grace mascon solutions blocks were down sampled to a spatial resolution of 0 50 0 50 this helped in averaging of the regional cells which were still restricted to the 300 km nominal resolution of the grace the csr mascon approach uses an intermediate solution for the establishment of a time variable regularization matrix to assess the mascon solution this allows the composition of a time variable regularization based on the grace dataset save et al 2016 and ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 explained the importance of this regularization which is vital in preventing the mission s signals leaking into the nearby oceans these procedures streamline the application of the grace derived datasets in various hydrological and water resource management problems 3 1 2 predictor selection predictor selection is a key step in developing data driven tws prediction models generally predictors characterizes two information sources that may contribute to tws predictability the influence of initial river basin conditions and the effects of climate change on surface water hydrology of the river basin during the prediction period ndehedehe et al 2022 hughes and farinosi 2020 the use of hydrological fluxes is the most common method of predicting changes in tws however sea surface temperatures and climate indies are becoming increasingly important in tws evaluations particularly due to their impacts and the weight of their footprints in regulating climate dynamics especially in tropical regions ndehedehe et al 2017 our predictor set of hydrological fluxes are carefully selected to reflect the dominant hydrological activities of the zambezi river basin gotten from past literatures e g kling et al 2014 teodoru et al 2015 meier et al 2011 the predictor set of ssts and cis are as a result of the growing influence of teleconnection patterns on the region s surface water hydrology which has been recorded to affect the spatio temporal variability of rainfall patterns over the river basin e g muchuru et al 2016 the effects of climate indices on tws s predictability are seasonal and regional dependent and have been the subject of discussions on several climate teleconnection studies e g chiew and mcmahon 2002 hidalgo and dracup 2003 a main purpose of this study however is to demonstrate the robustness of the gpr model for predicting tws at the monthly level which will provide insights to the influence of climate dynamics on terrestrial water hydrology of the study region due to the carefully selected predictors used for the experiment thus our predictor focus is tilted towards those representing the initial catchment conditions of the zambezi river basin table 1a 3 1 3 hydrological fluxes sea surface temperatures and climate indices predictors our predictors are categorized into hydrological fluxes hf sea surface temperatures sst and climate indices ci datasets they are summarized in table 1a 3 2 in situ river discharge estimates validation observed river discharge data for the katima mulilo station at the zambezi river was accessed from the grdc https portal grdc bafg de applications public html publicuser publicuser datadownload stations archives and is used to evaluate the hydrological response of the zambezi river basin to climate fluctuations and dynamics the zambezi river basin is one of the largest freshwater catchments in sub saharan africa and worldwide and is characterized by complex hydrological and political geography the river is referred to as one of the key rivers in the region as multiple source of discharge from other tributaries within the zambezi basin links with the river channel before emptying into the indian ocean while the zambezi river discharge encapsulates most of the flows within the basin kalu et al 2021 this river significantly modulates the surface water hydrology of the zambezi basin beck bernauer 2011 michailovsky et al 2012 the monthly river discharge data of the zambezi river in katima mulilo station was used to validate our gpr prediction analysis which was trained using products regulating hydrological fluxes sea surface temperatures and climate teleconnection patterns that served as input parameters asides prediction these input parameters also attempt to model the impacts of the surrounding oceans on temporal dynamics of the zambezi river discharge we however use data during 2002 2017 to assess the climate influence on terrestrial water hydrology i e tws over the zambezi basin 3 3 gaussian process regression gpr the gpr is a supervised non parametric kernel based probabilistic model it is a machine learning method based on the bayes theory and statistical learning theory it is suitable for complex regression problems such as high dimensionality and non linear cases which is predominant in climatic and hydrological analysis the model undergoes a testing and training phase like many other regression models in this study we used 70 of our data to train and the remaining 30 to test the strength and robustness of the model in depicting the influence of climate dynamics on surface water hydrology by predicting tws the data used to train are independent parameters characterized by hydrological fluxes sea surface temperature products and global teleconnection patterns a total of 23 datasets were used in the training exercise table 1a b considering the training set x i y i i 1 2 3 n where x i r d and y i r drawn from an indefinite distribution the gpr algorithm attempts to predict the value of a response variable y new given the new input vector x new which form the 30 testing datasets used in our experiment and the 70 training dataset a linear regression model is of the form 1 y x t β ε where ε n 0 σ 2 the priori distribution of the observation y eq 1 and the joint prior distribution of the observed y value and the predicted value y new can be obtained by 2 y n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n 3 y y new n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n k x x new k x new x k x new x new n 0 k k t k k where k x x is a symmetric positive definitive covariance matrix whose elements estimate the correlation between x i and x j through the chosen kernel function k x x k x x t represents the covariance matrix between the test sets x new and the training set x k x x is the covariance matrix of the test set itself i n represents an n by n unit matrix the coefficients of β and the error variance σ 2 are estimated from the original dataset eq 1 to explain the response a gpr model introduces latent variables f x i i 1 2 3 n from a gaussian process gp and explicit basis functions h the covariance function of the latent variables secures the smoothness of the basis and response functions thereby propelling the inputs x into a p dimensional feature space fig 3 a gaussian process is a set of random parameters such that any finite number of them has a joint gaussian distribution if f x x r d is a gp then given n observations x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the joint distribution of the random parameters f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x n is gaussian the key building blocks of the gp are its covariance functions k x x and mean functions m x this means that if f x x ϵ r d is a gp then e f x m x and cov f x f x e f x m x f x m x k x x considering the model 4 h x t β f x where f x gp 0 k x x which means that f x are derived from a zero mean gp with covariance function k x x h x represents a set of basis functions that transform the original feature vector x in r d into a new feature vector h x in r p β is a p by 1 vector of basis function coefficients this function represents a gpr model an instance of response y can be modeled as 5 p y i f x i x i n y i h x i t β f x i σ 2 hence a gpr model is a probabilistic model cf zhang et al 2016 for further details an introduction of latent variables f x i for every discrete observation x i makes the gpr model non parametric figs 2 3 the model eq 5 can be represented in vector form as 6 p y f x n y h β f σ 2 i where 7 x x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t x n t y y 1 y 2 y 3 y n h h x 1 t h x 2 t h x 3 t h x n t f f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x n the joint distribution of latent variables f x 1 f x 2 f x n in the gpr algorithm is as follows 8 p f x n f 0 k x x similar to a linear regression model where k x x looks like 9 k x x k x 1 x 1 k x 1 x 2 k x 1 x 3 k x 1 x n k x 2 x 1 k x 2 x 2 k x 2 x 3 k x 2 x n k x 3 x 1 k x 3 x 2 k x 3 x 3 k x 3 x n k x n x 1 k x n x 2 k x n x 3 k x n x n the covariance function k x x is usually parameterized by a set of kernel parameters or hyperparameters fig 2 θ usually k x x is represented as k x x θ to explicitly indicate the dependence on θ in supervised learning it is expected that the data points having related predictor values x i instinctively project close response target values y i fig 3 in the gp the covariance function behaves in a similar manner rasmussen and williams 2006 it indicates the covariance between the two latent variables f x i and f x j where both x i and x j are d by 1 vectors that is to say it ascertains how the response at one point x i is influenced by responses at other points x j i j i 1 2 3 n the covariance function k x i x j can be defined by various kernel functions it can be parameterized in terms of the kernel parameters in vector θ therefore it is possible to express the covariance function as k x i x j θ several standard kernel functions exist for most of them the kernel parameters are based on the signal standard deviation σ f and characteristic length scale σ l the characteristic length scales concisely define how far apart the input values x i can be for the response values to become uncorrelated for this to be achieved both σ l and σ f need to be greater than 0 and this can be enforced by the unconstrained parameterization vector θ such that 10 θ 1 log σ l θ 2 log σ f we explored five kernel covariance functions with same length scale for each predictors which we tagged as first order kernels and another set of five kernel covariance functions with separate length scale for each predictors which we tagged as higher order kernels the higher order kernels were derived by using a separate length scale σ m for each discrete predictor m m 1 2 3 d the kernel function for each predictor was initialized by implementing automatic relevance determination ard neal 1996 in our case the unconstrained parameter utilized is 11 θ m log σ m θ d 1 log σ f for m 1 2 3 d table 2 gives a summary of the first and higher order kernels and their covariance functions given that the posterior distribution of the predicted tws y new of our gpr model is given by 12 y new y n y new σ ynew 2 recall from eqs 2 3 we now have 13 y new k k 1 y 14 σ ynew 2 k k k 1 k t therefore the point prediction result of our gpr model is y new having an interval prediction result corresponding to the 95 prediction interval is given by 15 y new 1 92 σ ynew 3 4 evaluation metric of point precision we determine the goodness of fit of our gpr based tws predictions against the observed tws datasets using these statistical indices 3 4 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 16 nse 1 i 1 n q i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o i and q i represents the observed and predicted tws of the study region respectively and q o represents the mean observed value the nse quantifies the proficiency of a model to explain the dynamics of tws which is easily noticeable over freshwater hotspots such as the zambezi river basin as compared to a reference model using q o the sensitivity of the nse to extreme values warranted its application as a performance metric in this study 3 4 2 root mean square error rmse chai and draxler 2014 define rmse as the square root of the mean of squared error and is given as 17 rmse 1 te i 1 te tws i tws i 2 where tws i and tws i are predicted and observed predictand values respectively te represents the size of the test set sample the more the rmse values tends to 0 the better the prediction accuracy 3 4 3 coefficient of determination r 2 coefficient of determination is defined as the sum of the squares of the regression to the sum of the squares of the total deviations which shows a fraction of the predictors explaining the dynamics of the predictand the closer the value of r 2 is to 1 the higher the point prediction accuracy the formula for r 2 is given by 18 r 2 1 i 1 te tws i tws i 2 i 1 te tws i tws i 2 4 results 4 1 the performance of the gpr model for our gpr model we set aside 70 of our original predictor predictand datasets for training and the rest for testing before training the grace tws data was normalized using the z score transformation and all other variables were linearly scaled to the range of 1 and 1 after testing the results were transformed back to the original input space to calculate the performance metrics and validate the gpr s performance in estimating the influence of climate dynamics over our study region we experimented with the three predictor categories i e hf s sst s and ci s that were described in table 1a our input datasets took account of the palmer drought severity index pdsi because the increase in the duration frequency and severity of drought and heat stress episodes have been associated with climate change and past studies have shown the influence of their effects on the structure composition as well as the biogeography of large scale river basins in tropical regions linares et al 2011 gonzalez et al 2010 overall the inclusion of ssts and the teleconnection indices as part of our predictors were found to elucidate the strong climatic hotspots of the zambezi river basin and the key roles they play in global climatology river discharge estimates gotten from the katima mulilo station at the zambezi river served as independent validation datasets for our gpr predictions of the basins tws this was warranted after significant correlation was shown between the regions precipitation patterns and discharge estimates fig 4a c and the region s tws and discharge estimates fig 4d f the strong collinearity noticed between the principal components pc s of the tws and rainfall patterns conclude that grace tws over the zambezi river basin is largely driven by river discharge and surface water estimates which has also been reported in some other sub saharan african basins such as the congo river basin ndehedehe et al 2022 figure 5 is a representation of the performance of the first order gpr predictions of the grace tws over the study region using the testing datasets and the 95 prediction interval of the model the testing dataset represents an annual time series of randomly selected data samples from the original observations our point precision results tends to improve when moving from the dry to the wet periods which are characterized by higher runoff ratios given rise by increased precipitation patterns and lower aridity indices given rise by decreased precipitation patterns we also observe that the exponential kernel outperformed the remaining first order kernels in prediction results which explains its robustness in modeling tws of river basins having both persistent and erratic flow regimes erratic regimes are envisaged for fast responding catchments such as the zambezi and congo river basins ndehedehe et al 2022 and are presumed dominant during periods of sporadic rainfall events or during hot humid periods conversely the persistent regimes are expected during humid cold seasons in slow responding basins such as the muese and lorraine sud basins corzo et al 2009 the erratic regimes are characterized by far more significant dynamics of hydrological and climatic fluxes than the persistent regimes which in turn makes them less predictable this has been a significant objective for the application of deep learning procedures in these regions especially due to the severe non linearity of the datasets which compose the training and testing phases of the river basin s hydro climatology many tropical river basins fall into the category of erratic regimes as well as the runoff generation of which is controlled by direct precipitation patterns therefore in most cases the 95 prediction interval obtained by the gpr procedure depicts an adequate tws dynamics during the testing phase table 5 overall the prediction patterns of the first order gpr predictors are consistent for both dry and wet periods of our study region next we employ higher order gpr prediction models of the same datasets for the tws predictions of the zambezi basin basically the isotropic functions of the first order kernels are modified using the ard structure in order to efficiently extract and improve prediction accuracy and robustness of the set of high relevant optimized input features this has shown to be largely reliable in past prediction studies c f liu et al 2019 the higher order kernels perform model estimation by iteratively maximizing the marginal log likelihood of the set of input parameters fig 2 table 5 in fig 6 we observe the robust performance of the higher order kernels in the tws predictions of the study region using our testing datasets the ard procedure was able to fine tune the tws predictions compared to the first order kernels see corresponding variants of figs 5 and 6 4 2 the validation of the gpr performance our testing datasets further provided us with an avenue to comprehend the generalization capability of all trained gp models in our study especially as the testing datasets were not date dependent but randomly selected in a bid to ensure proper system stability and prediction validation ideally if the terrestrial water hydrology of the study region is unaltered and the trained models are not over fitted the performances of the models are supposed to stay relatively unaltered in table 3 we summarized the comparative assessment of the first fig 5 and higher order fig 6 gpr kernels in their predictions of tws in the zambezi river basin the correlation coefficient of the first fig 5 and higher order fig 6 kernels between the observed and predicted tws values indicate significant collinearity between the two values which affirms the robustness of the gpr algorithm in modeling severely non linear climatic datasets we observed an average rmse performance of 0 023 m 0 025 m 0 024 m 0 024 m 0 023 for the sequential first order kernels and an average rmse performance of 0 013 m 0 012 m 0 011 m 0 012 m and 0 007 m for the sequential higher order kernels table 3 which is relatively satisfactory the nse values show that the more they tend to 1 the better the performance of the gp kernel in the testing datasets conversely the more they tend to the more unstable the prediction capability tends to be our results show that both first and higher order kernels predicted well however the higher order kernels performed better than the first order kernels as they maintained nse values closest to 1 in climatological terms we interpret the results as follows a physically nse values tending towards indicate that the tws variability is more erratic and thus is less predictable in the first place b river basins that maintain nse values tending towards are usually situated in arid regions where sporadic precipitation patterns gives rise to erratic hydrological patterns that deviate substantially from the basin s nominal patterns thereby making gaussian distributions less appropriate in modeling them even after variable transformation c the effect of altered watershed responses and hydrological patterns in recent years is linked to vulnerability of semi arid regions towards anthropogenic impacts sun et al 2014 and d conventional data driven models that accommodates a comprehensive set of predictor parameters tend to be more reliable than data driven models trained using historic observations and is known as the effect of non stationarity as reported by wagener et al 2010 the study undertaken by ndehedehe et al 2022 found out the potential impact of anthropogenic influences and deforestation activities on the surface water hydrology of large freshwater basins in the sub saharan african region these finds are more significant than previously thought furthermore irrespective of the percentage of the annual precipitation patterns received by these freshwater basins irrigation activities and crop land management activities may cause shifts in the average surface water hydrology of these basins these inherent fluctuation patterns have the potential of affecting predictability especially as a result of the non linear interactions among multiple factors that form part of the basins climatology sun et al 2014 kalu et al 2022d 4 3 first order v higher order gpr kernels the first order kernels of our gpr algorithm were able to learn the 23 independent parameters which we used as predictors to produce a robust modeling of the grace tws of our study region in fig 7a the exponential kernel produced a satisfactory fit of the grace tws of our entire study region amidst the climatic uncertainties that affected tws levels before 2006 thomas et al 2014 the remaining first order kernels figs 7b e 10b e despite providing a fantastic modeling phase were slightly affected by the uncertainties shown in fig 4a and c the higher order kernels on the other hand maintained a perfect fitting index figs 7f j 10f j regardless of the variabilities and uncertainties of the zambezi river basin noticed in the early years of our study period fig 4d this shows that the influence of the ard in modulating climatic observations is highly significant and can improve accuracy and precision predicting the grace tws missing months so as to enhance hydro geodetic hydrological and climate operations 4 4 statistical decomposition of spatio temporal trends linear trends from the grace mascon solutions overlaid with river discharge estimates fig 4d f for the period from april 2002 june 2017 show the overall structure and suitability of our tws estimates to capture hydrological patterns the surface water hydrology of the zambezi basin was assessed using time series of grace derived tws and a set of model derived datasets that served as our predictors for the study period the temporal distribution of trends in tws obtained from grace mascon solution figs 1b 4a depicts an inconsistent trend from 2002 to 2007 a steady rise in tws from 2008 to 2010 followed by a slow but steady decline from 2011 to 2018 which overall translates to a loss in freshwater resources in the region as reported by kalu et al 2021 fig 8 represents the dominant spatio temporal patterns of changes in tws over the zambezi river basin from 2002 2017 the statistically significant pcs which are represented by the first six modes gave a cumulative variance of 98 735 and were assumed as significant signals denoting over 95 of the total tws dynamics of the zambezi basin from the pca analysis it is deduced that the eof loadings are observed within west and central parts of the zambezi river basin in the first third and fifth orthogonal modes figs 8a 8c 8e this is also in line with our observation in fig 9 where the influence of the upper zambezi luanginga cuando chobe barotse kafue kariba and tete sub basins in regulating tws over the zambezi basin has been outlined fig 9b m shows that ssts and teleconnection patterns play a key role in the dynamics of tws captured in figs 8a 8c 8e 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 the influence of river discharge and surface water estimates in driving grace tws the response of surface water hydrology to climate dynamics was evaluated by comparing the leading temporal time series of precipitation fig 4a c and tws patterns fig 4d f with normalized discharge time series katima mulilo station at the zambezi river the temporal patterns of the standardized tws and river discharge trends tends to be consistent except for periods of extreme hydro climatic events as seen in figs 4d 4 f the collinearity between river discharge estimates and tws was higher as compared to the collinearity between river discharge estimates and precipitation patterns this is because inasmuch as precipitation is a significant input to the hydrological system of the tropical wet coastal areas like the congo and zambezi the interconnectivity of the river systems results in the strong signals of surface water changes being captured by grace tws the leading temporal time series of precipitation against river discharge estimates fig 4a c however provided sufficient knowledge as to the influence of the precipitation signals that drive annual recharge and nourishes soil moisture over the zambezi river basin this equally suggests that the influences of precipitation patterns as the major drivers of hydrological conditions of the basin during the study period appear to have changed this is mainly due to the impacts of extreme climatic activities and anthropogenic influences which are known to alter the inter relationships between rainfall and discharge estimates in ways that compound our understanding of natural hydro climatic operations in the region temporal dynamics in river discharge estimates is presumed to be driven by changes in precipitation patterns and other land surface conditions which includes land use change considerable variability over the zambezi river s discharge was reported by muchuru et al 2016 from 2002 to 2006 which is consistent with the 14 decrease in the zambezi river discharge during the same period fig 4d f ultimately this would imply that the decrease in precipitation patterns during this period led to a reduction in the zambezi basin discharge this was also the major cause of the inconsistency from 2002 to 2016 when climatic extremes were observed furthermore fig 4 shows that the surface water of the zambezi river basin is a key component of the grace water column suggesting a significant association between river discharge estimates and surface water storage extracted from the grace tws dataset we however adopted the normalized variants of the river discharge estimates as a validation frame for our gpr predicted tws instead of using it as one of the input datasets of our machine learning procedure the influence of hydrological fluxes in regulating surface water hydrology of tropical freshwater basins has been captured by past studies ndehedehe et al 2018 2019 2022 our study estimates the impacts and contributions of hydrological products global teleconnection indices and sst products on the surface water storage of the zambezi basin using a multi linear regression approach as suggested by phillips et al 2012 this was useful in the recognition of significant modes of the grace tws that formed part of predictors in the study of surface water dynamics over the zambezi basin given that the sst index performs best when tested over relatively smaller localized regions such as river basins see ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 results from fig 9 therefore provides sufficient response as to their influence on the terrestrial water hydrology of the zambezi basin as shown in fig 9 the strength of the influences of our predictors are mostly felt in the south western and central portion of the zambezi basin which is composed of the upper zambezi luanginga cuando chobe barotse kafue kariba and tete sub basins the pdo and sst anomalies of the pacific oceans nino1 2 nino3 0 nino3 4 nino4 and the enso indices show the highest association with the spatial evolution of tws over the zambezi basin generally the independent patterns of tws dynamics over the study region are largely associated with the pacific indices the dominant relationship of these climate modes with the spatio temporal patterns of the tws over our study region highlights the substantial footprints of global climate over the zambezi basin given that the nino indices are signals from the enso region which is duly characterized by the eastern and central pacific it follows therefore that the tws dynamics over the western and central zambezi basin are driven by the enso phenomenon fig 9i ndehedehe et al 2017 other sst and teleconnection products also provided sufficient relationship with the tws of the study region showing their spatial impacts in regulating freshwater dynamics over the river basin however few hydrological parameters such as the albedo fig 9n showed weak relationships in their relationship with tws nevertheless their role as predictors increased the potential of our machine learning framework in performing the needed analysis over the study region building on the work of phillips et al 2012 we corroborate their assertions on the influence of el nino induced water deficits i e positive phase and increased tws i e negative phase caused by la nina s in the tropical region as a direct contributor of sst anomalies in the surrounding oceans ndehedehe et al 2019 also the grid based interactions between these climate modes and the region s tws show that the land water storage in a large portion of the zambezi sub basin is mostly influenced by the pacific followed by the atlantic and then the indian teleconnections fig 9 this supports the assertion made by ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 who suggested that the influence of ssts from relatively closer oceans on tws dynamics exhibit high correlations our study clearly shows that the effect of ocean dynamics in regulating climatic fluctuations of large freshwater basins is largely driven by proximity 5 2 spatio temporal patterns of land water storage fig 8 explains the pca decomposition of the most dominant spatial tws patterns over the study region in the first pca mode fig 8a the annual variability of tws dynamics over the study region is represented by a variance of 24 755 it can therefore be deduced that the strongest annual variability occurred over the central portion of the zambezi basin which consists of notable sub basins such as the kabompo barotse kariba mupata and kafue whose combined area is 546 251 km2 beilfuss 2012 the second pca mode fig 8b explains 11 135 of the total tws variability representing another annual tws variation with a significant positive trend over the upper eastern portion of the zambezi basin that is composed of the north eastern luangwa sub basin and the northern part of the lake malawi this re iterates on the essence of the lake malawi together with its outflowing shire river water system and its contribution to surface water dynamics and other human and ecological functions such as hydropower generation water supply for industrial and domestic use within and outside the city of blantyre and its supply of irrigation water in the lower shire valley therefore we observe that any changes in the ecological or hydrological behaviors of the lake will have significant consequences on the economy of the malawians in the third pca mode fig 8c increase in tws trends is noticed over the north western portion of the river basin which is composed of the upper zambezi and kabompo sub basins explaining their impact on the surface water hydrology of the region s tws significant declines however were noticed in the east west and southern portions of the zambezi basin fig 8d f according to kalu et al 2021 these declines are majorly as a result of movement of the itcz over the river basin from the north between october and march due to the strong impacts of multi annual precipitation rates of about four to six months summer rainy season this therefore translates to a high et anomaly rate 200 230 mm and substantial water loss in swamps and floodplains especially over the south western portion of the river basin fig 8e f the distribution of positive trends in tws in the south eastern part of the basin is observed to be weak unlike the other portions of the river basin where considerable rise in tws is observed the strong negative trends around the western part of the basin fig 8e could result in a possible unfavorable hydro climatology of the zambezi basin if the trend persists overall the spatial trends of tws and their corresponding temporal dynamics for our study period suggest a decline in the surface water availability of the zambezi basin we have outlined sst and teleconnection components as very significant contributors to this unprecedented change in the annual cycle of the basin resulting to considerable loss in freshwater thus affecting the organisms that rely on the ecological and aquatic ecosystem for livelihood fig 10 5 3 the gpr model as a topical machine learning algorithm in regulating surface water hydrology of the zambezi basin the zambezi river basin has one of the most dynamic climates of any major river basin in the world with an extreme range of conditions across the space and through time it has been categorized as the river basin exhibiting the worst potential effects of climate change in sub saharan africa especially as a result of the resonating effects of the increase in surface temperature latent heat transfer and evapotranspiration anomalies which have significantly affected precipitation rates over the basin mean annual precipitation varies from more than 1600 mm year in several far northern highland areas to less than 600 mm year in the water stressed southern portion of the basin fig 8d f beilfuss 2012 our experiments shows that key hydrological parameters such are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff are highly variable across the basin from year to year the entire region is extremely susceptible to harsh climatic events such as drought predicted to occur several times in a year and flood predicted to occur nearly every decade episodes drought episodes have significant impact on river flows freshwater availability and hydropower generation in the basin the natural dynamics of the zambezi river flow is significantly modified by large dams especially cahora and kariba dams on the mainstem as well as the kafue gorge upper and itezhi tezhi dams situated on the kafue river tributary these hydropower dams cited in the zambezi river basin have profoundly changed the hydrological conditions that are essential for biodiversity and downstream livelihood especially the magnitude timing frequency and duration of seasonal flood pulses over 10 of the mean annual flow of the zambezi evaporates from large reservoirs coupled with hydropower dams these water losses have been known to significantly impact on downstream ecosystem functions and increase risk of shortfalls in power generation over the region over the next century climate change is expected to escalate the hydrological fluctuations of the zambezi river basins and by extension increase the vulnerability of the ecological assets aquatic ecosystem and wetland functions of the basin as well as its hydropower dams and their operations the gpr model adopted in our experiment is a kernel based machine learning algorithm it is applied to assess the interaction of climate influence on terrestrial water hydrology of the zambezi river basin to this end we provided it with the algorithm of 23 different climatic predictors of which 11 were hydrological products 7 were sst products and 5 were climate teleconnection products a combination of these varied independent parameters formed the predictor set of our machine learning framework our predictand being grace tws of the zambezi river basin from april 2002 june 2017 was carefully extracted from the csr as a mascon solution and regridded as well as normalized to align with our set of predictors we provided sufficient knowledge fig 4 showing that the grace tws of the study region is largely driven by river discharge and surface water estimates which formed part of our validation assessment tool for the gpr predictions of grace tws as shown in fig 11 our validation results show that the gpr is very efficient in the interactions of non linear climatic observations the river discharge estimates which did not form part of the gpr learning and testing phase was only used to validate the results gotten from the first fig 11a e and higher order fig 11f j kernels of the predicted gpr tws time series fig 11 also reveals the inconsistent trends in the river discharge estimates which are driven by the significant hydro climatic influences of ocean basins around the study region thus resulting in increased sst effects on the river basin s hydrological and climatological parameters fig 9b m however the robustness of the gpr technique in modeling climatic variables is clearly shown in its prediction of the region s tws regardless of these uncertainties tables 4 5 which is a substantial result we report in this study fig 12 represents a scatter plot delineating the collinearity of the observed and predicted tws models in this study our results show that in the first order kernels the exponential kernel is more immune to climatic fluctuations than the remaining kernels fig 12a given that it recorded the highest correlation between observed and predicted tws values for the higher order kernels we see that the goodness of their performance is consistent across board fig 12f j this shows that the gpr technique is extremely useful in modeling non linear climatic indices regardless of their uncertainties and fluctuations tables 4 5 the natural flow regime of the zambezi river depicts the impact of river discharge estimates in regulating the region s tws as shown in fig 4 the river discharge estimates are composed of high seasonal and annual variability fig 4d f the zambezi tributaries draining the steep gorges of the central african plateau climax swiftly with the rains thereby reaching their maximum discharge between january and march while diminishing to dry season minimal flows by october november in the zambezi headwaters characterized by the shire river and kafue river basins large floodplain systems apprehends floodwaters and may delay peak discharge until very later in the dry periods of very early in the rainy periods one of the key factors affecting the volume of water flowing through the river channels of the zambezi river basins is runoff the mean runoff efficiency over the entire basin is only 8 3 whereas only 80 mm runoff is produced annually from the averaged 1000 mm annual precipitation over the area most of the rainfall is stored in landscape depressions floodplains or even intercepted by plants where it is lost to evaporation or infiltrates the ground to the aquifer to help maintain the zambezi base flows during the dry season the surface water estimates of this basin also play very crucial roles in regulating river discharge estimates other factors such as velocity of water width and depth of river are all contributors to the estimation of river discharge estimates these hydrological activities explain the impact and role of river discharge estimates in regulating tws fluctuations of the zambezi river s unique climatology and provides sufficient details to its role as a validation tool to the our gpr predictions fig 11 its use as a validation tool was warranted based on the collinearity we obtained from river discharge estimates against precipitation fig 4a c and tws fig 4d f from the first three dominant temporal patterns of our principal component analysis we therefore conclude this study with the following remark one of the major challenges related with the highly limited and shared water resource of many semi arid african regions is the perceived increase in competition for freshwater whose dynamics is considerably noticed in time and space okewu et al 2019 ndehedehe et al 2019 the escalated changes in freshwater in these regions as well as increased freshwater demands can be amplified by extreme climate events such as drought thereby increasing the susceptibility of rural agro communities to intensive hunger and poverty the impacts of these extreme climate variability extend beyond freshwater availability and agro related activities as it also substantially affects important terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems water scarcity and hydro power generation ndehedehe et al 2018 van loon et al 2017 schroth et al 2016 ferreira et al 2018 agutu et al 2017 recent reports on the impacts of climate variability on large freshwater basins like the congo and amazon provide a clear notion of the concept of continued effects of global climate on continental scales e g ndehedehe et al 2022 although the zambezi basin in africa is globally significant with substantial water resources after the similitude of the congo and amazon river basins recent drought episodes recorded over the basins are warnings that the effect of climatic fluctuations can be keenly felt even in the most humid regions of the world zhou et al 2014 our gpr technique identifies the contributions of global teleconnection patterns over the zambezi as an important driver of losses in hydrological stores e g surface water and drainable water we therefore argue that the gpr framework developed in this study meets the requirement of a 21st century machine learning algorithm kalu et al 2022a b okwuashi ndehedehe 2020 okwuashi and ndehedehe 2021 in modeling non linear climatic systems this is because i it appears to be immune to missing input variables as a result of its pooling of training datasets in the estimation of hyper parameters of covariance functions table 4 ii the gpr technique affords us the opportunity of testing the appropriateness of a particular covariance function through its method of cross validation or other handy model selection techniques however our experience in this experiment shows that the gp is not very sensitive to a wide array of covariance function choices especially for time series modeling and finally iii the utilization of a covariance function as a regularization mechanism improves the performance of a gpr model and makes it more robust when compared to other machine learning methods such as ann sun et al 2014 credit authorship contribution statement ikechukwu kalu writing original

7732,study region the zambezi river basin in southern africa study focus modelling global freshwater systems is difficult because of the complexities of climate and anthropogenic influence on hydrological systems especially at local scales the rapid changes in hydrological systems caused by the influence of global climate trigger complex processes that make traditional machine learning algorithms limited in quantifying impacts of climate variability on freshwater in this study we developed a novel machine learning routine based on the gaussian process regression gpr technique to improve understanding of the interaction of non linear climatic variables with hydrological stores includes surface water and terrestrial water storage tws the gpr is built on the principle of the gaussian process which is a stochastic process that simplifies multivariate gaussian distribution to infinite dimensional space such that the distributions over function values can be defined the prediction of the gpr is tested using twenty three independent climate variables against satellite observations of tws between april 2002 and june 2017 we explored the use of a characteristic length scale for the kernels which we tagged as first order kernels and another set of kernels having a separate length scale for each discrete predictor the latter was implemented using the automatic relevance determination ard tagged as higher order kernels the first and higher order kernels of the gpr technique were further examined using multivariate statistical indices to reveal the close relationship among hydro climatic similarity and predictability new hydrological insights for the region our results indicate that the large fluctuations of tws in our tentative test bed the zambezi basin for the gpr technique are largely caused by strong changes in sea surface temperature and global teleconnection patterns of the nearby oceans the gpr introduced in this study provides an improved modelling framework to keep track on the influence of these global climate teleconnection patterns on major hydrological systems like the zambezi basin which contributes to global hydro climatology but currently showing large amplitudes of land water storage loss graphical abstract ga1 keywords gaussian process regression machine learning theory surface water hydrology zambezi river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global interest in climate dynamics is intensifying because of its anticipated impacts on economic growth agriculture and water security tall et al 2017 as projected climate impacts are expected to have profound negative effects on freshwater availability through its direct effect on surface water hydrology especially in large river basins understanding the effect of climate dynamics on surface water hydrology is therefore needed to forecast the aftermath and implications on several ecological assets freshwater habitats as well as wetland functions ndehedehe et al 2022 however modelling global freshwater systems is difficult because of the complexities of climate and anthropogenic influence on hydrological systems especially at local scales the rapid changes in hydrological systems caused by the influence of global climate trigger complex processes that make traditional machine learning algorithms limited in quantifying impacts of climate variability on freshwater over the past decade there has been an increase in the application of machine learning in hydrology with several experiments attempting to uncover hidden patterns in non linear hydro climatic systems and improving forecast procedures for example the application of data driven stochastic models in understanding surface water interactions over large sub regions especially due to its simplicity in development and implementation has been reported ndehedehe et al 2022 kraft et al 2022 amaranto et al 2020 data driven techniques such as gene expression programming shah et al 2021 support vector machines rehana 2019 boosted regression trees tisseuil et al 2012 random forest and m5 model trees ardabili et al 2019 neural networks khan and coulibaly 2010 kalu et al 2022c among others have been widely applied in surface water related climate studies the simplicity of the above mentioned data driven models is easily noticed in its parameter estimation calibration techniques and its efficiency in handling different sources of uncertainties better than their physically based counterparts gianni et al 2019 burrows and doherty 2016 okwuashi et al 2020 the utilization of these data driven procedure however are not largely developed for systems models with many missing data points like the terrestrial water storage tws datasets gotten from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace missions ahi and cekim 2021 nevertheless the gaussian process regression gpr has been reported to accommodate this anomaly through its probabilistic mode of approximating a target function by maintaining the capability of denoting complex input and output interactions even without predefining a set of basis functions which enables the machine to predict a target output with uncertainty quantification however studies on novel methodologies like the gpr in understanding the influence of climate change on land water hydrology is still largely insufficient thus the intent behind this study the gpr process is a probabilistic supervised learning algorithm that originates the learning of a regressor within a bayesian framework rasmussen 2003 endo et al 2020 it allows the reconstruction of its underlying functions by removing contaminating factors when solving a regression problem it maintains the advantage of performing such regressions exactly using matrix operations past studies have implemented the gpr technique in satellite remote sensing and climate studies however its application towards understanding the dynamics of terrestrial water hydrology in large freshwater basins is yet to be fully explored nevertheless past studies that applied gpr in climate and hydrological analysis reported significant results to warrant a full scale analysis as undertaken in this literature e g kalu et al 2023 for example endo et al 2020 applied a gaussian process based temporal interpolation technique to a series of sentinel 1 images that capture wetlands in washington united states and reported a significant potential of the algorithm in detecting severe changes in a system as well as its strong contribution to operational wetland monitoring liang and liu 2021 employed the gpr procedure in capturing the relationship between modis derived water index and landsat derived water fraction the authors reported that the gpr model outperformed the decision tree and support vector machine regression model used for the same analysis in approximately 8 44 and 10 01 in terms of root mean square error rmse respectively shadrin et al 2021 on the other hand discussed the approach to water quality spatial prediction based on a modified gpr procedure and a thorough assessment based on its overall variance the authors utilized the gpr algorithm as a kriging tool and explored the automatic kernel structure search to achieve detailed results for geological modeling exercises which proved to be better when compared to ordinary and universal kriging methods lal and datta 2018 compared genetic programming gp and gpr in estimating density dependent saltwater intrusion process and forecast salinity concentrations in an illustrative coastal aquifer system their results show that the gpr models outperformed the gp algorithm and even suggested that the gpr technique can serve as a substitute for the complex numerical simulation model in a chain simulation optimization approach the study undertaken by grbić et al 2013 presented the probabilistic approach for stream water temperature prediction based on the gpr technique and produced better results than those obtained by the linear regression model logistic model and stochastic modeling techniques other climate related studies including groundwater analysis and predictions have equally corroborated the superiority of the gpr model to other probabilistic supervised machine learning algorithms e g see raghavendra and deka 2016 the gpr model presents a formal way of solving regression and classification problems e g bishop and nasrabadi 2006 grbić et al 2013 in this study we present this probabilistic supervised learning approach in understanding the influence of climate dynamics on surface water hydrology using the zambezi river basin as a test bed for the implementation of a gpr framework in line with the need to evaluate the dynamics of global freshwater resources the study undertaken by kalu et al 2021 recorded a consistent loss of 9 9 2 6 mm in freshwater over the zambezi river basin from the period of 2002 2017 other reports have highlighted the dominant hydrological features and uniqueness of the zambezi river basin s terrestrial water hydrology and hydrodynamics nyatsanza et al 2015 hughes and farinosi 2020 inasmuch as extreme hydro climatic events in the sub saharan african region are largely dominated by natural events and interannual variability studies have also dwelled on the direct influence of oceanic variabilities such as the el nino southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and indian ocean dipole iod phenomena in regulating surface water hydrology in the zambezi river basin see e g mehrnegar et al 2020 yan et al 2020 abd elbaky and jin 2019 however recent variations in tws in some parts of the zambezi basin have been linked to anthropogenic influences ahmed and wiese 2019 and was attributed to the decline in the levels of lake malawi as reports on the negative trends in tws over the zambezi river basin converge a broader perspective of surface water relationships with extreme climatic conditions could provide better understanding of the consequences of intense climatic events on hydro ecological assets and biodiversity of the zambezi river basin given the complexities of climate and anthropogenic influence on hydrological systems especially at local scales a novel machine learning is warranted to improve our capability in tracking the influence of global climate on such systems the goal of the proposed gpr technique is in the similitude of other stochastic models such that the estimation is generated as an integration of two gpr models the first gpr model is used for the prediction of tws while the other gpr model is modeling the impact of the independent input parameters that are thought to contribute significantly to the tws dynamics of the study region the latter model can be further disintegrated into multiple gpr models aimed at constructively modeling the non linear relationships existing between the original input predictors and the predictand the suitable input parameters and their respective lags are determined by the evaluation of complementary information between lagged input variables and the terrestrial water storage of the zambezi river basin our study objectives are i understanding the influence of river discharge and surface water estimates as key predictors of grace tws over the zambezi river basin ii predicting grace tws of the study region from 2002 to 2017 using the gpr model by training the non linear climate datasets which served as our predictors and iii validating the robustness of our proposed model in predicting grace tws for our study period using independent river discharge estimates this remainder of this study is segmented as follows section 2 gives a brief summary of the study area section 3 provides an overview on the materials and methods employed in this study section 4 gives a thorough outline of the results while we discuss and conclude the study in section 5 2 study area the zambezi river basin formed the study area and test bed of our new model located in south eastern africa the basin has a catchment area of 1 39 million km2 fig 1 the source of the river is the kalene hills in north west zambia and it flows through nine riparian countries over a length of 2750 km before it empties into the indian ocean in mozambique the hydrological conditions of the basin are characterized by a high degree of variability due to its large size and diverse topography the basin witnesses a high flow during the rainy season and low flow during the dry season generally rainfall starts between september and november peaks around december to february and ends between march and may kalu et al 2021 the basin witnesses dry season between june and august though occasionally the northern parts of the basin receives rainfall as early as august as a result of growing global climate fluctuations over the past decades the zambezi river basin witnessed severe hydrological anomalies which resulted in record water loss and drought episodes for example one of the longest grace identified hydrological drought events was experienced from jan 2003 to dec 2007 with a peak deficit of 222 km3 below climatology occurring in april 2005 thomas et al 2014 a more recent drought episode occurred in 2019 and was reported to have the lowest basin averaged annual precipitation pattern the most severe local precipitation deficit in the north of the basin and the lowest reservoir levels since 1995 hulsman et al 2021 the basin is also affected by a number of human activities such as dam constructions mining and irrigation which can have a significant impact on the hydrological conditions of the basin overall the hydrological conditions of the zambezi river basin are complex and can vary substantially depending on location and season 3 materials and methods 3 1 data and data processing 3 1 1 terrestrial water storage predictand this study used the grace mascon mass concentration solution assessed from the center for space research csr at the university of texas through http www csr utexas edu grace rl05 mascons html to assess tws over the zambezi river basin from april 2002 to june 2017 the grace mascon solutions blocks were down sampled to a spatial resolution of 0 50 0 50 this helped in averaging of the regional cells which were still restricted to the 300 km nominal resolution of the grace the csr mascon approach uses an intermediate solution for the establishment of a time variable regularization matrix to assess the mascon solution this allows the composition of a time variable regularization based on the grace dataset save et al 2016 and ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 explained the importance of this regularization which is vital in preventing the mission s signals leaking into the nearby oceans these procedures streamline the application of the grace derived datasets in various hydrological and water resource management problems 3 1 2 predictor selection predictor selection is a key step in developing data driven tws prediction models generally predictors characterizes two information sources that may contribute to tws predictability the influence of initial river basin conditions and the effects of climate change on surface water hydrology of the river basin during the prediction period ndehedehe et al 2022 hughes and farinosi 2020 the use of hydrological fluxes is the most common method of predicting changes in tws however sea surface temperatures and climate indies are becoming increasingly important in tws evaluations particularly due to their impacts and the weight of their footprints in regulating climate dynamics especially in tropical regions ndehedehe et al 2017 our predictor set of hydrological fluxes are carefully selected to reflect the dominant hydrological activities of the zambezi river basin gotten from past literatures e g kling et al 2014 teodoru et al 2015 meier et al 2011 the predictor set of ssts and cis are as a result of the growing influence of teleconnection patterns on the region s surface water hydrology which has been recorded to affect the spatio temporal variability of rainfall patterns over the river basin e g muchuru et al 2016 the effects of climate indices on tws s predictability are seasonal and regional dependent and have been the subject of discussions on several climate teleconnection studies e g chiew and mcmahon 2002 hidalgo and dracup 2003 a main purpose of this study however is to demonstrate the robustness of the gpr model for predicting tws at the monthly level which will provide insights to the influence of climate dynamics on terrestrial water hydrology of the study region due to the carefully selected predictors used for the experiment thus our predictor focus is tilted towards those representing the initial catchment conditions of the zambezi river basin table 1a 3 1 3 hydrological fluxes sea surface temperatures and climate indices predictors our predictors are categorized into hydrological fluxes hf sea surface temperatures sst and climate indices ci datasets they are summarized in table 1a 3 2 in situ river discharge estimates validation observed river discharge data for the katima mulilo station at the zambezi river was accessed from the grdc https portal grdc bafg de applications public html publicuser publicuser datadownload stations archives and is used to evaluate the hydrological response of the zambezi river basin to climate fluctuations and dynamics the zambezi river basin is one of the largest freshwater catchments in sub saharan africa and worldwide and is characterized by complex hydrological and political geography the river is referred to as one of the key rivers in the region as multiple source of discharge from other tributaries within the zambezi basin links with the river channel before emptying into the indian ocean while the zambezi river discharge encapsulates most of the flows within the basin kalu et al 2021 this river significantly modulates the surface water hydrology of the zambezi basin beck bernauer 2011 michailovsky et al 2012 the monthly river discharge data of the zambezi river in katima mulilo station was used to validate our gpr prediction analysis which was trained using products regulating hydrological fluxes sea surface temperatures and climate teleconnection patterns that served as input parameters asides prediction these input parameters also attempt to model the impacts of the surrounding oceans on temporal dynamics of the zambezi river discharge we however use data during 2002 2017 to assess the climate influence on terrestrial water hydrology i e tws over the zambezi basin 3 3 gaussian process regression gpr the gpr is a supervised non parametric kernel based probabilistic model it is a machine learning method based on the bayes theory and statistical learning theory it is suitable for complex regression problems such as high dimensionality and non linear cases which is predominant in climatic and hydrological analysis the model undergoes a testing and training phase like many other regression models in this study we used 70 of our data to train and the remaining 30 to test the strength and robustness of the model in depicting the influence of climate dynamics on surface water hydrology by predicting tws the data used to train are independent parameters characterized by hydrological fluxes sea surface temperature products and global teleconnection patterns a total of 23 datasets were used in the training exercise table 1a b considering the training set x i y i i 1 2 3 n where x i r d and y i r drawn from an indefinite distribution the gpr algorithm attempts to predict the value of a response variable y new given the new input vector x new which form the 30 testing datasets used in our experiment and the 70 training dataset a linear regression model is of the form 1 y x t β ε where ε n 0 σ 2 the priori distribution of the observation y eq 1 and the joint prior distribution of the observed y value and the predicted value y new can be obtained by 2 y n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n 3 y y new n 0 k x x σ n 2 i n k x x new k x new x k x new x new n 0 k k t k k where k x x is a symmetric positive definitive covariance matrix whose elements estimate the correlation between x i and x j through the chosen kernel function k x x k x x t represents the covariance matrix between the test sets x new and the training set x k x x is the covariance matrix of the test set itself i n represents an n by n unit matrix the coefficients of β and the error variance σ 2 are estimated from the original dataset eq 1 to explain the response a gpr model introduces latent variables f x i i 1 2 3 n from a gaussian process gp and explicit basis functions h the covariance function of the latent variables secures the smoothness of the basis and response functions thereby propelling the inputs x into a p dimensional feature space fig 3 a gaussian process is a set of random parameters such that any finite number of them has a joint gaussian distribution if f x x r d is a gp then given n observations x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the joint distribution of the random parameters f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x n is gaussian the key building blocks of the gp are its covariance functions k x x and mean functions m x this means that if f x x ϵ r d is a gp then e f x m x and cov f x f x e f x m x f x m x k x x considering the model 4 h x t β f x where f x gp 0 k x x which means that f x are derived from a zero mean gp with covariance function k x x h x represents a set of basis functions that transform the original feature vector x in r d into a new feature vector h x in r p β is a p by 1 vector of basis function coefficients this function represents a gpr model an instance of response y can be modeled as 5 p y i f x i x i n y i h x i t β f x i σ 2 hence a gpr model is a probabilistic model cf zhang et al 2016 for further details an introduction of latent variables f x i for every discrete observation x i makes the gpr model non parametric figs 2 3 the model eq 5 can be represented in vector form as 6 p y f x n y h β f σ 2 i where 7 x x 1 t x 2 t x 3 t x n t y y 1 y 2 y 3 y n h h x 1 t h x 2 t h x 3 t h x n t f f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x n the joint distribution of latent variables f x 1 f x 2 f x n in the gpr algorithm is as follows 8 p f x n f 0 k x x similar to a linear regression model where k x x looks like 9 k x x k x 1 x 1 k x 1 x 2 k x 1 x 3 k x 1 x n k

parameters or hyperparameters fig 2 θ usually k x x is represented as k x x θ to explicitly indicate the dependence on θ in supervised learning it is expected that the data points having related predictor values x i instinctively project close response target values y i fig 3 in the gp the covariance function behaves in a similar manner rasmussen and williams 2006 it indicates the covariance between the two latent variables f x i and f x j where both x i and x j are d by 1 vectors that is to say it ascertains how the response at one point x i is influenced by responses at other points x j i j i 1 2 3 n the covariance function k x i x j can be defined by various kernel functions it can be parameterized in terms of the kernel parameters in vector θ therefore it is possible to express the covariance function as k x i x j θ several standard kernel functions exist for most of them the kernel parameters are based on the signal standard deviation σ f and characteristic length scale σ l the characteristic length scales concisely define how far apart the input values x i can be for the response values to become uncorrelated for this to be achieved both σ l and σ f need to be greater than 0 and this can be enforced by the unconstrained parameterization vector θ such that 10 θ 1 log σ l θ 2 log σ f we explored five kernel covariance functions with same length scale for each predictors which we tagged as first order kernels and another set of five kernel covariance functions with separate length scale for each predictors which we tagged as higher order kernels the higher order kernels were derived by using a separate length scale σ m for each discrete predictor m m 1 2 3 d the kernel function for each predictor was initialized by implementing automatic relevance determination ard neal 1996 in our case the unconstrained parameter utilized is 11 θ m log σ m θ d 1 log σ f for m 1 2 3 d table 2 gives a summary of the first and higher order kernels and their covariance functions given that the posterior distribution of the predicted tws y new of our gpr model is given by 12 y new y n y new σ ynew 2 recall from eqs 2 3 we now have 13 y new k k 1 y 14 σ

evaluation metric of point precision we determine the goodness of fit of our gpr based tws predictions against the observed tws datasets using these statistical indices 3 4 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 16 nse 1 i 1 n q i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o i and q i represents the observed and predicted tws of the study region respectively and q o represents the mean observed value the nse quantifies the proficiency of a model to explain the dynamics of tws which is easily noticeable over freshwater hotspots such as the zambezi river basin as compared to a reference model using q o the sensitivity of the nse to extreme values warranted its application as a performance metric in this study 3 4 2 root mean square error rmse chai and draxler 2014 define rmse as the square root of the

predictand datasets for training and the rest for testing before training the grace tws data was normalized using the z score transformation and all other variables were linearly scaled to the range of 1 and 1 after testing the results were transformed back to the original input space to calculate the performance metrics and validate the gpr s performance in estimating the influence of climate dynamics over our study region we experimented with the three predictor categories i e hf s sst s and ci s that were described in table 1a our input datasets took account of the palmer drought severity index pdsi because the increase in the duration frequency and severity of drought and heat stress episodes have been associated with climate change and past studies have shown the influence of their effects on the structure composition as well as the biogeography of large scale river basins in tropical regions linares et al 2011 gonzalez et al 2010 overall the inclusion of ssts and the teleconnection indices as part of our predictors were found to elucidate the strong climatic hotspots of the zambezi river basin and the key roles they play in global climatology river discharge estimates gotten from the katima mulilo station at the zambezi river served as independent validation datasets for our gpr predictions of the basins tws this was warranted after significant correlation was shown between the regions precipitation patterns and discharge estimates fig 4a c and the region s tws and discharge estimates fig 4d f the strong collinearity noticed between the principal components pc s of the tws and rainfall patterns conclude that grace tws over the zambezi river basin is largely driven by river discharge and surface water estimates which has also been reported in some other sub saharan african basins such as the congo river basin ndehedehe et al 2022 figure 5 is a representation of the performance of the first order gpr predictions of the grace tws over the study region using the testing datasets and the 95 prediction interval of the model the testing dataset represents an annual time series of randomly selected data samples from the original observations our point precision results tends to improve when moving from the dry to the wet periods which are characterized by higher runoff ratios given rise by increased precipitation patterns and lower aridity indices given rise by decreased precipitation patterns we also observe that the exponential kernel outperformed the remaining first order kernels in prediction results which explains its robustness in modeling tws of river basins having both persistent and erratic flow regimes erratic regimes are envisaged for fast responding catchments such as the zambezi and congo river basins ndehedehe et al 2022 and are presumed dominant during periods of sporadic rainfall events or during hot humid periods conversely the persistent regimes are expected during humid cold seasons in slow responding basins such as the muese and lorraine sud basins corzo et al 2009 the erratic regimes are characterized by far more significant dynamics of hydrological and climatic fluxes than the persistent regimes which in turn makes them less predictable this has been a significant objective for the application of deep learning procedures in these regions especially due to the severe non linearity of the datasets which compose the training and testing phases of the river basin s hydro climatology many tropical river basins fall into the category of erratic regimes as well as the runoff generation of which is controlled by direct precipitation patterns therefore in most cases the 95 prediction interval obtained by the gpr procedure depicts an adequate tws dynamics during the testing phase table 5 overall the prediction patterns of the first order gpr predictors are consistent for both dry and wet periods of our study region next we employ higher order gpr prediction models of the same datasets for the tws predictions of the zambezi basin basically the isotropic functions of the first order kernels are modified using the ard structure in order to efficiently extract and improve prediction accuracy and robustness of the set of high relevant optimized input features this has shown to be largely reliable in past prediction studies c f liu et al 2019 the higher order kernels perform model estimation by iteratively maximizing the marginal log likelihood of the set of input parameters fig 2 table 5 in fig 6 we observe the robust performance of the higher order kernels in the tws predictions of the study region using our testing datasets the ard procedure was able to fine tune the tws predictions compared to the first order kernels see corresponding variants of figs 5 and 6 4 2 the validation of the gpr performance our testing datasets further provided us with an avenue to comprehend the generalization capability of all trained gp models in our study especially as the testing datasets were not date dependent but randomly selected in a bid to ensure proper system stability and prediction validation ideally if the terrestrial water hydrology of the study region is unaltered and the trained models are not over fitted the performances of the models are supposed to stay relatively unaltered in table 3 we summarized the comparative assessment of the first fig 5 and higher order fig 6 gpr kernels in their predictions of tws in the zambezi river basin the correlation coefficient of the first fig 5 and higher order fig 6 kernels between the observed and predicted tws values indicate significant collinearity between the two values which affirms the robustness of the gpr algorithm in modeling severely non linear climatic datasets we observed an average rmse performance of 0 023 m 0 025 m 0 024 m 0 024 m 0 023 for the sequential first order kernels and an average rmse performance of 0 013 m 0 012 m 0 011 m 0 012 m and 0 007 m for the sequential higher order kernels table 3 which is relatively satisfactory the nse values show that the more they tend to 1 the better the performance of the gp kernel in the testing datasets conversely the more they tend to the more unstable the prediction capability tends to be our results show that both first and higher order kernels predicted well however the higher order kernels performed better than the first order kernels as they maintained nse values closest to 1 in climatological terms we interpret the results as follows a physically nse values tending towards indicate that the tws variability is more erratic and thus is less predictable in the first place b river basins that maintain nse values tending towards are usually situated in arid regions where sporadic precipitation patterns gives rise to erratic hydrological patterns that deviate substantially from the basin s nominal patterns thereby making gaussian distributions less appropriate in modeling them even after variable transformation c the effect of altered watershed responses and hydrological patterns in recent years is linked to vulnerability of semi arid regions towards anthropogenic impacts sun et al 2014 and d conventional data driven models that accommodates a comprehensive set of predictor parameters tend to be more reliable than data driven models trained using historic observations and is known as the effect of non stationarity as reported by wagener et al 2010 the study undertaken by ndehedehe et al 2022 found out the potential impact of anthropogenic influences and deforestation activities on the surface water hydrology of large freshwater basins in the sub saharan african region these finds are more significant than previously thought furthermore irrespective of the percentage of the annual precipitation patterns received by these freshwater basins irrigation activities and crop land management activities may cause shifts in the average surface water hydrology of these basins these inherent fluctuation patterns have the potential of affecting predictability especially as a result of the non linear interactions among multiple factors that form part of the basins climatology sun et al 2014 kalu et al 2022d 4 3 first order v higher order gpr kernels the first order kernels of our gpr algorithm were able to learn the 23 independent parameters which we used as predictors to produce a robust modeling of the grace tws of our study region in fig 7a the exponential kernel produced a satisfactory fit of the grace tws of our entire study region amidst the climatic uncertainties that affected tws levels before 2006 thomas et al 2014 the remaining first order kernels figs 7b e 10b e despite providing a fantastic modeling phase were slightly affected by the uncertainties shown in fig 4a and c the higher order kernels on the other hand maintained a perfect fitting index figs 7f j 10f j regardless of the variabilities and uncertainties of the zambezi river basin noticed in the early years of our study period fig 4d this shows that the influence of the ard in modulating climatic observations is highly significant and can improve accuracy and precision predicting the grace tws missing months so as to enhance hydro geodetic hydrological and climate operations 4 4 statistical decomposition of spatio temporal trends linear trends from the grace mascon solutions overlaid with river discharge estimates fig 4d f for the period from april 2002 june 2017 show the overall structure and suitability of our tws estimates to capture hydrological patterns the surface water hydrology of the zambezi basin was assessed using time series of grace derived tws and a set of model derived datasets that served as our predictors for the study period the temporal distribution of trends in tws obtained from grace mascon solution figs 1b 4a depicts an inconsistent trend from 2002 to 2007 a steady rise in tws from 2008 to 2010 followed by a slow but steady decline from 2011 to 2018 which overall translates to a loss in freshwater resources in the region as reported by kalu et al 2021 fig 8 represents the dominant spatio temporal patterns of changes in tws over the zambezi river basin from 2002 2017 the statistically significant pcs which are represented by the first six modes gave a cumulative variance of 98 735 and were assumed as significant signals denoting over 95 of the total tws dynamics of the zambezi basin from the pca analysis it is deduced that the eof loadings are observed within west and central parts of the zambezi river basin in the first third and fifth orthogonal modes figs 8a 8c 8e this is also in line with our observation in fig 9 where the influence of the upper zambezi luanginga cuando chobe barotse kafue kariba and tete sub basins in regulating tws over the zambezi basin has been outlined fig 9b m shows that ssts and teleconnection patterns play a key role in the dynamics of tws captured in figs 8a 8c 8e 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 the influence of river discharge and surface water estimates in driving grace tws the response of surface water hydrology to climate dynamics was evaluated by comparing the leading temporal time series of precipitation fig 4a c and tws patterns fig 4d f with normalized discharge time series katima mulilo station at the zambezi river the temporal patterns of the standardized tws and river discharge trends tends to be consistent except for periods of extreme hydro climatic events as seen in figs 4d 4 f the collinearity between river discharge estimates and tws was higher as compared to the collinearity between river discharge estimates and precipitation patterns this is because inasmuch as precipitation is a significant input to the hydrological system of the tropical wet coastal areas like the congo and zambezi the interconnectivity of the river systems results in the strong signals of surface water changes being captured by grace tws the leading temporal time series of precipitation against river discharge estimates fig 4a c however provided sufficient knowledge as to the influence of the precipitation signals that drive annual recharge and nourishes soil moisture over the zambezi river basin this equally suggests that the influences of precipitation patterns as the major drivers of hydrological conditions of the basin during the study period appear to have changed this is mainly due to the impacts of extreme climatic activities and anthropogenic influences which are known to alter the inter relationships between rainfall and discharge estimates in ways that compound our understanding of natural hydro climatic operations in the region temporal dynamics in river discharge estimates is presumed to be driven by changes in precipitation patterns and other land surface conditions which includes land use change considerable variability over the zambezi river s discharge was reported by muchuru et al 2016 from 2002 to 2006 which is consistent with the 14 decrease in the zambezi river discharge during the same period fig 4d f ultimately this would imply that the decrease in precipitation patterns during this period led to a reduction in the zambezi basin discharge this was also the major cause of the inconsistency from 2002 to 2016 when climatic extremes were observed furthermore fig 4 shows that the surface water of the zambezi river basin is a key component of the grace water column suggesting a significant association between river discharge estimates and surface water storage extracted from the grace tws dataset we however adopted the normalized variants of the river discharge estimates as a validation frame for our gpr predicted tws instead of using it as one of the input datasets of our machine learning procedure the influence of hydrological fluxes in regulating surface water hydrology of tropical freshwater basins has been captured by past studies ndehedehe et al 2018 2019 2022 our study estimates the impacts and contributions of hydrological products global teleconnection indices and sst products on the surface water storage of the zambezi basin using a multi linear regression approach as suggested by phillips et al 2012 this was useful in the recognition of significant modes of the grace tws that formed part of predictors in the study of surface water dynamics over the zambezi basin given that the sst index performs best when tested over relatively smaller localized regions such as river basins see ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 results from fig 9 therefore provides sufficient response as to their influence on the terrestrial water hydrology of the zambezi basin as shown in fig 9 the strength of the influences of our predictors are mostly felt in the south western and central portion of the zambezi basin which is composed of the upper zambezi luanginga cuando chobe barotse kafue kariba and tete sub basins the pdo and sst anomalies of the pacific oceans nino1 2 nino3 0 nino3 4 nino4 and the enso indices show the highest association with the spatial evolution of tws over the zambezi basin generally the independent patterns of tws dynamics over the study region are largely associated with the pacific indices the dominant relationship of these climate modes with the spatio temporal patterns of the tws over our study region highlights the substantial footprints of global climate over the zambezi basin given that the nino indices are signals from the enso region which is duly characterized by the eastern and central pacific it follows therefore that the tws dynamics over the western and central zambezi basin are driven by the enso phenomenon fig 9i ndehedehe et al 2017 other sst and teleconnection products also provided sufficient relationship with the tws of the study region showing their spatial impacts in regulating freshwater dynamics over the river basin however few hydrological parameters such as the albedo fig 9n showed weak relationships in their relationship with tws nevertheless their role as predictors increased the potential of our machine learning framework in performing the needed analysis over the study region building on the work of phillips et al 2012 we corroborate their assertions on the influence of el nino induced water deficits i e positive phase and increased tws i e negative phase caused by la nina s in the tropical region as a direct contributor of sst anomalies in the surrounding oceans ndehedehe et al 2019 also the grid based interactions between these climate modes and the region s tws show that the land water storage in a large portion of the zambezi sub basin is mostly influenced by the pacific followed by the atlantic and then the indian teleconnections fig 9 this supports the assertion made by ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 who suggested that the influence of ssts from relatively closer oceans on tws dynamics exhibit high correlations our study clearly shows that the effect of ocean dynamics in regulating climatic fluctuations of large freshwater basins is largely driven by proximity 5 2 spatio temporal patterns of land water storage fig 8 explains the pca decomposition of the most dominant spatial tws patterns over the study region in the first pca mode fig 8a the annual variability of tws dynamics over the study region is represented by a variance of 24 755 it can therefore be deduced that the strongest annual variability occurred over the central portion of the zambezi basin which consists of notable sub basins such as the kabompo barotse kariba mupata and kafue whose combined area is 546 251 km2 beilfuss 2012 the second pca mode fig 8b explains 11 135 of the total tws variability representing another annual tws variation with a significant positive trend over the upper eastern portion of the zambezi basin that is composed of the north eastern luangwa sub basin and the northern part of the lake malawi this re iterates on the essence of the lake malawi together with its outflowing shire river water system and its contribution to surface water dynamics and other human and ecological functions such as hydropower generation water supply for industrial and domestic use within and outside the city of blantyre and its supply of irrigation water in the lower shire valley therefore we observe that any changes in the ecological or hydrological behaviors of the lake will have significant consequences on the economy of the malawians in the third pca mode fig 8c increase in tws trends is noticed over the north western portion of the river basin which is composed of the upper zambezi and kabompo sub basins explaining their impact on the surface water hydrology of the region s tws significant declines however were noticed in the east west and southern portions of the zambezi basin fig 8d f according to kalu et al 2021 these declines are majorly as a result of movement of the itcz over the river basin from the north between october and march due to the strong impacts of multi annual precipitation rates of about four to six months summer rainy season this therefore translates to a high et anomaly rate 200 230 mm and substantial water loss in swamps and floodplains especially over the south western portion of the river basin fig 8e f the distribution of positive trends in tws in the south eastern part of the basin is observed to be weak unlike the other portions of the river basin where considerable rise in tws is observed the strong negative trends around the western part of the basin fig 8e could result in a possible unfavorable hydro climatology of the zambezi basin if the trend persists overall the spatial trends of tws and their corresponding temporal dynamics for our study period suggest a decline in the surface water availability of the zambezi basin we have outlined sst and teleconnection components as very significant contributors to this unprecedented change in the annual cycle of the basin resulting to considerable loss in freshwater thus affecting the organisms that rely on the ecological and aquatic ecosystem for livelihood fig 10 5 3 the gpr model as a topical machine learning algorithm in regulating surface water hydrology of the zambezi basin the zambezi river basin has one of the most dynamic climates of any major river basin in the world with an extreme range of conditions across the space and through time it has been categorized as the river basin exhibiting the worst potential effects of climate change in sub saharan africa especially as a result of the resonating effects of the increase in surface temperature latent heat transfer and evapotranspiration anomalies which have significantly affected precipitation rates over the basin mean annual precipitation varies from more than 1600 mm year in several far northern highland areas to less than 600 mm year in the water stressed southern portion of the basin fig 8d f beilfuss 2012 our experiments shows that key hydrological parameters such are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff are highly variable across the basin from year to year the entire region is extremely susceptible to harsh climatic events such as drought predicted to occur several times in a year and flood predicted to occur nearly every decade episodes drought episodes have significant impact on river flows freshwater availability and hydropower generation in the basin the natural dynamics of the zambezi river flow is significantly modified by large dams especially cahora and kariba dams on the mainstem as well as the kafue gorge upper and itezhi tezhi dams situated on the kafue river tributary these hydropower dams cited in the zambezi river basin have profoundly changed the hydrological conditions that are essential for biodiversity and downstream livelihood especially the magnitude timing frequency and duration of seasonal flood pulses over 10 of the mean annual flow of the zambezi evaporates from large reservoirs coupled with hydropower dams these water losses have been known to significantly impact on downstream ecosystem functions and increase risk of shortfalls in power generation over the region over the next century climate change is expected to escalate the hydrological fluctuations of the zambezi river basins and by extension increase the vulnerability of the ecological assets aquatic ecosystem and wetland functions of the basin as well as its hydropower dams and their operations the gpr model adopted in our experiment is a kernel based machine learning algorithm it is applied to assess the interaction of climate influence on terrestrial water hydrology of the zambezi river basin to this end we provided it with the algorithm of 23 different climatic predictors of which 11 were hydrological products 7 were sst products and 5 were climate teleconnection products a combination of these varied independent parameters formed the predictor set of our machine learning framework our predictand being grace tws of the zambezi river basin from april 2002 june 2017 was carefully extracted from the csr as a mascon solution and regridded as well as normalized to align with our set of predictors we provided sufficient knowledge fig 4 showing that the grace tws of the study region is largely driven by river discharge and surface water estimates which formed part of our validation assessment tool for the gpr predictions of grace tws as shown in fig 11 our validation results show that the gpr is very efficient in the interactions of non linear climatic observations the river discharge estimates which did not form part of the gpr learning and testing phase was only used to validate the results gotten from the first fig 11a e and higher order fig 11f j kernels of the predicted gpr tws time series fig 11 also reveals the inconsistent trends in the river discharge estimates which are driven by the significant hydro climatic influences of ocean basins around the study region thus resulting in increased sst effects on the river basin s hydrological and climatological parameters fig 9b m however the robustness of the gpr technique in modeling climatic variables is clearly shown in its prediction of the region s tws regardless of these uncertainties tables 4 5 which is a substantial result we report in this study fig 12 represents a scatter plot delineating the collinearity of the observed and predicted tws models in this study our results show that in the first order kernels the exponential kernel is more immune to climatic fluctuations than the remaining kernels fig 12a given that it recorded the highest correlation between observed and predicted tws values for the higher order kernels we see that the goodness of their performance is consistent across board fig 12f j this shows that the gpr technique is extremely useful in modeling non linear climatic indices regardless of their uncertainties and fluctuations tables 4 5 the natural flow regime of the zambezi river depicts the impact of river discharge estimates in regulating the region s tws as shown in fig 4 the river discharge estimates are composed of high seasonal and annual variability fig 4d f the zambezi tributaries draining the steep gorges of the central african plateau climax swiftly with the rains thereby reaching their maximum discharge between january and march while diminishing to dry season minimal flows by october november in the zambezi headwaters characterized by the shire river and kafue river basins large floodplain systems apprehends floodwaters and may delay peak discharge until very later in the dry periods of very early in the rainy periods one of the key factors affecting the volume of water flowing through the river channels of the zambezi river basins is runoff the mean runoff efficiency over the entire basin is only 8 3 whereas only 80 mm runoff is produced annually from the averaged 1000 mm annual precipitation over the area most of the rainfall is stored in landscape depressions floodplains or even intercepted by plants where it is lost to evaporation or infiltrates the ground to the aquifer to help maintain the zambezi base flows during the dry season the surface water estimates of this basin also play very crucial roles in regulating river discharge estimates other factors such as velocity of water width and depth of river are all contributors to the estimation of river discharge estimates these hydrological activities explain the impact and role of river discharge estimates in regulating tws fluctuations of the zambezi river s unique climatology and provides sufficient details to its role as a validation tool to the our gpr predictions fig 11 its use as a validation tool was warranted based on the collinearity we obtained from river discharge estimates against precipitation fig 4a c and tws fig 4d f from the first three dominant temporal patterns of our principal component analysis we therefore conclude this study with the following remark one of the major challenges related with the highly limited and shared water resource of many semi arid african regions is the perceived increase in competition for freshwater whose dynamics is considerably noticed in time and space okewu et al 2019 ndehedehe et al 2019 the escalated changes in freshwater in these regions as well as increased freshwater demands can be amplified by extreme climate events such as drought thereby increasing the susceptibility of rural agro communities to intensive hunger and poverty the impacts of these extreme climate variability extend beyond freshwater availability and agro related activities as it also substantially affects important terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems water scarcity and hydro power generation ndehedehe et al 2018 van loon et al 2017 schroth et al 2016 ferreira et al 2018 agutu et al 2017 recent reports on the impacts of climate variability on large freshwater basins like the congo and amazon provide a clear notion of the concept of continued effects of global climate on continental scales e g ndehedehe et al 2022 although the zambezi basin in africa is globally significant with substantial water resources after the similitude of the congo and amazon river basins recent drought episodes recorded over the basins are warnings that the effect of climatic fluctuations can be keenly felt even in the most humid regions of the world zhou et al 2014 our gpr technique identifies the contributions of global teleconnection patterns over the zambezi as an important driver of losses in hydrological stores e g surface water and drainable water we therefore argue that the gpr framework developed in this study meets the requirement of a 21st century machine learning algorithm kalu et al 2022a b okwuashi ndehedehe 2020 okwuashi and ndehedehe 2021 in modeling non linear climatic systems this is because i it appears to be immune to missing input variables as a result of its pooling of training datasets in the estimation of hyper parameters of covariance functions table 4 ii the gpr technique affords us the opportunity of testing the appropriateness of a particular covariance function through its method of cross validation or other handy model selection techniques however our experience in this experiment shows that the gp is not very sensitive to a wide array of covariance function choices especially for time series modeling and finally iii the utilization of a covariance function as a regularization mechanism improves the performance of a gpr model and makes it more robust when compared to other machine learning methods such as ann sun et al 2014 credit authorship contribution statement ikechukwu kalu writing original

7733,study region the huang huai hai region hhh study focus the optimal time scales of standardized precipitation index spi for early drought identification was determined by using meteorological data and agrometeorological disaster observation records of summer maize in hhh in this study two performance measures were used one is accuracy defined as the proportion of the drought samples identified by spi in the total samples and the other is sensitivity defined as the ratio of the number of early recognized samples to the number of identified samples new hydrological insights for the region the spi can be calculated with only precipitation at any time scales mainly including 3 6 12 or 24 month periods in previous studies however the growth period of maize is only 3 4 months and the spi with more than 3 month time scales may not be applicable for maize drought identification additionally meteorological drought is considered to be the origin for agricultural drought it is important to identify meteorological drought signals in advance by using applicable time scale spi to avoid crop yield reduction results showed that 10 day spi spi10 was the optimal index for drought identification with the highest accuracy 95 8 and sensitivity 77 72 additionally most of the drought samples identified by spi10 were 0 16 days ahead of the observed onset date the findings can provide theoretical guidance for early warning and near real time monitoring for summer maize drought disasters in hhh graphical abstract ga1 keywords standardized precipitation index time scales early drought identification summer maize huang huai hai region data availability i have shared the link to my data in the manuscript 1 introduction drought is one of the most complicated and widely occurring natural disasters in the world causing massive agricultural economic and environmental damage vicente serrano et al 2010 the ipcc sixth assessment report noted that global warming affects the global water cycle and makes the differences between dry and wet areas of the earth more obvious leading to the possibility of more frequent and serious extreme drought disasters in the future battisti and naylor 2009 douville et al 2021 as reported in the journal nature droughts and extreme heat have significantly reduced global cereal production by 9 10 from 1964 to 2007 due in part to losses of harvested area lesk et al 2016 maize zea mays l is an important food crop worldwide and also plays a vital role in the agricultural feed and starch processing industries in china haarhoff and swanepoel 2018 wang et al 2020 fao 2022 maize production is mainly classified by planting periods as either spring maize summer maize or autumn maize in china the hhh region including hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu provinces and beijing and tianjin municipalities is considered to be one of the largest summer maize producing areas in china zhang et al 2016 zhao and yang 2018 this region accounts for 31 66 of the total harvested area of summer maize in china and 31 06 of the total production of summer maize in china fu and liu 2021 in addition summer maize in hhh is mainly produced under rainfed conditions however the average drought affected area of hhh accounts for 28 of the national drought affected area wei et al 2018 the frequency of drought disaster occurrence seriously affects growth development and production of summer maize and further causes related negative impacts on national food security yan et al 2013 therefore drought identification indicators that provide advance recognition of drought disasters are urgently needed in order to provide theoretical guidance for summer maize drought monitoring early warning and prevention technology in hhh mkhabela et al 2011 xue et al 2016 droughts are generally classified into four types namely meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought van loon 2015 liu et al 2016 different types of droughts represent various stages during the drought propagation the meteorological drought caused by limited precipitation is usually the initiator of other three types of droughts especially for rained crops such as summer maize in hhh gu et al 2020 ding et al 2021 previous research has demonstrated that meteorological drought due to relatively long term low precipitation resulted in a lack of available water in the soil that then gradually led to agricultural drought for crops zhang et al 2017b 2021 that is to say there is a time lag between meteorological drought and vegetation drought or agricultural drought ji and peters 2003 dai et al 2022 and the time lag can vary greatly in different areas due to the uncertainty arising from how and when the drought propagates duan and mei 2014 zhang et al 2017b 2017c for instance it was easy for meteorological drought to transform into agricultural drought from 2000 to 2010 in hailar county li et al 2014 while the propagation time was nearly 2 3 months in most regions of the yangtze river basin li et al 2020 therefore identifying meteorological drought in advance is of great significance for early warning of vegetation drought drought indices can effectively reflect the characteristics of drought evolution and can also provide a scientific basis for instituting measures to prevent and mitigate the development of agricultural disasters most of the drought indices are appropriate for drought identification on time scales of months or years while the drought indices with shorter time scales such as daily which are more suitable for agricultural drought recognition are relatively scarce with the frequently occurrence of flash droughts owing to a warming climate the droughts may be of short duration within a few days or weeks and can greatly threaten water supply and production for crops wang and yuan 2018 ren et al 2020 drought indices with daily time scale can more accurately describe the onset cessation and evolution of drought events than that with months or longer time scales couturier et al 2001 li et al 2021 previous studies in recent decades have been conducted to formulate a number of drought indices that can be applied to a daily time scale such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the multivariate drought index mdi rajsekhar and mishra 2014 the standardized relative humidity index srhi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 and others however these indices are complicated to calculate as they contain many variables the standardized precipitation index spi is a kind of daily meteorological drought index constructed based on precipitation characteristics mckee et al 1993 guttman 1994 okpara et al 2017 the spi is calculated by fitting precipitation data to a gamma γ probability distribution function for a certain time period and transforming the γ distribution to a normal distribution wu et al 2022 according to the national standard in the grades of meteorological drought zhang et al 2017a spi 0 5 was the critical threshold for meteorological drought if spi was less than or equal to 0 5 then drought would be considered to have occurred due to the availability and flexibility of various temporal and spatial scales of spi hayes et al 1999 the world meteorological organization wmo has recommended spi for meteorological drought monitoring svoboda et al 2012 jiao et al 2019 also spi with the γ distribution has been shown to have applicability for drought monitoring and is considered to be the best index to describe cumulative precipitation in china zhai et al 2010 wang et al 2021 spi is not affected by topography and is applicable for most types of droughts szalai and szinell 2000 lana et al 2001 it relies only on precipitation and is mainly calculated by cumulative precipitation for 3 6 12 or 24 month periods solaraju murali et al 2019 cavus and aksoy 2020 zhang et al 2021 the 3 and 6 month spi are used for drought recognition at the seasonal scale while the 12 month spi is used for intermediate term drought and 24 and 48 month spi are used for long term drought assessments caccamo et al 2011 zhang and yamaguchi 2014 yang et al 2019 spi values based on shorter time scale are generally used to describe drought disasters affecting agriculture while the longer time scale spi values are more suitable for assessment of water resource hazards that include reservoir storage stream flows and groundwater levels labedzki 2007 the growth period of summer maize in hhh is only 3 4 months kang et al 2022 and the longer time scale spi may not be applicable for maize drought monitoring wu et al 2021 wu et al 2019b compared daily 10 day spi and daily 30 day spi and concluded that the smaller time scale of spi the better for drought identification however the heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation may cause failure for some small time scale spi to detect drought signal in addition the sensitivities of various time scale spi for droughts are different the optimal time scale of spi for early drought identification of summer maize in hhh is still unclear this study was conducted to investigate relationships between daily spi at different time scales and actual drought disaster records for summer maize in hhh in order to find the optimal time scale for spi having high accuracy and sensitivity for early identification of drought to reach this goal we first constructed drought samples for summer maize according to observed agricultural disaster records and then calculated the accuracy and sensitivity of drought identification for 5 7 10 15 20 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 day spi in addition several typical drought processes in hhh were selected to compare and validate the applicability of these spi indices for identifying summer maize drought 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the hhh region is located at 29 43 n and 110 123 e covering five provinces and two municipalities including beijing tianjin hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu fig 1 the climate in this region ranges from semi arid to semi humid and is characterized as a typical continental monsoon climate having hot and rainy summers wu et al 2021 most of hhh is a plain that is conductive to crop cultivation it is generally considered to be the most important and the largest summer maize producing region in china as an important agricultural center however the seasonal droughts caused by high temperatures and heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation during the maize growing season often lead to high risks for grain production and national food security wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data daily precipitation records for 569 meteorological stations in hhh from 1961 to 2020 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn fig 1b all data were quality checked for climate extremes internal consistency and time consistency by the national meteorological information center nmic china meteorological administration cma applicable methods were selected to reconstruct missing data for the data of stations with less than 5 missing records the calculated mean values of the corresponding periods of other years with full measurements were interpolated at the same station stations with more than 5 missing records were eliminated 2 2 2 actual agrometeorological disaster records observations of agrometeorological disasters including the locations the types of disasters damaged crops the onset date and duration were recorded periodically based on the specification for agrometeorological observation china meteorological administration 1993 by the meteorologists at each agrometeorological station the drought records for summer maize at a total of 80 agrometeorological stations in hhh from 2000 to 2020 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn fig 1b additionally regional observation records of agrometeorological disasters from 2014 to 2020 were also obtained from cma s intranet http 10 1 64 146 disaster index last visited on 27 april 2020 the disaster records consisted of the onset final date disaster types damaged crops and a detailed description of the disaster process and its impact in provincial municipal or county areas in china 3 methodology 3 1 construction of drought disaster samples the drought events in this study were analyzed from 1 june to 30 september day of year doy 152 273 to encompass the summer maize growing season in hhh wu et al 2021 kang et al 2022 which also covers the entire period of drought disasters for summer maize yan et al 2013 hu et al 2021 according to the observation records the final date of the drought events could be calculated by the drought onset date and its duration therefore the continuous process of a drought event from the onset date to the final date was regarded as one drought disaster sample if the drought event occurred before doy 152 and lasted after that the start date of the maize drought sample was traced back to the actual onset date recorded according to the observation data however if the drought event occurred before doy 273 and lasted after that the final day of the sample was set to doy 273 thus a total 192 drought disaster samples for summer maize during the growing seasons from 54 agrometeorological stations in hhh were obtained after applying the method described above 3 2 standardized precipitation index spi the spi was used to characterize the probability of cumulative precipitation during a certain period spi is applicable to identification and assessment of droughts in different regions at different time scales in general the longer the period used to calculate spi the more likely that better results will be obtained zhang and yamaguchi 2014 laimighofer and laaha 2022 therefore 60 years of daily precipitation records from 1961 to 2020 were used in this study the γ distribution is widely suggested to fit precipitation on multiple time scales because precipitation exhibits a skewed distribution a standardized cumulative frequency distribution of precipitation was used to identify drought events the spi was calculated according to the following equations zhang et al 2017a the probability density function of precipitation in a certain period x fitted by the γ distribution is described as 1 f x 1 β γ γ γ x γ 1 e x β x 0 where both the scale parameter β and the shape parameter γ calculated by the method of maximum likelihood estimate were greater than 0 the equations were 2 γ ˆ 1 1 4 a 3 4 a 3 β ˆ x γ ˆ 4 a lg x 1 n i 1 n lg x i where x i is a precipitation data sample and x is the mean value of precipitation for precipitation in a certain year x 0 the probability of x x 0 is 5 f x x 0 0 x 0 f x dx the probability of x 0 is estimated according to 6 f x 0 m n where m is the sample size of x 0 and n represents the total number of samples the standard normal distribution of the γ distribution is expressed as 7 f x x 0 1 2 π 0 x 0 e z 2 2 dx spi z is obtained by numerical solution of the equation above 8 z s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 9 t ln 1 f 2 where f is the probability calculated according to 5 or 6 when f 0 5 f 1 0 f s 1 when f 0 5 s 1 c 0 2 5115517 c 1 0 802853 c 3 0 0010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 to verify and compare the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at different time scales for drought identification cumulative precipitation within 5 7 10 15 20 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 days before the current day was used to calculate the daily spi expressed as spi5 spi7 spi10 spi15 spi20 spi30 spi60 spi90 spi120 spi150 and spi180 respectively therefore spi considers the impacts of previous precipitation conditions on subsequent drought events and the accumulative impacts of the drought events as well as the sensitivities to the drought identifications of spi at different time scales could be assessed objectively 3 3 drought identification with spi according to the national standard in the grades of meteorological drought 0 5 was used as the critical threshold for drought zhang et al 2017a a drought would be identified when spi 0 5 to determine the onset final date of the drought identification with spi the following method was adopted for each drought event if the spi of the onset date was less than or equal to 0 5 then the spi would be judged day by day forward and backward respectively until the condition above was not satisfied and then the first day as well as the last day during this period when spi met the condition would be determined as the onset day and the final day respectively of drought identified by spi however if the spi of the actual onset date was greater than 0 5 it would be judged day by day backward until the spi of a certain day before the actual final day satisfied the condition that was identified as drought and the day would be set as the onset day after that the last day on which spi was less than or equal to 0 5 would be determined as the final day of drought identified by spi note that if none of the spi values during the actual drought period satisfied the drought identification condition then the period would be regarded as drought free according to spi by the method above the spi values at the 11 time scales were used to determine the onset final dates of all drought disaster samples 3 4 accuracy and sensitivity of spi to drought the accuracy and sensitivity of the indices were used to reflect the merits and applicability of spi at different time scales for identifying drought in this study based on the onset final date of drought identification with spi described above if the onset date was ahead of the actual final date of a certain drought sample then spi would be considered to identify the drought accurately the proportion of the samples identified by spi in the total samples was regarded as the accuracy in addition drought was considered to be identified in advance by spi if the spi based drought onset date was ahead of the actual onset date of the summer maize drought thereby suggesting that spi was sensitive to drought identification therefore the ratio of the number of early recognized samples to the number of identified samples was calculated as the sensitivity of spi the date difference between the identified onset date and the actual onset date was calculated and expressed as dif the early and delayed difs were represented by negative and positive values respectively the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at the 11 time scales were compared and the spi at the optimal time scale was recommended as the most suitable indictor for early drought warning for summer maize in hhh 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of drought samples 4 1 1 spatial distribution characteristics the spatial distribution of 54 agrometeorological stations with 192 drought disaster samples for summer maize in hhh as well as the drought frequency of stations are shown in fig 2 the stations with drought records from 2000 to 2020 were mainly located in shandong anhui and henan provinces while fewer were located in jiangsu additionally the drought disasters for summer maize frequently occurred in the central regions of hhh including most of shandong northern anhui and central henan especially at the junction of these three provinces the drought frequency of the stations located in the areas above was mostly more than three and a few of them were even up to 12 out of 21 years in other regions however such as large parts of hebei western and southern henan as well as southern anhui drought occurred less than three times 4 1 2 temporal distribution characteristics the drought frequency for each doy was determined from the drought records for summer maize from 2000 to 2020 at 54 agrometeorological stations in hhh fig 3 drought disasters were mainly concentrated in june doy 152 182 especially in doy 163 174 in which drought frequency was greater than 50 and even reached 76 on doy 170 summer maize in hhh mostly entered the sowing jointing stage at this time which was critical for growth and development of crops galmés et al 2007 water deficit during this period might result in plant dwarfing and eventually production reduction rahman et al 2004 li et al 2018 additionally another period exhibiting more frequent drought occurrence was from mid august to mid september doy 222 252 that corresponds approximately to the period of tasseling to physiological maturity drought frequency on other dates mostly ranged from 10 to 20 4 2 accuracy and sensitivity of drought identification for spi at different time scales based on all drought samples 4 2 1 drought identification accuracy the number of drought samples identified by spi at different time scales for each province in hhh are shown in fig 4 the number of drought samples identified with spi at each time scale for shandong anhui and henan provinces accounted for the relatively higher ratio in the total samples however the numbers of identified drought samples for hebei and jiangsu provinces were less than the numbers observed for the other provinces and the total number of drought samples of those two provinces were only 14 and 10 respectively which was far less than observed for shandong 85 anhui 39 and henan 44 although the spatial distribution of drought samples was heterogeneous the drought identification accuracy in different provinces all presented a similar trend i e the accuracies for spi calculated with 7 10 15 and 20 day time scales were generally higher than the accuracies for other time scales spi and the accuracies calculated from spi7 spi10 spi15 and spi20 were the highest of all of the time scales in all of the provinces the accuracy of drought identification by these four spi indices in hebei and jiangsu even reached 100 although the number of drought samples for these two provinces were fewer note that even though spi5 exhibited excellent accuracy for drought identification in hebei 100 and anhui 87 2 provinces it was not applicable in other regions especially in shandong province where the drought samples accounted for the largest proportion of the total drought samples in general across the entire hhh region the number of drought samples identified by spi initially increased as time scale increased and then decreased the 184 drought samples identified by spi10 were the most compared with other spi time scales being only 8 fewer than the total number of samples similarly spi10 was the index with the highest accuracy for drought identification 95 8 ahead of spi7 and spi15 with an accuracy of 94 8 while spi150 had the lowest accuracy 66 1 slightly lower than spi120 and spi180 67 7 in addition the drought identification accuracy of spi5 77 1 and spi60 77 6 were also far below than that of spi10 according to fig 4 the accuracy of spi10 was the highest among all spi time scales and therefore the number of drought and drought free samples identified by other spi indices were compared with spi10 table 1 among the 184 samples identified by spi10 as drought 180 178 and 174 samples were also recognized as drought by spi7 spi15 and spi20 respectively while the numbers were only 126 by spi150 and 128 by both spi120 and spi180 suggesting that 93 8 of the drought samples could be recognized by both spi10 and spi7 however this proportion was only 65 6 for spi150 and 76 0 for spi5 for the eight samples identified as being drought free by spi10 six of them were recognized by spi7 while four of ten drought free samples determined by spi7 were recognized by spi10 4 2 2 drought identification sensitivity the numbers of samples identified by spi at different time scales in advance of drought disaster being noted in observational records are shown in table 2 the ratio of number of early identified samples to respective identified drought samples was calculated as the drought identification sensitivity of spi as with the number of identified drought samples the greatest number of early identified samples was produced by spi10 the number of early identified samples initially increased with increasing spi time scale up to spi10 and then decreased comparing all of the spi time scales we found that the spi with the three longest time scales spi120 spi150 and spi180 produced the lowest number of early identified drought samples however the sensitivities of these three spi indices for drought identification were all above 71 and were all higher than the sensitivities of the other indices except for spi10 77 72 the drought identification sensitivity of spi30 was the lowest 62 72 and was slightly lower than with spi5 64 19 in addition the sensitivity of spi7 71 43 and spi15 69 78 and were far below that of spi10 even though the number of identified drought samples produced by spi7 and spi15 were only two less than produced by spi10 the difs between the identified drought onset date produced by spi and the actual onset date from agricultural drought records were calculated fig 5 the number of drought samples identified by spi7 spi10 and spi15 within the dif range of 8 0 was greater than those in the ranges of 16 8 and 0 8 in order the order for other spi time scales was 8 0 0 8 and 16 8 except for spi20 and spi30 for which the number of samples decreased in the order of 0 8 8 0 and 16 8 this result can also be seen in the lines of cumulative number of samples in fig 5 the maximum line slope for the cumulative number of samples line for spi7 spi10 and spi15 were within the dif range of 24 0 for other spi time scales however the fastest period for identified samples accumulation ranged from dif greater than 16 to less than or equal to eight days with dif 8 the ratio of the cumulative number of samples to the total number of identified samples for spi7 spi10 and spi15 were 92 3 96 7 and 90 7 while ratios were less than 90 for the other spi indices except for spi30 91 7 as for the samples with dif 40 as the spi time scales increased the samples basically showed an increasing trend the greatest number of samples in the dif 40 category was identified by spi150 and spi180 with the greatest number produced by spi150 box plots were used to reflect the distribution range and median of the dif values produced by spi at different time scales fig 6 the height of the box is the interquartile range and represents the variability of the data obviously the box heights for spi with time scales of 5 7 10 15 20 and 30 days were less than the box heights for spi with longer time scales the box heights of these six spi indices with relatively short time scales increased sequentially in the order of spi5 spi7 spi10 spi15 spi30 and spi20 but spi10 had the lowest median line in addition the number of outliers values beyond the range of 1 5 iqr were much fewer for spi10 with only three outliers than for all of the other spi indices although the median lines for spi60 spi120 spi150 and spi180 were lower than the median line for spi10 the large number of outliers caused a wide and dispersive range of dif distribution the ranges of dif values for spi at time scales of 20 180 days were all greater than 100 days and the dif range was even up to 200 days for spi150 the dif ranges were less than 75 days for spi5 and spi10 however most of the outliers for spi5 were above the upper quartile q3 4 3 analysis and validation of typical drought processes 4 3 1 time series of spi values for drought identification at typical stations the two agrometeorological stations located at laiyang shandong province and ruzhou henan province with drought frequencies of 12 and 6 respectively from 2000 to 2020 were selected as typical stations for further analysis of drought processes the drought processes at laiyang in 2005 and ruzhou in 2006 are presented as examples to screen out which time scale spi is more accuracy and sensitive on drought identification fig 7 according to the records the drought which occurred during the period from 3 to 26 june 2005 doy 155 178 at laiyang and was indicated by the yellow shaded area in fig 7a comparing the results for all the spi time scales the drought event was initially recognized by spi10 on doy 148 which was seven days ahead of the actual drought onset date although spi5 spi7 and spi15 also identified the drought in advance of the observed drought onset date the onset date identified by spi5 spi7 and spi15 were four one and five days later than that determined by spi10 respectively in addition the spi5 and spi7 values fluctuated frequently around the critical drought threshold of 0 5 and spi5 even remained in a drought free state from doy 157 174 during the drought occurrence period possibly because of the small precipitation amounts on doy 161 162 166 167 and 170 similarly spi7 turned into a drought free state only four days later after the drought started additionally the drought onset dates identified by spi at time scales of 20 180 days were 3 12 14 13 12 13 and 10 days later respectively than the actual drought record onset date a heavy rain of 39 mm occurred on doy 178 thereby ending the drought condition this end to the drought was reflected accurately by all of the spi indices as shown in fig 7b the historical disaster record showed that ruzhou experienced a drought event from 11 to 20 june doy 163 172 2006 results were similar to what was observed at laiyang fig 7a even though spi5 values fell below 0 5 on doy 152 it indicated a drought free state soon thereafter with values hovering near the critical drought threshold line the determined drought onset date identified by spi5 was doy 161 two days ahead of the actual recorded drought onset date however spi5 indicated a drought free condition again only four days later and spi7 turned into a drought free state after a small amount of precipitation 2 6 mm on doy 166 spi10 presented better accuracy and sensitivity for the identification of the drought process the drought period that was identified by spi10 was from doy 155 171 with the drought onset date being eight days ahead of the actual drought onset date which was five days earlier than that for spi15 the drought onset dates determined by spi20 and spi30 were two and nine days later respectively than the observed drought onset date in addition drought was never recognized by spi with time scales of 60 180 days 4 3 2 spatial distribution of the drought onset doy and the dif identified by spi for a typical drought process according to the drought disaster observation records 14 agrometeorological stations in shandong province all recorded drought events in 2002 the drought process started from the west and progressed eastward doy 167 272 nearly covering the entire shandong province and was therefore selected as an example to present the spatial distribution of the drought onset doy identified by spi based on kriging interpolation as well as the dif at agrometeorological stations in shandong as the length of spi time scales increased the identified onset date of drought was significantly delayed fig 8 especially in eastern shandong province spi5 spi30 identified the drought situation 60 80 days earlier than spi120 spi180 in addition it seems that spi5 and spi7 was more sensitive to drought identification than spi10 for the green shaded area doy 174 193 where spi5 and spi7 was larger however the drought was identified in advance by spi10 at all 14 stations while only 12 and 13 stations identified the drought with spi5 and spi7 respectively also drought identification at two stations was delayed with spi15 and one station did not recognize the occurrence of drought the number of stations that did not recognize the drought even reached four for spi180 accounting for nearly 30 of the 14 agrometeorological stations in shandong province 4 3 3 validation of drought identification by spi10 by comprehensively measuring the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at different time scales spi10 was considered to be the best identifier of summer maize drought in hhh based on the regional observation records of agrometeorological disasters from 2014 to 2020 a drought process was recorded by 13 counties in central and western henan province from july to august 2014 and was therefore used for validation of drought identification by spi10 fig 9 according to the regional disaster records this drought event in henan province continued throughout july and into august the results showed that the entire region was consistently under a drought free condition as identified by spi10 at the end of june fig 9a however spi10 identified a drought disaster in central henan province on 4 july fig 9b and two stations in this area reported the drought six days later the drought was recognized by spi10 across most of henan province and the area contained all 13 stations on 10 july fig 9c more stations recorded the drought as time went on on 3 august all 13 stations reported the drought disaster and these observations were consistent with the drought region identified by spi10 fig 9g according to the observation records precipitation occurred over most of henan province from 5 to 9 august and the drought was therefore essentially relieved and this was reflected by much reduced drought area identified by the spi10 values fig 9h 5 discussion this study compared the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at different time scales for summer maize drought identification in the huang huai hai region using daily precipitation data and agrometeorological drought disaster observations results showed that spi10 was more applicable for drought recognition than other spi time scales which was consistent with the conclusion of wu et al 2021 that srhi at 10 day scale can objectively identify summer maize drought disasters spi10 produced higher accuracy of drought identification not only over the entire hhh region 95 8 but also in each province fig 4 and most of the drought samples that were unrecognized by the other spi indices could be identified by spi10 table 1 the spi7 spi15 and spi20 also showed a higher accuracy of 94 8 94 8 and 93 2 respectively although lower than that of spi10 the other time scales spi all had accuracy that lower than 90 and therefore could not be applicable for summer maize drought identification wu et al 2019b found that the accuracy of droughts identified by spi10 and spi30 during summer maize at sowing tasseling stage in hhh were 96 4 and 85 5 which was similar to the results in this study however they did not determine that if 10 day time scale of spi has the highest accuracy among all time scales spi we also proved that the values of spi5 fluctuated frequently around the critical drought threshold resulting in lower accuracy of drought identification than observed with spi10 therefore spi5 could not either precisely reflect the drought or drought free state of summer maize furthermore we defined sensitivity and dif to characterize abilities and days for early drought identification by different time scales spi results showed that the sensitivity for drought identification was the highest for spi10 compared with all other spi time scales additionally most of the drought samples could be identified 0 16 days ahead of the actual drought onset date fig 5 while the difs for spi20 and spi30 were mostly 0 8 days later than the observed drought records however li et al 2020 reported that the time lag from meteorological drought to vegetation drought was about two to three months and according to zhang et al 2017b it even took six months for winter wheat to respond to meteorological drought the different crop types and the different study regions might be the reason for the difference in results regarding the length of the time lag ji and peters 2003 duan and mei 2014 zhang et al 2021 additionally the longer spi time scales especially spi120 spi150 and spi180 were greatly affected by the long term precipitation deficit surplus during the previous period and thus could not accurately reflect the drought or drought free state for summer maize due to maize s relatively short life cycle previous research has demonstrated that longer spi time scale values were more applicable for identification of seasonal or annual droughts he et al 2015 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 fu et al 2022 without excessive precipitation values of spi120 spi150 and spi180 that were below the critical drought threshold could not return to a drought free state in a timely manner and might indicate ongoing drought for several months even though there was no observed drought for summer maize during this period this situation resulted in many drought samples being recognized more than 40 days ahead of observed drought by spi120 spi150 and spi180 this result was seriously inconsistent with the real situation a small amount of rain might be adequate to relieve summer maize drought stress similarly spi120 spi150 and spi180 values above 0 5 were insensitive to short term water deficit and therefore drought identification might be delayed or even unrecognized by these indices fig 7 it was because the longer the time scale the lower the weight of daily precipitation okpara et al 2017 xie et al 2019 the time series graphs of long time scales spi would not change rapidly when the same daily precipitation moved out of the time scales windows thus the response of spi120 spi150 and spi180 to precipitation is too insensitive which was in agreement with the findings of zhang and yamaguchi 2014 and xie et al 2019 in contrast spi10 presented the best sensitivity to a variety of precipitation events and amounts additionally spi10 was validated as having the ability to predict summer maize drought processes through an analysis of drought events in shandong and henan provinces fig 8 and fig 9 respectively however other spi time scales presented different degrees of delayed identification of droughts and some stations did not recognize the occurrence of drought at all with these indices consequently we conclude that spi10 can be used to identify the signal of drought and has earlier drought detection ability than other time scales spi nevertheless some limitations still exist in our study hhh was selected as the study area because it is the largest major summer maize producing area in china however hhh is very large especially in the north south direction and therefore experiences huge differences in thermal resources crop cultivars cultivation management practices and so on zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the actual developmental periods of summer maize in different years and areas can vary widely rezaei et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 wu et al 2019a especially due to differences in planting date the accumulated impacts of precipitation deficits in early june might not affect late planted summer maize in some regions in our study the same critical threshold of 0 5 was used to recognize drought by different spi time scales even though the sensitivity to drought is different during different phenophases of summer maize wu et al 2019b 2021 these differences might cause a substantial impact on drought identification by spi the best approach for monitoring and assessing summer maize drought may need to consider more detailed records of the actual phenological phases for further analysis even so this study focused on the identification accuracy and sensitivity of meteorological drought before agricultural drought occurs therefore it is a feasible method to use the meteorological drought threshold of 0 5 to judge the accuracy of spi in the early identification of agricultural drought at different time scales okpara et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a another limitation of the study is that the drought disaster records obtained from agrometeorological stations might not be accurate enough wu et al 2018 errors might occur due to the subjectivity of different recorders as well as lack of a standard to judge whether crops have suffered from drought conditions thereby leading to inconsistent records of actual crop situation fortunately the observations of agrometeorological disasters from 2000 to 2020 we collected completely recorded the onset final date of droughts allowing us to objectively measure ability of spi at different time scales for early identifying summer maize droughts with the continuous updating and improving of drought disaster datasets for summer maize it will be necessary to further validate the accuracy and sensitivity of spi for drought identification additionally this study was only conducted on summer maize in hhh further verification and research are needed to determine whether the conclusion is applicable to summer maize drought identification in other regions the objective of this study was to determine the optimal time scales for spi to early identify meteorological drought for summer maize other meteorological drought indices were not discussed in the study it is therefore necessary to compare other meteorological drought indices to determine applicability of 10 day time scale for early drought identification xie et al 2019 wu et al 2021 previous research had showed that 10 day scale srhi standardized relative humidity index could identify the occurrence of drought relatively earlier than actual drought records for summer maize wu et al 2021 that is we got the similar conclusion with different indicators furthermore the spi indices were studied only for early identification by distinguishing the drought and drought free states of summer maize in this study it will be important to collect more detailed drought disaster records in order to further investigate the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at multiple drought levels okpara et al 2017 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 additionally agricultural meteorological drought indices can be of great significance when combined with spi10 to analyze the drought evolution process including latency onset development and recovery of drought disaster for summer maize ji and peters 2003 duan and mei 2014 zhang et al 2017b the results of this study contribute to exploring and clarifying the mechanisms of development and progression of summer maize drought disaster and provide a scientific basis for drought monitoring early warning of drought and development of drought prevention technology 6 conclusions this study constructed a set of drought samples using agricultural disaster observation records from 2000 to 2020 in hhh the spi10 index was determined to be the most optimal indicator for identifying drought disasters in comparison with other spi time scales 5 7 15 20 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 days which achieved the highest accuracy for summer maize drought identification in hhh 95 8 ahead of spi7 and spi15 with an accuracy of 94 8 in addition the sensitivity of spi10 was also the highest among the 11 spi time scales 77 7 the results suggested that most of the drought samples could be identified 0 16 days ahead of the actual observed summer maize drought onset date by spi10 the application of spi10 to characterize the drought process in different regions of hhh successfully demonstrated the robustness and utility of the index the findings from this study can provide theoretical guidance for early warning of summer maize drought furthermore more research should be conducted to distinguish multiple drought levels for summer maize in the future credit authorship

7733,study region the huang huai hai region hhh study focus the optimal time scales of standardized precipitation index spi for early drought identification was determined by using meteorological data and agrometeorological disaster observation records of summer maize in hhh in this study two performance measures were used one is accuracy defined as the proportion of the drought samples identified by spi in the total samples and the other is sensitivity defined as the ratio of the number of early recognized samples to the number of identified samples new hydrological insights for the region the spi can be calculated with only precipitation at any time scales mainly including 3 6 12 or 24 month periods in previous studies however the growth period of maize is only 3 4 months and the spi with more than 3 month time scales may not be applicable for maize drought identification additionally meteorological drought is considered to be the origin for agricultural drought it is important to identify meteorological drought signals in advance by using applicable time scale spi to avoid crop yield reduction results showed that 10 day spi spi10 was the optimal index for drought identification with the highest accuracy 95 8 and sensitivity 77 72 additionally most of the drought samples identified by spi10 were 0 16 days ahead of the observed onset date the findings can provide theoretical guidance for early warning and near real time monitoring for summer maize drought disasters in hhh graphical abstract ga1 keywords standardized precipitation index time scales

occurring natural disasters in the world causing massive agricultural economic and environmental damage vicente serrano et al 2010 the ipcc sixth assessment report noted that global warming affects the global water cycle and makes the differences between dry and wet areas of the earth more obvious leading to the possibility of more frequent and serious extreme drought disasters in the future battisti and naylor 2009 douville et al 2021 as reported in the journal nature droughts and extreme heat have significantly reduced global cereal production by 9 10 from 1964 to 2007 due in part to losses of harvested area lesk et al 2016 maize zea mays l is an important food crop worldwide and also plays a vital role in the agricultural feed and starch processing industries in china haarhoff and swanepoel 2018 wang et al 2020 fao 2022 maize production is mainly classified by planting periods as either spring maize summer maize or autumn maize in china the hhh region including hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu provinces and beijing and tianjin municipalities is considered to be one of the largest summer maize producing areas in china zhang et al 2016 zhao and yang 2018 this region accounts for 31 66 of the total harvested area of summer maize in china and 31 06 of the total production of summer maize in china fu and liu 2021 in addition summer maize in hhh is mainly produced under rainfed conditions however the average drought affected area of hhh accounts for 28 of the national drought affected area wei et al 2018 the frequency of drought disaster occurrence seriously affects growth development and production of summer maize and further causes related negative impacts on national food security yan et al 2013 therefore drought identification indicators that provide advance recognition of drought disasters are urgently needed in order to provide theoretical guidance for summer maize drought monitoring early warning and prevention technology in hhh mkhabela et al 2011 xue et al 2016 droughts are generally classified into four types namely meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socio economic drought van loon 2015 liu et al 2016 different types of droughts represent various stages during the drought propagation the meteorological drought caused by limited precipitation is usually the initiator of other three types of droughts especially for rained crops such as summer maize in hhh gu et al 2020 ding et al 2021 previous research has demonstrated that meteorological drought due to relatively long term low precipitation resulted in a lack of available water in the soil that then gradually led to agricultural drought for crops zhang et al 2017b 2021 that is to say there is a time lag between meteorological drought and vegetation drought or agricultural drought ji and peters 2003 dai et al 2022 and the time lag can vary greatly in different areas due to the uncertainty arising from how and when the drought propagates duan and mei 2014 zhang et al 2017b 2017c for instance it was easy for meteorological drought to transform into agricultural drought from 2000 to 2010 in hailar county li et al 2014 while the propagation time was nearly 2 3 months in most regions of the yangtze river basin li et al 2020 therefore identifying meteorological drought in advance is of great significance for early warning of vegetation drought drought indices can effectively reflect the characteristics of drought evolution and can also provide a scientific basis for instituting measures to prevent and mitigate the development of agricultural disasters most of the drought indices are appropriate for drought identification on time scales of months or years while the drought indices with shorter time scales such as daily which are more suitable for agricultural drought recognition are relatively scarce with the frequently occurrence of flash droughts owing to a warming climate the droughts may be of short duration within a few days or weeks and can greatly threaten water supply and production for crops wang and yuan 2018 ren et al 2020 drought indices with daily time scale can more accurately describe the onset cessation and evolution of drought events than that with months or longer time scales couturier et al 2001 li et al 2021 previous studies in recent decades have been conducted to formulate a number of drought indices that can be applied to a daily time scale such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the multivariate drought index mdi rajsekhar and mishra 2014 the standardized relative humidity index srhi farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 and others however these indices are complicated to calculate as they contain many variables the standardized precipitation index spi is a kind of daily meteorological drought index constructed based on precipitation characteristics mckee et al 1993 guttman 1994 okpara et al 2017 the spi is calculated by fitting precipitation data to a gamma γ probability distribution function for a certain time period and transforming the γ distribution to a normal distribution wu et al 2022 according to the national standard in the grades of meteorological drought zhang et al 2017a spi 0 5 was the critical threshold for meteorological drought if spi was less than or equal to 0 5 then drought would be considered to have occurred due to the availability and flexibility of various temporal and spatial scales of spi hayes et al 1999 the world meteorological organization wmo has recommended spi for meteorological drought monitoring svoboda et al 2012 jiao et al 2019 also spi with the γ distribution has been shown to have applicability for drought monitoring and is considered to be the best index to describe cumulative precipitation in china zhai et al 2010 wang et al 2021 spi is not affected by topography and is applicable for most types of droughts szalai and szinell 2000 lana et al 2001 it relies only on precipitation and is mainly calculated by cumulative precipitation for 3 6 12 or 24 month periods solaraju murali et al 2019 cavus and aksoy 2020 zhang et al 2021 the 3 and 6 month spi are used for drought recognition at the seasonal scale while the 12 month spi is used for intermediate term drought and 24 and 48 month spi are used for long term drought assessments caccamo et al 2011 zhang and yamaguchi 2014 yang et al 2019 spi values based on shorter time scale are generally used to describe drought disasters affecting agriculture while the longer time scale spi values are more suitable for assessment of water resource hazards that include reservoir storage stream flows and groundwater levels labedzki 2007 the growth period of summer maize in hhh is only 3 4 months kang et al 2022 and the longer time scale spi may not be applicable for maize drought monitoring wu et al 2021 wu et al 2019b compared daily 10 day spi and daily 30 day spi and concluded that the smaller time scale of spi the better for drought identification however the heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation may cause failure for some small time scale spi to detect drought signal in addition the sensitivities of various time scale spi for droughts are different the optimal time scale of spi for early drought identification of summer maize in hhh is still unclear this study was conducted to investigate relationships between daily spi at different time scales and actual drought disaster records for summer maize in hhh in order to find the optimal time scale for spi having high accuracy and sensitivity for early identification of drought to reach this goal we first constructed drought samples for summer maize according to observed agricultural disaster records and then calculated the accuracy and sensitivity of drought identification for 5 7 10 15 20 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 day spi in addition several typical drought processes in hhh were selected to compare and validate the applicability of these spi indices for identifying summer maize drought 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the hhh region is located at 29 43 n and 110 123 e covering five provinces and two municipalities including beijing tianjin hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu fig 1 the climate in this region ranges from semi arid to semi humid and is characterized as a typical continental monsoon climate having hot and rainy summers wu et al 2021 most of hhh is a plain that is conductive to crop cultivation it is generally considered to be the most important and the largest summer maize producing region in china as an important agricultural center however the seasonal droughts caused by high temperatures and heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation during the maize growing season often lead to high risks for grain production and national food security wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data daily precipitation records for 569 meteorological stations in hhh from 1961 to 2020 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn fig 1b all data were quality checked for climate extremes internal consistency and time consistency by the national meteorological information center nmic china meteorological administration cma applicable methods were selected to reconstruct missing data for the data of stations with less than 5 missing records the calculated mean values of the corresponding periods of other years with full measurements were interpolated at the same station stations with more than 5 missing records were eliminated 2 2 2 actual agrometeorological disaster records observations of agrometeorological disasters including the locations the types of disasters damaged crops the onset date and duration were recorded periodically based on the specification for agrometeorological observation china meteorological administration 1993 by the meteorologists at each agrometeorological station the drought records for summer maize at a total of 80 agrometeorological stations in hhh from 2000 to 2020 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn fig 1b additionally regional observation records of agrometeorological disasters from 2014 to 2020 were also obtained from cma s intranet http 10 1 64 146 disaster index last visited on 27 april 2020 the disaster records consisted of the onset final date disaster types damaged crops and a detailed description of the disaster process and its impact in provincial municipal or county areas in china 3 methodology 3 1 construction of drought disaster samples the drought events in this study were analyzed from 1 june to 30 september day of year doy 152 273 to encompass the summer maize growing season in hhh wu et al 2021 kang et al 2022 which also covers the entire period of drought disasters for summer maize yan et al 2013 hu et al 2021 according to the observation records the final date of the drought events could be calculated by the drought onset date and its duration therefore the continuous process of a drought event from the onset date to the final date was regarded as one drought disaster sample if the drought event occurred before doy 152 and lasted after that the start date of the maize drought sample was traced back to the actual onset date recorded according to the observation data however if the drought event occurred before doy 273 and lasted after that the final day of the sample was set to doy 273 thus a total 192 drought disaster samples for summer maize during the growing seasons from 54 agrometeorological stations in hhh were obtained after applying the method described above 3 2 standardized precipitation index spi the spi was used to characterize the probability of cumulative precipitation during a certain period spi is applicable to identification and assessment of droughts in different regions at different time scales in general the longer the period used to calculate spi the more likely that better results will be obtained zhang and yamaguchi 2014 laimighofer and laaha 2022 therefore 60 years of daily precipitation records from 1961 to 2020 were used in this study the γ distribution is widely suggested to fit precipitation on multiple time scales because precipitation exhibits a skewed distribution a standardized cumulative frequency distribution of precipitation was used to identify drought events the spi was calculated according to the following equations zhang et al 2017a the probability density function of precipitation in a certain period x fitted by the γ distribution is described as 1 f x 1 β γ γ γ x γ 1 e x β x 0 where both the scale parameter β and the shape parameter γ calculated by the method of maximum likelihood estimate were greater than 0 the equations were 2 γ ˆ 1 1 4 a 3 4 a 3 β ˆ x γ ˆ 4 a lg x 1 n i 1 n lg x i where x i is a precipitation data sample and x is the mean value of precipitation for precipitation in a certain year x 0 the probability of x x 0 is 5 f x x 0 0 x 0 f x dx the probability of x 0 is estimated according to 6 f x 0 m n where m is the sample size of x 0 and n represents the total number of samples the standard normal distribution of the γ distribution is expressed as 7 f x x 0 1 2 π 0 x 0 e z 2 2 dx spi z is obtained by numerical solution of the equation above 8 z s t c 2 t c 1 t c 0 d 3 t d 2 t d 1 t 1 0 9 t ln 1 f 2 where f is the probability calculated according to 5 or 6 when f 0 5 f 1 0 f s 1 when f 0 5 s 1 c 0 2 5115517 c 1 0 802853 c 3 0 0010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 to verify and compare the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at different time scales for drought identification cumulative precipitation within 5 7 10 15 20 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 days before the current day was used to calculate the daily spi expressed as spi5 spi7 spi10 spi15 spi20 spi30 spi60 spi90 spi120 spi150 and spi180 respectively therefore spi considers the impacts of previous precipitation conditions on subsequent drought events and the accumulative impacts of the drought events as well as the sensitivities to the drought identifications of spi at different time scales could be assessed objectively 3 3 drought identification with spi according to the national standard in the grades of meteorological drought 0 5 was used as the critical threshold for drought zhang et al 2017a a drought would be identified when spi 0 5 to determine the onset final date of the drought identification with spi the following method was adopted for each drought event if the spi of the onset date was less than or equal to 0 5 then the spi would be judged day by day forward and backward respectively until the condition above was not satisfied and then the first day as well as the last day during this period when spi met the condition would be determined as the onset day and the final day respectively of drought identified by spi however if the spi of the actual onset date was greater than 0 5 it would be judged day by day backward until the spi of a certain day before the actual final day satisfied the condition that was identified as drought and the day would be set as the onset day after that the last day on which spi was less than or equal to 0 5 would be determined as the final day of drought identified by spi note that if none of the spi values during the actual drought period satisfied the drought identification condition then the period would be regarded as drought free according to spi by the method above the spi values at the 11 time scales were used to determine the onset final dates of all drought disaster samples 3 4 accuracy and sensitivity of spi to drought the accuracy and sensitivity of the indices were used to reflect the merits and applicability of spi at different time scales for identifying drought in this study based on the onset final date of drought identification with spi described above if the onset date was ahead of the actual final date of a certain drought sample then spi would be considered to identify the drought accurately the proportion of the samples identified by spi in the total samples was regarded as the accuracy in addition drought was considered to be identified in advance by spi if the spi based drought onset date was ahead of the actual onset date of the summer maize drought thereby suggesting that spi was sensitive to drought identification therefore the ratio of the number of early recognized samples to the number of identified samples was calculated as the sensitivity of spi the date difference between the identified onset date and the actual onset date was calculated and expressed as dif the early and delayed difs were represented by negative and positive values respectively the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at the 11 time scales were compared and the spi at the optimal time scale was recommended as the most suitable indictor for early drought warning for summer maize in hhh 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of drought samples 4 1 1 spatial distribution characteristics the spatial distribution of 54 agrometeorological stations with 192 drought disaster samples for summer maize in hhh as well as the drought frequency of stations are shown in fig 2 the stations with drought records from 2000 to 2020 were mainly located in shandong anhui and henan provinces while fewer were located in jiangsu additionally the drought disasters for summer maize frequently occurred in the central regions of hhh including most of shandong northern anhui and central henan especially at the junction of these three provinces the drought frequency of the stations located in the areas above was mostly more than three and a few of them were even up to 12 out of 21 years in other regions however such as large parts of hebei western and southern henan as well as southern anhui drought occurred less than three times 4 1 2 temporal distribution characteristics the drought frequency for each doy was determined from the drought records for summer maize from 2000 to 2020 at 54 agrometeorological stations in hhh fig 3 drought disasters were mainly concentrated in june doy 152 182 especially in doy 163 174 in which drought frequency was greater than 50 and even reached 76 on doy 170 summer maize in hhh mostly entered the sowing jointing stage at this time which was critical for growth and development of crops galmés et al 2007 water deficit during this period might result in plant dwarfing and eventually production reduction rahman et al 2004 li et al 2018 additionally another period exhibiting more frequent drought occurrence was from mid august to mid september doy 222 252 that corresponds approximately to the period of tasseling to physiological maturity drought frequency on other dates mostly ranged from 10 to 20 4 2 accuracy and sensitivity of drought identification for spi at different time scales based on all drought samples 4 2 1 drought identification accuracy the number of drought samples identified by spi at different time scales for each province in hhh are shown in fig 4 the number of drought samples identified with spi at each time scale for shandong anhui and henan provinces accounted for the relatively higher ratio in the total samples however the numbers of identified drought samples for hebei and jiangsu provinces were less than the numbers observed for the other provinces and the total number of drought samples of those two provinces were only 14 and 10 respectively which was far less than observed for shandong 85 anhui 39 and henan 44 although the spatial distribution of drought samples was heterogeneous the drought identification accuracy in different provinces all presented a similar trend i e the accuracies for spi calculated with 7 10 15 and 20 day time scales were generally higher than the accuracies for other time scales spi and the accuracies calculated from spi7 spi10 spi15 and spi20 were the highest of all of the time scales in all of the provinces the accuracy of drought identification by these four spi indices in hebei and jiangsu even reached 100 although the number of drought samples for these two provinces were fewer note that even though spi5 exhibited excellent accuracy for drought identification in hebei 100 and anhui 87 2 provinces it was not applicable in other regions especially in shandong province where the drought samples accounted for the largest proportion of the total drought samples in general across the entire hhh region the number of drought samples identified by spi initially increased as time scale increased and then decreased the 184 drought samples identified by spi10 were the most compared with other spi time scales being only 8 fewer than the total number of samples similarly spi10 was the index with the highest accuracy for drought identification 95 8 ahead of spi7 and spi15 with an accuracy of 94 8 while spi150 had the lowest accuracy 66 1 slightly lower than spi120 and spi180 67 7 in addition the drought identification accuracy of spi5 77 1 and spi60 77 6 were also far below than that of spi10 according to fig 4 the accuracy of spi10 was the highest among all spi time scales and therefore the number of drought and drought free samples identified by other spi indices were compared with spi10 table 1 among the 184 samples identified by spi10 as drought 180 178 and 174 samples were also recognized as drought by spi7 spi15 and spi20 respectively while the numbers were only 126 by spi150 and 128 by both spi120 and spi180 suggesting that 93 8 of the drought samples could be recognized by both spi10 and spi7 however this proportion was only 65 6 for spi150 and 76 0 for spi5 for the eight samples identified as being drought free by spi10 six of them were recognized by spi7 while four of ten drought free samples determined by spi7 were recognized by spi10 4 2 2 drought identification sensitivity the numbers of samples identified by spi at different time scales in advance of drought disaster being noted in observational records are shown in table 2 the ratio of number of early identified samples to respective identified drought samples was calculated as the drought identification sensitivity of spi as with the number of identified drought samples the greatest number of early identified samples was produced by spi10 the number of early identified samples initially increased with increasing spi time scale up to spi10 and then decreased comparing all of the spi time scales we found that the spi with the three longest time scales spi120 spi150 and spi180 produced the lowest number of early identified drought samples however the sensitivities of these three spi indices for drought identification were all above 71 and were all higher than the sensitivities of the other indices except for spi10 77 72 the drought identification sensitivity of spi30 was the lowest 62 72 and was slightly lower than with spi5 64 19 in addition the sensitivity of spi7 71 43 and spi15 69 78 and were far below that of spi10 even though the number of identified drought samples produced by spi7 and spi15 were only two less than produced by spi10 the difs between the identified drought onset date produced by spi and the actual onset date from agricultural drought records were calculated fig 5 the number of drought samples identified by spi7 spi10 and spi15 within the dif range of 8 0 was greater than those in the ranges of 16 8 and 0 8 in order the order for other spi time scales was 8 0 0 8 and 16 8 except for spi20 and spi30 for which the number of samples decreased in the order of 0 8 8 0 and 16 8 this result can also be seen in the lines of cumulative number of samples in fig 5 the maximum line slope for the cumulative number of samples line for spi7 spi10 and spi15 were within the dif range of 24 0 for other spi time scales however the fastest period for identified samples accumulation ranged from dif greater than 16 to less than or equal to eight days with dif 8 the ratio of the cumulative number of samples to the total number of identified samples for spi7 spi10 and spi15 were 92 3 96 7 and 90 7 while ratios were less than 90 for the other spi indices except for spi30 91 7 as for the samples with dif 40 as the spi time scales increased the samples basically showed an increasing trend the greatest number of samples in the dif 40 category was identified by spi150 and spi180 with the greatest number produced by spi150 box plots were used to reflect the distribution range and median of the dif values produced by spi at different time scales fig 6 the height of the box is the interquartile range and represents the variability of the data obviously the box heights for spi with time scales of 5 7 10 15 20 and 30 days were less than the box heights for spi with longer time scales the box heights of these six spi indices with relatively short time scales increased sequentially in the order of spi5 spi7 spi10 spi15 spi30 and spi20 but spi10 had the lowest median line in addition the number of outliers values beyond the range of 1 5 iqr were much fewer for spi10 with only three outliers than for all of the other spi indices although the median lines for spi60 spi120 spi150 and spi180 were lower than the median line for spi10 the large number of outliers caused a wide and dispersive range of dif distribution the ranges of dif values for spi at time scales of 20 180 days were all greater than 100 days and the dif range was even up to 200 days for spi150 the dif ranges were less than 75 days for spi5 and spi10 however most of the outliers for spi5 were above the upper quartile q3 4 3 analysis and validation of typical drought processes 4 3 1 time series of spi values for drought identification at typical stations the two agrometeorological stations located at laiyang shandong province and ruzhou henan province with drought frequencies of 12 and 6 respectively from 2000 to 2020 were selected as typical stations for further analysis of drought processes the drought processes at laiyang in 2005 and ruzhou in 2006 are presented as examples to screen out which time scale spi is more accuracy and sensitive on drought identification fig 7 according to the records the drought which occurred during the period from 3 to 26 june 2005 doy 155 178 at laiyang and was indicated by the yellow shaded area in fig 7a comparing the results for all the spi time scales the drought event was initially recognized by spi10 on doy 148 which was seven days ahead of the actual drought onset date although spi5 spi7 and spi15 also identified the drought in advance of the observed drought onset date the onset date identified by spi5 spi7 and spi15 were four one and five days later than that determined by spi10 respectively in addition the spi5 and spi7 values fluctuated frequently around the critical drought threshold of 0 5 and spi5 even remained in a drought free state from doy 157 174 during the drought occurrence period possibly because of the small precipitation amounts on doy 161 162 166 167 and 170 similarly spi7 turned into a drought free state only four days later after the drought started additionally the drought onset dates identified by spi at time scales of 20 180 days were 3 12 14 13 12 13 and 10 days later respectively than the actual drought record onset date a heavy rain of 39 mm occurred on doy 178 thereby ending the drought condition this end to the drought was reflected accurately by all of the spi indices as shown in fig 7b the historical disaster record showed that ruzhou experienced a drought event from 11 to 20 june doy 163 172 2006 results were similar to what was observed at laiyang fig 7a even though spi5 values fell below 0 5 on doy 152 it indicated a drought free state soon thereafter with values hovering near the critical drought threshold line the determined drought onset date identified by spi5 was doy 161 two days ahead of the actual recorded drought onset date however spi5 indicated a drought free condition again only four days later and spi7 turned into a drought free state after a small amount of precipitation 2 6 mm on doy 166 spi10 presented better accuracy and sensitivity for the identification of the drought process the drought period that was identified by spi10 was from doy 155 171 with the drought onset date being eight days ahead of the actual drought onset date which was five days earlier than that for spi15 the drought onset dates determined by spi20 and spi30 were two and nine days later respectively than the observed drought onset date in addition drought was never recognized by spi with time scales of 60 180 days 4 3 2 spatial distribution of the drought onset doy and the dif identified by spi for a typical drought process according to the drought disaster observation records 14 agrometeorological stations in shandong province all recorded drought events in 2002 the drought process started from the west and progressed eastward doy 167 272 nearly covering the entire shandong province and was therefore selected as an example to present the spatial distribution of the drought onset doy identified by spi based on kriging interpolation as well as the dif at agrometeorological stations in shandong as the length of spi time scales increased the identified onset date of drought was significantly delayed fig 8 especially in eastern shandong province spi5 spi30 identified the drought situation 60 80 days earlier than spi120 spi180 in addition it seems that spi5 and spi7 was more sensitive to drought identification than spi10 for the green shaded area doy 174 193 where spi5 and spi7 was larger however the drought was identified in advance by spi10 at all 14 stations while only 12 and 13 stations identified the drought with spi5 and spi7 respectively also drought identification at two stations was delayed with spi15 and one station did not recognize the occurrence of drought the number of stations that did not recognize the drought even reached four for spi180 accounting for nearly 30 of the 14 agrometeorological stations in shandong province 4 3 3 validation of drought identification by spi10 by comprehensively measuring the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at different time scales spi10 was considered to be the best identifier of summer maize drought in hhh based on the regional observation records of agrometeorological disasters from 2014 to 2020 a drought process was recorded by 13 counties in central and western henan province from july to august 2014 and was therefore used for validation of drought identification by spi10 fig 9 according to the regional disaster records this drought event in henan province continued throughout july and into august the results showed that the entire region was consistently under a drought free condition as identified by spi10 at the end of june fig 9a however spi10 identified a drought disaster in central henan province on 4 july fig 9b and two stations in this area reported the drought six days later the drought was recognized by spi10 across most of henan province and the area contained all 13 stations on 10 july fig 9c more stations recorded the drought as time went on on 3 august all 13 stations reported the drought disaster and these observations were consistent with the drought region identified by spi10 fig 9g according to the observation records precipitation occurred over most of henan province from 5 to 9 august and the drought was therefore essentially relieved and this was reflected by much reduced drought area identified by the spi10 values fig 9h 5 discussion this study compared the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at different time scales for summer maize drought identification in the huang huai hai region using daily precipitation data and agrometeorological drought disaster observations results showed that spi10 was more applicable for drought recognition than other spi time scales which was consistent with the conclusion of wu et al 2021 that srhi at 10 day scale can objectively identify summer maize drought disasters spi10 produced higher accuracy of drought identification not only over the entire hhh region 95 8 but also in each province fig 4 and most of the drought samples that were unrecognized by the other spi indices could be identified by spi10 table 1 the spi7 spi15 and spi20 also showed a higher accuracy of 94 8 94 8 and 93 2 respectively although lower than that of spi10 the other time scales spi all had accuracy that lower than 90 and therefore could not be applicable for summer maize drought identification wu et al 2019b found that the accuracy of droughts identified by spi10 and spi30 during summer maize at sowing tasseling stage in hhh were 96 4 and 85 5 which was similar to the results in this study however they did not determine that if 10 day time scale of spi has the highest accuracy among all time scales spi we also proved that the values of spi5 fluctuated frequently around the critical drought threshold resulting in lower accuracy of drought identification than observed with spi10 therefore spi5 could not either precisely reflect the drought or drought free state of summer maize furthermore we defined sensitivity and dif to characterize abilities and days for early drought identification by different time scales spi results showed that the sensitivity for drought identification was the highest for spi10 compared with all other spi time scales additionally most of the drought samples could be identified 0 16 days ahead of the actual drought onset date fig 5 while the difs for spi20 and spi30 were mostly 0 8 days later than the observed drought records however li et al 2020 reported that the time lag from meteorological drought to vegetation drought was about two to three months and according to zhang et al 2017b it even took six months for winter wheat to respond to meteorological drought the different crop types and the different study regions might be the reason for the difference in results regarding the length of the time lag ji and peters 2003 duan and mei 2014 zhang et al 2021 additionally the longer spi time scales especially spi120 spi150 and spi180 were greatly affected by the long term precipitation deficit surplus during the previous period and thus could not accurately reflect the drought or drought free state for summer maize due to maize s relatively short life cycle previous research has demonstrated that longer spi time scale values were more applicable for identification of seasonal or annual droughts he et al 2015 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 fu et al 2022 without excessive precipitation values of spi120 spi150 and spi180 that were below the critical drought threshold could not return to a drought free state in a timely manner and might indicate ongoing drought for several months even though there was no observed drought for summer maize during this period this situation resulted in many drought samples being recognized more than 40 days ahead of observed drought by spi120 spi150 and spi180 this result was seriously inconsistent with the real situation a small amount of rain might be adequate to relieve summer maize drought stress similarly spi120 spi150 and spi180 values above 0 5 were insensitive to short term water deficit and therefore drought identification might be delayed or even unrecognized by these indices fig 7 it was because the longer the time scale the lower the weight of daily precipitation okpara et al 2017 xie et al 2019 the time series graphs of long time scales spi would not change rapidly when the same daily precipitation moved out of the time scales windows thus the response of spi120 spi150 and spi180 to precipitation is too insensitive which was in agreement with the findings of zhang and yamaguchi 2014 and xie et al 2019 in contrast spi10 presented the best sensitivity to a variety of precipitation events and amounts additionally spi10 was validated as having the ability to predict summer maize drought processes through an analysis of drought events in shandong and henan provinces fig 8 and fig 9 respectively however other spi time scales presented different degrees of delayed identification of droughts and some stations did not recognize the occurrence of drought at all with these indices consequently we conclude that spi10 can be used to identify the signal of drought and has earlier drought detection ability than other time scales spi nevertheless some limitations still exist in our study hhh was selected as the study area because it is the largest major summer maize producing area in china however hhh is very large especially in the north south direction and therefore experiences huge differences in thermal resources crop cultivars cultivation management practices and so on zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the actual developmental periods of summer maize in different years and areas can vary widely rezaei et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 wu et al 2019a especially due to differences in planting date the accumulated impacts of precipitation deficits in early june might not affect late planted summer maize in some regions in our study the same critical threshold of 0 5 was used to recognize drought by different spi time scales even though the sensitivity to drought is different during different phenophases of summer maize wu et al 2019b 2021 these differences might cause a substantial impact on drought identification by spi the best approach for monitoring and assessing summer maize drought may need to consider more detailed records of the actual phenological phases for further analysis even so this study focused on the identification accuracy and sensitivity of meteorological drought before agricultural drought occurs therefore it is a feasible method to use the meteorological drought threshold of 0 5 to judge the accuracy of spi in the early identification of agricultural drought at different time scales okpara et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a another limitation of the study is that the drought disaster records obtained from agrometeorological stations might not be accurate enough wu et al 2018 errors might occur due to the subjectivity of different recorders as well as lack of a standard to judge whether crops have suffered from drought conditions thereby leading to inconsistent records of actual crop situation fortunately the observations of agrometeorological disasters from 2000 to 2020 we collected completely recorded the onset final date of droughts allowing us to objectively measure ability of spi at different time scales for early identifying summer maize droughts with the continuous updating and improving of drought disaster datasets for summer maize it will be necessary to further validate the accuracy and sensitivity of spi for drought identification additionally this study was only conducted on summer maize in hhh further verification and research are needed to determine whether the conclusion is applicable to summer maize drought identification in other regions the objective of this study was to determine the optimal time scales for spi to early identify meteorological drought for summer maize other meteorological drought indices were not discussed in the study it is therefore necessary to compare other meteorological drought indices to determine applicability of 10 day time scale for early drought identification xie et al 2019 wu et al 2021 previous research had showed that 10 day scale srhi standardized relative humidity index could identify the occurrence of drought relatively earlier than actual drought records for summer maize wu et al 2021 that is we got the similar conclusion with different indicators furthermore the spi indices were studied only for early identification by distinguishing the drought and drought free states of summer maize in this study it will be important to collect more detailed drought disaster records in order to further investigate the accuracy and sensitivity of spi at multiple drought levels okpara et al 2017 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 additionally agricultural meteorological drought indices can be of great significance when combined with spi10 to analyze the drought evolution process including latency onset development and recovery of drought disaster for summer maize ji and peters 2003 duan and mei 2014 zhang et al 2017b the results of this study contribute to exploring and clarifying the mechanisms of development and progression of summer maize drought disaster and provide a scientific basis for drought monitoring early warning of drought and development of drought prevention technology 6 conclusions this study constructed a set of drought samples using agricultural disaster observation records from 2000 to 2020 in hhh the spi10 index was determined to be the most optimal indicator for identifying drought disasters in comparison with other spi time scales 5 7 15 20 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 days which achieved the highest accuracy for summer maize drought identification in hhh 95 8 ahead of spi7 and spi15 with an accuracy of 94 8 in addition the sensitivity of spi10 was also the highest among the 11 spi time scales 77 7 the results suggested that most of the drought samples could be identified 0 16 days ahead of the actual observed summer maize drought onset date by spi10 the application of spi10 to characterize the drought process in different regions of hhh successfully demonstrated the robustness and utility of the index the findings from this study can provide theoretical guidance for early warning of summer maize drought furthermore more research should be conducted to distinguish multiple drought levels for summer maize in the future credit authorship

7734,study region the naryn river basin kyrgyzstan study focus we investigate the impacts of climate change in the basin based on two families of general circulation models gcms using the hydrological model swat the forcing datasets are the widely used isimip2 i2 and the newly derived isimip3 i3 data which refer to the 5th and 6th stage of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip due to notable differences in the forcing we evaluate their impacts on various hydrological components of the basin such as discharge evapotranspiration eta and soil moisture sm besides a partial correlation pc analysis is used to assess the meteorological controls of the basin with special emphasize on the sm eta coupling new hydrological insights for the region agreement in the basin s projections is found such as discharge shifts towards an earlier peak flow of one month significant sm reductions and eta increases i3 temperature projections exceed their previous estimates and show an increase in precipitation which differs from i2 however the mitigating effects do not lead to an improvement in the region s susceptibility to soil moisture deficits the pc study reveals enhanced water limited

resources and is prone to water related conflicts bernauer and siegfried 2012 berndtsson and tussupova 2020 peña ramos et al 2021 water availability originates mostly from the high mountainous part and relies to a significant part on nivo glacial processes that supply water to the arid lowlands where it is used for agricultural production or to satisfy the energy demand didovets et al 2021 chen et al 2016 hagg et al 2007 central asian s water towers are vulnerable to climate change due to glacier recession and seasonal snow cover reductions which will lead to substantial impacts on the freshwater availability of the local population barandun et al 2020 2021 huss and hock 2018 saks et al 2022 further climatic changes are already expected to exacerbate droughts with partly adverse effects and risks on vegetation and ecosystems jiang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 xing et al 2022 ca is particularly vulnerable to land degradation especially with its special form of desertification which is already present and might be more pronounced in the future due to further climatic changes huang et al 2020a zhang et al 2018 li et al 2015 reasons can be a multitude of climatic effects such as precipitation decrease reducing moisture availability or temperature increases enhancing evapotranspiration as well as anthropogenic causes jiang et al 2022 peng et al 2021 however the relationships between these factors and the vegetation response are complex and challenging jie xu et al 2016 gessner et al 2013 non climatic factors such as mismanagement of water resources as it was the case for the prominent example of the aral sea basin xenarios et al 2018 hamidov et al 2016 and the general drivers of water stress in transboundary river basins such as allocation upstream water use or damming exacerbate water related issues hill et al 2017 wilson et al 2017 döll et al 2009 reported observed temperature rises range from 0 2 0 3 c per decade 1956 2007 in the tian shan kutuzov and shahgedanova 2009 up to 0 36 0 42 c 1979 2011 per decade considering whole central asia hu et al 2014 there is also evidence that the warming trends were intensified since the 1970s while for precipitation observed changes are more heterogeneous without consistent patterns unger shayesteh et al 2013 climate projections in the context of the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 project significant temperature increases until 2099 e g immerzeel et al 2013 reports a temperature rise of around 2 c until 2050 under the rcp4 5 relative concentration pathway for the amu darya and syr darya which is consistent with the calculated increase of 1 2 2 c in high asia by lutz et al 2014 ozturk et al 2017 estimates a temperature increase of up to 7 c under the high emission scenario rcp8 5 until 2099 which is in line with the projected changes in summer of 6 5 c in reyer et al 2015 precipitation trends are mostly minor and show a strong spatial diversity besides precipitation changes are less significant and more uncertain for most projections lutz et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2013 luo et al 2018 only ozturk et al 2017 reports a more consistent precipitation decrease in their study more recent studies which are based on the newer shared socioeconomic pathways ssp and newer general circulation models gcm from cmip6 show strong similarities in projected temperatures with slightly higher projections compared to cmip5 under ssp8 5 lalande et al 2021 calculated an upper bound of 9 c for the adjacent located high mountain asia hma a different picture is found for precipitation changes over ca where several studies report a clear increase in precipitation amounts with ranges from 10 5 14 4 under ssp2 6 and ssp8 5 until the end of the century jiang et al 2020 or similar findings guo et al 2021 however cmip6 based impact studies that investigate what these differences in the new estimates could mean are still rare but will likely increase in the near future the assessment of climate change impacts on different components e g of the hydrological cycle is an essential element for the development of societal adaption and mitigation strategies but also to raise the general awareness of potential changes however climate impact studies are subject to a complex modeling chain considering multiple scenarios multiple gcms multi model downscaling and bias adjustment methods and lastly an impact model such as an hydrological model huang et al 2020b olsson et al 2016 as a consequence impact studies are prone to large uncertainties initiated by these different sources wen et al 2020 bosshard et al 2013 nevertheless the quantification and communication of uncertainties play an important role in impact modeling mishra et al 2020 vetter et al 2015 where one aim should be the minimization of uncertainty referred to the impact model to improve the reliability of the projected changes vetter et al 2016 krysanova et al 2018 thus krysanova et al 2020 showed in their special issue how a robust impact model can reduce the magnitude of projected uncertainties and provided guidelines for a comprehensive model evaluation in addition to the standard calibration and validation procedure due to the importance of ca s water towers and its dependence on agriculture the evaluation of its climate and hydrology is essential for adaption and mitigation climate impact assessment on the hydrological cycle in ca has been conducted in several studies as it was done for eight ca catchments by didovets et al 2021 with varying results depending on the catchment characteristics and flow regime gan et al 2015 reports a shift towards earlier peak discharge and runoff as well as precipitation declines in the naryn catchment slight reductions in runoff combined with similar significant seasonal shifts are found by hagg et al 2013 for the upper amu darya more substantial negative changes in runoff are estimated for the chu river basin by changkun et al 2015 however climate impact studies on the hydrological cycle based on cmip6 are almost not available in the region thus our aim is to provide an assessment of climate change impacts on different hydrological components within the naryn basin considering a subset of the recent cmip6 gcms and scenarios secondly we do not solely focus on the climate projections based on cmip6 but reveal how the impacts on the hydrological cycle changed from cmip5 to cmip6 which is particularly relevant in the context of adaptation and mitigation strategies our gcm subsets are derived from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip versions 2b and 3b and will be designated as i2 and i3 in the following see 2 1 special emphasize is put on the differences in the projected coupling of soil moisture and evapotranspiration initiated through disparate precipitation and temperature projections between the two generations hence we perform a correlation analysis where a partial correlation pc system is used to assess the meteorological effects on and changes within the soil moisture evapotranspiration feedback 2 materials and methods 2 1 datasets used in this study we used the daily meteorological data of four gcms and two scenarios from cmip5 for the analysis of future changes and the corresponding successor models and scenarios from cmip6 to drive our hydrological model and to evaluate how projected impacts differ between both cmip generations in total then 8 gcms were utilized 4 of each generation of climate models in detail we used the gcm data from gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 under cmip5 and the corresponding successor gcms gfdl esm4 ukesm1 0 ll successor of hadgem2 es ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 under cmip6 respectively the selected scenarios refer to a low and high emission scenario of both phases namely rcp2 6 rcp8 5 and ssp1 2 6 as well as ssp5 8 5 respectively in the following we denote them simply as rcp26 rcp85 ssp26 ssp85 the data was obtained from the isimip project where the gcm data was separately downscaled and bias adjusted for each cmip phase isimip is analogously to cmip structured in various phases where isimip2b frieler et al 2017 lange 2018 corresponds to cmip5 while isimip3b lange 2019 utilizes cmip6 results the isimip2b procedure preserves trends in long term mean values using adjustment factors or offsets for those statistics and transfer functions for the adjustment of day to day variability around the monthly mean value in contrast the isimip3b procedure adjusts biases using quantile mapping and preserves trends in all quantiles of the distribution of a climate variable statistical downscaling is done via spatial interpolation in isimip2b and with multivariate quantile mapping in isimip3b furthermore the bias adjustment was performed for different reference datasets namely ewembi under isimip2b cmip5 gcms lange 2018 and w5e5 under isimip3b cmip6 gcms cucchi et al 2020 lange et al 2021 providing the base for the calibration and validation of our hydrological model both reference datasets were designed for the bias adjustment of climate impact studies both datasets merge various data sources ewembi hereby is based on earth2observe forcing era interim nasa gewex surface radiation budget data and wfdei data the predecessor w5e5 combines the methodology of version 1 0 watch forcing data era5 reanalysis data and precipitation data from version 2 3 of the global precipitation climatology project the two reference datasets are the base for the bias adjustment of the corresponding isimip phase see table 1 to evaluate simulated actual evapotranspiration eta and soil moisture sm of swat we considered the widely used data from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 and global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 respectively the digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 90 m was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm nasa jpl 2013 land use data was obtained from the european space agency s climate change initiative land cover esa cci lc project esa 2017 with a resolution of 300 m and soil data was received from the food and agricultural organization s fao 1 km harmonized world soil map hwsm fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 as the used isimip data represents only a subset of available gcms of each cmip generation it has to be noted that our approach rather compares a sample of each cmip generation based on the isimip data than providing a complete picture which was beyond the scope of that study 2 2 study area naryn basin the naryn basin is located in kyrgyzstan and is along with the kara darya one of the two headwater catchments of the syr darya river in the aral sea basin the naryn is formed by the two headwater rivers big and small naryn which originate in the tian shan mountains it flows westwards through kyrgyzstan until it crosses the border to uzbekistan where it joins the kara darya in the fergana valley the basin is characterized by a nivo glacial flow regime where the flood period begins in april and ends in september the catchment size is around 58 000 km 2 however our study only considers the share of the catchment 46 000 km 2 until the toktogul reservoir a multi purpose reservoir used for hydroelectricity generation and irrigation around 2 2 of the catchment is glacierized where the majority of the glaciers lie in the eastern area the region has a dry continental and semi arid climate with annual precipitation sums between 280 mm 450 mm aizen et al 1995 depending on the location and elevation within the basin the annual maximum precipitation occurs in spring or summer temperatures are diverse throughout the basin and the mean summer temperatures can reach 25 c and during the winter months the mean temperatures can fall down to 20 c an overview of the study area can be found in fig 1 2 3 hydrological model swat the soil water assessment tool swat is a process based semi distributed and continuous model which was developed by the blackland research extension center of the united states department for agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 swat was initially developed to evaluate the impact of land management practices in large watersheds but is nowadays used for a multitude of applications all over the world swat is widely used for sediment studies water resources management climate impact assessment or agricultural investigations arnold and fohrer 2005 spatially the catchment is subdivided into subbasins on the basis of which a further spatial discretization into hydrological response units hrus takes place the latter one serves as the smallest spatial unit within the model and represents a unique combination of land use soil and slope on the subbasin level computations are divided into a land and a water phases where the calculations of the land phase are carried out on the hru level the land phase hereby covers the processes which are responsible for the movement of water nutrients or sediment to the stream of a subbasin swat first sums up the area dependent hru loadings and fluxes of each subbasin before they are transferred to the corresponding stream the water or routing phase refers to instream processes such as the transport of water sediment or nutrients through the channel network 2 4 calibration validation and evaluation test this section describes the calibration and evaluation procedure of the hydrological model based on the reference datasets of both projection families the approach follows the suggestions of krysanova et al 2018 2020 and some modifications provided in gelfan et al 2020 the whole methodology is represented in fig 2 for each of the two reference datasets of the isimip phases a swat model was set up individually in detail we performed the following steps 1 multi site calibration of seven gauges considering multiple goodness of fit criteria gof fig 2a 2 model robustness check under contrasting climate periods fig 2b 3 cross evaluation of model robustness using evapotranspiration and soil moisture estimates fig 2b first the procedure was applied for the swat model forced with the ewembi reference dataset representing i2 before we transferred the obtained parameter set to the w5e5 representing i3 driven impact model and the same steps were performed again only if all steps for both hydrological models forced with the two reference datasets of i2 and i3 could be carried out satisfactorily the impact assessment is conducted due to inconsistencies in data availability and quality daily discharge data was only available for four gauges and monthly data was obtained for the three remaining gauges based on the available data the calibration period was set to 1974 1981 and the validation period from 1982 1987 for the ewembi driven model a limitation arose through different temporal coverages of ewembi and w5e5 originally both datasets are available from 1979 onward however for ewembi the extended gswp3 ewembi hereafter ewembi product enabled a prolonged temporal coverage a similar extension was not accessible for the w5e5 dataset at the time the calibration was done therefore the calibration period was set to the validation period of the model driven with ewembi due to these limitations a separate and suitable validation phase could not be used as a preliminary study the two forcing datasets were compared and evaluated to quantify differences in the basin step 1 of the procedure considered multiple rules we calibrated from upstream to downstream and for each gauge multiple initial simulations were performed to close the water balance the number varied throughout the subcatchments based on how fast the water balance could be closed multiple gof criteria were selected during the calibration procedure the water balance closure was assessed based on the percent bias pbias where we adapted and fixed the lapse rates for temperature and precipitation secondly different parameter groups were calibrated e g snow parameters groundwater parameters etc and evaluated using the nash sutcliff efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge in combination with a seasonal rmse to account for a trade off between daily monthly and seasonal results an overview of the selected parameters and their categories is presented in a 1 when satisfactory results in the calibration and validation phase were achieved a robustness check for contrasting climatic conditions was performed step 2 the model performance is evaluated against wet and dry years as well as for warm and cold years by forming a sequential time series of non continuous years each sequence then represents the respective climate thus the mean annual precipitation and temperature for the calibration and validation period were calculated each year was then individually divided by the mean value and either classified as cold if the mean temperature of a year t i where i is the individual year is smaller than the mean annual temperature of the whole time series t m e a n or warm if t i t m e a n and wet if the annual precipitation of a year p i the mean annual precipitation of the time series p m e a n or dry if p i p m e a n the four resulting discharge time series per swat model were then evaluated with the gof criteria introduced under step 1 lastly step 3 a cross evaluation using eta data from gleam as well as sm from gldas is performed to ensure an adequate internal model consistency and to represent various components of the hydrological system krysanova et al 2020 the analysis was done on the basin and subbasin scale for monthly and annual estimates the performance of eta is illustrated by means of the nse rmse and the pearson correlation r however sm could not been validated in absolute values due to a mismatch in the soil layer definitions within the swat model and gldas which provides sm values for different layers e g 0 10 cm or 10 40 cm thus we rather assessed seasonal and inter annual sm anomalies again by a r coefficient and a normalized version of the rmse nrmse computed by a normalization with the interquartile range difference between 75th percentile and 25th percentile similar difficulties with sm evaluations are presented for example in poméon et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 and dembélé et al 2020 to allow for an appropriate comparison of the impacts based on the i2 and i3 driven models we aimed for a consistent parameterization of both models thus steps 1 3 were first performed for the swat model driven with ewembi and then when satisfactory results were achieved the same parameterization was used for the model forced with w5e5 then all three steps were carried out again a final parameterization was stated as acceptable when similar results are obtained for both models however due to minor differences in the forcing datasets ewembi and w5e5 in their mean annual precipitation and temperature minor adaptions in the parameterization were necessary to match the water balance the adaptions were thus limited to the lapse rates and in seldom cases to the snow pack temperature lag factor 2 5 projected changes of isimip2b and isimip3b this section illustrates the comparison between both generations of projections first we show how the temperature and precipitation projections as well as their estimates in the historical phase differ the comparison is done on the basin scale for multiple temporal representations seasonal annual the future projections are derived from the four general circulation models of each projection phase i2 and i3 respectively and scenario in order to ensure an adequate comparability we selected gcms that are both available in i2 as well as in the new phase i3 represented by a corresponding successor model see 2 1 accordingly we focused on cmip5 s rcp scenarios that were translated and continued by a corresponding ssp scenario that characterizes a similar aggregated forcing however there are several differences between the rcp scenarios and their successors which are explained and demonstrated in detail in meinshausen et al 2020 or tebaldi et al 2021 this assumption leads to the consideration of the low emission rcp2 6 and ssp2 6 and high emission rcp8 5 and ssp8 5 scenarios as swat requires t m a x as input we use the respective quantity as proxy for mean daily temperature changes precipitation changes δ p refer to relative anomalies of the mean annual sum 2 5 1 differences in meteorological forcing first of all we present the differences in the meteorological variables of all gcms between i2 and i3 therefore we calculate anomalies of two future 30 year periods near 2020 2049 and far future 2070 2099 to the historical baseline period 1971 2000 differences are illustrated individually for precipitation and temperature as multi model mean mmm of the gcms of each isimip phase uncertainties are represented as gcm range the radiative forcings of the selected scenarios of i2 and i3 are equal e g ssp85 similar to rcp85 deviations arise mainly from different climate sensitivities present in the gcms of the different cmip or isimip phases 2 5 2 changes in hydrological components as a next step future hydrological changes in the basin are evaluated as a result of the various trajectories therefore discharge eta and sm anomalies are assessed for the i2 and i3 forced hydrological models and compared afterwards the model spread provides a representation of the uncertainty and the ensemble mean represents the average future change per scenario and generation of projection analogously to the meteorological changes hydrological changes are presented on a basin scale as seasonal and annual anomalies 2 6 meteorological controls of the soil moisture and evapotranspiration feedback special emphasize is put on the relevance of meteorological drivers on variations in sm and eta as well as the future development of the eta sm feedback under both generation of climate models it was aimed to evaluate to what extent meteorological differences under i2 and i3 affect the coupling of sm and eta the interaction is implicitly considered in the model non linear decrease when sm is below field capacity to identify the major controls and their effects on the sm eta feedback a partial correlation system was developed which gives further insights on the direction and strength of the sm eta mechanism the evaluation focused on the mmm results of the gcms e g the mmm for each variable of a specific scenario and time period within the corresponding isimip phase to draw conclusions with regard to the mean signal for the analysis monthly anomalies of the meteorological and hydrological variables were generated since eta and sm variations are larger during the vegetative season which partly coincides with the rainy season see fig a2 the analysis was based on the period from april to september the vegetation season is thus assumed to be stationary until 2099 and potential phenological shifts are not considered for the analysis the vegetative season was split in two periods april june amj which roughly coincides with the rainy season in the basin and july to september jas which is generally drier on the basin scale it has to be noted that irrigation which is the largest water consumer of kyrgyzstan was not explicitly considered in the simulations the pcs allow to directly control for the effects of one or more independent variables to identify confounding effects variable that explain part of the relationship which is present in the standard regression between a dependent and independent variable we thus considered the combined effects of temperature precipitation sm and eta to infer potential future shifts in the sm eta interaction and their dominant controls in our case combined effects refer to the consideration of two control variables e g in the pc calculation between temperature and sm the effects of the remaining variables eta and precipitation are taken into account accordingly the pc calculation is supported by the standard pearson correlation values to highlight the confounding effect a significant shift in the correlation values pearson and pc value indicates that the relationship cannot be explained by one driver alone but is partly based on the second variable eta variations are assessed by the explanatory strength of temperature and sm while sm was evaluated using temperature since sm generally controls eta in water limited regimes and not vice versa we present the sm eta coupling in the pc system of eta rather than sm berg and sheffield 2019 mathematically the pc system can be formulated as follows 1 r y x 1 x 2 r y x 1 r y x 2 r x 1 x 2 1 r y x 2 2 1 r x 1 x 2 2 where r y x 1 x 2 refers to the partial correlation coefficient between the dependent variable y sm or eta and the independent variable x 1 while controlling for the effects of the independent variable x 2 the remaining r represent the pearson correlation coefficients between the corresponding pairs of variables the control variables can be precipitation temperature sm or eta e g if we want to evaluate potential effects of precipitation the control variable x 2 would refer to precipitation and x 1 to temperature hence r x 1 x 2 would refer to the pearson correlation of precipitation and temperature 3 results hereafter we present the results of the calibration procedure the comparison of projected meteorological and hydrological changes under the new and old climate model generations the relevance of the meteorological controls and the findings of the uncertainty decomposition 3 1 calibration validation and evaluation test the following sections correspond to part a and b illustrated in fig 2 statistical results w r t different gof criteria for all seven gauges are presented in table 2 note due to unsatisfactory data availability there is no validation phase for w5e5 see 2 1 apart from the big naryn basin a significant deterioration between the monthly and daily calibration results as well as between ewembi and w5e5 could not be detected best results were achieved at the basin outlet on average the nse values are around 0 75 for the calibration and validation period kge 0 82 pbias 9 4 in the two models worst results are found at the two headwater streams big and small naryn the poorer results here are likely to be caused by the higher relevance of glacier processes which were not represented by the model a comprehensive discussion on that can be found in the discussion section at the end of this work besides a notable difference in water volumes expressed as pbias was found at gauge kekirim which is caused by a systematic overestimation of late summer and autumn flow july october fig 3 shows the daily monthly calibration and validation results for four selected gauges combined with their seasonal hydrographs we selected one gauges which was calibrated monthly and three daily calibrated gauges to emphasize the comparable performance for the daily calibrated gauges the selection comprised two well performing gauges followed by the big naryn where poorer results were achieved in general both daily monthly and seasonal hydrographs of both models show a good agreement with the observed flow with the exception of the big naryn in general the model based on ewembi data as well the one driven with w5e5 are able to reproduce the seasonal behavior within the respective subcatchments however in case of the poorer performing headwater catchment it becomes apparent that the deterioration is likely caused by a mismatch during summer where a systematic underestimation occurs the mean seasonal plots include observed flow for two different periods each representing the maximum available data of ewembi 1974 1987 and w5e5 1982 1987 respectively the robustness check in which the model performance was individually assessed in wet dry and warm cold periods see section 2 4 led to comparable results as achieved in the original calibration and validation procedure the results of the evaluation for all gauges can be found in table 3 overall wet periods are better reproduced by both models for both gof criteria than dry years nsewet 0 8 nsedry 0 7 pbiaswet 9 pbiasdry 11 8 also for warm and cold phases model performances are similar nsewarm 0 75 nsecold 0 71 and pbiaswarm 9 1 pbiascold 10 46 the numbers are average values of both models and all gauges similar to the original calibration the same gauges exhibit the worst performance comparing the robustness of the ewembi and w5e5 driven models no significant differences are observed the model forced by ewembi data performs better in warm periods slightly better in dry periods similar in wet periods and slightly worse in cold years compared to its w5e5 counterpart it can be concluded that the methodology is generally able to produce comparable results for both models in overall the models performed reasonable for most of the gauges in all climate phases as well as for the standard calibration and validation procedure and thus successfully pass the first two steps of the evaluation test gauges that produced unsatisfactory results are in line for both models indicating the similarity in the parameterization and the meteorological forcing of both reference datasets poor results relate mainly to the big naryn and gauge kekerim where the poor performance mainly arises from water balance issues indicated by pbias a notable deterioration of the results is found in the small naryn basin when moving from ewembi to w5e5 in contrast an improvement is even obtained at gauge kekerim 3 1 1 cross validation of actual evapotranspiration to improve the models reliability they were cross validated with respect to the gleam eta product in order to increase the credibility of the projected changes the cross validation is performed to assure consistency of the hydrological processes within the catchment and to further improve model robustness due to the data availability it was performed from 1982 to 1987 the simulated eta of both models show a high agreement with the eta estimates of gleam at the catchment scale a nse of 0 97 is achieved based on the monthly evaporation estimates for the ewembi forced model rmse 4 1 mm pbias 3 2 the performance of the w5e5 driven model is similar with a nse of 0 96 rmse 4 6 mm pbias 3 3 basin values for r are almost 1 on the subbasin scale the median nse and r value are 0 8 and 0 9 respectively for both models without any significant difference between them nrmse values are close to 0 for both models with both medians around 0 20 however the small number of subbasins performing poor arises from both a systematic over and underestimation of swat in the summer period without any clear pattern due to the high agreement between the eta estimates of both models and an overall very good performance results are considered satisfactory fig 4 summarizes the monthly results on the basin and subbasin scale where the latter is represented as boxplot for the individual performance metrics 3 1 2 cross validation of soil moisture similar to eta the sm estimates of the two swat models were evaluated using gldas data the performance was assessed for soil moisture anomalies we also used a nrmse due to different soil layer assumptions see section 2 4 analogously the evaluation period was from 1982 to 1987 it was found that the resulting sm estimates of both models based on the reference datasets ewembi and w5e5 reveal a satisfactory agreement on the basin scale besides the general seasonal behavior in the models is reproduced in a satisfactory way with respect to the gldas sm particularly at the basin scale on the basin scale the nrmse is 0 44 for the ewembi and w5e5 driven model respectively in addition a r value of 0 81 is obtained for both models the basin nse is 0 65 for the model forced with ewembi and 0 64 for the one based on w5e5 on the subbasin scale the median considering the performance of all individual subbasins nrmse is 2 20 r 0 62 for the ewembi driven model and 2 24 r 0 62 for the w5e5 counterpart see fig 4 however on the subbasin scale a deterioration in all evaluation metrics can be observed which is mainly due to the very poor performance of some subbasins while the deficiencies are counterbalanced on the basin scale some subbasins proved to produce much stronger seasonal cycle which were not found in the gldas estimates the effect is reflected in the weaker nse results on the subbasin scale the results of both variables eta and sm used in the cross validation were moderate to very good in the catchment for both models in summary both models performed equally during all steps of the evaluation procedure a significant deterioration from ewembi to w5e5 was not found and most of the discrepancies in the water balance were present at parts of the headwater subbasins both models were able to capture the contrasting climate periods with slight reductions in the quality in dry or cold phases no notable differences were determined in the cross validation of the water balance components sm and eta all steps were successfully performed and passed 3 2 projected hydrometeorological changes of isimip2b and isimip3b results are separately presented for the meteorological forcings the hydrological projections the importance of the meteorological controls as well as the sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 differences in meteorological forcing in the following we highlight the main differences of the two gcm generations with respect to the projected temperature and precipitation changes changes are represented as anomalies to the baseline for two future periods see section 2 5 1 under both scenarios temperature changes are evaluated as mean annual daily maximum temperature anomalies from now on δ t m a x rather than mean temperatures mean daily temperature changes are represented as proxy derived from t m a x precipitation changes δ p refer to relative anomalies of the mean annual sum fig 5 provides an overview of the meteorological projections of all scenarios isimip phases gcms and future periods the newer generation of gcms produce generally higher temperatures as their former counterparts comparison of equal blue and green symbols in contrast to the high emission scenario the temperature rise of an individual gcm between near and far future is weaker under the low emission scenario same symbol but different outline intensity under the low emission scenario the gcms range from 1 5 c to 4 c temperature increase until 2099 under i3 compared to 0 46 c to 2 4 c under the old generation most gcms scatter around 2 c without any significant difference between the two periods under rcp ssp26 in contrast under the high emission scenario the temperature rise ranges from 3 8 c to 7 1 c for rcp85 and 4 5 c to 8 8 c for ssp85 this underlines the higher climate sensitivity of the new generation of climate models in the study region comparing the warming rates in the far future on the gcm development level for the radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 differences range from 0 77 c predecessor gcm computes higher temperatures to 3 2 c successor gcm produces higher temperature in average the warming of the new climate models is around 0 82 c higher in the far future period under the high emission scenario mmm of 5 86 c compared to mmm of 6 68 c the mmm of the low emission scenario for i2 is 1 82 c and 2 65 c for i3 in the far future period those results are in line with a generally higher climate sensitivity of cmip6 gcms compared to cmip5 gcms meehl et al 2020 precipitation anomalies show a higher disagreement between both climate generations especially the old generation of gcm is characterized by diverging and contrasting precipitation patterns in comparison under i3 the gcms consistently exhibit positive precipitation anomalies albeit with strong deviations in their magnitudes under ssp85 in the far future period the projections range from 3 5 up to 38 2 compared to 18 9 to 22 under rcp85 in general the differences in magnitude between the near and far future for each gcm are less pronounced under rcp26 ssp26 and more distinctive for rcp85 ssp85 respectively the projected change represented by the mmm is small under both rcp scenarios with values of 3 1 and 5 in the far future for rcp85 and rcp26 respectively for the respective scenarios of i3 we observe an increase in precipitation of 9 7 ssp26 and 16 3 ssp85 in summary the positive precipitation anomalies reflected by the various mmms are enhanced under i3 besides the inter model range of i2 reveals a stronger spread uncertainty of precipitation anomalies for all future periods the projected δ t m a x anomalies present comparable inter model ranges in all scenarios under i2 and i3 fig 6 the discrepancy in the projected precipitation anomalies of the two generations arises mainly from specific regional contrasts which are further addressed in the discussion section moreover deviations are found in the seasonal projections of precipitation while both gcm families show an increase from october to may june they differ in late summer and early autumn the mmm of the i3 ensemble does not significantly differ from the historical period in this period however in i2 the mmm shows strong declines of up to 30 with respect to the seasonal patterns all effects are more distinctive in the respective high emission scenario and the far future period see a1 a2 3 2 2 hydrological impacts the hydrological models were forced with the meteorological inputs of the different gcms and scenarios until 2099 however due to differences in the time of departure from the historical to the projection period between the two gcm generations 2006 and 2015 different time series lengths were available for the trajectories the impact models for i2 and i3 are based on the individual parameter sets from the respective reference datasets ewembi or w5e5 here we present the results of the climate impact study on various hydrological components on the basin scale discharge results are thus presented for gauge uchterek discharge a summary of the results is provided in fig 7 in the far future period the mmm of the annual mean flow is projected to change by 3 6 under ssp85 6 3 ssp26 and 0 7 under rcp85 5 rcp26 however we observe significant seasonal shifts towards an earlier onset of the high flow period under the high emission scenario peak flow is shifted by one month from june to may with a high agreement between the mmm of both the i2 and i3 driven models for the far future period while spring flow is projected to increase drastically under rcp26 31 6 and rcp85 82 5 summer flow trajectories show significant decreases under the old generation of gcms 3 7 for rcp26 and 28 5 for rcp85 the i3 forced models exhibit similar patterns spring flow is projected to increase by 26 2 and 80 2 respectively for ssp26 and ssp85 compared to a reduction of 2 ssp26 and 24 4 ssp85 in summer the contrasting seasonal shifts in spring and summer have compensating effects with respect to annual mean flow changes despite an overall strong agreement in the seasonal mmm both isimip phases reveal differences regarding their uncertainties see uncertainty bands in fig 7 the agreement is detected in both scenarios in the far future period the uncertainties become larger with time and are more pronounced for the high emission scenarios besides the lower boundary of the inter model range is smaller under i2 in the high emission scenario far future throughout the year evapotranspiration stronger deviations between i2 and i3 are found in the eta projections higher mean annual eta anomalies are observed for i3 in both scenarios and both periods expressed as mmm we find a discrepancy of around 6 in the ensemble mean within the low emission scenario fig 8 in the two periods under the high emission scenario the discrepancy between the i2 and i3 driven models increases with time this leads to differences of 14 at the end of the century in the mmm 9 32 i2 and 23 97 i3 it becomes apparent that the reason is mainly due to negative summer anomalies under rcp85 while the newer estimates are positive 9 in mmm of i2 and 5 i3 for the far future period the effect is further amplified due to higher eta estimates under ssp85 from march to june the discrepancy of summer eta indicates differences in the available sm within this period see also fig 9 lower right panel the impact is likely to be induced by the deviations found in summer precipitation of i2 and i3 fig a2 for example in the far future period the relative eta changes from june to september under rcp85 are 9 8 compared to a reduction of 27 5 in precipitation model median in the same period under ssp85 precipitation increases by 1 8 supported by an eta raise of 4 8 which is almost in balance similar patterns also occur under the low emission scenario although not as distinct the results are illustrated in fig 8 soil moisture fig 9 illustrates the projected sm changes in the naryn basin both i2 and i3 projections agree in their overall tendency of a significant decline in sm under all scenarios and periods however discrepancies are found in the uncertainties and magnitudes of the detected patterns the projections of the older gcm family constitute larger uncertainties with less negative seasonal anomalies in the far future period in the low emission scenario in contrast the negative seasonal anomalies in the high emission scenario are more pronounced than for i3 in particular summer and early autumn are characterized by a significant decline in the mmm in all periods and scenarios under both climate model phases for ssp85 available summer sm is projected to decrease around 33 far future which is in line with a decrease of 36 for rcp85 in the low emission scenario again far future summer sm projections reveal a decrease of 17 and 12 for ssp26 and rcp26 respectively similar reductions for the far future are observed in autumn with mmm sm decreasing by 27 under ssp85 38 under rcp85 18 under ssp26 and 14 for rcp26 positive sm anomalies are detected in april under both isimip generations in the high emission scenario and far future period 11 mmm of rcp85 and 15 8 mmm of ssp85 annual sm anomalies under rcp26 remain relatively constant from near to far future around 10 in mmm while a marked decline under ssp26 is found from 9 5 to 14 3 in the high emission scenario the mmm of both the i2 and i3 driven models project a negative sm anomaly of 13 in the near future for the far future an even more distinct sm decline of 18 under ssp85 and 26 under rcp85 is detected respectively besides the lower boundary of the sm projections under rcp85 is 35 around 29 for ssp85 the lower reductions under ssp85 are in line with the significant precipitation rise see fig 6 compared to the i2 derived counterpart 3 3 meteorological controls of the soil moisture and evapotranspiration feedback a pc system was established to evaluate the relevance of meteorological changes on the sm eta feedback and to determine differences in the feedback between i2 and i3 as the basin is generally water limited sm anomalies control eta anomalies positive relationship while in energy limited regions the coupling would be reversed and eta anomalies would lead to sm variations negative relationship berg and sheffield 2019 for this reason we calculated the pc between eta and sm rather than eta and precipitation which might be suitable as sm proxy monthly anomalies of the mmm for the two periods amj and jas were used for the evaluation the two periods together comprise the vegetative season due to hydrometeorological differences within the vegetative season the season was split to identify potential contrasting patterns the pc results are supported by standard pearson correlation values in order to highlight the magnitude of confounding effects the results of the pc analysis are illustrated in fig 10 where the upper four panels refer to the period from may to june and the lower four to june to september in the amj period a strong positive relationship between temperature and eta is found for the near future within all scenarios under both isimip phases here the effects of precipitation and sm are small gray crosses versus colored bars which indicates a sufficient water availability in this period in the near future to cover the eta demand this is in agreement with the constant to slight increase in precipitation in these months fig a2 vice versa the sm control on eta in the near future of the amj period is rather small 0 5 albeit higher under i2 which is confirmed by higher precipitation projections causing a slightly higher water availability under i3 fig a2 confounding effects in the eta control are relatively weak and most pronounced in the ssp26 near future relationship of sm and eta the eta variance is therefore explained to a large degree of temperature and precipitation we can already see a strong decline of the importance of temperature on eta anomalies under the high emission scenario in the far future i2 and i3 this implies an increase in the positive sm eta coupling and a potential stressor for soil water a cross validation with fig 9 shows that this mostly refers to june where soil decussation under rcp and ssp85 is substantial in the far future in contrast to i3 the i2 projections of rcp85 the sm eta feedback increases significantly while under ssp85 the relationship of temperature and sm with eta are close with small pc values 0 5 under the low emission scenario far future eta variations are still controlled mainly by temperature with pc magnitudes similar to the near future under i2 and i3 the amj period coincides with the rainy season and the pc values of temperature and sm are predominantly weaker as for eta nearly all pcs of temperature and sm are below 0 5 all scenarios periods and both isimip phases or even below 0 25 under i2 no strong changes in the behavior of sm and temperature are found between near and far future both scenarios a similar development is shown under i3 however the contra intuitive positive association of temperature and sm is largely mitigated by the fact that the strengths of the relationships are insignificant and the signs heterogeneous in the high emission scenario of i3 water limitation becomes more apparent through a negative relationship although weak between sm and temperature in the far future this is in accordance with the sm eta coupling in the amj period where the t eta association is substantially decreased and sm becomes more important in the far future the generally drier jas season is characterized by sm shortcomings and pronounced water limited conditions this is also reflected in the pc values of the jas season the sm eta feedback is strongly positively correlated in the near and far future of all scenarios under i2 and i3 the actual pearson correlations between temperature and eta show strong negative relationships which would imply the unintuitive fact that rising temperatures are associated with a decline in eta again all scenarios of i2 and i3 and far and near future however most of the variance can be explained by the effects of precipitation and sm hence the corresponding pcs of temperature and eta are much weaker in absolute values than the pearson correlations for the i2 cases and the near future of the ssp85 the negative behavior is even reversed positive sign of pc while under both i2 scenarios the dominant sm control of eta anomalies remains constant from near to far future the positive feedback is marginally reduced from near to far future in the i3 counterparts this is especially in line with the precipitation projections in the jas period of the high emission scenarios which have a significant drop under i2 compared to i3 and is also visible in the sm anomalies of the high emission figs 9 and a2 the advanced water limitation under i2 compared to i3 is clearly visible in the corresponding pc values generally the higher the pc value of sm eta the stronger the feedback and the more distinctive the water limitation accordingly two entirely contrasting pictures can be revealed in the control of eta variations the explanation of sm anomalies is again more ambiguous for the high emission scenarios i2 and i3 of the near future a substantial portion is explained by temperature anomalies both show a strong negative relationship indicating a strong sm decrease with rising temperatures the negative relationship is also present in the far future both scenarios as well as the low emission scenarios of the near future yet not as notable 0 5 for the near future of the low emission scenarios the missing strength is attributed to the smaller positive temperature anomalies compared to the high emission scenarios the reduced dominance of temperature in the far future is probably caused by an already advanced desiccation of soils water limitation higher as in near future the selection of eta as one of the confounding variables for sm might be doubtful since sm controls eta and not vice versa at least it becomes apparent that the confounding effects under i3 here are relatively high fig a4 provides an additional example of sensitivities of multiple variables to annual temperature anomalies 4 discussion in this study we investigated how climate impact assessment agrees and diverges under a subset of i2 and i3 gcms to produce a reliable and robust hydrological model for the impact assessment we followed the recommendations proposed by krysanova et al 2018 2020 4 1 evaluation test the evaluation procedure produced meaningful and comparable results for both the swat model forced with ewembi as well as with w5e5 all steps of the evaluation procedure were successfully passed and the models performed satisfactorily to well in most cases under contrasting climate periods on multiple temporal scales for various gof criteria as well as for eta and sm in addition to discharge in detail however there were differences at the subbasin level where individual gauges showed a poorer performance than for example at the basin outlet thus two similar parameter sets were identified for both reference datasets serving as base for the impact assessment gof results were on average around 0 75 for nse 0 82 for kge and 9 4 for pbias in the basin considering all gauges moreover warm and wet periods were better reflected nsewet 0 8 nsewarm 0 75 than cold and dry periods nsecold 0 71 nsedry 0 70 similar difficulties and weaker model performances are for example also reported in vaze et al 2010 for a catchment in australia however due to the crucial role of nivo glacial processes in ca catchments more emphasize should be placed on these processes in future studies e g considering snow cover as in hofmeister et al 2022 glacier mass balance as wortmann et al 2018 did or snow water equivalent data see tuo et al 2018 in the calibration process if available could produce an even more consistent and reliable picture of the system deficiencies were mostly observed in the high elevated headwater part see tables 2 and 3 where nse values were in average only around 0 6 these are mainly due to model weaknesses with regard to the representation of glaciers we therefore agree with saks et al 2022 that future studies should consider these aspects and evaluate expected peak flow more closely it must also be mentioned that the approach followed here logically does not necessarily guarantee that the robustness of the model adequately reflects all projected changes this is particularly the case for the contrasting climatological periods since rates of change are likely to be more pronounced in the future on the one hand and on the other hand the relatively short historical period restricted due to data availability may not adequately reflect the influence of persistent changes over a longer period of time these deviations and assumptions that might be only partially representative are described in detail in stephens et al 2020 4 2 meteorological changes projected temperature raises agree throughout the year in all periods under the new and old generation of gcms in contrast precipitation disparities have shown to be one of the major differences between i2 and i3 while precipitation changes observed under i2 are mostly in line with other related studies lutz et al 2014 luo et al 2018 huang et al 2014 the higher increase under i3 has not yet been comprehensively and extensively addressed in the literature the same applies to the associated effects on the hydrological cycle discrepancies in the precipitation projections between i2 and i3 arise mainly from regional contrasts in the basin under ssp26 and ssp85 a continuous rise throughout the whole basin is projected with a marked characteristic in the kekerim subbasin i2 contains two counteracting patterns the western part of the basin receives more precipitation which is amplified in the high emission scenario while on the other hand the eastern and headwater part is characterized by a decline in precipitation the decline is also even more significant in the high emission scenario and for the far future period we provide a first estimate of hydrological impacts triggered by precipitation changes under both isimip generations the deviations in projected precipitation anomalies consistent positive precipitation anomalies with mmm of 16 3 under ssp85 compared to 3 1 under rcp85 in the far future come along with a higher climate sensitivity in the new ensemble of climate models warming rate in average 0 82 c higher until 2100 in high emission scenario however a lot of the current research focuses on the higher climate sensitivity of cmip6 models including the potential or necessity to constrain warming trends of models that tend to be on the upper edge tokarska et al 2020 sherwood et al 2020 as only a subset of gcms was available and included future studies might extend the efforts with a larger sample further although projects like isimip add a huge value for climate impact studies the generally coarse resolution of the gcms might not be suitable for all studies and regions especially for small basins the resolution could be insufficient hydrological scale patterns could be missed this problem might also affect the higher elevated parts of the study area where the performance of the models for all variables was deteriorated meteorological processes of individual mountain ranges might be inaccurately represented however data limitations make it difficult to evaluate this thesis in detail in any case we assume that regional climate models are favorable and would add value to future studies if possible to include we also would like to at least mention that depending on the methodology and data availability an assessment of the gcm performance might be reasonable in advance of the actual study to for example exclude poor performing climate models or to take into account a weighting approach to reduce their importance within the results if for some reasons gcms are not applicable in a study we would also like to emphasize to consider perturbations of the observed climatology to draw conclusions of the future hydrology based on these synthetic time series examples can for example be found in rasouli et al 2019b a 4 3 hydrological changes the projected mmm of all hydrological variables generally agree between i2 and i3 on the annual and seasonal scale mmm discharge projections were similar across both isimip phases they showed a significant shift in the flow regime peak discharge is projected to occur one month earlier june to may under the high emission scenarios by the end of the century this is consistent with what was reported by other authors gan et al 2015 didovets et al 2021 the shift is mainly driven by substantial increases in spring snowmelt followed by a strong decline in summer a3 the summer deficit agrees with the water shortage found for sm summer deficits of discharge and sm could cause and promote water stress in the region this is particularly evident since summer water availability directly affects irrigation demand during the vegetative season and water storage for energy production especially for higher projected temperatures and thus an increase in potential evapotranspiration estimates future water demand could significantly rise and constitute an additional stressor moderate deviations were found in the eta trajectories with stronger increases projected under i3 difference of 6 in mmm of i2 and i3 in low emission scenario and 14 in high emission scenario at the end of the century the higher estimates are likely to be triggered by a combination of higher projected temperatures higher energy availability fig 6 as well as weaker sm reductions higher water availability fig 9 eta increases referred mainly to the first half of the year the period where the most significant precipitation increases were observed the period was also characterized by a strong increase in snowmelt fig a3 an additional source of water the described impacts are more pronounced under the high emission scenario and the far future the eta trajectories are consistent with recently reported trends for ca and globally and the impacts could significantly contribute to future desertification one of the major risks in ca huang et al 2020b ma et al 2021 notable sm deficits in summer 36 in mmm of rcp85 and 33 under ssp85 in the far future and autumn 38 in mmm of rcp85 and 27 under ssp85 in the far future were projected for both gcm generations which could act as potential stressor for the agricultural productivity summer and autumn sm deficits could thus induce and promote future agricultural droughts droughts that promote land degradation are already present in ca zhang et al 2018 according to our results indications of negative changes in the vegetation dynamics caused by soil moisture deficits which became particularly pronounced after the 90 s li et al 2015 deng and chen 2017 could thus also represent a substantial future risk in the basin the crucial role of sm for drying in ca is also illustrated in hu et al 2018 who used a correlation analysis to demonstrate the importance of sm although most of the studies available focus on whole ca solely on the historical period or use related variables such as ndvi or variants of it and total water storage jiang et al 2017 xing et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 peng et al 2021 our study supports to assess these future risks at the local level the negative anomalies were slightly smaller under i3 due to an attenuation caused by a raise in precipitation annual decrease in mmm of 18 for ssp85 and 26 for rcp85 in the far future annual sm shortcomings tend to be stronger for i3 under the low emission scenario and smaller under the high emission scenario compared to i2 by end of the century summarized the findings indicate the vulnerability of the region to sm shortages our pc results provide evidence that shifts in the role of the meteorological drivers can be expected from near to far future as well as between i2 and i3 in both periods amj and jas this leads to partly significant deviations and changes in the sm eta coupling from near to far under both gcm generations as well as between them and in both seasons we find clear differences in the strength of the sm eta relationship in the two seasons amj and jas where the latter is considerably more water limited while under i2 the pressure on soil moisture reflected in the strong control of eta remains relatively constant from near to far future both scenarios we see a attenuation of the strongly positive relationship under i3 both scenarios from near to far this development represents the different precipitation trajectories where the i3 jas rainfall does not show the drop which is especially visible in the rcp85 and thus likely leads to a mitigated negative sm evolution under i3 albeit still severe the strong water limitations in jas are expected to exacerbate the pressure on water resources to meet the demand the resulting implications for example on land degradation or the occurrence of droughts are similar to those mentioned already above however the pc results underline the assumption of a reinforced sm eta coupling under both generations of climate models yet with a marginal shift towards less water limitation under i2 in jas the strength of the sm eta coupling could be seen as indicator for vegetation conditions ibrahim et al 2015 and in terms of a positive coupling reduced moisture availability berg and sheffield 2019 the strong positive future relationship between the two variables in the basin is also in accordance what is expected roughly on the global scale when analyzing gcm outputs berg and sheffield 2018 berg et al 2015 dirmeyer et al 2013 a limitation which applies not only to our study but to many hydrological impact studies are missing atmospheric feedbacks which are connected to the eta sm coupling such as evaporative cooling for the generally wetter amj season we can already identify a positive increase in the sm eta relationship under i2 and i3 from near to far future particularly in the high emission scenarios this provides evidence that the water limited regime could further advance in the region despite precipitation projection in the far future tend to be positive for i2 as well as i3 in other words the importance of sm variations to explain eta variations increases this shift in the future importance of sm is enhanced by the decreasing dominance of temperature to explain eta variations under the high emission scenarios one major deviation between i2 and i3 is found in the magnitude of the sm eta feedback in the far future of the high emission scenarios under rcp85 the explanatory power of sm replaces the one of temperature as major controlling factor in contrast although the importance of sm increases with a simultaneous decline of temperature the final magnitudes in the far future are relatively close to each other with small values 0 5 we assume that this is caused by the slightly larger increase in precipitation under i3 in amj attenuating the increased demand of rising temperatures however it is expected that further increasing temperatures would also tip the relationship and approach the conditions of i2 stationarity was assumed for the vegetation season which was used for comparability reasons although the period can vary with land use and thus in space zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 as the climatic shifts are likely to shift the vegetative season as well a constant period represents a simplified manner we only included one hydrological model in the assessment an ensemble of impact models would further improve the robustness of the results structural differences in impact models can result in significant deviations in the projections and identify adequateness or inadequacy of impact models for different conditions kundzewicz et al 2018 wen et al 2020 su et al 2016 also land use changes were neglected which are likely to affect processes such as runoff generation albedo associated mechanisms or translation and retention 5 conclusions our study shows that despite advances in the forcings of impact models as a result of gcm scenario or bias adjustment developments estimated impacts are in general concordance these are particularly evident in the projected shifts of the hydrological regime and a sharp increase in soil desiccation we find a shift in peak flow of one month due to an earlier start of the melt season in the high emission scenarios the earlier onset leads to an increase in discharge in spring followed by a decline in summer across both gcm generations and all scenarios the impact assessment further indicates substantial soil moisture deficits especially in summer and autumn however disagreement between i2 and i3 is found in the evapotranspiration estimates which are higher in the new generation temperature projections of i3 are consistent with the general recognition of being warmer than under previous generations higher climate sensitivity rather large deviation between the two generations are found in the precipitation projections although consistently positive precipitation anomalies are observed under i3 the projected sm deficits are substantial under both phases indicating the region s vulnerability this underlines the sensitive interplay between the different components precipitation soil moisture and evapotranspiration deviations in the temperature and precipitation projections of i2 and i3 in the two examined seasons amj and jas reveal significant effects on the sm eta coupling in the basin expressed as pcs we find enhanced water limited conditions in the amj season at the end of the century particularly in the high emission scenarios the advanced importance of sm is directly shown as increase in the positive relationship between sm and eta and indirectly through the decrease in the dominance of temperature on eta the inherently drier jas season with its strong positive sm eta coupling remains constant under the near and far future of i2 while there is a slight decrease with time under the corresponding i3 scenarios this indicates that the general and progressive water limitation among both isimip generations could be at least slightly weakened under i3 albeit it is still intense differences in the magnitudes of effects between i2 and i3 are likely to be caused by mitigating effects present under i3 mostly referred to positive or at least constant precipitation trajectories in the vegetative

7734,study region the naryn river basin kyrgyzstan study focus we investigate the impacts of climate change in the basin based on two families of general circulation models gcms using the hydrological model swat the forcing datasets are the widely used isimip2 i2 and the newly derived isimip3 i3 data which refer to the 5th and 6th stage of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip due to notable differences in the forcing we evaluate their impacts on various hydrological components of the basin such as discharge evapotranspiration eta and soil moisture sm besides a partial correlation pc analysis is used to assess the meteorological controls of the basin with special emphasize on the sm eta coupling new hydrological insights for the region agreement in the basin s projections is found such as discharge shifts towards an earlier peak flow of one month significant sm reductions and eta increases i3 temperature projections exceed their previous estimates and show an increase in precipitation which differs from i2 however the mitigating effects do not lead to an improvement in the region s susceptibility to soil moisture deficits the pc study reveals enhanced water limited

resources and is prone to water related conflicts bernauer and siegfried 2012 berndtsson and tussupova 2020 peña ramos et al 2021 water availability originates mostly from the high mountainous part and relies to a significant part on nivo glacial processes that supply water to the arid lowlands where it is used for agricultural production or to satisfy the energy demand didovets et al 2021 chen et al 2016 hagg et al 2007 central asian s water towers are vulnerable to climate change due to glacier recession and seasonal snow cover reductions which will lead to substantial impacts on the freshwater availability of the local population barandun et al 2020 2021 huss and hock 2018 saks et al 2022 further climatic changes are already expected to exacerbate droughts with partly adverse effects and risks on vegetation and ecosystems jiang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 xing et al 2022 ca is particularly vulnerable to land degradation especially with its special form of desertification which is already present and might be more pronounced in the future due to further climatic changes huang et al 2020a zhang et al 2018 li et al 2015 reasons can be a multitude of climatic effects such as precipitation decrease reducing moisture availability or temperature increases enhancing evapotranspiration as well as anthropogenic causes jiang et al 2022 peng et al 2021 however the relationships between these factors and the vegetation response are complex and challenging jie xu et al 2016 gessner et al 2013 non climatic factors such as mismanagement of water resources as it was the case for the prominent example of the aral sea basin xenarios et al 2018 hamidov et al 2016 and the general drivers of water stress in transboundary river basins such as allocation upstream water use or damming exacerbate water related issues hill et al 2017 wilson et al 2017 döll et al 2009 reported observed temperature rises range from 0 2 0 3 c per decade 1956 2007 in the tian shan kutuzov and shahgedanova 2009 up to 0 36 0 42 c 1979 2011 per decade considering whole central asia hu et al 2014 there is also evidence that the warming trends were intensified since the 1970s while for precipitation observed changes are more heterogeneous without consistent patterns unger shayesteh et al 2013 climate projections in the context of the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 project significant temperature increases until 2099 e g immerzeel et al 2013 reports a temperature rise of around 2 c until 2050 under the rcp4 5 relative concentration pathway for the amu darya and syr darya which is consistent with the calculated increase of 1 2 2 c in high asia by lutz et al 2014 ozturk et al 2017 estimates a temperature increase of up to 7 c under the high emission scenario rcp8 5 until 2099 which is in line with the projected changes in summer of 6 5 c in reyer et al 2015 precipitation trends are mostly minor and show a strong spatial diversity besides precipitation changes are less significant and more uncertain for most projections lutz et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2013 luo et al 2018 only ozturk et al 2017 reports a more consistent precipitation decrease in their study more recent studies which are based on the newer shared socioeconomic pathways ssp and newer general circulation models gcm from cmip6 show strong similarities in projected temperatures with slightly higher projections compared to cmip5 under ssp8 5 lalande et al 2021 calculated an upper bound of 9 c for the adjacent located high mountain asia hma a different picture is found for precipitation changes over ca where several studies report a clear increase in precipitation amounts with ranges from 10 5 14 4 under ssp2 6 and ssp8 5 until the end of the century jiang et al 2020 or similar findings guo et al 2021 however cmip6 based impact studies that investigate what these differences in the new estimates could mean are still rare but will likely increase in the near future the assessment of climate change impacts on different components e g of the hydrological cycle is an essential element for the development of societal adaption and mitigation strategies but also to raise the general awareness of potential changes however climate impact studies are subject to a complex modeling chain considering multiple scenarios multiple gcms multi model downscaling and bias adjustment methods and lastly an impact model such as an hydrological model huang et al 2020b olsson et al 2016 as a consequence impact studies are prone to large uncertainties initiated by these different sources wen et al 2020 bosshard et al 2013 nevertheless the quantification and communication of uncertainties play an important role in impact modeling mishra et al 2020 vetter et al 2015 where one aim should be the minimization of uncertainty referred to the impact model to improve the reliability of the projected changes vetter et al 2016 krysanova et al 2018 thus krysanova et al 2020 showed in their special issue how a robust impact model can reduce the magnitude of projected uncertainties and provided guidelines for a comprehensive model evaluation in addition to the standard calibration and validation procedure due to the importance of ca s water towers and its dependence on agriculture the evaluation of its climate and hydrology is essential for adaption and mitigation climate impact assessment on the hydrological cycle in ca has been conducted in several studies as it was done for eight ca catchments by didovets et al 2021 with varying results depending on the catchment characteristics and flow regime gan et al 2015 reports a shift towards earlier peak discharge and runoff as well as precipitation declines in the naryn catchment slight reductions in runoff combined with similar significant seasonal shifts are found by hagg et al 2013 for the upper amu darya more substantial negative changes in runoff are estimated for the chu river basin by changkun et al 2015 however climate impact studies on the hydrological cycle based on cmip6 are almost not available in the region thus our aim is to provide an assessment of climate change impacts on different hydrological components within the naryn basin considering a subset of the recent cmip6 gcms and scenarios secondly we do not solely focus on the climate projections based on cmip6 but reveal how the impacts on the hydrological cycle changed from cmip5 to cmip6 which is particularly relevant in the context of adaptation and mitigation strategies our gcm subsets are derived from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip versions 2b and 3b and will be designated as i2 and i3 in the following see 2 1 special emphasize is put on the differences in the projected coupling of soil moisture and evapotranspiration initiated through disparate precipitation and temperature projections between the two generations hence we perform a correlation analysis where a partial correlation pc system is used to assess the meteorological effects on and changes within the soil moisture evapotranspiration feedback 2 materials and methods 2 1 datasets used in this study we used the daily meteorological data of four gcms and two scenarios from cmip5 for the analysis of future changes and the corresponding successor models and scenarios from cmip6 to drive our hydrological model and to evaluate how projected impacts differ between both cmip generations in total then 8 gcms were utilized 4 of each generation of climate models in detail we used the gcm data from gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 under cmip5 and the corresponding successor gcms gfdl esm4 ukesm1 0 ll successor of hadgem2 es ipsl cm6a lr and miroc6 under cmip6 respectively the selected scenarios refer to a low and high emission scenario of both phases namely rcp2 6 rcp8 5 and ssp1 2 6 as well as ssp5 8 5 respectively in the following we denote them simply as rcp26 rcp85 ssp26 ssp85 the data was obtained from the isimip project where the gcm data was separately downscaled and bias adjusted for each cmip phase isimip is analogously to cmip structured in various phases where isimip2b frieler et al 2017 lange 2018 corresponds to cmip5 while isimip3b lange 2019 utilizes cmip6 results the isimip2b procedure preserves trends in long term mean values using adjustment factors or offsets for those statistics and transfer functions for the adjustment of day to day variability around the monthly mean value in contrast the isimip3b procedure adjusts biases using quantile mapping and preserves trends in all quantiles of the distribution of a climate variable statistical downscaling is done via spatial interpolation in isimip2b and with multivariate quantile mapping in isimip3b furthermore the bias adjustment was performed for different reference datasets namely ewembi under isimip2b cmip5 gcms lange 2018 and w5e5 under isimip3b cmip6 gcms cucchi et al 2020 lange et al 2021 providing the base for the calibration and validation of our hydrological model both reference datasets were designed for the bias adjustment of climate impact studies both datasets merge various data sources ewembi hereby is based on earth2observe forcing era interim nasa gewex surface radiation budget data and wfdei data the predecessor w5e5 combines the methodology of version 1 0 watch forcing data era5 reanalysis data and precipitation data from version 2 3 of the global precipitation climatology project the two reference datasets are the base for the bias adjustment of the corresponding isimip phase see table 1 to evaluate simulated actual evapotranspiration eta and soil moisture sm of swat we considered the widely used data from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 and global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 respectively the digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 90 m was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm nasa jpl 2013 land use data was obtained from the european space agency s climate change initiative land cover esa cci lc project esa 2017 with a resolution of 300 m and soil data was received from the food and agricultural organization s fao 1 km harmonized world soil map hwsm fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 as the used isimip data represents only a subset of available gcms of each cmip generation it has to be noted that our approach rather compares a sample of each cmip generation based on the isimip data than providing a complete picture which was beyond the scope of that study 2 2 study area naryn basin the naryn basin is located in kyrgyzstan and is along with the kara darya one of the two headwater catchments of the syr darya river in the aral sea basin the naryn is formed by the two headwater rivers big and small naryn which originate in the tian shan mountains it flows westwards through kyrgyzstan until it crosses the border to uzbekistan where it joins the kara darya in the fergana valley the basin is characterized by a nivo glacial flow regime where the flood period begins in april and ends in september the catchment size is around 58 000 km 2 however our study only considers the share of the catchment 46 000 km 2 until the toktogul reservoir a multi purpose reservoir used for hydroelectricity generation and irrigation around 2 2 of the catchment is glacierized where the majority of the glaciers lie in the eastern area the region has a dry continental and semi arid climate with annual precipitation sums between 280 mm 450 mm aizen et al 1995 depending on the location and elevation within the basin the annual maximum precipitation occurs in spring or summer temperatures are diverse throughout the basin and the mean summer temperatures can reach 25 c and during the winter months the mean temperatures can fall down to 20 c an overview of the study area can be found in fig 1 2 3 hydrological model swat the soil water assessment tool swat is a process based semi distributed and continuous model which was developed by the blackland research extension center of the united states department for agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 swat was initially developed to evaluate the impact of land management practices in large watersheds but is nowadays used for a multitude of applications all over the world swat is widely used for sediment studies water resources management climate impact assessment or agricultural investigations arnold and fohrer 2005 spatially the catchment is subdivided into subbasins on the basis of which a further spatial discretization into hydrological response units hrus takes place the latter one serves as the smallest spatial unit within the model and represents a unique combination of land use soil and slope on the subbasin level computations are divided into a land and a water phases where the calculations of the land phase are carried out on the hru level the land phase hereby covers the processes which are responsible for the movement of water nutrients or sediment to the stream of a subbasin swat first sums up the area dependent hru loadings and fluxes of each subbasin before they are transferred to the corresponding stream the water or routing phase refers to instream processes such as the transport of water sediment or nutrients through the channel network 2 4 calibration validation and evaluation test this section describes the calibration and evaluation procedure of the hydrological model based on the reference datasets of both projection families the approach follows the suggestions of krysanova et al 2018 2020 and some modifications provided in gelfan et al 2020 the whole methodology is represented in fig 2 for each of the two reference datasets of the isimip phases a swat model was set up individually in detail we performed the following steps 1 multi site calibration of seven gauges considering multiple goodness of fit criteria gof fig 2a 2 model robustness check under contrasting climate periods fig 2b 3 cross evaluation of model robustness using evapotranspiration and soil moisture estimates fig 2b first the procedure was applied for the swat model forced with the ewembi reference dataset representing i2 before we transferred the obtained parameter set to the w5e5 representing i3 driven impact model and the same steps were performed again only if all steps for both hydrological models forced with the two reference datasets of i2 and i3 could be carried out satisfactorily the impact assessment is conducted due to inconsistencies in data availability and quality daily discharge data was only available for four gauges and monthly data was obtained for the three remaining gauges based on the available data the calibration period was set to 1974 1981 and the validation period from 1982 1987 for the ewembi driven model a limitation arose through different temporal coverages of ewembi and w5e5 originally both datasets are available from 1979 onward however for ewembi the extended gswp3 ewembi hereafter ewembi product enabled a prolonged temporal coverage a similar extension was not accessible for the w5e5 dataset at the time the calibration was done therefore the calibration period was set to the validation period of the model driven with ewembi due to these limitations a separate and suitable validation phase could not be used as a preliminary study the two forcing datasets were compared and evaluated to quantify differences in the basin step 1 of the procedure considered multiple rules we calibrated from upstream to downstream and for each gauge multiple initial simulations were performed to close the water balance the number varied throughout the subcatchments based on how fast the water balance could be closed multiple gof criteria were selected during the calibration procedure the water balance closure was assessed based on the percent bias pbias where we adapted and fixed the lapse rates for temperature and precipitation secondly different parameter groups were calibrated e g snow parameters groundwater parameters etc and evaluated using the nash sutcliff efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge in combination with a seasonal rmse to account for a trade off between daily monthly and seasonal results an overview of the selected parameters and their categories is presented in a 1 when satisfactory results in the calibration and validation phase were achieved a robustness check for contrasting climatic conditions was performed step 2 the model performance is evaluated against wet and dry years as well as for warm and cold years by forming a sequential time series of non continuous years each sequence then represents the respective climate thus the mean annual precipitation and temperature for the calibration and validation period were calculated each year was then individually divided by the mean value and either classified as cold if the mean temperature of a year t i where i is the individual year is smaller than the mean annual temperature of the whole time series t m e a n or warm if t i t m e a n and wet if the annual precipitation of a year p i the mean annual precipitation of the time series p m e a n or dry if p i p m e a n the four resulting discharge time series per swat model were then evaluated with the gof criteria introduced under step 1 lastly step 3 a cross evaluation using eta data from gleam as well as sm from gldas is performed to ensure an adequate internal model consistency and to represent various components of the hydrological system krysanova et al 2020 the analysis was done on the basin and subbasin scale for monthly and annual estimates the performance of eta is illustrated by means of the nse rmse and the pearson correlation r however sm could not been validated in absolute values due to a mismatch in the soil layer definitions within the swat model and gldas which provides sm values for different layers e g 0 10 cm or 10 40 cm thus we rather assessed seasonal and inter annual sm anomalies again by a r coefficient and a normalized version of the rmse nrmse computed by a normalization with the interquartile range difference between 75th percentile and 25th percentile similar difficulties with sm evaluations are presented for example in poméon et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 and dembélé et al 2020 to allow for an appropriate comparison of the impacts based on the i2 and i3 driven models we aimed for a consistent parameterization of both models thus steps 1 3 were first performed for the swat model driven with ewembi and then when satisfactory results were achieved the same parameterization was used for the model forced with w5e5 then all three steps were carried out again a final parameterization was stated as acceptable when similar results are obtained for both models however due to minor differences in the forcing datasets ewembi and w5e5 in their mean annual precipitation and temperature minor adaptions in the parameterization were necessary to match the water balance the adaptions were thus limited to the lapse rates and in seldom cases to the snow pack temperature lag factor 2 5 projected changes of isimip2b and isimip3b this section illustrates the comparison between both generations of projections first we show how the temperature and precipitation projections as well as their estimates in the historical phase differ the comparison is done on the basin scale for multiple temporal representations seasonal annual the future projections are derived from the four general circulation models of each projection phase i2 and i3 respectively and scenario in order to ensure an adequate comparability we selected gcms that are both available in i2 as well as in the new phase i3 represented by a corresponding successor model see 2 1 accordingly we focused on cmip5 s rcp scenarios that were translated and continued by a corresponding ssp scenario that characterizes a similar aggregated forcing however there are several differences between the rcp scenarios and their successors which are explained and demonstrated in detail in meinshausen et al 2020 or tebaldi et al 2021 this assumption leads to the consideration of the low emission rcp2 6 and ssp2 6 and high emission rcp8 5 and ssp8 5 scenarios as swat requires t m a x as input we use the respective quantity as proxy for mean daily temperature changes precipitation changes δ p refer to relative anomalies of the mean annual sum 2 5 1 differences in meteorological forcing first of all we present the differences in the meteorological variables of all gcms between i2 and i3 therefore we calculate anomalies of two future 30 year periods near 2020 2049 and far future 2070 2099 to the historical baseline period 1971 2000 differences are illustrated individually for precipitation and temperature as multi model mean mmm of the gcms of each isimip phase uncertainties are represented as gcm range the radiative forcings of the selected scenarios of i2 and i3 are equal e g ssp85 similar to rcp85 deviations arise mainly from different climate sensitivities present in the gcms of the different cmip or isimip phases 2 5 2 changes in hydrological components as a next step future hydrological changes in the basin are evaluated as a result of the various trajectories therefore discharge eta and sm anomalies are assessed for the i2 and i3 forced hydrological models and compared afterwards the model spread provides a representation of the uncertainty and the ensemble mean represents the average future change per scenario and generation of projection analogously to the meteorological changes hydrological changes are presented on a basin scale as seasonal and annual anomalies 2 6 meteorological controls of the soil moisture and evapotranspiration feedback special emphasize is put on the relevance of meteorological drivers on variations in sm and eta as well as the future development of the eta sm feedback under both generation of climate models it was aimed to evaluate to what extent meteorological differences under i2 and i3 affect the coupling of sm and eta the interaction is implicitly considered in the model non linear decrease when sm is below field capacity to identify the major controls and their effects on the sm eta feedback a partial correlation system was developed which gives further insights on the direction and strength of the sm eta mechanism the evaluation focused on the mmm results of the gcms e g the mmm for each variable of a specific scenario and time period within the corresponding isimip phase to draw conclusions with regard to the mean signal for the analysis monthly anomalies of the meteorological and hydrological variables were generated since eta and sm variations are larger during the vegetative season which partly coincides with the rainy season see fig a2 the analysis was based on the period from april to september the vegetation season is thus assumed to be stationary until 2099 and potential phenological shifts are not considered for the analysis the vegetative season was split in two periods april june amj which roughly coincides with the rainy season in the basin and july to september jas which is generally drier on the basin scale it has to be noted that irrigation which is the largest water consumer of kyrgyzstan was not explicitly considered in the simulations the pcs allow to directly control for the effects of one or more independent variables to identify confounding effects variable that explain part of the relationship which is present in the standard regression between a dependent and independent variable we thus considered the combined effects of temperature precipitation sm and eta to infer potential future shifts in the sm eta interaction and their dominant controls in our case combined effects refer to the consideration of two control variables e g in the pc calculation between temperature and sm the effects of the remaining variables eta and precipitation are taken into account accordingly the pc calculation is supported by the standard pearson correlation values to highlight the confounding effect a significant shift in the correlation values pearson and pc value indicates that the relationship cannot be explained by one driver alone but is partly based on the second variable eta variations are assessed by the explanatory strength of temperature and sm while sm was evaluated using temperature since sm generally controls eta in water limited regimes and not vice versa we present the sm eta coupling in the pc system of eta rather than sm berg and sheffield 2019 mathematically the pc system can be formulated as follows 1 r y x 1 x 2 r y x 1 r y x 2 r x 1 x 2 1 r y x 2 2 1 r x 1 x 2 2 where r y x 1 x 2 refers to the partial correlation coefficient between the dependent variable y sm or eta and the independent variable x 1 while controlling for the effects of the independent variable x 2 the remaining r represent the pearson correlation coefficients between the corresponding pairs of variables the control variables can be precipitation temperature sm or eta e g if we want to evaluate potential effects of precipitation the control variable x 2 would refer to precipitation and x 1 to temperature hence r x 1 x 2 would refer to the pearson correlation of precipitation and temperature 3 results hereafter we present the results of the calibration procedure the comparison of projected meteorological and hydrological changes under the new and old climate model generations the relevance of the meteorological controls and the findings of the uncertainty decomposition 3 1 calibration validation and evaluation test the following sections correspond to part a and b illustrated in fig 2 statistical results w r t different gof criteria for all seven gauges are presented in table 2 note due to unsatisfactory data availability there is no validation phase for w5e5 see 2 1 apart from the big naryn basin a significant deterioration between the monthly and daily calibration results as well as between ewembi and w5e5 could not be detected best results were achieved at the basin outlet on average the nse values are around 0 75 for the calibration and validation period kge 0 82 pbias 9 4 in the two models worst results are found at the two headwater streams big and small naryn the poorer results here are likely to be caused by the higher relevance of glacier processes which were not represented by the model a comprehensive discussion on that can be found in the discussion section at the end of this work besides a notable difference in water volumes expressed as pbias was found at gauge kekirim which is caused by a systematic overestimation of late summer and autumn flow july october fig 3 shows the daily monthly calibration and validation results for four selected gauges combined with their seasonal hydrographs we selected one gauges which was calibrated monthly and three daily calibrated gauges to emphasize the comparable performance for the daily calibrated gauges the selection comprised two well performing gauges followed by the big naryn where poorer results were achieved in general both daily monthly and seasonal hydrographs of both models show a good agreement with the observed flow with the exception of the big naryn in general the model based on ewembi data as well the one driven with w5e5 are able to reproduce the seasonal behavior within the respective subcatchments however in case of the poorer performing headwater catchment it becomes apparent that the deterioration is likely caused by a mismatch during summer where a systematic underestimation occurs the mean seasonal plots include observed flow for two different periods each representing the maximum available data of ewembi 1974 1987 and w5e5 1982 1987 respectively the robustness check in which the model performance was individually assessed in wet dry and warm cold periods see section 2 4 led to comparable results as achieved in the original calibration and validation procedure the results of the evaluation for all gauges can be found in table 3 overall wet periods are better reproduced by both models for both gof criteria than dry years nsewet 0 8 nsedry 0 7 pbiaswet 9 pbiasdry 11 8 also for warm and cold phases model performances are similar nsewarm 0 75 nsecold 0 71 and pbiaswarm 9 1 pbiascold 10 46 the numbers are average values of both models and all gauges similar to the original calibration the same gauges exhibit the worst performance comparing the robustness of the ewembi and w5e5 driven models no significant differences are observed the model forced by ewembi data performs better in warm periods slightly better in dry periods similar in wet periods and slightly worse in cold years compared to its w5e5 counterpart it can be concluded that the methodology is generally able to produce comparable results for both models in overall the models performed reasonable for most of the gauges in all climate phases as well as for the standard calibration and validation procedure and thus successfully pass the first two steps of the evaluation test gauges that produced unsatisfactory results are in line for both models indicating the similarity in the parameterization and the meteorological forcing of both reference datasets poor results relate mainly to the big naryn and gauge kekerim where the poor performance mainly arises from water balance issues indicated by pbias a notable deterioration of the results is found in the small naryn basin when moving from ewembi to w5e5 in contrast an improvement is even obtained at gauge kekerim 3 1 1 cross validation of actual evapotranspiration to improve the models reliability they were cross validated with respect to the gleam eta product in order to increase the credibility of the projected changes the cross validation is performed to assure consistency of the hydrological processes within the catchment and to further improve model robustness due to the data availability it was performed from 1982 to 1987 the simulated eta of both models show a high agreement with the eta estimates of gleam at the catchment scale a nse of 0 97 is achieved based on the monthly evaporation estimates for the ewembi forced model rmse 4 1 mm pbias 3 2 the performance of the w5e5 driven model is similar with a nse of 0 96 rmse 4 6 mm pbias 3 3 basin values for r are almost 1 on the subbasin scale the median nse and r value are 0 8 and 0 9 respectively for both models without any significant difference between them nrmse values are close to 0 for both models with both medians around 0 20 however the small number of subbasins performing poor arises from both a systematic over and underestimation of swat in the summer period without any clear pattern due to the high agreement between the eta estimates of both models and an overall very good performance results are considered satisfactory fig 4 summarizes the monthly results on the basin and subbasin scale where the latter is represented as boxplot for the individual performance metrics 3 1 2 cross validation of soil moisture similar to eta the sm estimates of the two swat models were evaluated using gldas data the performance was assessed for soil moisture anomalies we also used a nrmse due to different soil layer assumptions see section 2 4 analogously the evaluation period was from 1982 to 1987 it was found that the resulting sm estimates of both models based on the reference datasets ewembi and w5e5 reveal a satisfactory agreement on the basin scale besides the general seasonal behavior in the models is reproduced in a satisfactory way with respect to the gldas sm particularly at the basin scale on the basin scale the nrmse is 0 44 for the ewembi and w5e5 driven model respectively in addition a r value of 0 81 is obtained for both models the basin nse is 0 65 for the model forced with ewembi and 0 64 for the one based on w5e5 on the subbasin scale the median considering the performance of all individual subbasins nrmse is 2 20 r 0 62 for the ewembi driven model and 2 24 r 0 62 for the w5e5 counterpart see fig 4 however on the subbasin scale a deterioration in all evaluation metrics can be observed which is mainly due to the very poor performance of some subbasins while the deficiencies are counterbalanced on the basin scale some subbasins proved to produce much stronger seasonal cycle which were not found in the gldas estimates the effect is reflected in the weaker nse results on the subbasin scale the results of both variables eta and sm used in the cross validation were moderate to very good in the catchment for both models in summary both models performed equally during all steps of the evaluation procedure a significant deterioration from ewembi to w5e5 was not found and most of the discrepancies in the water balance were present at parts of the headwater subbasins both models were able to capture the contrasting climate periods with slight reductions in the quality in dry or cold phases no notable differences were determined in the cross validation of the water balance components sm and eta all steps were successfully performed and passed 3 2 projected hydrometeorological changes of isimip2b and isimip3b results are separately presented for the meteorological forcings the hydrological projections the importance of the meteorological controls as well as the sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 differences in meteorological forcing in the following we highlight the main differences of the two gcm generations with respect to the projected temperature and precipitation changes changes are represented as anomalies to the baseline for two future periods see section 2 5 1 under both scenarios temperature changes are evaluated as mean annual daily maximum temperature anomalies from now on δ t m a x rather than mean temperatures mean daily temperature changes are represented as proxy derived from t m a x precipitation changes δ p refer to relative anomalies of the mean annual sum fig 5 provides an overview of the meteorological projections of all scenarios isimip phases gcms and future periods the newer generation of gcms produce generally higher temperatures as their former counterparts comparison of equal blue and green symbols in contrast to the high emission scenario the temperature rise of an individual gcm between near and far future is weaker under the low emission scenario same symbol but different outline intensity under the low emission scenario the gcms range from 1 5 c to 4 c temperature increase until 2099 under i3 compared to 0 46 c to 2 4 c under the old generation most gcms scatter around 2 c without any significant difference between the two periods under rcp ssp26 in contrast under the high emission scenario the temperature rise ranges from 3 8 c to 7 1 c for rcp85 and 4 5 c to 8 8 c for ssp85 this underlines the higher climate sensitivity of the new generation of climate models in the study region comparing the warming rates in the far future on the gcm development level for the radiative forcing of 8 5 w m 2 differences range from 0 77 c predecessor gcm computes higher temperatures to 3 2 c successor gcm produces higher temperature in average the warming of the new climate models is around 0 82 c higher in the far future period under the high emission scenario mmm of 5 86 c compared to mmm of 6 68 c the mmm of the low emission scenario for i2 is 1 82 c and 2 65 c for i3 in the far future period those results are in line with a generally higher climate sensitivity of cmip6 gcms compared to cmip5 gcms meehl et al 2020 precipitation anomalies show a higher disagreement between both climate generations especially the old generation of gcm is characterized by diverging and contrasting precipitation patterns in comparison under i3 the gcms consistently exhibit positive precipitation anomalies albeit with strong deviations in their magnitudes under ssp85 in the far future period the projections range from 3 5 up to 38 2 compared to 18 9 to 22 under rcp85 in general the differences in magnitude between the near and far future for each gcm are less pronounced under rcp26 ssp26 and more distinctive for rcp85 ssp85 respectively the projected change represented by the mmm is small under both rcp scenarios with values of 3 1 and 5 in the far future for rcp85 and rcp26 respectively for the respective scenarios of i3 we observe an increase in precipitation of 9 7 ssp26 and 16 3 ssp85 in summary the positive precipitation anomalies reflected by the various mmms are enhanced under i3 besides the inter model range of i2 reveals a stronger spread uncertainty of precipitation anomalies for all future periods the projected δ t m a x anomalies present comparable inter model ranges in all scenarios under i2 and i3 fig 6 the discrepancy in the projected precipitation anomalies of the two generations arises mainly from specific regional contrasts which are further addressed in the discussion section moreover deviations are found in the seasonal projections of precipitation while both gcm families show an increase from october to may june they differ in late summer and early autumn the mmm of the i3 ensemble does not significantly differ from the historical period in this period however in i2 the mmm shows strong declines of up to 30 with respect to the seasonal patterns all effects are more distinctive in the respective high emission scenario and the far future period see a1 a2 3 2 2 hydrological impacts the hydrological models were forced with the meteorological inputs of the different gcms and scenarios until 2099 however due to differences in the time of departure from the historical to the projection period between the two gcm generations 2006 and 2015 different time series lengths were available for the trajectories the impact models for i2 and i3 are based on the individual parameter sets from the respective reference datasets ewembi or w5e5 here we present the results of the climate impact study on various hydrological components on the basin scale discharge results are thus presented for gauge uchterek discharge a summary of the results is provided in fig 7 in the far future period the mmm of the annual mean flow is projected to change by 3 6 under ssp85 6 3 ssp26 and 0 7 under rcp85 5 rcp26 however we observe significant seasonal shifts towards an earlier onset of the high flow period under the high emission scenario peak flow is shifted by one month from june to may with a high agreement between the mmm of both the i2 and i3 driven models for the far future period while spring flow is projected to increase drastically under rcp26 31 6 and rcp85 82 5 summer flow trajectories show significant decreases under the old generation of gcms 3 7 for rcp26 and 28 5 for rcp85 the i3 forced models exhibit similar patterns spring flow is projected to increase by 26 2 and 80 2 respectively for ssp26 and ssp85 compared to a reduction of 2 ssp26 and 24 4 ssp85 in summer the contrasting seasonal shifts in spring and summer have compensating effects with respect to annual mean flow changes despite an overall strong agreement in the seasonal mmm both isimip phases reveal differences regarding their uncertainties see uncertainty bands in fig 7 the agreement is detected in both scenarios in the far future period the uncertainties become larger with time and are more pronounced for the high emission scenarios besides the lower boundary of the inter model range is smaller under i2 in the high emission scenario far future throughout the year evapotranspiration stronger deviations between i2 and i3 are found in the eta projections higher mean annual eta anomalies are observed for i3 in both scenarios and both periods expressed as mmm we find a discrepancy of around 6 in the ensemble mean within the low emission scenario fig 8 in the two periods under the high emission scenario the discrepancy between the i2 and i3 driven models increases with time this leads to differences of 14 at the end of the century in the mmm 9 32 i2 and 23 97 i3 it becomes apparent that the reason is mainly due to negative summer anomalies under rcp85 while the newer estimates are positive 9 in mmm of i2 and 5 i3 for the far future period the effect is further amplified due to higher eta estimates under ssp85 from march to june the discrepancy of summer eta indicates differences in the available sm within this period see also fig 9 lower right panel the impact is likely to be induced by the deviations found in summer precipitation of i2 and i3 fig a2 for example in the far future period the relative eta changes from june to september under rcp85 are 9 8 compared to a reduction of 27 5 in precipitation model median in the same period under ssp85 precipitation increases by 1 8 supported by an eta raise of 4 8 which is almost in balance similar patterns also occur under the low emission scenario although not as distinct the results are illustrated in fig 8 soil moisture fig 9 illustrates the projected sm changes in the naryn basin both i2 and i3 projections agree in their overall tendency of a significant decline in sm under all scenarios and periods however discrepancies are found in the uncertainties and magnitudes of the detected patterns the projections of the older gcm family constitute larger uncertainties with less negative seasonal anomalies in the far future period in the low emission scenario in contrast the negative seasonal anomalies in the high emission scenario are more pronounced than for i3 in particular summer and early autumn are characterized by a significant decline in the mmm in all periods and scenarios under both climate model phases for ssp85 available summer sm is projected to decrease around 33 far future which is in line with a decrease of 36 for rcp85 in the low emission scenario again far future summer sm projections reveal a decrease of 17 and 12 for ssp26 and rcp26 respectively similar reductions for the far future are observed in autumn with mmm sm decreasing by 27 under ssp85 38 under rcp85 18 under ssp26 and 14 for rcp26 positive sm anomalies are detected in april under both isimip generations in the high emission scenario and far future period 11 mmm of rcp85 and 15 8 mmm of ssp85 annual sm anomalies under rcp26 remain relatively constant from near to far future around 10 in mmm while a marked decline under ssp26 is found from 9 5 to 14 3 in the high emission scenario the mmm of both the i2 and i3 driven models project a negative sm anomaly of 13 in the near future for the far future an even more distinct sm decline of 18 under ssp85 and 26 under rcp85 is detected respectively besides the lower boundary of the sm projections under rcp85 is 35 around 29 for ssp85 the lower reductions under ssp85 are in line with the significant precipitation rise see fig 6 compared to the i2 derived counterpart 3 3 meteorological controls of the soil moisture and evapotranspiration feedback a pc system was established to evaluate the relevance of meteorological changes on the sm eta feedback and to determine differences in the feedback between i2 and i3 as the basin is generally water limited sm anomalies control eta anomalies positive relationship while in energy limited regions the coupling would be reversed and eta anomalies would lead to sm variations negative relationship berg and sheffield 2019 for this reason we calculated the pc between eta and sm rather than eta and precipitation which might be suitable as sm proxy monthly anomalies of the mmm for the two periods amj and jas were used for the evaluation the two periods together comprise the vegetative season due to hydrometeorological differences within the vegetative season the season was split to identify potential contrasting patterns the pc results are supported by standard pearson correlation values in order to highlight the magnitude of confounding effects the results of the pc analysis are illustrated in fig 10 where the upper four panels refer to the period from may to june and the lower four to june to september in the amj period a strong positive relationship between temperature and eta is found for the near future within all scenarios under both isimip phases here the effects of precipitation and sm are small gray crosses versus colored bars which indicates a sufficient water availability in this period in the near future to cover the eta demand this is in agreement with the constant to slight increase in precipitation in these months fig a2 vice versa the sm control on eta in the near future of the amj period is rather small 0 5 albeit higher under i2 which is confirmed by higher precipitation projections causing a slightly higher water availability under i3 fig a2 confounding effects in the eta control are relatively weak and most pronounced in the ssp26 near future relationship of sm and eta the eta variance is therefore explained to a large degree of temperature and precipitation we can already see a strong decline of the importance of temperature on eta anomalies under the high emission scenario in the far future i2 and i3 this implies an increase in the positive sm eta coupling and a potential stressor for soil water a cross validation with fig 9 shows that this mostly refers to june where soil decussation under rcp and ssp85 is substantial in the far future in contrast to i3 the i2 projections of rcp85 the sm eta feedback increases significantly while under ssp85 the relationship of temperature and sm with eta are close with small pc values 0 5 under the low emission scenario far future eta variations are still controlled mainly by temperature with pc magnitudes similar to the near future under i2 and i3 the amj period coincides with the rainy season and the pc values of temperature and sm are predominantly weaker as for eta nearly all pcs of temperature and sm are below 0 5 all scenarios periods and both isimip phases or even below 0 25 under i2 no strong changes in the behavior of sm and temperature are found between near and far future both scenarios a similar development is shown under i3 however the contra intuitive positive association of temperature and sm is largely mitigated by the fact that the strengths of the relationships are insignificant and the signs heterogeneous in the high emission scenario of i3 water limitation becomes more apparent through a negative relationship although weak between sm and temperature in the far future this is in accordance with the sm eta coupling in the amj period where the t eta association is substantially decreased and sm becomes more important in the far future the generally drier jas season is characterized by sm shortcomings and pronounced water limited conditions this is also reflected in the pc values of the jas season the sm eta feedback is strongly positively correlated in the near and far future of all scenarios under i2 and i3 the actual pearson correlations between temperature and eta show strong negative relationships which would imply the unintuitive fact that rising temperatures are associated with a decline in eta again all scenarios of i2 and i3 and far and near future however most of the variance can be explained by the effects of precipitation and sm hence the corresponding pcs of temperature and eta are much weaker in absolute values than the pearson correlations for the i2 cases and the near future of the ssp85 the negative behavior is even reversed positive sign of pc while under both i2 scenarios the dominant sm control of eta anomalies remains constant from near to far future the positive feedback is marginally reduced from near to far future in the i3 counterparts this is especially in line with the precipitation projections in the jas period of the high emission scenarios which have a significant drop under i2 compared to i3 and is also visible in the sm anomalies of the high emission figs 9 and a2 the advanced water limitation under i2 compared to i3 is clearly visible in the corresponding pc values generally the higher the pc value of sm eta the stronger the feedback and the more distinctive the water limitation accordingly two entirely contrasting pictures can be revealed in the control of eta variations the explanation of sm anomalies is again more ambiguous for the high emission scenarios i2 and i3 of the near future a substantial portion is explained by temperature anomalies both show a strong negative relationship indicating a strong sm decrease with rising temperatures the negative relationship is also present in the far future both scenarios as well as the low emission scenarios of the near future yet not as notable 0 5 for the near future of the low emission scenarios the missing strength is attributed to the smaller positive temperature anomalies compared to the high emission scenarios the reduced dominance of temperature in the far future is probably caused by an already advanced desiccation of soils water limitation higher as in near future the selection of eta as one of the confounding variables for sm might be doubtful since sm controls eta and not vice versa at least it becomes apparent that the confounding effects under i3 here are relatively high fig a4 provides an additional example of sensitivities of multiple variables to annual temperature anomalies 4 discussion in this study we investigated how climate impact assessment agrees and diverges under a subset of i2 and i3 gcms to produce a reliable and robust hydrological model for the impact assessment we followed the recommendations proposed by krysanova et al 2018 2020 4 1 evaluation test the evaluation procedure produced meaningful and comparable results for both the swat model forced with ewembi as well as with w5e5 all steps of the evaluation procedure were successfully passed and the models performed satisfactorily to well in most cases under contrasting climate periods on multiple temporal scales for various gof criteria as well as for eta and sm in addition to discharge in detail however there were differences at the subbasin level where individual gauges showed a poorer performance than for example at the basin outlet thus two similar parameter sets were identified for both reference datasets serving as base for the impact assessment gof results were on average around 0 75 for nse 0 82 for kge and 9 4 for pbias in the basin considering all gauges moreover warm and wet periods were better reflected nsewet 0 8 nsewarm 0 75 than cold and dry periods nsecold 0 71 nsedry 0 70 similar difficulties and weaker model performances are for example also reported in vaze et al 2010 for a catchment in australia however due to the crucial role of nivo glacial processes in ca catchments more emphasize should be placed on these processes in future studies e g considering snow cover as in hofmeister et al 2022 glacier mass balance as wortmann et al 2018 did or snow water equivalent data see tuo et al 2018 in the calibration process if available could produce an even more consistent and reliable picture of the system deficiencies were mostly observed in the high elevated headwater part see tables 2 and 3 where nse values were in average only around 0 6 these are mainly due to model weaknesses with regard to the representation of glaciers we therefore agree with saks et al 2022 that future studies should consider these aspects and evaluate expected peak flow more closely it must also be mentioned that the approach followed here logically does not necessarily guarantee that the robustness of the model adequately reflects all projected changes this is particularly the case for the contrasting climatological periods since rates of change are likely to be more pronounced in the future on the one hand and on the other hand the relatively short historical period restricted due to data availability may not adequately reflect the influence of persistent changes over a longer period of time these deviations and assumptions that might be only partially representative are described in detail in stephens et al 2020 4 2 meteorological changes projected temperature raises agree throughout the year in all periods under the new and old generation of gcms in contrast precipitation disparities have shown to be one of the major differences between i2 and i3 while precipitation changes observed under i2 are mostly in line with other related studies lutz et al 2014 luo et al 2018 huang et al 2014 the higher increase under i3 has not yet been comprehensively and extensively addressed in the literature the same applies to the associated effects on the hydrological cycle discrepancies in the precipitation projections between i2 and i3 arise mainly from regional contrasts in the basin under ssp26 and ssp85 a continuous rise throughout the whole basin is projected with a marked characteristic in the kekerim subbasin i2 contains two counteracting patterns the western part of the basin receives more precipitation which is amplified in the high emission scenario while on the other hand the eastern and headwater part is characterized by a decline in precipitation the decline is also even more significant in the high emission scenario and for the far future period we provide a first estimate of hydrological impacts triggered by precipitation changes under both isimip generations the deviations in projected precipitation anomalies consistent positive precipitation anomalies with mmm of 16 3 under ssp85 compared to 3 1 under rcp85 in the far future come along with a higher climate sensitivity in the new ensemble of climate models warming rate in average 0 82 c higher until 2100 in high emission scenario however a lot of the current research focuses on the higher climate sensitivity of cmip6 models including the potential or necessity to constrain warming trends of models that tend to be on the upper edge tokarska et al 2020 sherwood et al 2020 as only a subset of gcms was available and included future studies might extend the efforts with a larger sample further although projects like isimip add a huge value for climate impact studies the generally coarse resolution of the gcms might not be suitable for all studies and regions especially for small basins the resolution could be insufficient hydrological scale patterns could be missed this problem might also affect the higher elevated parts of the study area where the performance of the models for all variables was deteriorated meteorological processes of individual mountain ranges might be inaccurately represented however data limitations make it difficult to evaluate this thesis in detail in any case we assume that regional climate models are favorable and would add value to future studies if possible to include we also would like to at least mention that depending on the methodology and data availability an assessment of the gcm performance might be reasonable in advance of the actual study to for example exclude poor performing climate models or to take into account a weighting approach to reduce their importance within the results if for some reasons gcms are not applicable in a study we would also like to emphasize to consider perturbations of the observed climatology to draw conclusions of the future hydrology based on these synthetic time series examples can for example be found in rasouli et al 2019b a 4 3 hydrological changes the projected mmm of all hydrological variables generally agree between i2 and i3 on the annual and seasonal scale mmm discharge projections were similar across both isimip phases they showed a significant shift in the flow regime peak discharge is projected to occur one month earlier june to may under the high emission scenarios by the end of the century this is consistent with what was reported by other authors gan et al 2015 didovets et al 2021 the shift is mainly driven by substantial increases in spring snowmelt followed by a strong decline in summer a3 the summer deficit agrees with the water shortage found for sm summer deficits of discharge and sm could cause and promote water stress in the region this is particularly evident since summer water availability directly affects irrigation demand during the vegetative season and water storage for energy production especially for higher projected temperatures and thus an increase in potential evapotranspiration estimates future water demand could significantly rise and constitute an additional stressor moderate deviations were found in the eta trajectories with stronger increases projected under i3 difference of 6 in mmm of i2 and i3 in low emission scenario and 14 in high emission scenario at the end of the century the higher estimates are likely to be triggered by a combination of higher projected temperatures higher energy availability fig 6 as well as weaker sm reductions higher water availability fig 9 eta increases referred mainly to the first half of the year the period where the most significant precipitation increases were observed the period was also characterized by a strong increase in snowmelt fig a3 an additional source of water the described impacts are more pronounced under the high emission scenario and the far future the eta trajectories are consistent with recently reported trends for ca and globally and the impacts could significantly contribute to future desertification one of the major risks in ca huang et al 2020b ma et al 2021 notable sm deficits in summer 36 in mmm of rcp85 and 33 under ssp85 in the far future and autumn 38 in mmm of rcp85 and 27 under ssp85 in the far future were projected for both gcm generations which could act as potential stressor for the agricultural productivity summer and autumn sm deficits could thus induce and promote future agricultural droughts droughts that promote land degradation are already present in ca zhang et al 2018 according to our results indications of negative changes in the vegetation dynamics caused by soil moisture deficits which became particularly pronounced after the 90 s li et al 2015 deng and chen 2017 could thus also represent a substantial future risk in the basin the crucial role of sm for drying in ca is also illustrated in hu et al 2018 who used a correlation analysis to demonstrate the importance of sm although most of the studies available focus on whole ca solely on the historical period or use related variables such as ndvi or variants of it and total water storage jiang et al 2017 xing et al 2022 zhou et al 2015 peng et al 2021 our study supports to assess these future risks at the local level the negative anomalies were slightly smaller under i3 due to an attenuation caused by a raise in precipitation annual decrease in mmm of 18 for ssp85 and 26 for rcp85 in the far future annual sm shortcomings tend to be stronger for i3 under the low emission scenario and smaller under the high emission scenario compared to i2 by end of the century summarized the findings indicate the vulnerability of the region to sm shortages our pc results provide evidence that shifts in the role of the meteorological drivers can be expected from near to far future as well as between i2 and i3 in both periods amj and jas this leads to partly significant deviations and changes in the sm eta coupling from near to far under both gcm generations as well as between them and in both seasons we find clear differences in the strength of the sm eta relationship in the two seasons amj and jas where the latter is considerably more water limited while under i2 the pressure on soil moisture reflected in the strong control of eta remains relatively constant from near to far future both scenarios we see a attenuation of the strongly positive relationship under i3 both scenarios from near to far this development represents the different precipitation trajectories where the i3 jas rainfall does not show the drop which is especially visible in the rcp85 and thus likely leads to a mitigated negative sm evolution under i3 albeit still severe the strong water limitations in jas are expected to exacerbate the pressure on water resources to meet the demand the resulting implications for example on land degradation or the occurrence of droughts are similar to those mentioned already above however the pc results underline the assumption of a reinforced sm eta coupling under both generations of climate models yet with a marginal shift towards less water limitation under i2 in jas the strength of the sm eta coupling could be seen as indicator for vegetation conditions ibrahim et al 2015 and in terms of a positive coupling reduced moisture availability berg and sheffield 2019 the strong positive future relationship between the two variables in the basin is also in accordance what is expected roughly on the global scale when analyzing gcm outputs berg and sheffield 2018 berg et al 2015 dirmeyer et al 2013 a limitation which applies not only to our study but to many hydrological impact studies are missing atmospheric feedbacks which are connected to the eta sm coupling such as evaporative cooling for the generally wetter amj season we can already identify a positive increase in the sm eta relationship under i2 and i3 from near to far future particularly in the high emission scenarios this provides evidence that the water limited regime could further advance in the region despite precipitation projection in the far future tend to be positive for i2 as well as i3 in other words the importance of sm variations to explain eta variations increases this shift in the future importance of sm is enhanced by the decreasing dominance of temperature to explain eta variations under the high emission scenarios one major deviation between i2 and i3 is found in the magnitude of the sm eta feedback in the far future of the high emission scenarios under rcp85 the explanatory power of sm replaces the one of temperature as major controlling factor in contrast although the importance of sm increases with a simultaneous decline of temperature the final magnitudes in the far future are relatively close to each other with small values 0 5 we assume that this is caused by the slightly larger increase in precipitation under i3 in amj attenuating the increased demand of rising temperatures however it is expected that further increasing temperatures would also tip the relationship and approach the conditions of i2 stationarity was assumed for the vegetation season which was used for comparability reasons although the period can vary with land use and thus in space zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 as the climatic shifts are likely to shift the vegetative season as well a constant period represents a simplified manner we only included one hydrological model in the assessment an ensemble of impact models would further improve the robustness of the results structural differences in impact models can result in significant deviations in the projections and identify adequateness or inadequacy of impact models for different conditions kundzewicz et al 2018 wen et al 2020 su et al 2016 also land use changes were neglected which are likely to affect processes such as runoff generation albedo associated mechanisms or translation and retention 5 conclusions our study shows that despite advances in the forcings of impact models as a result of gcm scenario or bias adjustment developments estimated impacts are in general concordance these are particularly evident in the projected shifts of the hydrological regime and a sharp increase in soil desiccation we find a shift in peak flow of one month due to an earlier start of the melt season in the high emission scenarios the earlier onset leads to an increase in discharge in spring followed by a decline in summer across both gcm generations and all scenarios the impact assessment further indicates substantial soil moisture deficits especially in summer and autumn however disagreement between i2 and i3 is found in the evapotranspiration estimates which are higher in the new generation temperature projections of i3 are consistent with the general recognition of being warmer than under previous generations higher climate sensitivity rather large deviation between the two generations are found in the precipitation projections although consistently positive precipitation anomalies are observed under i3 the projected sm deficits are substantial under both phases indicating the region s vulnerability this underlines the sensitive interplay between the different components precipitation soil moisture and evapotranspiration deviations in the temperature and precipitation projections of i2 and i3 in the two examined seasons amj and jas reveal significant effects on the sm eta coupling in the basin expressed as pcs we find enhanced water limited conditions in the amj season at the end of the century particularly in the high emission scenarios the advanced importance of sm is directly shown as increase in the positive relationship between sm and eta and indirectly through the decrease in the dominance of temperature on eta the inherently drier jas season with its strong positive sm eta coupling remains constant under the near and far future of i2 while there is a slight decrease with time under the corresponding i3 scenarios this indicates that the general and progressive water limitation among both isimip generations could be at least slightly weakened under i3 albeit it is still intense differences in the magnitudes of effects between i2 and i3 are likely to be caused by mitigating effects present under i3 mostly referred to positive or at least constant precipitation trajectories in the vegetative
