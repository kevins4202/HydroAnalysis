15215,this paper explores wastewater based epidemiology wbe as a tool enabling understanding of city s pain treatment in an intercity longitudinal study an intensive 13 month monitoring programme was undertaken in two adjacent urban areas in south west england a small commuter town keynsham and the city of bath 180 samples collected the study has shown a great potential of using triangulated wbe and national health service nhs prescription data in understanding pain treatment in two contrasting communities with strong apparent seasonal patterns of short pain medications vs chronic pain treatment as well as the type of treatment used e g oral vs topical community wide usage of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and paracetamol in the intercity study is population size and season driven with the highest usage recorded in winter months this contrasts with other pain pharmaceuticals especially those used for chronic pain where no limited seasonal usage was recorded unmetabolized nsaids are to a large extent directly disposed of into the sewerage system bypassing metabolism due to their topical application this is particularly apparent in winter months with naproxen showing the highest seasonal variability pharma met ratio of pharmaceutical and its metabolite concentration analysis allows for tracking topical non metabolic application down the drain disposal of pharmaceuticals with frequent instances of direct disposal of nsaids into the sewerage system observed normalisation of pharma markers to population size shows comparable estimates of pharma usage in the two cities confirming population as the main driver of pharma loads in wastewater variable application patterns of pain pharmaceuticals make back calculation of intake more convoluted intake calculated using percentage excretion of parent nsaids will likely lead to overestimation as it is assumed that nsaids are subject to extensive metabolism this is not the case for topical applications intake calculated using percentage excretion of metabolites or parent compound as consumption markers leads to underestimation of nsaids usage due to contributions from topical application not being accounted for prescription data indicates cumulative internal and topical usage but the data ignores large proportion of over the counter usage therefore we have proposed a combined approach allowing for estimation of total usage including and differentiating between topical application and oral administration keywords water fingerprinting chemical mining wbe wastewater based epidemiology human exposure pain nsaids analgesics 1 introduction pain is inherent to communities globally it can be acute chronic or intermittent it is estimated that 20 of adults suffer from pain globally and 10 are newly diagnosed with chronic pain each year despite this the issue of pain has been little addressed in the area of public health goldberg and mcgee 2011 pain treatment is inherently linked with disease burden the four largest causes of pain are cancer osteoand rheumatoid arthritis operations and injuries and spinal problems pain is linked with depression inability to work and hindered social interaction goldberg and mcgee 2011 monitoring of local national and global pain burden is of paramount importance to provide evidence and inform policy responses with the ultimate goal of population health protection breivik et al 2013 pain treatment is also associated with high economic cost smith and hillner 2019 breivik et al 2013 there is also a need to raise public awareness about community pain to acknowledge pain as public health priority goldberg and mcgee 2011 unfortunately public health epidemiology tools able to capture community wide pain are lacking there is therefore a need for an evidence based public health diagnostics and risk prediction system which will collate long term comprehensive spatiotemporal datasets on public health status and trigger rapid response from regulatory and public health sectors with the aim of pain management and disease prevention this system if operated in near real time and if linked with timely response systems could allow public health threats to be rapidly identified at low cost and instantly dealt with reducing the global pain burden and public health we are proposing to overcome the above limitations with its ground breaking approach towards epidemiological research through utilisation of wastewater fingerprinting or wastewater based epidemiology wbe wastewater is a complex mixture of substances of biological and chemical origin including city stressors e g toxicants and infectious agents and urban physiological processes e g specific disease linked proteins genes and stressor metabolites the quantitative measurement of these substances continuously pooled by the sewerage system can provide evidence of a city s exposure to stressors as well as can be used to inform the state of community s health kasprzyk hordern 2019 wbe is currently used to estimate illicit drug use at the national and international levels ort et al 2014 thomas et al 2012 gonzález mariño et al

wbe approaches its main goals are develop robust back calculation approaches of pharma intake via systematic review of literature human biomonitoring hbm data understand true usage of pain medications accounting for both prescription and over the counter otc usage understand seasonal changes in pain medication usage understand usage vs direct disposal as well as changes in patterns of drug administration data triangulation with pain medicines prescription data and community demographics 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and analytical standards several pharmaceuticals used for pain treatment pps and their metabolites were subject of investigation in this study table 1 the internal standards is used are gathered in table s1 water was purified using a milli q purification system from millipore nottingham uk methanol formic acid 95 nh4oh nh4f were purchased from sigma uk and fisher uk all solvents used were of hplc grade or higher all glassware was deactivated using a 5 v v dimethyldichlorosilane dmdcs in toluene sigma uk to prevent loses from analyte sorption according to the following procedure washing the glassware once with 5 dmdcs followed by two washes with toluene and finally with three washes of methanol 2 2 sample collection untreated wastewater samples were collected between screening and primary sedimentation for 13 months from two wwtps serving fig 1 city of bath and town keynsham these wwtps contribute to one river catchment in the south west uk covering an area of approximately 2000 km2 and the population of 1 5 million this constitutes 75 of the overall population in the catchment randomised sample collection was implemented with average 2 samples collected every week influent wastewater was collected as flow proportional 24 h composites with average sub sample collection frequencies of 15 min using an isco 3700 autosampler sub samples 80 ml were cooled to 4 c with ice during collection to limit biological activity individual samples were then pooled after 24 h to provide one 24 h composite all samples were then transported on ice to the laboratory spiked with the internal standards and stored at 18 c until sample preparation and analysis could take place 2 3 sample preparation and analysis wastewater samples 50 ml were spiked with 50 ng of is mix 50 µl of a 1 µg ml 1 methanolic is solution filtered using gf f glass microfibre

analytes data processing was carried out using masslynx version 4 1 waters and targetlynx software waters method performance parameters are available in si 2 4 calculations of daily mass loads population normalised mass loads and intake daily mass loads of pprs mg day 1 pain pharmaceutical residue either parent compound or metabolite were calculated by multiplying total ppr concentrations mg l 1 in a 24 h composite raw wastewater sample by daily wastewater flow rates l day 1 total ppr concentrations in raw wastewater were calculated after taking into account both liquid and suspended particulate matter spm fractions 1 l o a d p p r m g d a y 1 c p p r v where cppr is the total concentration of ppr mg l 1 in influent wastewater both liquid and spe phase v is the volume of wastewater received by the wwtp per day l day 1 mass loads mg day 1 were then normalized to the number of people served by each wwtp mg day 1 1000 inhabitants 1 to give population normalised mass loads pndl in order to compare results between different wwtps 2 p n d l p p r m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 l o a d p p r p e 1000 where pe is the population size served by wwtps pe ww was used for all calculations in this paper population normalised pp intakes pndi mg day 1 1000 inh 1 were calculated using the following equation 3 p n d i p p m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 p n d l p p r c f where cf is the correction factor cfs table 2 were calculated using the following formula 4 c f m w p p m w p p r e x c r e t e d a s p p r 100 where mw pp is the molecular weight of pp and mw ppr is the molecular weight of ppr parent compound or metabolite population normalised daily pp topical application pndta mg day 1 1000 inh 1 was calculated using the following formula 5 p n d t a p p r m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 p n d l p p p n d i p p r m e t p p e x c r e t e d 100 where pndlpp is the population normalised daily loads of pp and pndippr met is the population normalised daily intake of pp calculates using metabolite as a ppr and ppexcreted is of pp excreted after oral administration of pp population normalised combined daily usage pndu mg day 1 1000 inh 1 was calculated using the following formula 6 p n d u m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 p n d i p p r m e t p n d t a please note that it was assumed that no metabolism of topically applied pp takes place a systematic literature search of selected pp and their metabolites in humans was undertaken all searches were performed using the web of knowledge database the following keywords were used urine excretion human metabolite metabolism and glucuronide combinations of these keywords were utilised to narrow the results of the searches e g ibuprofen and metabolite and urine and human with each analyte compound undergoing identical combinations of keywords each search result was considered and the abstract of promisingly titled papers i e keywords found in the title were read to further narrow the results there were two main reasons for rejecting papers 1 no metabolism information i e they did not mention metabolism or the metabolites formed within the body 2 no quantitative metabolism data i e no excretion data was provided for the parent compound or its metabolites detailed information on the systematic literature search is available in si 2 5 population equivalent estimation pe ww was calculated based on water utility estimates as presented in table 3 resident population estimate was calculated by multiplying number of properties by occupancy rate adjusted for care homes residential schools etc the occupancy rate was set at a district level resident population included care homes schools universities prisons and military bases tourism was counted under the non resident population day trippers were not counted commercial waste was calculated based on supply flow to commercial properties and estimate of 60 g bod per capita per day tankered waste imports were calculated based on cod strength as the volume of waste was known therefore a load could be calculated and converted into a pe using the assumption of 120 g cod per capita per day however tankered waste could not be associated only with septic waste as a proportion of the waste was of industrial origin pe nhs population size by general practice gp surgeries was calculated based on the sum of the number of people registered in each gp surgery located inside the wwtps catchment zone gp surgeries information such as gp code gp surgery name address including postcode and number of people registered were obtained from nhs digital https digital nhs uk briefly we have used the wwtps catchment maps and prana jagadeesan et al 2022 our in house developed r package to identify and retrieve the list of gp surgeries located inside each wwtps catchment zone and sum the total number of people registered in each gp surgeries using r an open source software for statistical computing and graphics comparison of pe nhs and ww data indicates close alignment in bath estimates 2 difference and relatively lower alignment in keynsham average 26 pe ww was therefore used in this study for pndl and intake calculations 2 6 prescription data we have used prana jagadeesan et al 2022 to calculate the prescription of pharmaceuticals for the wwtps catchments involved in this study prana utilises national level monthly prescription data published by nhs digital https digital nhs uk to aggregate normalise and map each prescribed pharmaceutical to its corresponding prescribing gp surgeries and postcode the prana package also features pranaviz a web based interactive tool to visualise and analyse prana generated dataset in real time pranaviz facilitates wider use with spatiotemporal and long term trends wwtp catchment maps were used to identify gp surgeries inside each catchment region to collect all relevant information for this study we have extracted the identified gp surgeries prescriptions of the pharmaceutical drugs of different pharmacological groups the data was normalised to the quantity kg month 1 of individual pharmaceutical compounds prescribed in each postcode inside the catchment zone average amount prescribed each day for that month mg day 1 was calculated from the monthly consumption quantity 2 7 population demographics methodology we estimated the residential population demographics age and sex of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp catchment by overlaying the wwtp catchment maps against the lower layer super output area lsoa lsoa 2011 and link general practice gp patients registration by individual lsoa level information nhs choices using r r core team jagadeesan et al 2022 lsoas are the england s lowest geographical area of practical use with an average population of 1500 people or 650 households population within the overlapping wwtp catchment and lsoas were summed to provide the population estimate if the overlap is not exact the proportion of the lsoa within the wwtp catchment i e overlap was calculated and multiplied with population of that lsoa and rounded up to an integer finally all the lsoa intersecting wholly and partly with the wwtp catchment were summed up to give the population demographics of the wwtp catchment comparing population demographics between the two sites figure s10 keynsham and bath had a similar percentage of 20 22 for 19 but comparing the older population keynsham had a slightly higher proportion in the age group 60 79 at 23 with bath reporting 16 perhaps unsurprisingly bath had a higher proportion of younger adults 20 29 around 23 with keynsham at 11 this is in line with the strong university presence in bath with two universities residing in the catchment area 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal variability in daily loads of pharmaceuticals in a 13 months intercity longitudinal study 3 1 1 nsaids and paracetamol increased loads of three out of four nsaids studied ibuprofen naproxen and ketoprofen in winter months from december until march were observed as seen in figs 2 5 ibuprofen in saltford was recorded at average 303 578 62 260 mg day in summer months vs 642 589 267 461 mg day in winter months naproxen was present in saltford at 296 314 48 462 mg day in summer months vs 637 407 380 601 mg day in winter months similar patterns were observed in keynsham with ibuprofen averaging at 52 778 27 956 mg day in summer months vs 100 346 42 932 mg day in winter months naproxen was present in keynsham at 66 056 95 951 mg day in summer months vs 1301 374 75 554 mg day in winter months the highest increase in usage over winter months dec march was observed for ibuprofen and naproxen on average 2 1 2 2 and 1 4 for ibuprofen naproxen in saltford and 1 9 2 0 and 1 0 for ibuprofen naproxen and ketoprofen in keynsham when compared to summer months jun aug interestingly metabolite daily loads for ibuprofen 2 hydroxyibuprofen stayed constant despite increased daily loads of ibuprofen in winter months which is likely linked with increased topical applications of ibuprofen during winter months and relatively constant level of oral administration of ibuprofen throughout the year this contrasts with o desmethylnaproxen naproxen s metabolite which decreased during winter months this indicates that naproxen is primarily applied as a topical medication in winter months with higher levels of oral application in summer months furthermore parent nsaid met ratios were higher in winter vs summer months for example in satford ibu ibuprofen 2 hydroxy 2 hydroxyibuprofen ratio denoted 2 8 1 2 in winter and 1 0 0 3 in summer and in keynsham 3 6 1 6 in winter and 1 2 0 5 in summer napr naproxen desmethyl desmethylnaproxen recorded in saltford 124 0 113 4 in winter and 16 5 9 2 in summer and in keynsham 168 5 110 2 in winter and 33 7 32 7 in summer this confirms a non metabolic entry route either because of topical application or via down the drain direct disposal of unused medicines 1 4 times increase in ketoprofen loads in saltford with no increase in keynsham was observed in winter but this increase was also associated with increased loads of its metabolite dihydroketoprofen which indicates an increased usage that involves oral administration and metabolism this is confirmed by higher ket ketoprofen dihydro dihydroketoprofen ratios in summer vs winter in saltford ket dihydro 3 8 5 8 in winter and 6 7 7 1 in summer with less pronounced difference in keynsham ket dihydro 2 6 3 7 in winter and 3 3 2 7 in summer interestingly prescription data does not follow this trend with stable prescribing for most nsaids in saltford as opposed to the other nsaids diclofenac s daily loads remained constant across sampling months 16 055 6269 mg day in saltford and 2731 1694 mg day in keynsham fig 5 dicl diclofenac 4 hydroxydicl 4 hydroxydisclofenac ratio also remained constant throughout the year 2 5 1 0 in saltford and 3 5 1 5 in keynsham indicating that there is no seasonality in diclofenac consumption it is important to note that there are some random exceedances in dicl 4 hydroxydicl which could indicate direct down the drain disposal of unconsumed dicl the most pronounced increase was recorded in saltford january dicl 4 hydroxydicl 74 7 and in keynsham january dicl 4 hydroxydicl 24 1 and 66 3 respectively a non opioid analgesic paracetamol was found at increased loads in winter months from december until march as seen in fig 6 it was recorded in saltford at average 4698 554 929 480 mg day in summer months vs 6821 760 2612 072 mg day in winter months lower temporal variability for paracetamol usage averaging at 1102 163 1107 426 mg day in summer months vs 1135 870 328 395 mg day in winter months was observed in keynsham 3 1 2 opioid analgesics several opioid analgesics and their metabolites were targeted in this study morphine normorphine dihydromorphine norcodeine codeine dihydrocodeine tramadol n desmethyltramadol o desmethyltramadol diamorphine 6 acetylmorphine relatively low seasonal variation in opioid analgesics tramadol codeine dihydrocodeine morphine remained constant across sampling months e g morphine 12 222 8698 mg day in saltford and 3132 2250 mg day in keynsham codeine 11 725 3520 mg day in saltford and 5947 6680 mg day in keynsham dihydrocodeine 11 509 37 558 mg day in saltford and 2378 1460 mg day in keynsham tramadol 32 060 11 916 mg day in saltford and 5543 5639 mg day in keynsham figs s5 and s6 diamorphine and its metabolites 6 acetylmorphine were hardly quantified throughout the study 3 1 3 nerve pain chronic pain agents as opposed to nsaids and non opioid analgesics nerve chronic pain agents gabapentin and pregabalin remained constant across sampling months gabapentin 20 733 5 16 688 0 mg day in saltford and 5351 8 10 431 6 mg day in keynsham and pregabalin 4762 4 1568 4 mg day in saltford and 792 2 964 3 mg day in keynsham figs s7 and s8 preg methylpreg ratio also remained constant throughout the year 1 9 0 6 in saltford and 2 6 1 1 in keynsham indicating that there is no seasonality in pregabalin s consumption 3 1 4 anaesthetics ketamine was the only anaesthetic surveyed in this study it remained relatively constant across sampling months 3342 7 830 8 mg day in saltford and 557 7 296 6 mg day in keynsham fig s9 a slight increase in loads was observed in the summer this was manifested with a drop with otherwise constant ketamine norketamine ratio through the 13 months study this indicates different non metabolic usage patterns rather than an increase in use of ketamine 3 2 population normalised daily loads to understand intercity usage patterns as shown in figs 2 5 daily loads of nsaids in keynsham are much lower than in bath this is directly linked with smaller population contributing to the wastewater samples indeed normalisation of daily nsaids loads to the population size shows similar average daily mass loads of all studied nsaids and their metabolites in both keynsham and bath as seen in fig 7 ibuprofen 3790 2122 7 and 3288 1 2161 1 and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 2564 1108 and 1774 7 1436 7 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively ketoprofen 131 9 106 5 and 139 3 166 6 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively naproxen 3555 4 2672 1 and 4161 2 3988 9 mg day 1000inh and o desmethylnaproxen 115 9 87 1 and 75 7 76 5 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively finally diclofenac denotes 138 8 54 2 and 125 8 84 6 mg day 1000inh and 4 hydroxydiclofenac 59 7 22 4 and 38 4 31 4 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively similarly to nsaids other pharmaceuticals showed comparable patterns fig 8 paracetamol 47 888 8 18 137 and 61 291 48 129 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively gabapentin 181 4 152 9 and 27 6 64 3 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pregabalin 41 2 13 5 and 42 7 46 1 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively ketamine 27 6 9 2 and 30 1 15 8 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively tramadol 280 5 98 4 and 293 1 300 8 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively morphine 47 49 73 36 and 40 6 92 0 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively codeine 85 4 46 2 and 201 6 321 1 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively dihydrocodeine 54 8 32 5 and 78 3 87 0 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively figs 7 and 8 clearly indicate that double normalisation using two key variables wastewater flows and population size in well understood wastewater catchments leads to similar pndls of studied pain treatment pharmaceuticals in two independent but geographically similar communities this shows key importance of wbe as a new epidemiology tool enabling fully quantitative assessment of community pain treatment interestingly there are no obvious differences in usage patterns in the context of different demographics in the two studies communities keynsham and bath have a similar percentage of 20 22 for 19 but comparing the older population keynsham has a slightly higher proportion in the age group 60 79 at 23 with bath reporting 16 perhaps unsurprisingly bath has a higher proportion of younger adults 20 29 around 23 with keynsham at 11 this is in line with the strong university presence in bath with two universities residing in the catchment area interestingly there is clearly higher prescription in keynsham that could reflect older population but this is not manifested in wastewater data 3 3 intake in an intercity study data normalisation to account for variable wastewater flows population size and human metabolism enabled direct comparison of wastewater derived consumption intake with nhs prescription indeed comparable population normalised intake estimates were observed in the two studied communities as seen in fig 9 two types of nsaids biomarkers pprs were used to calculate intake pharmaceutical itself and its metabolite table 2 this was to ensure that both internal administration and topical use of pharmaceuticals nsaids are captured as well as potential direct disposal of pharma is recognised 3 3 1 ibuprofen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion 20 59 2 56 and 25 64 3 60 and new cfs estimation 9 44 2 28 and 3 62 0 51 for ibuprofen and hydroxyibuprofen respectively table 2 detailed discussion of the review is available in si it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces or phase ii metabolism glucuronides urine samples were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis however as stated above the biliary excretion of unchanged drug and active phase ii metabolites represents 1 of the administered dose furthermore recovered dose parent compounds and identified metabolites accounted for 70 80 across several papers see si ii for details which confirms validity of pprs and their cfs the utilisation of newly established ibuprofen and hydroxyibuprofen s cfs resulted in the following intake estimates ibuprofen 35 777 20 151 and 31 040 20 534 and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 9282 4035 and 6424 5235 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily ibuprofen prescription in the two studied catchments see section 2 6 for further information denoted 2664 230 and 5937 742 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively interestingly while wbe estimates in bath and keynsham show similar per capita consumption this is not the case with per capita prescription data per capita prescription in keynsham is twice as high as in bath furthermore much higher per capita intake was observed using wbe data vs prescription data this was expected as ibuprofen is an over the counter medication as wastewater data will represent both prescription and over the counter usage it is important to note that intake calculated using ppr parent compounds leads to likely overestimation of consumption due to a large proportion of nsaids that are used topically and therefore not subject to human metabolism intake calculated using metabolites as consumption markers leads to likely underestimation of nsaids usage due to the very same reason not accounting for topical application prescription data on the other hand indicates cumulative internal and topical usage but does not account for otc usage therefore it is recommended that the total usage of ibuprofen pndu is calculated to account for population normalised daily intake pndi calculated using metabolic ppr and topical application pndta reduced by pp linked with intake see eq 6 such an approach leads to comprehensive overview of ibuprofen usage pndu which is totalling at 12 089 4267 and 8916 5653 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pndi accounts for 9282 4035 and 6424 5235 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and pndta accounts for 2776 2168 and 2574 2125 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively which gives topical application percentage of 23 and 29 in bath and keynsham respectively this is in line with prescribing data that is at 39 3 and 33 4 for topical application in bath and keynsham respectively 3 3 2 naproxen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion for naproxen and o desmethylnaproxen 58 86 17 64 and 32 26 9 13 with only 9 of the administered dose unaccounted for and new cfs estimation 1 70 0 30 and 3 30 0 93 for naproxen and o desmethylnaproxen respectively table 2 it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces however only 5 of naproxen is excreted in faeces hence cfs are considered accurate utilisation of naproxen and o desmethylnaproxen resulted in the following intake estimates naproxen 6044 4568 and 7074 6726 and o desmethylnaproxen 383 289 and 250 254 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily naproxen prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 5539 437 and 9350 1012 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively similarly to ibuprofen wastewater data showed comparable naproxen usage in the two studied urban areas this was yet again not the case with prescription data as seen in fig 3 large quantities of naproxen are used especially in wintertime topically therefore without the first pass metabolic pathway it is therefore important to evaluate pndis alongside pndls pndls for naproxen were 3555 2672 and 4161 3989 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively with a characteristic peak in wintertime manifested by an increase of naproxen o desmethylnaproxen ratio fig 3 the total usage of naproxen pndu was estimated at 3713 2657 and 4209 4020 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pndis accounted for 383 289 and 250 254 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and pndta accounted for 3 330 2 739 and 3 963 4 016 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively which gives 90 and 94 topical application respectively this is in contrast with prescribing data that indicates no topical usage of naproxen and it might be linked with otc usage 3 3 3 ketoprofen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion for ketoprofen 5 67 3 45 and 70 31 14 45 without and with inclusion of cleaved ketoprofen from glucuronides 100 cleavage was assumed and new cfs estimation 17 64 10 77 and 1 42 0 29 for ketoprofen without and with glucuronides respectively table 2 it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces however ketoprofen is mostly excreted in urine 80 mainly as a conjugated glucuronic acid derivative phase ii metabolism has therefore been considered in calculations dihydroketoprofen is a minor metabolite and no information was found on its metabolism patterns hence it was not used for intake calculations utilisation of ketoprofen with and without an inclusion of glucuronides resulted in the following intake estimates ketoprofen no cleaved ketoprofen included 4507 26 649 and 2457 2958 and ketoprofen glucuronide ketoprofen cleaved 363 2145 and 198 238 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily ketoprofen prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 3 0 3 4 and 1 3 2 6 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively further work is required to fully understand the role of parent compound cleavage in the sewerage system unfortunately as ketoprofen is an otc medication it is not possible to compare outputs from the two cfs against prescription data however from our previous work with prescription pharmaceuticals e g citalopram and high resolution per postcode prescription data kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a it is apparent that excretion factors accounting for glucuronides need to be used to avoid overestimation of intake we are therefore proposing that cf of 5 67 is used with a note over uncertainty of the cleavage observed it is recommended that future analytical protocols include acid or enzymatic hydrolysis for full cleavage of parent analytes from glucuronides 3 3 4 diclofenac a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion 5 81 2 65 and 10 58 7 12 and new cfs estimation 17 21 7 85 and 8 97 6 04 for diclofenac and 4 hydroxydiclofenac respectively table 2 detailed discussion of the review is available in si it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces or phase ii metabolism glucuronides as seen in table s1 68 of the administered dose is unaccounted for urine samples were not subjected to acidic enzymatic hydrolysis calculated excretion factors are therefore likely underestimated and resulting cfs and intake data are overestimated further work is required to provide more accurate estimates of diclofenac s intake despite uncertainties around excretion of diclofenac and its metabolite 4 hydroxydiclofenac interesting trends were observed in the time series utilisation of newly established diclofenac and 4 hydroxydiclofenac s cfs resulted in the following intake estimates diclofenac 2362 966 and 2164 1466 and 4 hydroxydiclofenac 543 197 and 372 273 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily diclofenac prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 136 18 and 142 34 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively the total usage of diclofenac pndu was estimated at 656 214 and 470 332 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pndi accounted for 543 197 and 372 273 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and pndta accounted for 107 49 and 103 73 mg day 1000inh which gives 16 and 22 of topical application in bath and keynsham respectively this is lower than prescribing data that is at 52 16 and 53 17 in bath and keynsham respectively and it might be linked with otc usage 3 3 5 acetaminophen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion for acetaminophen 3 55 0 92 and 55 54 5 42 without and with inclusion of cleaved acetaminophen from glucuronides 100 cleavage was assumed and new cfs estimation 28 17 7 30 and 1 80 0 18 for acetaminophen without and with glucuronides respectively table 2 it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces however acetaminophen is mostly excreted in urine mainly as conjugated glucuronic acid derivative phase ii metabolism has therefore been considered in calculations utilisation of acetaminophen with and without an inclusion of glucuronides resulted in the following intake estimates acetaminophen no cleaved acetaminophen included 1334 038 530 330 and 1695 186 1375 631 and acetaminophen glucuronide acetaminophen cleaved 88 242 33 886 and 75 423 89 614 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily paracetamol prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 69 273 3323 and 144 878 13 183 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively as in the case of ketoprofen and in the absence of metabolic biomarkers paracetamol s intake estimation poses challenges paracetamol is mainly an over the counter medication and it is not possible to compare outputs from the two cfs used accounting for or disregarding phase ii metabolism against prescription data as mentioned earlier from our previous work with prescription pharmaceuticals e g citalopram and high resolution per postcode prescription data kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a it is apparent that excretion factors accounting for glucuronides need to be used to avoid overestimation of intake paracetamol s cf of 3 55 should be therefore recommended for usage to avoid overestimation of intake with a note over uncertainty of the cleavage observed interestingly when cf of 3 55 is used in this study paracetamol s intake is close to prescription data which seems to be an underestimation due to extensive over the counter use this sheds light on our limited understanding on the efficiency of glucuronides cleavage in sewers which needs resolving there is also a known issue of low stability of paracetamol in wastewater it is recommended that future analytical protocols include acid or enzymatic hydrolysis as part of sample preparation protocols to enable full cleavage of parent analytes from glucuronides as our protocols obeyed the same performance criteria throughout the course of the study the observed trends are informative however further work is required to provide cfs for paracetamol that account for both phase ii metabolism as well as stability data 3 3 6 other pain pharmaceuticals pregabalin s cfs were established in this study see table s7 for pregabalin and n methyl pregabalin excretion 71 7 and 0 9 and cfs 1 39 and 102 12 respectively from fig 10 it can be seen that using n methyl pregabalin leads to intake estimates 1968 651 and 1808 1825 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively aligned with prescription data 1018 64 and 2061 1175 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively cfs for tramadol codeine dihydrocodeine and morphine were taken from published literature the following intake estimates were obtained tramadol 904 363 and 967 1003 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively codeine 3041 913 and 8834 10 673 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively dihydrocodeine 120 45 and 211 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and morphine 133 98 and 218 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively wbe based estimates of tramadol 904 363 and 967 1003 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively were found to be aligned with prescription data in bath but they were lower than in keynsham 832 47 and 1500 172 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively similarly there was a good alignment of wbe estimated dihydrocodeine 120 45 and 211 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively with prescription 127 9 and 207 30 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively interestingly both codeine and morphine wbe levels were much higher codeine 3041 913 and 8834 10 673 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and morphine 133 98 and 218 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively than prescription data codeine 1177 43 and 2394 236 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham and morphine 46 4 and 98 10 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively there are several potential reasons codeine is also an over the counter medication so it is expected to see higher wbe vs prescription estimates in the case of morphine higher wbe estimates might be linked with the fact that morphine itself is a metabolite of several opioid analgesics including codeine and diamorphine interestingly no diamorphine was recorded in wastewater due to its low usage prescription estimated 1 0 6 g day 1000inh low stability and high metabolic transformation rates to morphine 3 4 limitations of the study this study focussed on a largescale longitudinal monitoring study of two urban areas with 180 samples collected and 300 samples processed throughout a 13 month monitoring study despite the wealth of data obtained and best alignment of sewer population and prescription data including a systematic literature review of cfs one needs to recognise its limitations these are areas for future work needed to provide best possible accuracy of measurements 1 stability of biomarkers in sewers 2 possible pp transformation via topical application the metabolism of drugs is mainly by metabolic enzyme cytochrome p450 and this enzyme is mainly found in liver the cyp450 actively metabolized drugs can then maintain high concentration when being applied on skin although some of the drug does enter the systemic circulation from the dermal microcirculation for example plasma level of diclofenac after topical administration is within 0 2 to 8 of those achieved after oral administration hagen and baker 2017 it is therefore assumed in this manuscript that no transformation of topically administered pps occurs however further work is required to fully evaluate this phenomenon the role and the extend of biomarker glucoronides cleavage it is assumed in this manuscript that full hydrolysis occurs in wastewater however further work is required to estimate percentage cleavage as well as to introduce sample preparation approaches enabling hydrolysis 3 5 conclusions this study presented results from an intensive 13 month monitoring programme undertaken in two urban areas in south west england keynsham a small commuter town and bath a city the study has shown a great potential of wbe and nhs prescription data triangulation in understanding pain treatment in two adjacent communities with strong apparent seasonal usage patterns of short pain medications vs less variable chronic pain treatment as well as the type of treatment used e g oral vs topical there are several important outcomes of this work 1 community wide usage of nsaids and paracetamol in the intercity study is population size and season driven with the highest usage recorded in winter months this contrasts with other pain pharmaceuticals especially those used for chronic pain where no limited seasonal usage was recorded 2 unmetabolized nsaids are to a large extent directly disposed of into the sewerage system bypassing metabolism due to their preferred topical application this is particularly apparent in winter months with naproxen showing the highest variability 3 parent pp metabolite analysis allows for tracking topical non metabolic application down the drain disposal of pharmaceuticals with frequent instances of direct disposal of nsaids into the sewerage system observed in this study 4 normalisation of biomarker loads to population size shows comparable estimates of biomarkers in the two cities confirming that the population size is the main driver of marker loads in wastewater 5 variable application patterns of pain pharmaceuticals make back calculation of intake more convoluted intake calculated using percentage excretion of parent nsaids will likely lead to overestimation as it is assumed that nsaids are subject to extensive metabolism this is not the case for topical applications intake calculated using percentage excretion of metabolites or parent compound as consumption markers leads to likely underestimation of nsaids usage due to contributions from topical application not being accounted for prescription data indicates cumulative internal and topical usage but the data ignores large proportion of over the counter usage therefore it is recommended that a combined approach allowing for estimation of total usage including and differentiating between topical application and oral administration is applied 6 cfs accounting for glucuronides should be applied in calculations to avoid overestimation of intake future sample preparation protocols will require hydrolysis acid or enzymatic to allow full cleavage of parent compounds from glucuronides credit authorship contribution statement andrew kannan conceptualization

15215,this paper explores wastewater based epidemiology wbe as a tool enabling understanding of city s pain treatment in an intercity longitudinal study an intensive 13 month monitoring programme was undertaken in two adjacent urban areas in south west england a small commuter town keynsham and the city of bath 180 samples collected the study has shown a great potential of using triangulated wbe and national health service nhs prescription data in understanding pain treatment in two contrasting communities with strong apparent seasonal patterns of short pain medications vs chronic pain treatment as well as the type of treatment used e g oral vs topical community wide usage of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and paracetamol in the intercity study is population size and season driven with the highest usage recorded in winter months this contrasts with other pain pharmaceuticals especially those used for chronic pain where no limited seasonal usage was recorded unmetabolized nsaids are to a large extent directly disposed of into the sewerage system bypassing metabolism due to their topical application this is particularly apparent in winter months with naproxen showing the highest seasonal variability pharma met ratio of pharmaceutical and its metabolite concentration analysis allows for tracking topical non metabolic application down the drain disposal of pharmaceuticals with frequent instances of direct disposal of nsaids into the sewerage system observed normalisation of pharma markers to population size shows comparable estimates of pharma usage in the two cities confirming population as the main driver of pharma loads in wastewater variable application patterns of pain pharmaceuticals make back calculation of intake more convoluted intake calculated using percentage excretion of parent nsaids will likely lead to overestimation as it is assumed that nsaids are subject to extensive metabolism this is not the case for topical applications intake calculated using percentage excretion of metabolites or parent compound as consumption markers leads to underestimation of nsaids usage due to contributions from topical application not being accounted for prescription data indicates cumulative internal and topical usage but the data ignores large proportion of over the counter usage therefore we have proposed a combined approach allowing for estimation of total usage including and differentiating between topical application and oral administration keywords water fingerprinting chemical mining wbe wastewater based epidemiology human exposure pain nsaids analgesics 1 introduction pain is inherent to communities globally it can be acute chronic or intermittent it is estimated that 20 of adults suffer from pain globally and 10 are newly diagnosed with chronic pain each year despite this the issue of pain has been little addressed in the area of public health goldberg and mcgee 2011 pain treatment is inherently linked with disease burden the four largest causes of pain are cancer osteoand rheumatoid arthritis operations and injuries and spinal problems pain is linked with depression inability to work and hindered social interaction goldberg and mcgee 2011 monitoring of local national and global pain burden is of paramount importance to provide evidence and inform policy responses with the ultimate goal of population health protection breivik et al 2013 pain treatment is also associated with high economic cost smith and hillner 2019 breivik et al 2013 there is also a need to raise public awareness about community pain to acknowledge pain as public health priority goldberg and mcgee 2011 unfortunately public health epidemiology tools able to capture community wide pain are lacking there is therefore a need for an evidence based public health diagnostics and risk prediction system which will collate long term comprehensive spatiotemporal datasets on public health status and trigger rapid response from regulatory and public health sectors with the aim of pain management and disease prevention this system if operated in near real time and if linked with timely response systems could allow public health threats to be rapidly identified at low cost and instantly dealt with reducing the global pain burden and public health we are proposing to overcome the above limitations with its ground breaking approach towards epidemiological research through utilisation of wastewater fingerprinting or wastewater based epidemiology wbe wastewater is a complex mixture of substances of biological and chemical origin including city stressors e g toxicants and infectious agents and urban physiological processes e g specific disease linked proteins genes and stressor metabolites the quantitative measurement of these substances continuously pooled by the sewerage system can provide evidence of a city s exposure to stressors as well as can be used to inform the

administration data triangulation with pain medicines prescription data and community demographics 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and analytical standards several pharmaceuticals used for pain treatment pps and their metabolites were subject of investigation in this study table 1 the internal standards is used are gathered in table s1 water was purified using a milli q purification system from millipore nottingham uk methanol formic acid 95 nh4oh nh4f were purchased from sigma uk and fisher uk all solvents used were of hplc grade or higher all glassware was deactivated using a 5 v v dimethyldichlorosilane dmdcs in toluene sigma uk to prevent loses from analyte sorption according to the following procedure washing the glassware once with 5 dmdcs followed by two washes with toluene and finally with three washes of methanol 2 2 sample collection untreated wastewater samples were collected between screening and primary sedimentation for 13 months from two wwtps serving fig 1 city of bath and town keynsham these wwtps contribute to one river catchment in the south west uk covering an area of approximately 2000 km2 and the population of 1 5 million this constitutes 75 of the overall population in the catchment randomised sample collection was implemented with average 2 samples collected every week influent wastewater was collected as flow proportional 24 h composites with average sub sample collection frequencies of 15 min using an isco 3700 autosampler sub samples 80 ml were cooled to 4 c with ice during collection to limit biological activity individual samples were then pooled after 24 h to provide one 24 h composite all samples were then transported on ice to the laboratory spiked with the internal standards and stored at 18 c until sample preparation and analysis could take place 2 3 sample preparation and analysis wastewater samples 50 ml were spiked with 50 ng of is mix 50 µl of a 1 µg ml 1 methanolic is solution filtered using gf f glass microfibre

analytes data processing was carried out using masslynx version 4 1 waters and targetlynx software waters method performance parameters are available in si 2 4 calculations of daily mass loads population normalised mass loads and intake daily mass loads of pprs mg day 1 pain pharmaceutical residue either parent compound or metabolite were calculated by multiplying total ppr concentrations mg l 1 in a 24 h composite raw wastewater sample by daily wastewater flow rates l day 1 total ppr concentrations in raw wastewater were calculated after taking into account both liquid and suspended particulate matter spm fractions 1 l o a d p p r m g d a y 1 c p p r v where cppr is the total concentration of ppr mg l 1 in influent wastewater both liquid and spe phase v is the volume of wastewater received by the wwtp per day l day 1 mass loads mg day 1 were then normalized to the number of people served by each wwtp mg day 1 1000 inhabitants 1 to give population normalised mass loads pndl in order to compare results between different wwtps 2 p n d l p p r m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 l o a d p p r p e 1000 where pe is the population size served by wwtps pe ww was used for all calculations in this paper population normalised pp intakes pndi mg day 1 1000 inh 1 were calculated using the following equation 3 p n d i p p m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 p n d l p p r c f where cf is the correction factor cfs table 2 were calculated using the following formula 4 c f m w p p m w p p r e x c r e t e d a s p p r 100 where mw pp is the molecular weight of pp and mw ppr is the molecular weight of ppr parent compound or metabolite population normalised daily pp topical application pndta mg day 1 1000 inh 1 was calculated using the following formula 5 p n d t a p p r m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 p n d l p p p n d i p p r m e t p p e x c r e t e d 100 where pndlpp is the population normalised daily loads of pp and pndippr met is the population normalised daily intake of pp calculates using metabolite as a ppr and ppexcreted is of pp excreted after oral administration of pp population normalised combined daily usage pndu mg day 1 1000 inh 1 was calculated using the following formula 6 p n d u m g d a y 1 1000 i n h 1 p n d i p p r m e t p n d t a please note that it was assumed that no metabolism of topically applied pp takes place a systematic literature search of selected pp and their metabolites in humans was undertaken all searches were performed using the web of knowledge database the following keywords were used urine excretion human metabolite metabolism and glucuronide combinations of these keywords were utilised to narrow the results of the searches e g ibuprofen and metabolite and urine and human with each analyte compound undergoing identical combinations of keywords each search result was considered and the abstract of promisingly titled papers i e keywords found in the title were read to further narrow the results there were two main reasons for rejecting papers 1 no metabolism information i e they did not mention metabolism or the metabolites formed within the body 2 no quantitative metabolism data i e no excretion data was provided for the parent compound or its metabolites detailed information on the systematic literature search is available in si 2 5 population equivalent estimation pe ww was calculated based on water utility estimates as presented in table 3 resident population estimate was calculated by multiplying number of properties by occupancy rate adjusted for care homes residential schools etc the occupancy rate was set at a district level resident population included care homes schools universities prisons and military bases tourism was counted under the non resident population day trippers were not counted commercial waste was calculated based on supply flow to commercial properties and estimate of 60 g bod per capita per day tankered waste imports were calculated based on cod strength as the volume of waste was known therefore a load could be calculated and converted into a pe using the assumption of 120 g cod per capita per day however tankered waste could not be associated only with septic waste as a proportion of the waste was of industrial origin pe nhs population size by general practice gp surgeries was calculated based on the sum of the number of people registered in each gp surgery located inside the wwtps catchment zone gp surgeries information such as gp code gp surgery name address including postcode and number of people registered were obtained from nhs digital https digital nhs uk briefly we have used the wwtps catchment maps and prana jagadeesan et al 2022 our in house developed r package to identify and retrieve the list of gp surgeries located inside each wwtps catchment zone and sum the total number of people registered in each gp surgeries using r an open source software for statistical computing and graphics comparison of pe nhs and ww data indicates close alignment in bath estimates 2 difference and relatively lower alignment in keynsham average 26 pe ww was therefore used in this study for pndl and intake calculations 2 6 prescription data we have used prana jagadeesan et al 2022 to calculate the prescription of pharmaceuticals for the wwtps catchments involved in this study prana utilises national level monthly prescription data published by nhs digital https digital nhs uk to aggregate normalise and map each prescribed pharmaceutical to its corresponding prescribing gp surgeries and postcode the prana package also features pranaviz a web based interactive tool to visualise and analyse prana generated dataset in real time pranaviz facilitates wider use with spatiotemporal and long term trends wwtp catchment maps were used to identify gp surgeries inside each catchment region to collect all relevant information for this study we have extracted the identified gp surgeries prescriptions of the pharmaceutical drugs of different pharmacological groups the data was normalised to the quantity kg month 1 of individual pharmaceutical compounds prescribed in each postcode inside the catchment zone average amount prescribed each day for that month mg day 1 was calculated from the monthly consumption quantity 2 7 population demographics methodology we estimated the residential population demographics age and sex of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp catchment by overlaying the wwtp catchment maps against the lower layer super output area lsoa lsoa 2011 and link general practice gp patients registration by individual lsoa level information nhs choices using r r core team jagadeesan et al 2022 lsoas are the england s lowest geographical area of practical use with an average population of 1500 people or 650 households population within the overlapping wwtp catchment and lsoas were summed to provide the population estimate if the overlap is not exact the proportion of the lsoa within the wwtp catchment i e overlap was calculated and multiplied with population of that lsoa and rounded up to an integer finally all the lsoa intersecting wholly and partly with the wwtp catchment were summed up to give the population demographics of the wwtp catchment comparing population demographics between the two sites figure s10 keynsham and bath had a similar percentage of 20 22 for 19 but comparing the older population keynsham had a slightly higher proportion in the age group 60 79 at 23 with bath reporting 16 perhaps unsurprisingly bath had a higher proportion of younger adults 20 29 around 23 with keynsham at 11 this is in line with the strong university presence in bath with two universities residing in the catchment area 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal variability in daily loads of pharmaceuticals in a 13 months intercity longitudinal study 3 1 1 nsaids and paracetamol increased loads of three out of four nsaids studied ibuprofen naproxen and ketoprofen in winter months from december until march were observed as seen in figs 2 5 ibuprofen in saltford was recorded at average 303 578 62 260 mg day in summer months vs 642 589 267 461 mg day in winter months naproxen was present in saltford at 296 314 48 462 mg day in summer months vs 637 407 380 601 mg day in winter months similar patterns were observed in keynsham with ibuprofen averaging at 52 778 27 956 mg day in summer months vs 100 346 42 932 mg day in winter months naproxen was present in keynsham at 66 056 95 951 mg day in summer months vs 1301 374 75 554 mg day in winter months the highest increase in usage over winter months dec march was observed for ibuprofen and naproxen on average 2 1 2 2 and 1 4 for ibuprofen naproxen in saltford and 1 9 2 0 and 1 0 for ibuprofen naproxen and ketoprofen in keynsham when compared to summer months jun aug interestingly metabolite daily loads for ibuprofen 2 hydroxyibuprofen stayed constant despite increased daily loads of ibuprofen in winter months which is likely linked with increased topical applications of ibuprofen during winter months and relatively constant level of oral administration of ibuprofen throughout the year this contrasts with o desmethylnaproxen naproxen s metabolite which decreased during winter months this indicates that naproxen is primarily applied as a topical medication in winter months with higher levels of oral application in summer months furthermore parent nsaid met ratios were higher in winter vs summer months for example in satford ibu ibuprofen 2 hydroxy 2 hydroxyibuprofen ratio denoted 2 8 1 2 in winter and 1 0 0 3 in summer and in keynsham 3 6 1 6 in winter and 1 2 0 5 in summer napr naproxen desmethyl desmethylnaproxen recorded in saltford 124 0 113 4 in winter and 16 5 9 2 in summer and in keynsham 168 5 110 2 in winter and 33 7 32 7 in summer this confirms a non metabolic entry route either because of topical application or via down the drain direct disposal of unused medicines 1 4 times increase in ketoprofen loads in saltford with no increase in keynsham was observed in winter but this increase was also associated with increased loads of its metabolite dihydroketoprofen which indicates an increased usage that involves oral administration and metabolism this is confirmed by higher ket ketoprofen dihydro dihydroketoprofen ratios in summer vs winter in saltford ket dihydro 3 8 5 8 in winter and 6 7 7 1 in summer with less pronounced difference in keynsham ket dihydro 2 6 3 7 in winter and 3 3 2 7 in summer interestingly prescription data does not follow this trend with stable prescribing for most nsaids in saltford as opposed to the other nsaids diclofenac s daily loads remained constant across sampling months 16 055 6269 mg day in saltford and 2731 1694 mg day in keynsham fig 5 dicl diclofenac 4 hydroxydicl 4 hydroxydisclofenac ratio also remained constant throughout the year 2 5 1 0 in saltford and 3 5 1 5 in keynsham indicating that there is no seasonality in diclofenac consumption it is important to note that there are some random exceedances in dicl 4 hydroxydicl which could indicate direct down the drain disposal of unconsumed dicl the most pronounced increase was recorded in saltford january dicl 4 hydroxydicl 74 7 and in keynsham january dicl 4 hydroxydicl 24 1 and 66 3 respectively a non opioid analgesic paracetamol was found at increased loads in winter months from december until march as seen in fig 6 it was recorded in saltford at average 4698 554 929 480 mg day in summer months vs 6821 760 2612 072 mg day in winter months lower temporal variability for paracetamol usage averaging at 1102 163 1107 426 mg day in summer months vs 1135 870 328 395 mg day in winter months was observed in keynsham 3 1 2 opioid analgesics several opioid analgesics and their metabolites were targeted in this study morphine normorphine dihydromorphine norcodeine codeine dihydrocodeine tramadol n desmethyltramadol o desmethyltramadol diamorphine 6 acetylmorphine relatively low seasonal variation in opioid analgesics tramadol codeine dihydrocodeine morphine remained constant across sampling months e g morphine 12 222 8698 mg day in saltford and 3132 2250 mg day in keynsham codeine 11 725 3520 mg day in saltford and 5947 6680 mg day in keynsham dihydrocodeine 11 509 37 558 mg day in saltford and 2378 1460 mg day in keynsham tramadol 32 060 11 916 mg day in saltford and 5543 5639 mg day in keynsham figs s5 and s6 diamorphine and its metabolites 6 acetylmorphine were hardly quantified throughout the study 3 1 3 nerve pain chronic pain agents as opposed to nsaids and non opioid analgesics nerve chronic pain agents gabapentin and pregabalin remained constant across sampling months gabapentin 20 733 5 16 688 0 mg day in saltford and 5351 8 10 431 6 mg day in keynsham and pregabalin 4762 4 1568 4 mg day in saltford and 792 2 964 3 mg day in keynsham figs s7 and s8 preg methylpreg ratio also remained constant throughout the year 1 9 0 6 in saltford and 2 6 1 1 in keynsham indicating that there is no seasonality in pregabalin s consumption 3 1 4 anaesthetics ketamine was the only anaesthetic surveyed in this study it remained relatively constant across sampling months 3342 7 830 8 mg day in saltford and 557 7 296 6 mg day in keynsham fig s9 a slight increase in loads was observed in the summer this was manifested with a drop with otherwise constant ketamine norketamine ratio through the 13 months study this indicates different non metabolic usage patterns rather than an increase in use of ketamine 3 2 population normalised daily loads to understand intercity usage patterns as shown in figs 2 5 daily loads of nsaids in keynsham are much lower than in bath this is directly linked with smaller population contributing to the wastewater samples indeed normalisation of daily nsaids loads to the population size shows similar average daily mass loads of all studied nsaids and their metabolites in both keynsham and bath as seen in fig 7 ibuprofen 3790 2122 7 and 3288 1 2161 1 and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 2564 1108 and 1774 7 1436 7 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively ketoprofen 131 9 106 5 and 139 3 166 6 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively naproxen 3555 4 2672 1 and 4161 2 3988 9 mg day 1000inh and o desmethylnaproxen 115 9 87 1 and 75 7 76 5 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively finally diclofenac denotes 138 8 54 2 and 125 8 84 6 mg day 1000inh and 4 hydroxydiclofenac 59 7 22 4 and 38 4 31 4 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively similarly to nsaids other pharmaceuticals showed comparable patterns fig 8 paracetamol 47 888 8 18 137 and 61 291 48 129 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively gabapentin 181 4 152 9 and 27 6 64 3 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pregabalin 41 2 13 5 and 42 7 46 1 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively ketamine 27 6 9 2 and 30 1 15 8 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively tramadol 280 5 98 4 and 293 1 300 8 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively morphine 47 49 73 36 and 40 6 92 0 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively codeine 85 4 46 2 and 201 6 321 1 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively dihydrocodeine 54 8 32 5 and 78 3 87 0 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively figs 7 and 8 clearly indicate that double normalisation using two key variables wastewater flows and population size in well understood wastewater catchments leads to similar pndls of studied pain treatment pharmaceuticals in two independent but geographically similar communities this shows key importance of wbe as a new epidemiology tool enabling fully quantitative assessment of community pain treatment interestingly there are no obvious differences in usage patterns in the context of different demographics in the two studies communities keynsham and bath have a similar percentage of 20 22 for 19 but comparing the older population keynsham has a slightly higher proportion in the age group 60 79 at 23 with bath reporting 16 perhaps unsurprisingly bath has a higher proportion of younger adults 20 29 around 23 with keynsham at 11 this is in line with the strong university presence in bath with two universities residing in the catchment area interestingly there is clearly higher prescription in keynsham that could reflect older population but this is not manifested in wastewater data 3 3 intake in an intercity study data normalisation to account for variable wastewater flows population size and human metabolism enabled direct comparison of wastewater derived consumption intake with nhs prescription indeed comparable population normalised intake estimates were observed in the two studied communities as seen in fig 9 two types of nsaids biomarkers pprs were used to calculate intake pharmaceutical itself and its metabolite table 2 this was to ensure that both internal administration and topical use of pharmaceuticals nsaids are captured as well as potential direct disposal of pharma is recognised 3 3 1 ibuprofen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion 20 59 2 56 and 25 64 3 60 and new cfs estimation 9 44 2 28 and 3 62 0 51 for ibuprofen and hydroxyibuprofen respectively table 2 detailed discussion of the review is available in si it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces or phase ii metabolism glucuronides urine samples were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis however as stated above the biliary excretion of unchanged drug and active phase ii metabolites represents 1 of the administered dose furthermore recovered dose parent compounds and identified metabolites accounted for 70 80 across several papers see si ii for details which confirms validity of pprs and their cfs the utilisation of newly established ibuprofen and hydroxyibuprofen s cfs resulted in the following intake estimates ibuprofen 35 777 20 151 and 31 040 20 534 and 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 9282 4035 and 6424 5235 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily ibuprofen prescription in the two studied catchments see section 2 6 for further information denoted 2664 230 and 5937 742 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively interestingly while wbe estimates in bath and keynsham show similar per capita consumption this is not the case with per capita prescription data per capita prescription in keynsham is twice as high as in bath furthermore much higher per capita intake was observed using wbe data vs prescription data this was expected as ibuprofen is an over the counter medication as wastewater data will represent both prescription and over the counter usage it is important to note that intake calculated using ppr parent compounds leads to likely overestimation of consumption due to a large proportion of nsaids that are used topically and therefore not subject to human metabolism intake calculated using metabolites as consumption markers leads to likely underestimation of nsaids usage due to the very same reason not accounting for topical application prescription data on the other hand indicates cumulative internal and topical usage but does not account for otc usage therefore it is recommended that the total usage of ibuprofen pndu is calculated to account for population normalised daily intake pndi calculated using metabolic ppr and topical application pndta reduced by pp linked with intake see eq 6 such an approach leads to comprehensive overview of ibuprofen usage pndu which is totalling at 12 089 4267 and 8916 5653 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pndi accounts for 9282 4035 and 6424 5235 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and pndta accounts for 2776 2168 and 2574 2125 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively which gives topical application percentage of 23 and 29 in bath and keynsham respectively this is in line with prescribing data that is at 39 3 and 33 4 for topical application in bath and keynsham respectively 3 3 2 naproxen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion for naproxen and o desmethylnaproxen 58 86 17 64 and 32 26 9 13 with only 9 of the administered dose unaccounted for and new cfs estimation 1 70 0 30 and 3 30 0 93 for naproxen and o desmethylnaproxen respectively table 2 it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces however only 5 of naproxen is excreted in faeces hence cfs are considered accurate utilisation of naproxen and o desmethylnaproxen resulted in the following intake estimates naproxen 6044 4568 and 7074 6726 and o desmethylnaproxen 383 289 and 250 254 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily naproxen prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 5539 437 and 9350 1012 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively similarly to ibuprofen wastewater data showed comparable naproxen usage in the two studied urban areas this was yet again not the case with prescription data as seen in fig 3 large quantities of naproxen are used especially in wintertime topically therefore without the first pass metabolic pathway it is therefore important to evaluate pndis alongside pndls pndls for naproxen were 3555 2672 and 4161 3989 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively with a characteristic peak in wintertime manifested by an increase of naproxen o desmethylnaproxen ratio fig 3 the total usage of naproxen pndu was estimated at 3713 2657 and 4209 4020 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pndis accounted for 383 289 and 250 254 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and pndta accounted for 3 330 2 739 and 3 963 4 016 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively which gives 90 and 94 topical application respectively this is in contrast with prescribing data that indicates no topical usage of naproxen and it might be linked with otc usage 3 3 3 ketoprofen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion for ketoprofen 5 67 3 45 and 70 31 14 45 without and with inclusion of cleaved ketoprofen from glucuronides 100 cleavage was assumed and new cfs estimation 17 64 10 77 and 1 42 0 29 for ketoprofen without and with glucuronides respectively table 2 it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces however ketoprofen is mostly excreted in urine 80 mainly as a conjugated glucuronic acid derivative phase ii metabolism has therefore been considered in calculations dihydroketoprofen is a minor metabolite and no information was found on its metabolism patterns hence it was not used for intake calculations utilisation of ketoprofen with and without an inclusion of glucuronides resulted in the following intake estimates ketoprofen no cleaved ketoprofen included 4507 26 649 and 2457 2958 and ketoprofen glucuronide ketoprofen cleaved 363 2145 and 198 238 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily ketoprofen prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 3 0 3 4 and 1 3 2 6 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively further work is required to fully understand the role of parent compound cleavage in the sewerage system unfortunately as ketoprofen is an otc medication it is not possible to compare outputs from the two cfs against prescription data however from our previous work with prescription pharmaceuticals e g citalopram and high resolution per postcode prescription data kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a it is apparent that excretion factors accounting for glucuronides need to be used to avoid overestimation of intake we are therefore proposing that cf of 5 67 is used with a note over uncertainty of the cleavage observed it is recommended that future analytical protocols include acid or enzymatic hydrolysis for full cleavage of parent analytes from glucuronides 3 3 4 diclofenac a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion 5 81 2 65 and 10 58 7 12 and new cfs estimation 17 21 7 85 and 8 97 6 04 for diclofenac and 4 hydroxydiclofenac respectively table 2 detailed discussion of the review is available in si it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces or phase ii metabolism glucuronides as seen in table s1 68 of the administered dose is unaccounted for urine samples were not subjected to acidic enzymatic hydrolysis calculated excretion factors are therefore likely underestimated and resulting cfs and intake data are overestimated further work is required to provide more accurate estimates of diclofenac s intake despite uncertainties around excretion of diclofenac and its metabolite 4 hydroxydiclofenac interesting trends were observed in the time series utilisation of newly established diclofenac and 4 hydroxydiclofenac s cfs resulted in the following intake estimates diclofenac 2362 966 and 2164 1466 and 4 hydroxydiclofenac 543 197 and 372 273 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily diclofenac prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 136 18 and 142 34 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively the total usage of diclofenac pndu was estimated at 656 214 and 470 332 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively pndi accounted for 543 197 and 372 273 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and pndta accounted for 107 49 and 103 73 mg day 1000inh which gives 16 and 22 of topical application in bath and keynsham respectively this is lower than prescribing data that is at 52 16 and 53 17 in bath and keynsham respectively and it might be linked with otc usage 3 3 5 acetaminophen a systematic literature review allowed for the establishment of new excretion for acetaminophen 3 55 0 92 and 55 54 5 42 without and with inclusion of cleaved acetaminophen from glucuronides 100 cleavage was assumed and new cfs estimation 28 17 7 30 and 1 80 0 18 for acetaminophen without and with glucuronides respectively table 2 it is important to note that all papers considered did not account for excretion in faeces however acetaminophen is mostly excreted in urine mainly as conjugated glucuronic acid derivative phase ii metabolism has therefore been considered in calculations utilisation of acetaminophen with and without an inclusion of glucuronides resulted in the following intake estimates acetaminophen no cleaved acetaminophen included 1334 038 530 330 and 1695 186 1375 631 and acetaminophen glucuronide acetaminophen cleaved 88 242 33 886 and 75 423 89 614 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively daily paracetamol prescription in the two studied catchments denoted 69 273 3323 and 144 878 13 183 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively as in the case of ketoprofen and in the absence of metabolic biomarkers paracetamol s intake estimation poses challenges paracetamol is mainly an over the counter medication and it is not possible to compare outputs from the two cfs used accounting for or disregarding phase ii metabolism against prescription data as mentioned earlier from our previous work with prescription pharmaceuticals e g citalopram and high resolution per postcode prescription data kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a it is apparent that excretion factors accounting for glucuronides need to be used to avoid overestimation of intake paracetamol s cf of 3 55 should be therefore recommended for usage to avoid overestimation of intake with a note over uncertainty of the cleavage observed interestingly when cf of 3 55 is used in this study paracetamol s intake is close to prescription data which seems to be an underestimation due to extensive over the counter use this sheds light on our limited understanding on the efficiency of glucuronides cleavage in sewers which needs resolving there is also a known issue of low stability of paracetamol in wastewater it is recommended that future analytical protocols include acid or enzymatic hydrolysis as part of sample preparation protocols to enable full cleavage of parent analytes from glucuronides as our protocols obeyed the same performance criteria throughout the course of the study the observed trends are informative however further work is required to provide cfs for paracetamol that account for both phase ii metabolism as well as stability data 3 3 6 other pain pharmaceuticals pregabalin s cfs were established in this study see table s7 for pregabalin and n methyl pregabalin excretion 71 7 and 0 9 and cfs 1 39 and 102 12 respectively from fig 10 it can be seen that using n methyl pregabalin leads to intake estimates 1968 651 and 1808 1825 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively aligned with prescription data 1018 64 and 2061 1175 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively cfs for tramadol codeine dihydrocodeine and morphine were taken from published literature the following intake estimates were obtained tramadol 904 363 and 967 1003 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively codeine 3041 913 and 8834 10 673 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively dihydrocodeine 120 45 and 211 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and morphine 133 98 and 218 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively wbe based estimates of tramadol 904 363 and 967 1003 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively were found to be aligned with prescription data in bath but they were lower than in keynsham 832 47 and 1500 172 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively similarly there was a good alignment of wbe estimated dihydrocodeine 120 45 and 211 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively with prescription 127 9 and 207 30 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively interestingly both codeine and morphine wbe levels were much higher codeine 3041 913 and 8834 10 673 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively and morphine 133 98 and 218 156 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively than prescription data codeine 1177 43 and 2394 236 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham and morphine 46 4 and 98 10 mg day 1000inh in bath and keynsham respectively there are several potential reasons codeine is also an over the counter medication so it is expected to see higher wbe vs prescription estimates in the case of morphine higher wbe estimates might be linked with the fact that morphine itself is a metabolite of several opioid analgesics including codeine and diamorphine interestingly no diamorphine was recorded in wastewater due to its low usage prescription estimated 1 0 6 g day 1000inh low stability and high metabolic transformation rates to morphine 3 4 limitations of the study this study focussed on a largescale longitudinal monitoring study of two urban areas with 180 samples collected and 300 samples processed throughout a 13 month monitoring study despite the wealth of data obtained and best alignment of sewer population and prescription data including a systematic literature review of cfs one needs to recognise its limitations these are areas for future work needed to provide best possible accuracy of measurements 1 stability of biomarkers in sewers 2 possible pp transformation via topical application the metabolism of drugs is mainly by metabolic enzyme cytochrome p450 and this enzyme is mainly found in liver the cyp450 actively metabolized drugs can then maintain high concentration when being applied on skin although some of the drug does enter the systemic circulation from the dermal microcirculation for example plasma level of diclofenac after topical administration is within 0 2 to 8 of those achieved after oral administration hagen and baker 2017 it is therefore assumed in this manuscript that no transformation of topically administered pps occurs however further work is required to fully evaluate this phenomenon the role and the extend of biomarker glucoronides cleavage it is assumed in this manuscript that full hydrolysis occurs in wastewater however further work is required to estimate percentage cleavage as well as to introduce sample preparation approaches enabling hydrolysis 3 5 conclusions this study presented results from an intensive 13 month monitoring programme undertaken in two urban areas in south west england keynsham a small commuter town and bath a city the study has shown a great potential of wbe and nhs prescription data triangulation in understanding pain treatment in two adjacent communities with strong apparent seasonal usage patterns of short pain medications vs less variable chronic pain treatment as well as the type of treatment used e g oral vs topical there are several important outcomes of this work 1 community wide usage of nsaids and paracetamol in the intercity study is population size and season driven with the highest usage recorded in winter months this contrasts with other pain pharmaceuticals especially those used for chronic pain where no limited seasonal usage was recorded 2 unmetabolized nsaids are to a large extent directly disposed of into the sewerage system bypassing metabolism due to their preferred topical application this is particularly apparent in winter months with naproxen showing the highest variability 3 parent pp metabolite analysis allows for tracking topical non metabolic application down the drain disposal of pharmaceuticals with frequent instances of direct disposal of nsaids into the sewerage system observed in this study 4 normalisation of biomarker loads to population size shows comparable estimates of biomarkers in the two cities confirming that the population size is the main driver of marker loads in wastewater 5 variable application patterns of pain pharmaceuticals make back calculation of intake more convoluted intake calculated using percentage excretion of parent nsaids will likely lead to overestimation as it is assumed that nsaids are subject to extensive metabolism this is not the case for topical applications intake calculated using percentage excretion of metabolites or parent compound as consumption markers leads to likely underestimation of nsaids usage due to contributions from topical application not being accounted for prescription data indicates cumulative internal and topical usage but the data ignores large proportion of over the counter usage therefore it is recommended that a combined approach allowing for estimation of total usage including and differentiating between topical application and oral administration is applied 6 cfs accounting for glucuronides should be applied in calculations to avoid overestimation of intake future sample preparation protocols will require hydrolysis acid or enzymatic to allow full cleavage of parent compounds from glucuronides credit authorship contribution statement andrew kannan conceptualization

15216,this study provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the application of gas liquid two phase flow with microbubbles in the feed stream to improve heat and mass transfer in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd processes for seawater desalination a swirl flow type microbubble generator mbg was installed at the feed side inlet of the dcmd module to investigate its effect on transmembrane flux the maximum improvement in the mbg assisted dcmd permeation flux was found to be approximately 18 at a lower feed temperature 40 c and optimal air flow rate 50 cc min and an optimal mbg geometry comprising a swirler a nozzle tip of diameter 2 mm and a diffuser at an angle of 30 the results were observed to be related to the number density of microbubbles less than 100 µm in size which plays an important role in improving heat and mass transfer in two phase flow in addition the simulation results based on conventional heat transfer correlations of bubbly flow underestimated the experimental results therefore this study also aims to propose and verify a new two phase flow heat transfer correlation the proposed correlation considers the effects of bubble size distribution

hydrophobic membranes to separate volatile molecules e g water vapor from feed solutions such as seawater brine or other types of industrial wastewater md processes have several potential advantages such as low operating temperature and hydraulic pressure rejection of nonvolatile solutes almost 100 low sensitivity to salt concentration and concentration polarization cp low footprint and maintenance requirements and potentially high permeation flux alkhudhiri et al 2012 al obaidani et al 2008 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2015 2016 several types of md configurations such as direct contact md dcmd air gap md agmd material gap md mgmd vacuum md vmd and sweep gas md sgmd are classified by the condensation scheme used within the module in the case of dcmd the temperature gradient results from evaporation and condensation at the liquid vapor interface on the feed and permeate sides of the membrane respectively as well as heat conduction via the membrane dcmd has attracted considerable attention owing to its simple configuration moreover it does not require an additional external condenser is easier to operate and has relatively high permeate flow rates several laboratory scale studies choi et al 2022 lee et al 2016 li et al 2021 tibi et al 2021 have investigated and verified its potential despite these advantages industrial applications of large scale dcmds have been restricted by major technical issues such as temperature polarization tp alsaadi et al 2014 martinez diez and vazquez gonzalez 1999 santoro et al 2017 direct contact between the hot feed and cold permeate produces a higher transmembrane flux compared with other md processes however the feed temperature varies along the length of the membrane owing to the high conductive heat lost through it consequently convective heat transfer through the boundary layer in both channels contributes significantly in reducing the tp in md processes furthermore the flow characteristics can be improved by increasing the flow rate or using a spacer in the stream channel of the module however these methods are unsuitable downstream of the multistage dcmd system francis et al 2014 kim et al 2015 2016 2019 lee et al 2015 2016 mengual et al 2004 shim et al 2014 from this perspective two phase flow of the feed solution could be a potentially more effective alternative for minimizing the tp effect downstream of the multistage dcmd process compared with the other two methods generally in membrane processes a gas liquid two phase flow is intentionally used to create hydrodynamic instabilities in the flow channels these instabilities disturb the tp effect enhance heat and mass transfer and remove biofouling from the membrane surfaces by increasing the surface shear stress of the flow gao et al 2017 meanwhile the channel velocity in the md module is generally considered to be less than 1 m s considering the mechanical strength of the membrane and the energy consumption efficiency al obaidani et al 2008 choi et al 2022 francis et al 2014 kim et al 2013 2015 2016 lee et al 2015 2016 li et al 2021 santoro et al 2017 furthermore the flow regime applied to the md primarily considers bubbly or slug flow chalgeri and jeong 2022 dong and hibiki 2018 elamvaluthi and srinivas 1984 fedotkin and zarudnev 1970 hetsroni et al 2009 from this perspective various studies have been conducted on md with two phase flow chang et al 2021 investigated the effect of air bubbling on a submerged vacuum membrane distillation s vmd system for desalination of seawater containing algal bloom they reported that the system subjected to 0 167 m s air bubbling exhibited superior and stabler flux flux improvement of 16 97 performance with a lower extent of fouling when compared with the non bubbling s vmd system chen et al 2014 demonstrated the benefits of using gas bubbling to enhance the heat transfer in the md process and calculated the heat transfer and tp coefficients wu et al 2015 reported an air bubbling enhanced vmd process based on experimental and theoretical studies and developed a mathematical model of the heat and mass transfer coefficients ding et al 2011 investigated the growth of fouling resistance through gas bubbling in concentrating the extract of traditional chinese medicine tcm by dcmd and suggested a method to maximize process productivity by optimizing gas bubbling conditions however the aforementioned studies primarily focused only on improvements induced by two phase flow i e delayed membrane fouling and or improved permeation flux from a theoretical perspective of a two phase flow model almost every constitutive relation depends on the flow regime because physical mechanisms vary with flow regime transitions therefore a comprehensive evaluation needs to be conducted to characterize the performance of two phase flow md systems and to distinguish the intensification effect of bubbles with different properties e g flow regime and size distribution in the case of bubbly flow the heat and mass transfer coefficient and flow instabilities depend on various factors including the size and spatial distribution of bubbles terminal velocity reynolds number and distance between bubbles bai et al 2008 elamvaluthi and srinivas 1984 fedotkin and zarudnev 1970 hetsroni et al 2009 kitagawa and murai 2013 wu et al 2022 the results of previous studies on bubbly flow demonstrated that smaller bubbles further increased the heat transfer coefficient moreover the bubble and the surrounding liquid interacted for a longer time owing to the decrease in the terminal velocity in addition the bubble density ratio increased significantly for a given air volume flow rate this increase had a considerable effect on forced convection and mixing effects in the thermal boundary layer kitagawa and murai 2013 kitagawa et al 2009 zimmerman 2021 although evidence exists that microbubbles effectively enhance heat and mass transfer studies on md applying microbubbles to the feed side are limited however further research is required to overcome several obstacles in the application of microbubbles for instance bubbles are typically generated using direct air injection or a simple venturi bubble generator in these cases the bubble size is generally a few millimeters at this bubble size a large amount of gas is required to increase bubble density in the boundary layer adjacent to the membrane chang et al 2021 chen et al 2014 ding et al 2011 wu et al 2015 furthermore module design requires a more reliable and accurately detailed model that considers microbubble characteristics e g size and number density this is essential for industrial application in large scale md systems although several empirical heat transfer correlations for two phase bubbly flows have been proposed most of them have been developed based on limited experimental data moreover the applicable range of correlations is limited bhagwat and ghajar 2017 chu and jones 1980 elamvaluthi and srinivas 1984 ghajar and tang 2010 groothuis and hendal 1959 kudirka et al 1965 rezkallah and sims 1989 this study demonstrates that none of the existing correlations can predict the micro bubbly flow heat transfer coefficient with sufficient accuracy therefore in this study experimental and theoretical investigations were simultaneously conducted thus the effect of the two phase flow of the feed solution mixed with microbubbles on the performance of the dcmd process was more comprehensively understood to generate microbubbles 100 µm on the feed stream in this study we developed an mbg the newly designed mbg was based on a swirl flow type mbg developed in our previous study kim et al 2019 and was applied to the existing dcmd system kim et al 2019 lee et al 2016 the performance of the proposed system was evaluated under various operating parameters mbg configurations and flow conditions to verify its feasibility for desalination applications to characterize the improvement in the transmembrane flux by microbubbles the bubble size distribution in the feed stream at the entrance of the dcmd module was scrutinized in addition this study assessed the convective heat transfer correlation for two phase flow of a feed solution mixed with microbubbles the correlation was used to achieve a more accurate prediction of heat and mass transfer enhancement finally the performance of the proposed correlation was compared with that of existing heat transfer models to demonstrate the validity of the model developed in this study 2 experimental setup 2 1 microbubble generator mbg a schematic fig 1 a and photograph fig 1b of the mbg designed and fabricated in this study are illustrated in fig 1 the mbg comprises a supply air line diffuser chamber swirler with four rectangular helical channels and convergent jet nozzle the mbg housing i e the diffuser chamber and convergent jet nozzle and swirler were manufactured from stainless steel sus304 the new design was based on the mbg developed in a previous study kim et al 2019 and it incorporated the following improvements i reduction of pumping cost owing to increased cross sectional area of the channel ii improvement in swirler durability owing to a change of filament material from polyethylene terephthalate glycol to stainless steel and iii inclusion of convergent jet nozzles of various diameters and angles to facilitate analysis of the effect of nozzle tip diameter and diffuser angle on mbg performance the mechanism of microbubbles generated from mbg has been described in detail by kim et al 2019 table 1 lists the key specifications of the mbg 2 2 mbg assisted dcmd experimental setup the mbg developed in this study was integrated into the dcmd system to evaluate its performance under various operating conditions detailed descriptions of the laboratory scale dcmd experimental setup using the mbg can be found elsewhere kim et al 2019 see also sections 1 1 and 1 2 of the supporting information for further discussion 2 3 microbubbles characterization in this study the bubble size distributions bsd were estimated using an image analysis technique fig 2 shows a schematic fig 2a and a photograph fig 2b of the experimental setup for characterizing the bubbles generated through the mbg to observe the flow pattern of microbubbles flowing through the feed channel of the dcmd module a transparent acrylic test module was manufactured the test module had an upward flow direction and dimensions of 15 mm length 1 5 mm width 200 mm height the test module was installed at a distance of approximately 250 mm upstream of the feed side to provide the same conditions as the mbg assisted dcmd experiment to capture the flow image of each corresponding operating condition a high speed charge coupled device ccd camera phantom miro c320 16g m phantom was focused on the center of the test module and a light emitting diode led light source was arranged in a backlight configuration to provide a uniformly illuminated background the field of view was 14 mm length 8 mm height and 20 images were randomly selected for image analysis for each operating condition after repeated capture at an imaging rate of 500 fps for 3 s section 1 3 of the supporting information provides a detailed procedure for obtaining flow patterns and bsds from digital images 2 4 experimental procedure to observe the effect on the microbubble in the feed side downstream of the multistage dcmd system lower inlet feed temperatures in the range of 40 60 c were considered in the experiments while the inlet permeate temperature was maintained at 25 c based on the results of our previous study kim et al 2019 the flow rates on the feed and permeate sides were maintained at 2 0 l min prior to conducting the main experiments experiments were performed to compare and evaluate the mbg assisted and mbg free dcmd performance under the above steady state operating conditions the main experiments were conducted using four procedures as shown in table 3 first the effect of the swirler on mbg assisted dcmd performance was investigated case ι the mbg was configured with a diffuser angle of 30 and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm in addition the steady state operating conditions of inlet feed temperature in the range of 40 60 c and an air flow rate of 50 cc min were maintained subsequently the experiments were conducted with nozzle tip diameters in the range of 2 4 mm as shown in table 3 this was done to obtain the optimal nozzle tip diameter while simultaneously determining the effect of the mbg nozzle tip configuration on the dcmd transmembrane flux case ⅱ here a swirler was used and the mbg was configured with a diffuser angle of 30 the steady state operating conditions of inlet feed temperature in the range of 40 60 c and an air flow rate of 50 cc min were maintained subsequently the experiments were conducted with diffuser angles in the range of 15 90 this was done to obtain the optimal diffuser angle for the mbg assisted dcmd process case iii the experiment was performed at a feed temperature of 40 c and air flow rate of 50 cc min finally the performance of the mbg assisted dcmd process was investigated at a feed temperature of 40 c and air flow rate in the range of 20 80 cc min case iv the optimal mbg configurations obtained in cases ι ii and iii were used for this final experiment elaborate descriptions of the results obtained in experimental cases iii and iv were obtained by quantifying and comparing the bubble size distribution and number density of microbubbles the obtained results were used as data for the development of a new two phase heat transfer correlation with microbubbles each experiment was performed under steady state conditions with feed and permeate temperature variations of less than 0 1 c for reproducibility and reliability all experimental cases were measured for 30 min and were performed more than three times the maximum deviation of the measured flux was less than 7 detailed performance indices to assess the performance of the dcmd process with and without mbg are provided in section 1 4 of the supporting information 3 heat transfer correlation model a theoretical investigation was performed to demonstrate the feasibility and operability of the mbg assisted dcmd system proposed in this study as shown in fig 3 heat and mass transfers occurred simultaneously across the boundary layers near the membrane surfaces and through the ptfe pp composite membrane in this study the knudsen diffusion molecular diffusion and poiseuille flow transition model i e dusty gas model were applied to demonstrate mass transfer through the composite membrane in the dcmd process ding et al 2002 lawson and lloyd 1997 lee et al 2015 2016 certain studies lee et al 2015 2016 have provided a detailed explanation of the theoretical models and the procedure adopted to obtain a solution for the heat and mass transfer through the composite membrane these studies have also reported on the transport behaviors of the bulk feed and permeate flows the present study primarily focuses on the assessment of convective heat transfer correlation i e nusselt number to achieve a more accurate prediction of heat and mass transfer across the boundary layer in a microbubble mixed channel in the two subsequent sections the following are discussed i the introduction of the existing heat transfer correlation of bubbly two phase flow and ii proposal of a new heat transfer correlation for the bubbly flow of the feed solution mixed with microbubbles based on i the newly proposed correlation aims to achieve a more accurate prediction of mbg assisted dcmd performance 3 1 conventional two phase flow heat transfer coefficient correlation this section introduces the correlation equation for predicting the heat transfer coefficient of the conventional two phase bubbly flow considered in this study dong et al 2018 developed an accurate robust and theoretically supported novel correlation for the two phase heat transfer enhancement ratio using the classic reynolds and chilton colburn analogies the newly developed correlation was verified using the existing data obtained over a wide range of test conditions in this context it must be noted that the notations 1ϕ and 2ϕ are used to identify single phase and two phase flows respectively table 2 summarizes the three conventional correlations to calculate the heat transfer enhancement ratio of two phase flow compared with single phase flow dong et al 2018 in this study the void fraction α correlation proposed by lockhart and martinelli which is applicable to the no slip condition was used as follows barreto et al 2015 1 α 1 1 0 28 1 x x 0 64 ρ g ρ l 0 36 μ l μ g 0 07 where x denotes the ratio of the gas mass flow rate to the total mass flow rate i e air quality ρ denotes the density μ denotes the dynamic viscosity the subscript l indicates the liquid phase and g indicates the gas phase the lockhart martinelli parameter x is defined as the square root of the liquid and gas pressure drop ratio due to friction and it is given by the following equation barreto et al 2015 2 x φ g 2 φ l 2 d p d z f g d p d z f m d p d z f l d p d z f m d p d z f l d p d z f g where φ g 2 and φ l 2 denote the gas and liquid multipliers of the two phase flow respectively the lockhart martinelli method is one of the simplest procedures for calculating the two phase flow pressure drop in this model the phases are considered to be flowing separately in the channel each occupying a given fraction of the channel cross section at different velocities lockhart and martinelli 1949 proposed tentative criteria for the transition of flows from one type to another the equations used to calculate parameter x under different flow conditions are expressed as 3 x t t 2 1 x x 1 8 ρ g ρ l μ l μ g 0 2 4 x l t 2 re g 0 8 c l c g 1 x x ρ g ρ l μ l μ g 5 x t l 2 re l 0 8 c l c g 1 x x ρ g ρ l μ l μ g 6 x l l 2 1 x x ρ g ρ l μ l μ g where the subscripts l and t denote laminar and turbulent flows respectively the left and right sides of the subscript denote the liquid and gas phases respectively the constants c l and c g for different flow conditions are given by lockhart and martinelli 1949 3 2 new two phase flow heat transfer coefficient correlation the two phase heat transfer coefficient correlations proposed in the previous section were developed based on a database collected through extensive literature research the accuracy and scalability of these correlations have been previously verified dong et al 2018 however to accurately predict the performance of the dcmd process mixed with microbubbles in the feed stream micro size characteristics with higher heat and mass transfer coefficients must be distinguished from typical bubbly flow characteristics therefore a new correlation that can predict the heat transfer coefficient in a two phase flow with microbubbles must be developed furthermore this correlation must be supported by the existing heat transfer correlation for bubbly flow therefore a new correlation can be expressed as follows 7 n u 2 ϕ n u 1 ϕ n e w η n u 2 ϕ n u 1 ϕ c o n v e n t i o n a l where η is the amplifier of the heat transfer in the microbubble flow regime it was demonstrated that microbubbles of size less than 100 μm result in further improvement of the heat and mass transfer in the feed solution kitagawa and murai 2013 kitagawa et al 2009 zimmerman 2021 moreover the effect was found to be noticeable at a smaller size and a higher number density of bubbles therefore the amplifier used in this study is defined as follows 8 η 1 m 1 β n p m where m n and p are empirical constants and β is the microbubble number density defined as the number of bubbles of size smaller than 100 µm present per 1 mm2 of membrane area although the size distribution of microbubbles should be considered to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations of flows with microbubbles its variety makes it difficult to introduce it into the simulations in this study it was assumed that the effects induced by bubbles of size smaller than 100 μm were identical regardless of their size for bubbly flow with millibubbles β 0 eq 8 is reduced to 9 lim β 0 η lim β 0 1 m 1 β n p m 1 this demonstrates that eq 9 has built in characteristics that match the limiting case of the two phase heat transfer enhancement ratio without microbubbles the microbubble number density was calculated by analyzing the bsd the bsd was obtained from the flow image observed through the acrylic test module that simulated the feed side channel of the dcmd module mentioned in section 2 3 the bubbles were assumed to be uniformly distributed along the flow direction moreover based on a database obtained under various parameters i e diffuser angle and air flow rate the empirical constants were calculated using the conjugate gradient method which is a powerful iterative numerical technique for solving linear and nonlinear inverse problems of parameter estimation 4 results and discussion 4 1 dcmd model verification to verify the theoretical approaches developed in this section the performance characteristics of the non mbg dcmd system were used these previously reported kim et al 2019 characteristics were examined with respect to the feed temperature and both the feed and permeate flow rates at the inlet of the dcmd module the steady state operating parameters were as follows the inlet feed temperature was in the range of 40 to 60 c both flow rates were in the range of 1 0 to 2 0 l min and the predicted mean permeate fluxes were consistent with the measured data fig 4 kim et al 2019 with an increase in the inlet feed temperature in the range of 40 to 60 c at a flow rate of 1 0 l min for both flows the measured permeate flux was observed to increase from 4 97 to 18 2 kg m2h in comparison the predicted permeate flux increased from 4 78 to 17 5 kg m2h similarly at a flow rate of 1 5 l min for both flows under the same inlet feed temperature conditions the measured permeate flux increased from 5 54 to 19 9 kg m2h whereas the predicted permeate flux increased from 5 46 to 20 8 kg m2h finally at a flow rate of 2 0 l min for both flows the measured permeate flux increased from 6 29 to 22 4 kg m2h while the predicted permeate flux increased from 5 95 to 23 1 kg m2h the measured and predicted data were generally consistent with each other with maximum relative deviations of 8 4 3 5 and 4 8 at flow rates of 1 0 l min 1 5 l min and 2 0 l min respectively 4 2 dcmd performance with mbg the results of our previous study kim et al 2019 on the mbg assisted dcmd system demonstrated that the mean transmembrane flux increased compared with the non mbg dcmd system owing to the increased driving force and reduced thermal boundary layer thickness on the feed side this can be attributed to the improved flow mixing and enhanced surface shear stress caused by the two phase flow induced by the mbg in this section the performance evaluation of the mbg assisted dcmd system is performed by considering various operating parameters to further investigate the effect of the two phase flow in the feed stream as described in section 2 4 the operating parameters comprise factors related to the mbg geometry e g swirler nozzle tip diameter and diffuser angle and operating conditions of the fluids e g inlet feed temperature and air flow rate the results measured herein were compared in detail with those of the non mbg dcmd experiments the mean permeate flux and its improved performance in the dcmd process with and without mbg are listed in table 3 in terms of each operating parameter detailed analyses and discussions of the physical characteristics of the results for each of the aforementioned operating parameters are presented in the subsequent four sections 4 2 1 effect of swirler this section discusses the effect of the swirler on the mean permeate flux enhancement of the dcmd process using mbg fig 5 shows the improvement ratio of the permeate flux with and without the swirler at a feed temperature of 40 60 c air flow rate of 50 cc min diffuser angle of 30 and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm the results indicated that the swirler improved the permeate flux for all operating conditions and the maximum enhancement ratio was approximately 18 at an inlet feed temperature of 40 c this can be attributed to the difference in the bubble generating mechanisms in the mbg with and without swirlers as the axially flowing feed solution enters the mbg a swirl is induced in it with velocity components in both the axial and azimuthal directions via a diffuser chamber with an enlarged diameter subsequently the feed velocity in both the axial and azimuthal directions is increased by the swirler the feed solution ejected from the swirler is converted into a high speed swirl flow in the region near the wall of the nozzle chamber this results in a combination of axial and azimuthal velocity gradients in the compressed air that is continuously injected into the nozzle chamber possessing only an axial component in other words the high speed swirling feed flow evolutes the basic shear instability kelvin helmholtz instability of compressed air into axial and azimuthal shear layers chigier and chervinsky 1967 kong et al 1999 liu et al 2015 consequently the feed stream and the air flow mix strongly in the nozzle chamber thereby promoting the disintegration of bubbles owing to the abrupt velocity gradient meanwhile the transmembrane flux decreases marginally when a non swirler mbg is used in the absence of a swirler the feed flow into the mbg is dominated by the axial component this significantly reduces the intensity of the turbulence of the feed solution in the nozzle chamber resulting in a negligible effect on the formation of the gas liquid velocity gradient consequently two phase flow results in a highly bubbly or slug flow bhagwat and ghajar 2014 ma et al 2018 suwankamnerd and wongwises 2015 this type of flow has the adverse effect of reducing the effective contact area of the feed with the membrane and thereby the permeation flux enhancement ratio thus the results indicate that the application of an mbg with a swirler can improve the permeation flux more effectively 4 2 2 effect of nozzle tip diameter the influence of nozzle tip diameter on the permeate flux enhancement achieved by the mbg is discussed in this section fig 6 shows the enhancement ratio of the permeate flux with respect to the nozzle tip diameter at an inlet feed temperature of 40 60 c air flow rate of 50 cc min and diffuser angle of 30 the enhanced permeation flux was more pronounced at a lower nozzle tip diameter the increase in flux peaked at approximately 18 at an inlet feed temperature of 40 c and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm the two phase flow mixed in the nozzle chamber enters through the venturi nozzle the relatively large bubbles are subjected to complex transport processes i e expansion deformation and break up caused by the pressure gradient and shear stress due to velocity fluctuations fujiwara et al 2007 huang et al 2021 in other words the high velocity of the nozzle throat and the pressure recovery of the fluid through the nozzle tip play an important role in the generation of high quality microbubbles fujiwara et al 2007 huang et al 2021 in our study the two phase flow velocities through the nozzle throat were 2 7 4 7 and 10 6 m s for nozzle tip diameters of 4 3 and 2 mm respectively moreover the feed velocity through the nozzle increased significantly as the nozzle tip diameter decreased resulting in an increase in the pressure gradient at the front and rear ends of the nozzle this increase in pressure gradient further accelerated the disintegration of bubbles however a decrease in the nozzle tip diameter can lead to bubble coalescence which reduces the number density of microbubbles and simultaneously generates large bubbles unyaphan et al 2017 investigated the sauter mean diameter of the bubbles produced from a venturi type bubble generator considering three nozzle tip diameters i e 2 5 and 8 mm they found that the nozzle tip with a diameter of 5 mm produced the smallest bubble with a sauter mean diameter of 197 μm at a velocity of 5 6 m s in the nozzle throat moreover it was reported that a nozzle tip with a diameter of 2 mm suppressed the formation of smaller bubbles due to bubble coalescence in addition a significant pressure drop owing to the small nozzle tip diameter can also affect the overall system efficiency therefore selecting the appropriate nozzle tip diameter is essential this can be achieved through an economic evaluation that considers the operating environment of an actual mbg application all the results in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 clearly indicate that the enhancement ratio of the transmembrane flux is higher at lower inlet feed temperatures this is consistent with the results obtained in our previous study and can be attributed to the variation in the dissolved air and shear stress with respect to the feed temperature keepaiboon and wongwises 2015 kim et al 2019 song et al 2019 vlyssides et al 2004 clearly an mbg using a low temperature feed solution can generate more microbubbles therefore in the following the experiments were performed at an inlet feed temperature of 40 c which was the lowest temperature considered in this study 4 2 3 effect of diffuser angle the diffuser angle is considered to be a determining factor in the performance of venturi type bubble generators lee et al 2019 li et al 2017 sparrow et al 2009 fig 7 shows the transmembrane flux enhancement ratio with respect to the diffuser angle in the range of 15 to 90 at an inlet feed temperature of 40 60 c air flow rate of 50 cc min and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm the permeate flux enhancement ratio increases as the diffuser angle increases from 15 to 30 and its maximum value was achieved at an air flow rate of 50 cc min however a further increase in the diffuser angle from 30 to 90 resulted in a marginal reduction of the enhancement ratio from approximately 18 to 11 this can be demonstrated by the number of microbubbles in the feed stream kim et al 2019 kitagawa and murai 2013 in terms of the bubble collapse mechanism through mbg the change in the diffuser angle is strongly related to the wake flow formed near the diffuser channel wall lee et al 2019 sparrow et al 2009 sparrow et al 2009 reported that a nozzle with diffuser angles greater than 7 induce wake flows between the main flow and the wall of the diffuser channel this creates a very strong recirculation zone with intensive bubble collapse at the nozzle exit bubbles entering through the nozzle throat are significantly decelerated by the recirculation flow resulting in improved air liquid interaction and consequently bubble collapse as the diffuser angle increased from 15 to 30 in our study the bubbles flowing near the diffuser channel wall were more strongly influenced by the wake flow meanwhile when the diffuser angle exceeded 30 the diffuser channel expanded sharply resulting in the migration of a large proportion of bubbles the bubbles migrated toward the bulk feed stream instead of flowing through the diffuser channel walls where a recirculation area exists this indicates that the bubbles were not fully affected by the wake flow and consequently bubble collapse did not occur properly the experiments described in section 2 4 were performed to analyze the bubble size distributions bsd fig 8 in the feed stream for diffuser angles ranging from 15 to 90 bubbles were mostly distributed in the size range of 20 30 µm at all diffuser angles meanwhile the results clearly indicate that a diffuser angle of 30 leads to a higher peak and narrower bandwidth in the bsd profile resulting in the highest number density of microbubbles the number of microbubbles of size less than 100 μm was measured at diffuser angles ranging from 15 to 90 the corresponding values were approximately 151 176 163 and 144 at diffuser angles of 15 30 45 and 90 respectively as the diffuser angle increased from 15 to 30 the number of microbubbles increased and then gradually decreased after peaking at a diffuser angle of 30 this behavior was similar to the trend of the mean transmembrane flux in conclusion the diffuser angle is a determining factor in the bsd produced from mbg 4 2 4 effect of air flow rate the air flow is another significant factor impacting the two phase flow characteristics induced by the mbg therefore under the optimal mbg configurations i e with swirler diffuser angle of 30 and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm demonstrated in sections 4 2 1 4 2 3 the improvement ratio of the transmembrane flux was measured at different air flow rates as shown in fig 9 the inlet feed temperature and flow rates of both flows were kept constant at 40 c and 2 0 l min respectively during the measurement as the air flow rate increased from 20 to 50 cc min the improvement ratio increased linearly from 12 to 18 however a further increase in the air flow rate from 50 to 80 cc min resulted in a reduction from 18 to 7 these results were similar to those obtained in our previous study kim et al 2019 to analyze the above results fig 9 bsds for air flow rates ranging from 20 to 80 cc min were obtained by performing the same experiments described in section 4 2 3 fig 10 bubbles were mostly distributed in the size range of 20 30 µm at all air flow rates with a rare difference in the bandwidth of the bsd profile meanwhile the peak of the bsd at an air flow rate of 50 cc min was the highest among all cases indicating that this air flow rate resulted in the highest number density of microbubbles the number of microbubbles of size less than 100 μm was approximately 156 167 176 149 and 129 at air flow rates of 20 40 50 60 and 80 cc min respectively furthermore the trend of a marginal decrease after peaking at an air flow rate of 50 cc min is consistent with the trend exhibited by the number of microbubbles and mean transmembrane flux excessive air flow rates above 50 cc min induced more coalescence of bubbles consequently the number density of microbubbles the effective contact area of the feed with the membrane and thereby the permeation flux improvement ratio was adversely affected it can be concluded that air flow rate is a crucial factor that has a significant impact on mbg performance thus it should be strictly controlled to achieve a high quality size distribution of microbubbles 4 3 development of a new two phase flow heat transfer correlation the experimental results in section 4 2 clearly demonstrate that the number density of microbubbles in the feed stream has an additional effect on the heat and mass transfer in the dcmd process in the present study mathematical models of the dcmd process were developed by considering the two heat transfer correlations mentioned in section 3 these models are used to demonstrate the effect of feed stream microbubbles on dcmd performance the two heat transfer correlations are described as follows i the conventional two phase flow heat transfer correlation which can be expressed as a function of the velocity of the fluid and the void fraction and ii the new two phase heat transfer correlation which considers the effect of microbubble size in the feed stream the mean permeation fluxes predicted through each correlation were compared to the experimental data the fluxes were evaluated in terms of the diffuser angles and air flow rates by keeping the other operating parameters constant as in the previous case 4 3 1 performance evaluation using conventional correlations in this section we predict the mean permeate flux through the dcmd mathematical model using the conventional two phase flow heat transfer correlations and compare it with the experimental data obtained in sections 4 2 3 and 4 2 4 fig 11 presents the mean permeate flux measured and predicted with respect to the diffuser angle fig 11a and the air flow rate fig 11b using conventional two phase flow heat transfer correlations as shown in table 2 here the triangle symbol denote the experimental data and the square symbol denote the prediction data the results clearly demonstrate that none of the existing correlations can satisfactorily predict the transmembrane flux enhancement ratio for measured data of two phase flows in the feed stream in the experimental results related to the diffuser angle the highest permeate flux 6 38 kg m2h was achieved at a diffuser angle of 30 as described in section 4 2 3 and the flux decreased marginally above 30 this proved to be related to the number density of the microbubbles according to the diffuser angle as previously described however the predicted results underestimated the experimental data and remained constant regardless of the diffuser angle however the experimental results with respect to the amount of air injected into the mbg as described in section 4 2 4 achieved the highest transmembrane flux at an air flow rate of 50 cc min which is associated with the number density of microbubbles an increase in the air flow rate increases the void fraction in the bubbly flow which is expected to increase the heat transfer coefficient and consequently the permeation flux despite deviations in the predicted data according to the correlations all of them predicted the tendency of permeate flux to increase with the air flow rate however it should be noted that these also underestimate the experimental data and are not consistent with the trend of the experimental results for the air flow rate in other words these results indicate that the mbg assisted dcmd performance cannot be accurately predicted with the existing heat transfer correlation for bubbly flow and the development of a new correlation that considers the effect of the microbubble size is required 4 3 2 performance and applicability analysis using newly developed correlation based on the aforementioned sections 4 2 3 and 4 2 4 experimental results the convective heat transfer coefficient at the feed boundary layer was obtained from the procedures described in section 3 the obtained heat transfer coefficient was correlated with the microbubble characteristics via multiple linear regressions the three parameters i e m n and p in eq 8 were estimated using the conjugate gradient method kim et al 2009 to obtain the heat transfer coefficients for the two phase flow with microbubbles in the feed stream the best fit between the measured and predicted permeate fluxes was achieved at the parameters of m 2 n 2 64 and p 4 55 with an r squared value of 0 935 for all experimental data except for an air flow rate of 80 cc min this is discussed in the paragraphs below the predicted values of the mean permeate flux obtained through the dcmd mathematical model using the new two phase flow heat transfer correlations were compared with the experimental data fig 12 the model predictions of the permeate flux were consistent with the measured results and the relative error for all cases was less than 1 except for the results at an air flow rate of 80 cc min thus it can be concluded that bubbly flow with microbubbles can achieve a higher gas liquid interface area compared to highly bubbly flow resulting in higher heat and mass transfer coefficients moreover the enhancement of the surface shear stress of the flow owing to the enhanced turbulence further reduces the feed side thermal boundary layer thickness thereby facilitating the mitigation of the tp effect in other words the tendency of the permeation flux to decrease after peaking at a specific diffuser angle 30 or air flow rate 50 cc min was accurately predicted this indicates that the new correlation adequately represents the characteristics of microbubbles in the bubbly flow meanwhile the predicted transmembrane flux for an air flow rate of 80 cc min overestimated the measured data and the relative error was significantly higher than that in other cases i e approximately 7 independent of the heat transfer coefficient of the feed stream this may have an adverse effect to be precise it might reduce the contact area between the feed solution and the membrane by increasing the number of relatively large bubbles at 80 cc min that is the performance of dcmd with two phase flow in the feed stream is affected not only by the number density of microbubbles but also by the suppression of milli bubbles in summary the results of this study provide a reasonable method to predict the performance of the dcmd process with microbubbles in the feed stream based on this additional research is required to develop correlations capable of making robust and reliable predictions under various operating conditions in addition mbg that can generate high quality microbubbles while being economical in the dcmd process must also be developed finally to generate higher quality microbubbles i e smaller and narrower bsd and higher number density in a dcmd process the effect of microbubbles in a two phase flow must be considered to predict the heat transfer coefficient 4 conclusions in this study the performance enhancement of the dcmd process with microbubbles in the feed stream was identified both experimentally and theoretically in terms of transmembrane flux a dcmd system equipped with a swirl flow type mbg was developed to scrutinize its performance for various mbg configurations i e swirler nozzle tip diameter and diffuser angle and operating parameters i e feed temperature and air flow rate the maximum enhancement of the mean transmembrane flux by mbg was achieved for the mbg configuration with a swirler nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm and diffuser angle of 30 this highest enhancement ratio was approximately 18 and was obtained at the lowest feed temperature 40 c and optimal air flow rate 50 cc min the results demonstrate that mbg assisted dcmd performance is highly correlated with the number of microbubbles of size smaller than 100 µm the conventional heat transfer correlation for bubbly flow could not predict the experimentally obtained results because it ignored the microbubble effect therefore in this study the characteristics of the feed side microbubbles in the dcmd system were quantified via the microbubble number density from the bsd and a new heat transfer correlation of two phase flow with microbubbles was proposed and verified the results of this study can be utilized as basic data for designing multistage dcmd systems in real world applications which should be considered more practically when generating higher quality microbubbles and or designing large scale systems meanwhile to ensure the reliability and practicality of mbg assisted practical applications further studies might be essential to reveal more detailed flow characteristics of microbubbles smaller than 100 µm and their effect on mbg assisted dcmd performance in terms of heat and mass transfer and establish a universal correlation that enables robust and reliable predictions under various operating conditions

15216,this study provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the application of gas liquid two phase flow with microbubbles in the feed stream to improve heat and mass transfer in direct contact membrane distillation dcmd processes for seawater desalination a swirl flow type microbubble generator mbg was installed at the feed side inlet of the dcmd module to investigate its effect on transmembrane flux the maximum improvement in the mbg assisted dcmd permeation flux was found to be approximately 18 at a lower feed temperature 40 c and optimal air flow rate 50 cc min and an optimal mbg geometry comprising a swirler a nozzle tip of diameter 2 mm and a diffuser at an angle of 30 the results were observed to be related to the number density of microbubbles less than 100 µm in size which plays an important role in improving heat and mass transfer in two phase flow in addition the simulation results based on conventional heat transfer correlations of bubbly flow underestimated the experimental results therefore this study also aims to propose and verify a new two phase flow heat transfer correlation the proposed correlation considers the effects of bubble size distribution

hydrophobic membranes to separate volatile molecules e g water vapor from feed solutions such as seawater brine or other types of industrial wastewater md processes have several potential advantages such as low operating temperature and hydraulic pressure rejection of nonvolatile solutes almost 100 low sensitivity to salt concentration and concentration polarization cp low footprint and maintenance requirements and potentially high permeation flux alkhudhiri et al 2012 al obaidani et al 2008 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2015 2016 several types of md configurations such as direct contact md dcmd air gap md agmd material gap md mgmd vacuum md vmd and sweep gas md sgmd are classified by the condensation scheme used within the module in the case of dcmd the temperature gradient results from evaporation and condensation at the liquid vapor interface on the feed and permeate sides of the membrane respectively as well as heat conduction via the membrane dcmd has attracted considerable attention owing to its simple configuration moreover it does not require an additional external condenser is easier to operate and has relatively high permeate flow rates several laboratory scale studies choi et al 2022 lee et al 2016 li et al 2021 tibi et al 2021 have investigated and verified its potential despite these advantages industrial applications of large scale dcmds have been restricted by major technical issues such as temperature polarization tp alsaadi et al 2014 martinez diez and vazquez gonzalez 1999 santoro et al 2017 direct contact between the hot feed and cold permeate produces a higher transmembrane flux compared with other md processes however the feed temperature varies along the length of the membrane owing to the high conductive heat lost through it consequently convective heat transfer through the boundary layer in both channels contributes significantly in reducing the tp in md processes furthermore the flow characteristics can be improved by increasing the flow rate or using a spacer in the stream channel of the module however these methods are unsuitable downstream of the multistage dcmd system francis et al 2014 kim et al 2015 2016 2019 lee et al 2015 2016 mengual et al 2004 shim et al 2014 from this perspective two phase flow of the feed solution could be a potentially more effective alternative for minimizing the tp effect downstream of the multistage dcmd process compared with the other two methods generally in membrane processes a gas liquid two phase flow is intentionally used to create hydrodynamic instabilities in the flow channels these instabilities disturb the tp effect enhance heat and mass transfer and remove biofouling from the membrane surfaces by increasing the surface shear stress of the flow gao et al 2017 meanwhile the channel velocity in the md module is generally considered to be less than 1 m s considering the mechanical strength of the membrane and the energy consumption efficiency al obaidani et al 2008 choi et al 2022 francis et al 2014 kim et al 2013 2015 2016 lee et al 2015 2016 li et al 2021 santoro et al 2017 furthermore the flow regime applied to the md primarily considers bubbly or slug flow chalgeri and jeong 2022 dong and hibiki 2018 elamvaluthi and srinivas 1984 fedotkin and zarudnev 1970 hetsroni et al 2009 from this perspective various studies have been conducted on md with two phase flow chang et al 2021 investigated the effect of air bubbling on a submerged vacuum membrane distillation s vmd system for desalination of seawater containing algal bloom they reported that the system subjected to 0 167 m s air bubbling exhibited superior and stabler flux flux improvement of 16 97 performance with a lower extent of fouling when compared with the non bubbling s vmd system chen et al 2014 demonstrated the benefits of using gas bubbling to enhance the heat transfer in the md process and calculated the heat transfer and tp coefficients wu et al 2015 reported an air bubbling enhanced vmd process based on experimental and theoretical studies and developed a mathematical model of the heat and mass transfer coefficients ding et al 2011 investigated the growth of fouling resistance through gas bubbling in concentrating the extract of traditional chinese medicine tcm by dcmd and suggested a method to maximize process productivity by optimizing gas bubbling conditions however the aforementioned studies primarily focused only on improvements induced by two phase flow i e delayed membrane fouling and or improved permeation flux from a theoretical perspective of a two phase flow model almost every constitutive relation depends on the flow regime because physical mechanisms vary with flow regime transitions therefore a comprehensive evaluation needs to be conducted to characterize the performance of two phase flow md systems and to distinguish the intensification effect of bubbles with different properties e g flow regime and size distribution in the case of bubbly flow the heat and mass transfer coefficient and flow instabilities depend on various factors including the size and spatial distribution of bubbles terminal velocity reynolds number and distance between bubbles bai et al 2008 elamvaluthi and srinivas 1984 fedotkin and zarudnev 1970 hetsroni et al 2009 kitagawa and murai 2013 wu et al 2022 the results of previous studies on bubbly flow demonstrated that smaller bubbles further increased the heat transfer coefficient moreover the bubble and the surrounding liquid interacted for a longer time owing to the decrease in the terminal velocity in addition the bubble density ratio increased significantly for a given air volume flow rate this increase had a considerable effect on forced convection and mixing effects in the thermal boundary layer kitagawa and murai 2013 kitagawa et al 2009 zimmerman 2021 although evidence exists that microbubbles effectively enhance heat and mass transfer studies on md applying microbubbles to the feed side are limited however further research is required to overcome several obstacles in the application of microbubbles for instance bubbles are typically generated using direct air injection or a simple venturi bubble generator in these cases the bubble size is generally a few millimeters at this bubble size a large amount of gas is required to increase bubble density in the boundary layer adjacent to the membrane chang et al 2021 chen et al 2014 ding et al 2011 wu et al 2015 furthermore module design requires a more reliable and accurately detailed model that considers microbubble characteristics e g size and number density this is essential for industrial application in large scale md systems although several empirical heat transfer correlations for two phase bubbly flows have been proposed most of them have been developed based on limited experimental data moreover the applicable range of correlations is limited bhagwat and ghajar 2017 chu and jones 1980 elamvaluthi and srinivas 1984 ghajar and tang 2010 groothuis and hendal 1959 kudirka et al 1965 rezkallah and sims 1989 this study demonstrates that none of the existing correlations can predict the micro bubbly flow heat transfer coefficient with sufficient accuracy therefore in this study experimental and theoretical investigations were simultaneously conducted thus the effect of the two phase flow of the feed solution mixed with microbubbles on the performance of the dcmd process was more comprehensively understood to generate microbubbles 100 µm on the feed stream in this study we developed an mbg the newly designed mbg was based on a swirl flow type mbg developed in our previous study kim et al 2019 and was applied to the existing dcmd system kim et al 2019 lee et al 2016 the performance of the proposed system was evaluated under various operating parameters mbg configurations and flow conditions to verify its feasibility for desalination applications to characterize the improvement in the transmembrane flux by microbubbles the bubble size distribution in the feed stream at the entrance of the dcmd module was scrutinized in addition this study assessed the convective heat transfer correlation for two phase flow of a feed solution mixed with microbubbles the correlation was used to achieve a more accurate prediction of heat and mass transfer enhancement finally the performance of the proposed correlation was compared with that of existing heat transfer models to demonstrate the validity of the model developed in this study 2 experimental setup 2 1 microbubble generator mbg a schematic fig 1 a and photograph fig 1b of the mbg designed and fabricated in this study are illustrated in fig 1 the mbg comprises a supply air line diffuser chamber swirler with four rectangular helical channels and convergent jet nozzle the mbg housing i e the diffuser chamber and convergent jet nozzle and swirler were manufactured from stainless steel sus304 the new design was based on the mbg developed in a previous study kim et al 2019 and it incorporated the following improvements i reduction of pumping cost owing to increased cross sectional area of the channel ii improvement in swirler durability owing to a change of filament material from polyethylene terephthalate glycol to stainless steel and iii inclusion of convergent jet nozzles of various diameters and angles to facilitate analysis of the effect of nozzle tip diameter and diffuser angle on mbg performance the mechanism of microbubbles generated from mbg has been described in detail by kim et al 2019 table 1 lists the key specifications of the mbg 2 2 mbg assisted dcmd experimental setup the mbg developed in this study was integrated into the dcmd system to evaluate its performance under various operating conditions detailed descriptions of the laboratory scale dcmd experimental setup using the mbg can be found elsewhere kim et al 2019 see also sections 1 1 and 1 2 of the supporting information for further discussion 2 3 microbubbles characterization in this study the bubble size distributions bsd were estimated using an image analysis technique fig 2 shows a schematic fig 2a and a photograph fig 2b of the experimental setup for characterizing the bubbles generated through the mbg to observe the flow pattern of microbubbles flowing through the feed channel of the dcmd module a transparent acrylic test module was manufactured the test module had an upward flow direction and dimensions of 15 mm length 1 5 mm width 200 mm height the test module was installed at a distance of approximately 250 mm upstream of the feed side to provide the same conditions as the mbg assisted dcmd experiment to capture the flow image of each corresponding operating condition a high speed charge coupled device ccd camera phantom miro c320 16g m phantom was focused on the center of the test module and a light emitting diode led light source was arranged in a backlight configuration to provide a uniformly illuminated background the field of view was 14 mm length 8 mm height and 20 images were randomly selected for image analysis for each operating condition after repeated capture at an imaging rate of 500 fps for 3 s section 1 3 of the supporting information provides a detailed procedure for obtaining flow patterns and bsds from digital images 2 4 experimental procedure to observe the effect on the microbubble in the feed side downstream of the multistage dcmd system lower inlet feed temperatures in the range of 40 60 c were considered in the experiments while the inlet permeate temperature was maintained at 25 c based on the results of our previous study kim et al 2019 the flow rates on the feed and permeate sides were maintained at 2 0 l min prior to conducting the main experiments experiments were performed to compare and evaluate the mbg assisted and mbg free dcmd performance under the above steady state operating conditions the main experiments were conducted using four procedures as shown in table 3 first the effect of the swirler on mbg assisted dcmd performance was investigated case ι the mbg was configured with a diffuser angle of 30 and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm in addition the steady state operating conditions of inlet feed temperature in the range of 40 60 c and an air flow rate of 50 cc min were maintained subsequently the experiments were conducted with nozzle tip diameters in the range of 2 4 mm as shown in table 3 this was done to obtain the optimal nozzle tip diameter while simultaneously determining the effect of the mbg nozzle tip configuration on the dcmd transmembrane flux case ⅱ here a swirler was used and the mbg was configured with a diffuser angle of 30 the steady state operating conditions of inlet feed temperature in the range of 40 60 c and an air flow rate of 50 cc min were maintained subsequently the experiments were conducted with diffuser angles in the range of 15 90 this was done to obtain the optimal diffuser angle for the mbg assisted dcmd process case iii the experiment was performed at a feed temperature of 40 c and air flow rate of 50 cc min finally the performance of the mbg assisted dcmd process was investigated at a feed temperature of 40 c and air flow rate in the range of 20 80 cc min case iv the optimal mbg configurations obtained in cases ι ii and iii were used for this final experiment elaborate descriptions of the results obtained in experimental cases iii and iv were obtained by quantifying and comparing the bubble size distribution and number density of microbubbles the obtained results were used as data for the development of a new two phase heat transfer correlation with microbubbles each experiment was performed under steady state conditions with feed and permeate temperature variations of less than 0 1 c for reproducibility and reliability all experimental cases were measured for 30 min and were performed more than three times the maximum deviation of the measured flux was less than 7 detailed performance indices to assess the performance of the dcmd process with and without mbg are provided in section 1 4 of the supporting information 3 heat transfer correlation model a theoretical investigation was performed to demonstrate the feasibility and operability of the mbg assisted dcmd system proposed in this study as shown in fig 3 heat and mass transfers occurred simultaneously across the boundary layers near the membrane surfaces and through the ptfe pp composite membrane in this study the knudsen diffusion molecular diffusion and poiseuille flow transition model i e dusty gas model were applied to demonstrate mass transfer through the composite membrane in the dcmd process ding et al 2002 lawson and lloyd 1997 lee et al 2015 2016 certain studies lee et al 2015 2016 have provided a detailed explanation of the theoretical models and the procedure adopted to obtain a solution for the heat and mass transfer through the composite membrane these studies have also reported on the transport behaviors of the bulk feed and permeate flows the present study primarily focuses on the assessment of convective heat transfer correlation i e nusselt number to achieve a more accurate prediction of heat and mass transfer across the boundary layer in a microbubble mixed channel in the two subsequent sections the following are discussed i the introduction of the existing heat transfer correlation of bubbly two phase flow and ii proposal of a new heat transfer correlation for the bubbly flow of the feed solution mixed with microbubbles based on i the newly proposed correlation aims to achieve a more accurate prediction of mbg assisted dcmd performance 3 1 conventional two phase flow heat transfer coefficient correlation this section introduces the correlation equation for predicting the heat transfer coefficient of the conventional two phase bubbly flow considered in this study dong et al 2018 developed an accurate robust and theoretically supported novel correlation for the two phase heat transfer enhancement ratio using the classic reynolds and chilton colburn analogies the newly developed correlation was verified using the existing data obtained over a wide range of test conditions in this context it must be noted that the notations 1ϕ and 2ϕ are used to identify single phase and two phase flows respectively table 2 summarizes the three conventional correlations to calculate the heat transfer enhancement ratio of two phase flow compared with single phase flow dong et al 2018 in this study the void fraction α correlation proposed by lockhart and martinelli which is applicable to the no slip condition was used as follows barreto et al 2015 1 α 1 1 0 28 1 x x 0 64 ρ g ρ l 0 36 μ l μ g 0 07 where x denotes the ratio of the gas mass flow rate to the total mass flow rate i e air quality ρ denotes the density μ denotes the dynamic viscosity the subscript l indicates the liquid phase and g indicates the gas phase the lockhart martinelli parameter x is defined as the square root of the liquid and gas pressure drop ratio due to friction and it is given by the following equation barreto et al 2015 2 x φ g 2 φ l 2 d p d z f g d p d z f m d p d z f l d p d z f m d p d z f l d p d z f g where φ g 2 and φ l 2 denote the gas and liquid multipliers of the two phase flow respectively the lockhart martinelli method is one of the simplest procedures for calculating the two phase flow pressure drop in this model the phases are considered to be flowing separately in the channel each occupying a given fraction of the channel cross section at different velocities lockhart and martinelli 1949 proposed tentative criteria for the transition of flows from one type to another the equations used to calculate parameter x under different flow conditions are expressed as 3 x t t 2 1 x x 1 8 ρ g ρ l μ l μ g 0 2 4 x l t 2 re g 0 8 c l c g 1 x x ρ g ρ l μ l μ g 5 x t l 2 re l 0 8 c l c g 1 x x ρ g ρ l μ l μ g 6 x l l 2 1 x x ρ g ρ l μ l μ g where the subscripts l and t denote laminar and turbulent flows respectively the left and right sides of the subscript denote the liquid and gas phases respectively the constants c l and c g for different flow conditions are given by lockhart and martinelli 1949 3 2 new two phase flow heat transfer coefficient correlation the two phase heat transfer coefficient correlations proposed in the previous section were developed based on a database collected through extensive literature research the accuracy and scalability of these correlations have been previously verified dong et al 2018 however to accurately predict the performance of the dcmd process mixed with microbubbles in the feed stream micro size characteristics with higher heat and mass transfer coefficients must be distinguished from typical bubbly flow characteristics therefore a new correlation that can predict the heat transfer coefficient in a two phase flow with microbubbles must be developed furthermore this correlation must be supported by the existing heat transfer correlation for bubbly flow therefore a new correlation can be expressed as follows 7 n u 2 ϕ n u 1 ϕ n e w η n u 2 ϕ n u 1 ϕ c o n v e n t i o n a l where η is the amplifier of the heat transfer in the microbubble flow regime it was demonstrated that microbubbles of size less than 100 μm result in further improvement of the heat and mass transfer in the feed solution kitagawa and murai 2013 kitagawa et al 2009 zimmerman 2021 moreover the effect was found to be noticeable at a smaller size and a higher number density of bubbles therefore the amplifier used in this study is defined as follows 8 η 1 m 1 β n p m where m n and p are empirical constants and β is the microbubble number density defined as the number of bubbles of size smaller than 100 µm present per 1 mm2 of membrane area although the size distribution of microbubbles should be considered to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations of flows with microbubbles its variety makes it difficult to introduce it into the simulations in this study it was assumed that the effects induced by bubbles of size smaller than 100 μm were identical regardless of their size for bubbly flow with millibubbles β 0 eq 8 is reduced to 9 lim β 0 η lim β 0 1 m 1 β n p m 1 this demonstrates that eq 9 has built in characteristics that match the limiting case of the two phase heat transfer enhancement ratio without microbubbles the microbubble number density was calculated by analyzing the bsd the bsd was obtained from the flow image observed through the acrylic test module that simulated the feed side channel of the dcmd module mentioned in section 2 3 the bubbles were assumed to be uniformly distributed along the flow direction moreover based on a database obtained under various parameters i e diffuser angle and air flow rate the empirical constants were calculated using the conjugate gradient method which is a powerful iterative numerical technique for solving linear and nonlinear inverse problems of parameter estimation 4 results and discussion 4 1 dcmd model verification to verify the theoretical approaches developed in this section the performance characteristics of the non mbg dcmd system were used these previously reported kim et al 2019 characteristics were examined with respect to the feed temperature and both the feed and permeate flow rates at the inlet of the dcmd module the steady state operating parameters were as follows the inlet feed temperature was in the range of 40 to 60 c both flow rates were in the range of 1 0 to 2 0 l min and the predicted mean permeate fluxes were consistent with the measured data fig 4 kim et al 2019 with an increase in the inlet feed temperature in the range of 40 to 60 c at a flow rate of 1 0 l min for both flows the measured permeate flux was observed to increase from 4 97 to 18 2 kg m2h in comparison the predicted permeate flux increased from 4 78 to 17 5 kg m2h similarly at a flow rate of 1 5 l min for both flows under the same inlet feed temperature conditions the measured permeate flux increased from 5 54 to 19 9 kg m2h whereas the predicted permeate flux increased from 5 46 to 20 8 kg m2h finally at a flow rate of 2 0 l min for both flows the measured permeate flux increased from 6 29 to 22 4 kg m2h while the predicted permeate flux increased from 5 95 to 23 1 kg m2h the measured and predicted data were generally consistent with each other with maximum relative deviations of 8 4 3 5 and 4 8 at flow rates of 1 0 l min 1 5 l min and 2 0 l min respectively 4 2 dcmd performance with mbg the results of our previous study kim et al 2019 on the mbg assisted dcmd system demonstrated that the mean transmembrane flux increased compared with the non mbg dcmd system owing to the increased driving force and reduced thermal boundary layer thickness on the feed side this can be attributed to the improved flow mixing and enhanced surface shear stress caused by the two phase flow induced by the mbg in this section the performance evaluation of the mbg assisted dcmd system is performed by considering various operating parameters to further investigate the effect of the two phase flow in the feed stream as described in section 2 4 the operating parameters comprise factors related to the mbg geometry e g swirler nozzle tip diameter and diffuser angle and operating conditions of the fluids e g inlet feed temperature and air flow rate the results measured herein were compared in detail with those of the non mbg dcmd experiments the mean permeate flux and its improved performance in the dcmd process with and without mbg are listed in table 3 in terms of each operating parameter detailed analyses and discussions of the physical characteristics of the results for each of the aforementioned operating parameters are presented in the subsequent four sections 4 2 1 effect of swirler this section discusses the effect of the swirler on the mean permeate flux enhancement of the dcmd process using mbg fig 5 shows the improvement ratio of the permeate flux with and without the swirler at a feed temperature of 40 60 c air flow rate of 50 cc min diffuser angle of 30 and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm the results indicated that the swirler improved the permeate flux for all operating conditions and the maximum enhancement ratio was approximately 18 at an inlet feed temperature of 40 c this can be attributed to the difference in the bubble generating mechanisms in the mbg with and without swirlers as the axially flowing feed solution enters the mbg a swirl is induced in it with velocity components in both the axial and azimuthal directions via a diffuser chamber with an enlarged diameter subsequently the feed velocity in both the axial and azimuthal directions is increased by the swirler the feed solution ejected from the swirler is converted into a high speed swirl flow in the region near the wall of the nozzle chamber this results in a combination of axial and azimuthal velocity gradients in the compressed air that is continuously injected into the nozzle chamber possessing only an axial component in other words the high speed swirling feed flow evolutes the basic shear instability kelvin helmholtz instability of compressed air into axial and azimuthal shear layers chigier and chervinsky 1967 kong et al 1999 liu et al 2015 consequently the feed stream and the air flow mix strongly in the nozzle chamber thereby promoting the disintegration of bubbles owing to the abrupt velocity gradient meanwhile the transmembrane flux decreases marginally when a non swirler mbg is used in the absence of a swirler the feed flow into the mbg is dominated by the axial component this significantly reduces the intensity of the turbulence of the feed solution in the nozzle chamber resulting in a negligible effect on the formation of the gas liquid velocity gradient consequently two phase flow results in a highly bubbly or slug flow bhagwat and ghajar 2014 ma et al 2018 suwankamnerd and wongwises 2015 this type of flow has the adverse effect of reducing the effective contact area of the feed with the membrane and thereby the permeation flux enhancement ratio thus the results indicate that the application of an mbg with a swirler can improve the permeation flux more effectively 4 2 2 effect of nozzle tip diameter the influence of nozzle tip diameter on the permeate flux enhancement achieved by the mbg is discussed in this section fig 6 shows the enhancement ratio of the permeate flux with respect to the nozzle tip diameter at an inlet feed temperature of 40 60 c air flow rate of 50 cc min and diffuser angle of 30 the enhanced permeation flux was more pronounced at a lower nozzle tip diameter the increase in flux peaked at approximately 18 at an inlet feed temperature of 40 c and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm the two phase flow mixed in the nozzle chamber enters through the venturi nozzle the relatively large bubbles are subjected to complex transport processes i e expansion deformation and break up caused by the pressure gradient and shear stress due to velocity fluctuations fujiwara et al 2007 huang et al 2021 in other words the high velocity of the nozzle throat and the pressure recovery of the fluid through the nozzle tip play an important role in the generation of high quality microbubbles fujiwara et al 2007 huang et al 2021 in our study the two phase flow velocities through the nozzle throat were 2 7 4 7 and 10 6 m s for nozzle tip diameters of 4 3 and 2 mm respectively moreover the feed velocity through the nozzle increased significantly as the nozzle tip diameter decreased resulting in an increase in the pressure gradient at the front and rear ends of the nozzle this increase in pressure gradient further accelerated the disintegration of bubbles however a decrease in the nozzle tip diameter can lead to bubble coalescence which reduces the number density of microbubbles and simultaneously generates large bubbles unyaphan et al 2017 investigated the sauter mean diameter of the bubbles produced from a venturi type bubble generator considering three nozzle tip diameters i e 2 5 and 8 mm they found that the nozzle tip with a diameter of 5 mm produced the smallest bubble with a sauter mean diameter of 197 μm at a velocity of 5 6 m s in the nozzle throat moreover it was reported that a nozzle tip with a diameter of 2 mm suppressed the formation of smaller bubbles due to bubble coalescence in addition a significant pressure drop owing to the small nozzle tip diameter can also affect the overall system efficiency therefore selecting the appropriate nozzle tip diameter is essential this can be achieved through an economic evaluation that considers the operating environment of an actual mbg application all the results in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 clearly indicate that the enhancement ratio of the transmembrane flux is higher at lower inlet feed temperatures this is consistent with the results obtained in our previous study and can be attributed to the variation in the dissolved air and shear stress with respect to the feed temperature keepaiboon and wongwises 2015 kim et al 2019 song et al 2019 vlyssides et al 2004 clearly an mbg using a low temperature feed solution can generate more microbubbles therefore in the following the experiments were performed at an inlet feed temperature of 40 c which was the lowest temperature considered in this study 4 2 3 effect of diffuser angle the diffuser angle is considered to be a determining factor in the performance of venturi type bubble generators lee et al 2019 li et al 2017 sparrow et al 2009 fig 7 shows the transmembrane flux enhancement ratio with respect to the diffuser angle in the range of 15 to 90 at an inlet feed temperature of 40 60 c air flow rate of 50 cc min and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm the permeate flux enhancement ratio increases as the diffuser angle increases from 15 to 30 and its maximum value was achieved at an air flow rate of 50 cc min however a further increase in the diffuser angle from 30 to 90 resulted in a marginal reduction of the enhancement ratio from approximately 18 to 11 this can be demonstrated by the number of microbubbles in the feed stream kim et al 2019 kitagawa and murai 2013 in terms of the bubble collapse mechanism through mbg the change in the diffuser angle is strongly related to the wake flow formed near the diffuser channel wall lee et al 2019 sparrow et al 2009 sparrow et al 2009 reported that a nozzle with diffuser angles greater than 7 induce wake flows between the main flow and the wall of the diffuser channel this creates a very strong recirculation zone with intensive bubble collapse at the nozzle exit bubbles entering through the nozzle throat are significantly decelerated by the recirculation flow resulting in improved air liquid interaction and consequently bubble collapse as the diffuser angle increased from 15 to 30 in our study the bubbles flowing near the diffuser channel wall were more strongly influenced by the wake flow meanwhile when the diffuser angle exceeded 30 the diffuser channel expanded sharply resulting in the migration of a large proportion of bubbles the bubbles migrated toward the bulk feed stream instead of flowing through the diffuser channel walls where a recirculation area exists this indicates that the bubbles were not fully affected by the wake flow and consequently bubble collapse did not occur properly the experiments described in section 2 4 were performed to analyze the bubble size distributions bsd fig 8 in the feed stream for diffuser angles ranging from 15 to 90 bubbles were mostly distributed in the size range of 20 30 µm at all diffuser angles meanwhile the results clearly indicate that a diffuser angle of 30 leads to a higher peak and narrower bandwidth in the bsd profile resulting in the highest number density of microbubbles the number of microbubbles of size less than 100 μm was measured at diffuser angles ranging from 15 to 90 the corresponding values were approximately 151 176 163 and 144 at diffuser angles of 15 30 45 and 90 respectively as the diffuser angle increased from 15 to 30 the number of microbubbles increased and then gradually decreased after peaking at a diffuser angle of 30 this behavior was similar to the trend of the mean transmembrane flux in conclusion the diffuser angle is a determining factor in the bsd produced from mbg 4 2 4 effect of air flow rate the air flow is another significant factor impacting the two phase flow characteristics induced by the mbg therefore under the optimal mbg configurations i e with swirler diffuser angle of 30 and nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm demonstrated in sections 4 2 1 4 2 3 the improvement ratio of the transmembrane flux was measured at different air flow rates as shown in fig 9 the inlet feed temperature and flow rates of both flows were kept constant at 40 c and 2 0 l min respectively during the measurement as the air flow rate increased from 20 to 50 cc min the improvement ratio increased linearly from 12 to 18 however a further increase in the air flow rate from 50 to 80 cc min resulted in a reduction from 18 to 7 these results were similar to those obtained in our previous study kim et al 2019 to analyze the above results fig 9 bsds for air flow rates ranging from 20 to 80 cc min were obtained by performing the same experiments described in section 4 2 3 fig 10 bubbles were mostly distributed in the size range of 20 30 µm at all air flow rates with a rare difference in the bandwidth of the bsd profile meanwhile the peak of the bsd at an air flow rate of 50 cc min was the highest among all cases indicating that this air flow rate resulted in the highest number density of microbubbles the number of microbubbles of size less than 100 μm was approximately 156 167 176 149 and 129 at air flow rates of 20 40 50 60 and 80 cc min respectively furthermore the trend of a marginal decrease after peaking at an air flow rate of 50 cc min is consistent with the trend exhibited by the number of microbubbles and mean transmembrane flux excessive air flow rates above 50 cc min induced more coalescence of bubbles consequently the number density of microbubbles the effective contact area of the feed with the membrane and thereby the permeation flux improvement ratio was adversely affected it can be concluded that air flow rate is a crucial factor that has a significant impact on mbg performance thus it should be strictly controlled to achieve a high quality size distribution of microbubbles 4 3 development of a new two phase flow heat transfer correlation the experimental results in section 4 2 clearly demonstrate that the number density of microbubbles in the feed stream has an additional effect on the heat and mass transfer in the dcmd process in the present study mathematical models of the dcmd process were developed by considering the two heat transfer correlations mentioned in section 3 these models are used to demonstrate the effect of feed stream microbubbles on dcmd performance the two heat transfer correlations are described as follows i the conventional two phase flow heat transfer correlation which can be expressed as a function of the velocity of the fluid and the void fraction and ii the new two phase heat transfer correlation which considers the effect of microbubble size in the feed stream the mean permeation fluxes predicted through each correlation were compared to the experimental data the fluxes were evaluated in terms of the diffuser angles and air flow rates by keeping the other operating parameters constant as in the previous case 4 3 1 performance evaluation using conventional correlations in this section we predict the mean permeate flux through the dcmd mathematical model using the conventional two phase flow heat transfer correlations and compare it with the experimental data obtained in sections 4 2 3 and 4 2 4 fig 11 presents the mean permeate flux measured and predicted with respect to the diffuser angle fig 11a and the air flow rate fig 11b using conventional two phase flow heat transfer correlations as shown in table 2 here the triangle symbol denote the experimental data and the square symbol denote the prediction data the results clearly demonstrate that none of the existing correlations can satisfactorily predict the transmembrane flux enhancement ratio for measured data of two phase flows in the feed stream in the experimental results related to the diffuser angle the highest permeate flux 6 38 kg m2h was achieved at a diffuser angle of 30 as described in section 4 2 3 and the flux decreased marginally above 30 this proved to be related to the number density of the microbubbles according to the diffuser angle as previously described however the predicted results underestimated the experimental data and remained constant regardless of the diffuser angle however the experimental results with respect to the amount of air injected into the mbg as described in section 4 2 4 achieved the highest transmembrane flux at an air flow rate of 50 cc min which is associated with the number density of microbubbles an increase in the air flow rate increases the void fraction in the bubbly flow which is expected to increase the heat transfer coefficient and consequently the permeation flux despite deviations in the predicted data according to the correlations all of them predicted the tendency of permeate flux to increase with the air flow rate however it should be noted that these also underestimate the experimental data and are not consistent with the trend of the experimental results for the air flow rate in other words these results indicate that the mbg assisted dcmd performance cannot be accurately predicted with the existing heat transfer correlation for bubbly flow and the development of a new correlation that considers the effect of the microbubble size is required 4 3 2 performance and applicability analysis using newly developed correlation based on the aforementioned sections 4 2 3 and 4 2 4 experimental results the convective heat transfer coefficient at the feed boundary layer was obtained from the procedures described in section 3 the obtained heat transfer coefficient was correlated with the microbubble characteristics via multiple linear regressions the three parameters i e m n and p in eq 8 were estimated using the conjugate gradient method kim et al 2009 to obtain the heat transfer coefficients for the two phase flow with microbubbles in the feed stream the best fit between the measured and predicted permeate fluxes was achieved at the parameters of m 2 n 2 64 and p 4 55 with an r squared value of 0 935 for all experimental data except for an air flow rate of 80 cc min this is discussed in the paragraphs below the predicted values of the mean permeate flux obtained through the dcmd mathematical model using the new two phase flow heat transfer correlations were compared with the experimental data fig 12 the model predictions of the permeate flux were consistent with the measured results and the relative error for all cases was less than 1 except for the results at an air flow rate of 80 cc min thus it can be concluded that bubbly flow with microbubbles can achieve a higher gas liquid interface area compared to highly bubbly flow resulting in higher heat and mass transfer coefficients moreover the enhancement of the surface shear stress of the flow owing to the enhanced turbulence further reduces the feed side thermal boundary layer thickness thereby facilitating the mitigation of the tp effect in other words the tendency of the permeation flux to decrease after peaking at a specific diffuser angle 30 or air flow rate 50 cc min was accurately predicted this indicates that the new correlation adequately represents the characteristics of microbubbles in the bubbly flow meanwhile the predicted transmembrane flux for an air flow rate of 80 cc min overestimated the measured data and the relative error was significantly higher than that in other cases i e approximately 7 independent of the heat transfer coefficient of the feed stream this may have an adverse effect to be precise it might reduce the contact area between the feed solution and the membrane by increasing the number of relatively large bubbles at 80 cc min that is the performance of dcmd with two phase flow in the feed stream is affected not only by the number density of microbubbles but also by the suppression of milli bubbles in summary the results of this study provide a reasonable method to predict the performance of the dcmd process with microbubbles in the feed stream based on this additional research is required to develop correlations capable of making robust and reliable predictions under various operating conditions in addition mbg that can generate high quality microbubbles while being economical in the dcmd process must also be developed finally to generate higher quality microbubbles i e smaller and narrower bsd and higher number density in a dcmd process the effect of microbubbles in a two phase flow must be considered to predict the heat transfer coefficient 4 conclusions in this study the performance enhancement of the dcmd process with microbubbles in the feed stream was identified both experimentally and theoretically in terms of transmembrane flux a dcmd system equipped with a swirl flow type mbg was developed to scrutinize its performance for various mbg configurations i e swirler nozzle tip diameter and diffuser angle and operating parameters i e feed temperature and air flow rate the maximum enhancement of the mean transmembrane flux by mbg was achieved for the mbg configuration with a swirler nozzle tip diameter of 2 mm and diffuser angle of 30 this highest enhancement ratio was approximately 18 and was obtained at the lowest feed temperature 40 c and optimal air flow rate 50 cc min the results demonstrate that mbg assisted dcmd performance is highly correlated with the number of microbubbles of size smaller than 100 µm the conventional heat transfer correlation for bubbly flow could not predict the experimentally obtained results because it ignored the microbubble effect therefore in this study the characteristics of the feed side microbubbles in the dcmd system were quantified via the microbubble number density from the bsd and a new heat transfer correlation of two phase flow with microbubbles was proposed and verified the results of this study can be utilized as basic data for designing multistage dcmd systems in real world applications which should be considered more practically when generating higher quality microbubbles and or designing large scale systems meanwhile to ensure the reliability and practicality of mbg assisted practical applications further studies might be essential to reveal more detailed flow characteristics of microbubbles smaller than 100 µm and their effect on mbg assisted dcmd performance in terms of heat and mass transfer and establish a universal correlation that enables robust and reliable predictions under various operating conditions

15217,release of contaminants from aquifers at the coastal area is of increasing concern but remains unclear due to the complex groundwater dynamics and hydrochemistry specifically frequently occurring seawater intrusion and the subsequent engineering measures of managed aquifer recharge mar could alter the groundwater regime which might affect the fate and behaviors of contaminants in this work we investigated the transport and transformation of arsenic as in the coastal aquifer at the scenario of seawater intrusion followed by the injection based mar process results showed that seawater intrusion induced 10 3 more release of aqueous as in aquifers which was attributed to the competitive desorption as a result of elevated anion concentration and ph and the reduction of as v to as iii due to the reduced redox potential and enriched as reducing bacteria furthermore seawater intrusion inhibited the recrystallization of iron hydr oxides and instead facilitated its conversion to iron sulfide with lower affinity to as the subsequent mar introduced oxygenated recharge water into aquifers and increased the redox potential leading to the dissolution of iron sulfide followed by formation of amorphous iron hydr oxides however the competitive desorption of as with rich hco3 under increased ph dominated continuous increase in the aquifer aqueous as during mar process a constructed numerical model for describing as transport based on the experimental data showed that as transported along the interface between seawater and freshwater and mar enhanced the release of as and expanded the spread range of as our findings reveal that both seawater intrusion and subsequent mar could cause the release transport and transformation of as which provides new insight on the understanding of geochemical process of as in coastal aquifers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic coastal aquifer managed aquifer recharge seawater intrusion transport and transformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquifer in the coastal area is a particular concern since it is prone to accumulate contaminants and provides linkage for contaminants to circulate between terrestrial and marine environments ward et al 2020 arsenic as is one of the most frequently occurred contaminants in coastal aquifers which has been widely documented worldwide e g bangladesh mihajlov et al 2020 vietnam sø et al 2018 and china rodríguez lado et al 2013 the release of as from aquifer sediment to groundwater is intimately associated with environmental conditions such as redox potential ph and ionic strength as well as the biogeochemical cycling of ambient minerals and organic matters fakhreddine et al 2021 morelli et al 2017 iron hydr oxides are efficient scavengers of dissolved as in aquifers and the reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides is considered to be the primary driver of as release from aquifers under reducing conditions lemonte et al 2017 the reduction of arsenate as v to arsenite as iii which has a lower affinity for iron hydr oxides is also a cause of as mobilization herbel et al 2006 whereas a number of studies have been conducted on as mobilization in the inland aquifers the transport and transformation of as in coastal aquifers remained unclear due to the complexed hydrochemical and hydrodynamic characteristics seawater intrusion frequently occurs in the coastal area as a result of sea level rise and groundwater overexploitation which intensively alters the native geochemical characteristics of aquifers ruffine et al 2021 substantial anions and cations such as cl so4 2 na and ca2 from seawater could flow into the coastal aquifers during seawater intrusion and compete with contaminants for adsorption sites as reported in the gerania mountains greece anions from seawater contributed to the release of as from iron hydr oixdes in coastal aquifers papazotos et al 2020 typically seawater intrusion could increase the ph of aquifers as seawater contains ample basic cation dehbandi et al 2019 suggested that desorption of as from the surface of iron hydr oxides under alkaline conditions was the main cause of as mobilization in the seawater intruded aquifer in sirjan plain iran moreover seawater intrusion could interfere the redox cycling of iron hydr oxides thus affect the mobilization of as field investigations suggested that seawater intrusion could provide required electron acceptors such as so4 2 for bacterial sulfate reduction and promote reduction of iron hydr oxides thus facilitated as mobilization johnston et al 2010 nath et al 2008 conversely lemonte et al 2017 and buschmann et al 2009 found elevated so4 2 in seawater can competitively inhibit dissimilatory reduction of iron hydr oxides consequently less as was released in seawater intruded aquifers so far the effect of seawater intrusion on the release or mobilization of as has been successively studied but there are still knowledge gaps in the mechanism of as mobilization in seawater intruded aquifers moreover the transport and transformation of as under seawater intrusion scenario remained unknown in order to restrain seawater intrusion managed aquifer recharge mar has been widely adopted by recharging freshwater into the coastal aquifer hussain et al 2019 injection of exogenous substances will alter the hydrochemistry of aquifers and affect the mobilization of as the most frequent sources of freshwater are rainwater and reclaimed water which often contain elevated dissolved oxygen or organic matters than groundwater fakhreddine et al 2021 these redox reactive substances could directly or indirectly participate in geochemical reactions related to as release for example neil et al 2014 reported that sodium chloride in recharge water faster phase transformation of iron hydr oxide to hematite while wu et al 2019 found the dissolved organic maters in recharge water inhibited secondary iron hydr oxide precipitation like seawater intrusion mar could also change the ph of aquifer and introduce competitive anions into aquifer which may cause the release of as the coupling of these two complex processes will further aggravate the release of as however the mobilization of as by mar following seawater intrusion scenario has not been investigated yet in this study we conducted a two dimensional experiment to dynamically simulate the effect of seawater intrusion followed by mar on the release transport and transformation of as in coastal aquifers the aim was to provide a detailed description for understanding the geochemical processes of as bearing mineral under the dynamics of seawater intrusion and mar based on the experimental data we also developed a conceptual and numerical model of as mobilization and migration that could be applied to similar geological settings 2 material and methods 2 1 sample preparation clean fine sand was collected from the inshore area of shanghai city china to simulate sediment in uncontaminated aquifer table 1 the as bearing ore was obtained from nearby shanghai city the ore was ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve after air drying then homogeneously mixed with clean fine sand in a mass ratio of 1 1 to simulate sediment in as contaminated aquifer table 1 the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer was measured via falling head method klute 1986 seawater was collected from inshore sea of shanghai city and preserved anaerobic table 1 deoxygenated ultrapure water obtained by purging ultrapure water with n2 was adopted to simulate freshwater reclaimed water collected from the sunken reclaimed water plant in jiading district shanghai city was used as recharge water table 1 2 2 reactor design the experiment was conducted in a rectangular flow tank made of 10 mm thick plexiglass the internal dimension of the device was 60 cm length 40 cm height 5 cm width the conceptual schematic and digital photo of the device are shown in figs 1 a and s1 the flow tank consisted of three distinct chambers a central flow chamber containing sediments and two constant head reservoirs containing seawater and freshwater respectively the constant head reservoirs were separated from the sediments chamber by porous partition covered with 2000 mesh gauze in the sediment region three layers were

as contaminated aquifer and the upper layer was filled to 35 cm from the as contaminated aquifer with uncontaminated sediment upper aquifer the design simulates the release of as from organic matter rich and weakly permeable sediments into the overlying and underlying aquifers that is common in pleistocene holocene aquifer systems wang et al 2019 the sediments were carefully extruded during packing to ensure the homogeneity of porous structure a total of 16 solution samplers rhizon mom 5 cm 0 15 μm pore size rhizosphere research products and concomitant eh sensors were installed in sediments region as shown in fig 1 the sediments were sampled by a syringe equipped with 2 mm inner diameter needle an evenly perforated pipe with an inner diameter of 10 mm was arranged in the bottom right corner of the as contaminated aquifer 5 cm from the freshwater reservoir and the pipe was wrapped with 2000 mesh gauze to prevent sediment entry a small pump was used to inject recharge water into the tank through this pipe 2 3 experimental details the whole experiment was divided into two phases seawater intrusion phase day 1 to day 20 and aquifer recharge phase day 21 to day 40 before the experiment the seawater reservoir was separated from the chamber by a water shutoff wall freshwater was supplied at 1 0 ml min to the chamber from constant head freshwater reservoirs until the water head reached specified value and saturated the sediments for 5 h then seawater was injected at 0 5 ml min and the water head was kept 1 5 cm lower than the chamber luyun jr et al 2011 the seawater intrusion phase began with the removal of the water shutoff wall and the aquifer recharge phase began with the injection of recharge water into the tank and the mass flow rate of recharge water was controlled at 5 10 7 kg s the ratio of groundwater flow to recharge flow is within the realistic range dillon et al 2019 water samples and effluent were collected periodically and the aquifer sediment was collected at the last day of each phase to visually obtain the information about the distribution of seawater seawater was dyed with a red food color allura red c i number 16035 2

studied with transmission electron microscopy tem fei talos f200x thermo fisher waltham massachusetts america equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds 2 5 numerical model darcy s law eq 1 was employed to generalize the process of water flow movement which can be described as follow 1 ϵ p ρ t ρ u q m where ϵ p is the porosity t is the time u is the velocity q m is the fluid source positive

calibrated numerical simulation parameters are shown in table s1 the distribution of seawater as and dissolved oxygen was obtained by two dimensional finite element simulations 3 results 3 1 dynamic hydrochemistry of aquifers seawater intrusion and subsequent mar shifted the hydrochemistry of aquifers based on the color of liquid sample fig s2 and the hydrochemistry parameters of aquifers fig 2 the aquifers were divided into the area only affected by seawater the area affected first by seawater and then by recharge water and the area only affected by recharge water fig 1b the former two were also referred to as seawater intruded area and the latter was non seawater intruded area the dynamic change of aquifer hydrochemistry is shown in fig 2 waterflooding reduced the eh of aquifers in the seawater intrusion phase the eh of uncontaminated bottom and upper aquifers decreased to approximately 600 mv within first several days fig 2a and g while as contaminated aquifer showed a slower rate of decline fig 2d due to originally higher content of oxidizing components such as no3 so4 2 and do table 1 meanwhile as shown in fig s3b clear peak of oxidative quinones with excitation maxima at around 250 nm and emission maxima at around 440 nm was observed in the fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectra of the dissolved organic matter in as contaminated aquifer cory et al 2005 which also contributed to the slow decline of eh in as contaminated aquifer the injection of oxygenated recharge water obviously increased the eh of uncontaminated aquifers for example the eh at the location near the injection point could rise to approximately 200 mv fig 2a and g however the as contaminated aquifer remained at low eh after injection fig 2d as fine grained texture in clay enriched sediments could moderate the response of the system to oxidant diffusion noël et al 2017 the response of the bottom aquifer to eh occurred in two days while it took more than ten days for the upper aquifer fig 2d indicating the depletion of oxidative substances in recharge water when moving through the as contaminated aquifer seawater intrusion increased the ec of uncontaminated aquifers from 0 12 ms cm to a maximum of 7 84 ms cm while ec in areas not affected by seawater remained low fig 2b and h the ec of the as contaminated aquifer has been decreasing due to scouring by flowing water but salt replenishment by seawater mitigated the ec reduction in seawater intruded area fig 2e by the end of seawater intrusion phase differences in ec between seawater intruded and non seawater intruded area can be up to 3 6 times after the injection of recharge water ec of uncontaminated aquifers decreased to values close to the ec of the recharge water 0 77 ms cm fig 2b and h as for ph the as contaminated aquifer was initially almost neutral and the uncontaminated aquifers were weakly alkaline table 1 after seawater intrusion the ph in as contaminated aquifer rose from 7 30 7 39 to 7 77 7 88 while the ph in uncontaminated aquifers fluctuated and showed a decline trend fig 2c f and i the trend of ph in each aquifer was barely changed after the injection of recharge water the concentration of total dissolved fe fe ii and hs was extremely low during the whole duration fig s4a and b with concentration of dissolved fe ii below the detection limit 0 3 μmol l data not shown although the concentration of dissolved hs fluctuated in the seawater intrusion phase the hs in the area affected by the recharge water was gradually depleted after the injection fig s4b 3 2 release and transformation of as in the contaminated aquifer arsenic was mobilized in both seawater intruded and non seawater intruded area but the release of as was greatly higher in seawater intrusion area fig 3 the aqueous concentration of total as in seawater intruded area ranged from 10 2 mg l to 11 1 mg l which was on average 10 3 higher than the 8 7 mg l to 10 4 mg l in the non seawater intrusion area fig 3d seawater intrusion also enhanced the reduction of as v to as iii the aqueous concentration of as iii in seawater intruded area was on average 47 1 higher than that in non seawater intruded area initially as v was the dominant aqueous as species in the as contaminated aquifer accounting for 95 4 99 0 of total as aqueous concentration of as iii increased rapidly and gradually outstripped as v in the seawater intruded area fig 3e and f the aqueous concentration of as in aquifer and effluent reached a stable level in the duration of the seawater intrusion phase implying that the system reached an equilibrium figs 3d and s5a the injection of oxygenated recharge water further enhanced the release of as aqueous concentration of total as increased to 11 2 13 0 mg l at the end of aquifer recharge phase fig 3d different release patterns of as from as contaminated aquifer were observed in three area fig 3d e and f 1 in the area only affected by seawater aqueous as iii at a 1 continued to rise while aqueous as v maintained at the original level 2 in the area affected first by seawater and then by recharge water aqueous concentration of both as iii and as v at a 2 maintained at the original level 3 in the area only affected by recharge water aqueous as iii at a 3 rose and then fell and aqueous as v rose after a delay specifically aqueous as iii decreased rapidly after day 30 while at the same time aqueous as v increased rapidly fig 3e and f the transformation of as valence was more obvious in the effluent the concentration of as v rapidly increased after injection and became dominant as species after day 30 fig s5a these phenomena suggested that the as variation affected by recharge water was due to the oxidation of as iii 3 3 transport of as from contaminated aquifer to uncontaminated aquifers flow velocity and flow field are shown in fig s6 the wedge shaped flow fields evoked by seawater intrusion enabled as to transport to the upper uncontaminated aquifer in the seawater intrusion phase aqueous concentration of as in the upper uncontaminated aquifer rapidly reached the peak 0 11 mg l 1 and then began to gradually decrease and the aqueous concentration of as was obviously higher at seawater intruded area 0 05 0 11 mg l 1 compared to non seawater intruded area 0 02 0 04 mg l 1 fig 3a the dominant species of as was initially as v but the aqueous concentration of as v 0 006 0 028 mg l gradually decreased and was surpassed by that of as iii 0 020 0 106 mg l by the end of seawater intrusion phase fig 3b and c after injection of recharge water aqueous concentration of as in seawater intruded area decreased and reached similar value to that of area only affected by recharge water fig 3a b and c low concentration of as was also detected in the lower uncontaminated aquifer aqueous concentration of as was stable at about 0 05 mg l during seawater intrusion phase with aqueous concentration of as iii slightly higher than that of as v fig 3g h and i note that a surge in aqueous concentration of as especially as v was observed immediately after the injection followed by a decrease in aqueous concentration of as to 0 02 0 04 mg l fig 3g h and i overall as released from contaminated aquifer can penetrate the upper aquifer its transport into the lower aquifer is less possible 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of as mobilization with seawater intrusion seawater intrusion exposed aquifers to different hydrochemical conditions which induced the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of as concentrations in aquifers seawater intrusion exacerbated the mobilization of as in contaminated aquifer the introduction of substantial anions such as so4 2 cl no3 and hco3 with seawater intrusion could cause the competitive desorption of as table 1 as shown in fig 4 a a large decrease in non specifically sorbed as occurred in the seawater intrusion area morelli et al 2017 also observed a positive correlation between the release of as and salinity during seawater intrusion through simulation experiments apart from anions the aqueous as v was found positively correlated with ph r2 0 55 fig s7 suggested that the elevated ph with seawater intrusion might lead to the competitive desorption of as v from iron hydr oxides however the aqueous as iii showed no obvious correlation with ph fig s7 because as v existed mainly as haso4 2 and h2aso4 anions under weakly basic conditions while as iii existed mainly as uncharged h3aso3 yan et al 2000 although the ph had an effect on the as mobilization especially for the as v release it could not be the main reason for enhanced as mobilization by seawater intrusion since the change in ph was less considering that the ph in seawater intruded areas ranged from 7 55 to 7 59 while the ph in the non seawater intrusion area ranged from 7 69 to 7 88 fig 2d and f the aqueous concentration of total as was inversely proportional to eh r2 0 68 fig s7 decrease in eh might lead to the reductive dissolution of amorphous iron hydr oxides fig 4b resulting in the release of amorphous iron hydr oxides bound as fig 4a the increased fe ii content demonstrated by xps spectra of fe 2p verified the reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides fig s8 the decrease of eh could also induce the reduction of as v to the more labile as iii contributing to the accelerated mobilization of as by seawater intrusion according to the as 3d xps spectra as v was the only species on the surface of sediment before and after seawater intrusion fig s9 indicating that the reduction of as v to as iii happened in the solution which also explained the increased concentration of as iii along with seawater intrusion biotic reduction of as v might also exist in this system the dominant specie in seawater intruded area desulfotomaculum table s2 has been proved to possess the ability to reduce as v newman et al 1997 another important mechanism for as mobilization evoked by seawater intrusion was that seawater intrusion altered the transformation pathways of iron hydr oxides as shown in fig 4b crystalline iron hydr oxides were formed in the contaminated aquifer transformation of amorphous iron hydr oxides to crystalline iron hydr oxides at the presence of fe ii is regular under reducing conditions the addition of as little as 40 μmol l fe ii could lead to the conversion of nearly half of the amorphous iron hydr oxides within 9 days burton et al 2011 hansel et al 2003 during the transformation process as can be sequestered by incorporation into the structure of the newly formed crystalline iron hydr oxides which was demonstrated by the result of sequential extraction of as that the content of crystalline iron hydr oxides bound as increased in non seawater intruded area fig 4a however seawater intrusion inhibited this process the amount of newly formed crystalline iron hydr oxides and as sequestered by crystalline iron hydr oxides was less in seawater intruded area fig 4 instead iron sulfide was formed in seawater intruded area fig s10 the stem eds elemental mapping showed a good association between as fe and s fig 5 indicating partial as was bound to iron sulfide however the affinity of iron sulfide for as was several orders of magnitude smaller than that of iron hydr oxides cao et al 2020 as a result the formation of iron sulfide could lead to the mobilization of as 4 2 mechanism of as mobilization with aquifer recharge injection of oxygenated recharge water further contributed to the transformation of as the recharge water contained substantial hco3 table 1 which is more effective than so4 2 and cl in competing with arsenic for adsorption sites charlet et al 2007 as a result large amounts of non specifically sorbed as were released after injection fig 4a the increase in ph due to mar also contributed to the desorption of as fig 2f moreover mar altered the geochemistry of as contaminated aquifer formed during seawater intrusion in area only affected by seawater content of iron sulfide continued to increase while in area affected by recharge water iron sulfide was oxidized and dissolved fig s10 the content of amorphous iron hydr oxides in the recharged area were elevated compared to that at the end of seawater intrusion implying the formation of neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides fig 4b the fe 2p xps spectra also indicated that fe iii content in this area increased after injection fig s8 at a mar site in orange county california usa the oxidative dissolution of as bearing iron sulfide caused by injection of oxygenated recharge water was also documented fakhreddine et al 2020 however the oxidative precipitation of fe ii was not observed in this study this might be due to the higher no3 concentration in recharge water we used 8 0 mg l vs 24 8 mg l table 1 considering that no3 could facilitate the oxidation of fe ii under anoxic conditions jamieson et al 2018 the neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides provided sorption sites for as that moderated the release of as from the aquifer to some extent fig 4a while in area only affected by seawater iron sulfide continued to be formed fig s10 and no neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides were generated fig 4b the oxidation of as iii to as v was also attributed to the action of no3 since the oxidation of as iii by oxygen is particularly slow smedley et al 2002 neil et al 2014 demonstrated through batch reactor experiments that no3 in the recharge water could oxidize as iii to as v within several hours even under anaerobic conditions the delayed oxidation of as iii might be due to the preferential oxidation of fe ii such as iron sulfide and fe2 over as iii which was consistent with the observation of hashimoto et al 2018 in short increases in anion concentration and ph were partly responsible for as mobilization in both seawater intrusion and mar phase high levels of sulfate and low eh environments caused by seawater intrusion led to the conversion of iron hydr oxides to form iron sulfides with much lower affinity to as resulting in the release of as mar introduced oxidants such as no3 which led to the formation neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides however the strong competitive desorption still caused as to exhibit release during mar 4 3 transport of as in coastal aquifers variations in flow field flow velocity and hydrochemistry due to seawater intrusion and mar led to heterogeneity in the transport of as in different phases under the action of the flow field both seawater and freshwater caused upward migration of as in the contaminated aquifer fig s6 aqueous concentration of as v rapidly increased upon seawater intrusion since the contaminated aquifer initially dominated by as v aqueous concentration of as v decreased after a few days fig 3b matching the time when the eh of the upper aquifer dropped to a negative value fig 2a aqueous concentration of as iii did not rise with it probably because it was more mobile under flow condition higher aqueous concentration of as was observed in seawater intruded area fig 2a which could be explained by the competitive desorption of as by anions in seawater aqueous concentration of as in the upper aquifer was at low level below 0 3 mg l according to the results of the sequential extraction of solid as in the upper uncontaminated aquifer fig s11 most of the upward transporting as was sorbed by the iron hydr oxides in the aquifer note that seawater decreased the ph of upper aquifer fig 2c which also contributed to the retention of as injection of recharge water forced back the seawater interface and narrowed the differences in hydrochemistry especially ec of the aquifers fig 2a b and c thus eliminated the differences in aqueous concentration of as in the upper aquifer fig 3a the downward transport of as was not driven by the flow field but by gravity and dispersion at present conditions wei et al 2022 in the seawater intrusion phase aqueous concentration of as iii in the lower aquifer was higher than that of as v which was consistent with the fact that the dispersion coefficient of as iii is higher than that of as v under weak alkaline conditions tanaka et al 2013 the possibility of downward migration of colloidal as under gravity cannot be excluded existing studies have emphasized the effect of gravity on the downward migration of colloidal contaminants in aquifer media james et al 2011 the sudden increase in aqueous concentration of as v after recharge water injection was unanticipated which might be related to the mobilization of colloids during fluctuations at the seawater freshwater interface tan et al 2022 in fact as an important carrier of contaminants the effect of colloids on contaminant transport under seawater intrusion conditions remains to be clarified 4 4 reactive transport model seawater intrusion and subsequent mar tremendously shifted the fractionation distribution and partitioning of both aqueous and solid phase as redox induced minerals transformation and anion induced competitive desorption dominated the mobilization and retention of as and the fate of as was intimately bound with fe and s based on the key chemical processes controlling the mobilization and retention of as an as transport model was constructed following the variable density flow and the parameters were calibrated based on the experimental data or literatures text s3 table s1 a nonreactive model considering only adsorption and desorption processes was also developed for comparison in order to further explore the transport of as during the seawater intrusion and subsequent mar in the actual coastal aquifer a two dimensional numerical model was constructed as shown in fig s12 the observed and simulated concentrations of as and sulfate in contaminated aquifer were well fitted during the seawater intrusion phase as was mainly transported upward along the interface between seawater and freshwater under the stress of the flow field fig 6 c mar enhanced the release of as and expanded the spread range of as fig 6d and this effect was more pronounced at larger injection rates or larger hydraulic conductivity fig s13 the difference in simulated concentrations of as between reactive and nonreactive models was not very large fig s12 considering the small amount of iron sulfide relative to iron hydr oxides in the current system the release of sulfide minerals related arsenic could be neglected the amount of as sequestered during the fe ii catalyzed iron hydr oxide crystal transformation process was roughly equivalent to the as released by the reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxide which was consistent with the experimental results reported by kocar et al 2006 both the reactive and nonreactive models showed that as concentrations in the contaminated aquifer reached the highest at the junction of the two flow fields at the end of the seawater intrusion phase rather than at the place closest to the seawater intrusion figs 6c and s14 which was also consistent with our experimental results fig 3d this phenomenon emphasized the importance of flow field on as transport under seawater intrusion the flow field determined the rate of replenishment of reactive materials in the aquifer and different flow rates in the flow field could affect the redox conditions in the aquifer guo et al 2012 simulated concentrations of sulfate in seawater intruded area by the reactive model were lower than that by the nonreactive model during the seawater intrusion phase and gradually caught up in the recharge phase which implied microbial sulfate reduction and oxidation of iron sulfide occurred in two separate phases fakhreddine et al 2020 5 conclusion and outlook arsenic is a ubiquitous contaminant in coastal aquifers which is extremely sensitive to ambient geochemistry conditions this study showed that both seawater intrusion and mar could intensively alter the native geochemistry of aquifer resulting in the mobilization and repartition of as both seawater intrusion and mar led to an increase in aquifer ph and the introduction of large amounts of anions which resulted in the desorption and release of as seawater intrusion inhibited fe ii catalyzed crystalline iron hydr oxide production instead of the generation of iron sulfide portion of the as was sequestered in the iron sulfide and subsequently released by oxidative dissolution caused by mar however the formation of amorphous iron hydr oxides by oxidative precipitation of fe ii during mar inhibited as mobilization to some extent in all this work emphasized the threatening of seawater intrusion to mobilize as from aquifer and investigated the as mobilization mechanisms on distinct geological zonation divided by seawater intrusion and mar still given the complexity of seawater intrusion and mar process and heterogeneity of the aquifer it is essential to understand at the field

15217,release of contaminants from aquifers at the coastal area is of increasing concern but remains unclear due to the complex groundwater dynamics and hydrochemistry specifically frequently occurring seawater intrusion and the subsequent engineering measures of managed aquifer recharge mar could alter the groundwater regime which might affect the fate and behaviors of contaminants in this work we investigated the transport and transformation of arsenic as in the coastal aquifer at the scenario of seawater intrusion followed by the injection based mar process results showed that seawater intrusion induced 10 3 more release of aqueous as in aquifers which was attributed to the competitive desorption as a result of elevated anion concentration and ph and the reduction of as v to as iii due to the reduced redox potential and enriched as reducing bacteria furthermore seawater intrusion inhibited the recrystallization of iron hydr oxides and instead facilitated its conversion to iron sulfide with lower affinity to as the subsequent mar introduced oxygenated recharge water into aquifers and increased the redox potential leading to the dissolution of iron sulfide followed by formation of amorphous iron hydr oxides however the competitive desorption of as with rich hco3 under increased ph dominated continuous increase in the aquifer aqueous as during mar process a constructed numerical model for describing as transport based on the experimental data showed that as transported along the interface between seawater and freshwater and mar enhanced the release of as and expanded the spread range of as our findings reveal that both seawater intrusion and subsequent mar could cause the release transport and transformation of as which provides new insight on the understanding of geochemical process of as in coastal aquifers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic coastal aquifer managed aquifer recharge seawater intrusion transport and transformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquifer in the coastal area is a particular concern since it is prone to accumulate contaminants and provides linkage for contaminants to circulate between terrestrial and marine environments ward et al 2020 arsenic as is one of the most frequently occurred contaminants in coastal aquifers which has been widely documented worldwide e g bangladesh mihajlov et al 2020 vietnam sø et al 2018 and china rodríguez lado et al 2013 the release of as from aquifer sediment to groundwater is intimately associated with environmental conditions such as redox potential ph and ionic strength as well as the biogeochemical cycling of ambient minerals and organic matters fakhreddine et al 2021 morelli et al 2017 iron hydr oxides are efficient scavengers of dissolved as in aquifers and the reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides is considered to be the primary driver of as release from aquifers under reducing conditions lemonte et al 2017 the reduction of arsenate as v to arsenite as iii which has a lower affinity for iron hydr oxides is also a cause of as mobilization herbel et al 2006 whereas a number of studies have been conducted on as mobilization in the inland aquifers the transport and transformation of as in coastal aquifers remained unclear due to the complexed hydrochemical and hydrodynamic characteristics seawater intrusion frequently occurs in the coastal area as a result of sea level rise and groundwater overexploitation which intensively alters the native geochemical characteristics of aquifers ruffine et al 2021 substantial anions and cations such as cl so4 2 na and ca2 from seawater could flow into the coastal aquifers during seawater intrusion and compete with contaminants for adsorption sites as reported in the gerania mountains greece anions from seawater contributed to the release of as from iron hydr oixdes in coastal aquifers papazotos et al 2020 typically seawater intrusion could increase the ph of aquifers as seawater contains ample basic cation dehbandi et al 2019 suggested that desorption of as from the surface of iron hydr oxides under alkaline conditions was the main cause of as mobilization in the seawater intruded aquifer in sirjan plain iran moreover seawater intrusion could interfere the redox cycling of iron hydr oxides thus affect the mobilization of as field investigations suggested that seawater intrusion could provide required electron acceptors such as so4 2 for bacterial sulfate reduction and promote reduction of iron hydr oxides thus facilitated as mobilization johnston et al 2010 nath et al 2008 conversely lemonte et al 2017 and buschmann et al 2009 found elevated so4 2 in seawater can competitively inhibit dissimilatory reduction of iron hydr oxides consequently less as was released in seawater intruded aquifers so far the effect of seawater intrusion on the release or mobilization of as has been successively studied but there are still knowledge gaps in the mechanism of as mobilization in seawater intruded aquifers moreover the transport and transformation of as under seawater intrusion scenario remained unknown in order to restrain seawater intrusion managed aquifer recharge mar has been widely adopted by recharging freshwater into the coastal aquifer hussain et al 2019 injection of exogenous substances will alter the hydrochemistry of aquifers and affect the mobilization of as the most frequent sources of freshwater are rainwater and reclaimed water which often contain elevated dissolved oxygen or organic matters than groundwater fakhreddine et al 2021 these redox reactive substances could directly or indirectly participate in geochemical reactions related to as release for example neil et al 2014 reported that sodium chloride in recharge water faster phase transformation of iron hydr oxide to hematite while wu et al 2019 found the dissolved organic maters in recharge water inhibited secondary iron hydr oxide precipitation like seawater intrusion mar could also change the ph of aquifer and introduce competitive anions into aquifer which may cause the release of as the coupling of these two complex processes will further aggravate the release of as however the mobilization of as by mar following seawater intrusion scenario has not been investigated yet in this study we conducted a two dimensional experiment to dynamically simulate the effect of seawater intrusion followed by mar on the release transport and transformation of as in coastal aquifers the aim was to provide a detailed description for understanding the geochemical processes of as bearing mineral under the dynamics of seawater intrusion and mar based on the experimental data we also developed a conceptual and numerical model of as mobilization and migration that could be applied to similar geological settings 2 material and methods 2 1 sample preparation clean fine sand was collected from the inshore area of shanghai city china to simulate sediment in uncontaminated aquifer table 1 the as bearing ore was obtained from nearby shanghai city the ore was ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve after air drying then homogeneously mixed with clean fine sand in a mass ratio of 1 1 to simulate sediment in as contaminated aquifer table 1 the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer was measured via falling head method klute 1986 seawater was collected from inshore sea of shanghai city and preserved anaerobic table 1 deoxygenated ultrapure water obtained by purging ultrapure water with n2 was adopted to simulate freshwater reclaimed water collected from the sunken reclaimed water plant in jiading district shanghai city was used as recharge water table 1 2 2 reactor design the experiment was conducted in a rectangular flow tank made of 10 mm thick plexiglass the internal dimension of the device was 60 cm length 40 cm height 5 cm width the conceptual schematic and digital photo of the device are shown in figs 1 a and s1 the flow tank consisted of three distinct chambers a central flow chamber containing sediments and two constant head reservoirs containing seawater and freshwater respectively the constant head reservoirs were separated from the sediments chamber by porous partition covered with 2000 mesh gauze in the sediment region three layers were

as contaminated aquifer and the upper layer was filled to 35 cm from the as contaminated aquifer with uncontaminated sediment upper aquifer the design simulates the release of as from organic matter rich and weakly permeable sediments into the overlying and underlying aquifers that is common in pleistocene holocene aquifer systems wang et al 2019 the sediments were carefully extruded during packing to ensure the homogeneity of porous structure a total of 16 solution samplers rhizon mom 5 cm 0 15 μm pore size rhizosphere research products and concomitant eh sensors were installed in sediments region as shown in fig 1 the sediments were sampled by a syringe equipped with 2 mm inner diameter needle an evenly perforated pipe with an inner diameter of 10 mm was arranged in the bottom right corner of the as contaminated aquifer 5 cm from the freshwater reservoir and the pipe was wrapped with 2000 mesh gauze to prevent sediment entry a small pump was used to inject recharge water into the tank through this pipe 2 3 experimental details the whole experiment was divided into two phases seawater intrusion phase day 1 to day 20 and aquifer recharge phase day 21 to day 40 before the experiment the seawater reservoir was separated from the chamber by a water shutoff wall freshwater was supplied at 1 0 ml min to the chamber from constant head freshwater reservoirs until the water head reached specified value and saturated the sediments for 5 h then seawater was injected at 0 5 ml min and the water head was kept 1 5 cm lower than the chamber luyun jr et al 2011 the seawater intrusion phase began with the removal of the water shutoff wall and the aquifer recharge phase began with the injection of recharge water into the tank and the mass flow rate of recharge water was controlled at 5 10 7 kg s the ratio of groundwater flow to recharge flow is within the realistic range dillon et al 2019 water samples and effluent were collected periodically and the aquifer sediment was collected at the last day of each phase to visually obtain the information about the distribution of seawater seawater was dyed with a red food color allura red c i number 16035 2

s2 hs levels were determined using the n n dimethyl p phenylenediamine method cline 1969 supelco lc sax strong anion exchange resin was utilized to rapidly separate as iii and as v le et al 2000 briefly 3 ml sample was sequentially passed through the lc sax cartridge at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min controlled by a spe stopcocks as v was retained in the cartridge while as iii was discharged into the effluent the total as and as iii concentration were measured by icp oes icap pro x thermo fisher waltham massachusetts america according to epa method 200 8 epa 1995 and the concentration of as v was obtained by subtracting the as iii from the total as the concentration of fe ii was determined by spectrophotometry viollier et al 2000 and the concentration of fe iii was obtained by subtracting the fe ii from the total fe the concentrations of br cl no3 and so4 2 were measured on ion chromatography mic metrohm herisau switzerland the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured

gene dsrb dsrp2060f dsr4r which encodes the dissimilatory sulfite reductase were performed according to existing work wu et al 2019 amorphous iron hydr oxide was extracted using the mixture of 0 25 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 0 25 m hydrochloric acid at 50 c for 30 min chao et al 1983 crystalline iron hydr oxide was extracted by adding 2 m hydrochloric acid to the residue of the previous step for 30 min at 96 c palumbo roe et al 2015 the sediment to extractant ratios for iron hydr oxide extraction was 1 50 the different fraction of as in sediments was extracted via wenzel sequential

studied with transmission electron microscopy tem fei talos f200x thermo fisher waltham massachusetts america equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds 2 5 numerical model darcy s law eq 1 was employed to generalize the process of water flow movement which can be described as follow 1 ϵ p ρ t ρ u q m where ϵ p is the porosity t is the time u is the velocity q m is the fluid source positive or sink negative density and concentration are coupled to consider the mixing of seawater and fresh water text s2 the reaction network was constructed based on the convection dispersion equation eq 2 which can be described as follow 2 ϵ p c i t ρ c p i t j i u c i r i s i where j i is convective flux vector of species i c i is the concentration of species i c p i is the amount sorbed to solid

oxide the competitive desorption of as the formation and dissolution of iron sulfide and the sorption of as by iron hydr oxide the details of reaction network are described in text s3 and the calibrated numerical simulation parameters are shown in table s1 the distribution of seawater as and dissolved oxygen was obtained by two dimensional finite element simulations 3 results 3 1 dynamic hydrochemistry of aquifers seawater intrusion and subsequent mar shifted the hydrochemistry of aquifers based on the color of liquid sample fig s2 and the hydrochemistry parameters of aquifers fig 2 the aquifers were divided into the area only affected by seawater the area affected first by seawater and then by recharge water and the area only affected by recharge water fig 1b the former two were also referred to as seawater intruded area and the latter was non seawater intruded area the dynamic change of aquifer hydrochemistry is shown in fig 2 waterflooding reduced the eh of aquifers in the seawater intrusion phase the eh of uncontaminated bottom and upper aquifers decreased to approximately 600 mv within first several days fig 2a and g while as contaminated aquifer showed a slower rate of decline fig 2d due to originally higher content of oxidizing components such as no3 so4 2 and do table 1 meanwhile as shown in fig s3b clear peak of oxidative quinones with excitation maxima at around 250 nm and emission maxima at around 440 nm was observed in the fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectra of the dissolved organic matter in as contaminated aquifer cory et al 2005 which also contributed to the slow decline of eh in as contaminated aquifer the injection of oxygenated recharge water obviously increased the eh of uncontaminated aquifers for example the eh at the location near the injection point could rise to approximately 200 mv fig 2a and g however the as contaminated aquifer remained at low eh after injection fig 2d as fine grained texture in clay enriched sediments could moderate the response of the system to oxidant diffusion noël et al 2017 the response of the bottom aquifer to eh occurred in two days while it took more than ten days for the upper aquifer fig 2d indicating the depletion of oxidative substances in recharge water when moving through the as contaminated aquifer seawater intrusion increased the ec of uncontaminated aquifers from 0 12 ms cm to a maximum of 7 84 ms cm while ec in areas not affected by seawater remained low fig 2b and h the ec of the as contaminated aquifer has been decreasing due to scouring by flowing water but salt replenishment by seawater mitigated the ec reduction in seawater intruded area fig 2e by the end of seawater intrusion phase differences in ec between seawater intruded and non seawater intruded area can be up to 3 6 times after the injection of recharge water ec of uncontaminated aquifers decreased to values close to the ec of the recharge water 0 77 ms cm fig 2b and h as for ph the as contaminated aquifer was initially almost neutral and the uncontaminated aquifers were weakly alkaline table 1 after seawater intrusion the ph in as contaminated aquifer rose from 7 30 7 39 to 7 77 7 88 while the ph in uncontaminated aquifers fluctuated and showed a decline trend fig 2c f and i the trend of ph in each aquifer was barely changed after the injection of recharge water the concentration of total dissolved fe fe ii and hs was extremely low during the whole duration fig s4a and b with concentration of dissolved fe ii below the detection limit 0 3 μmol l data not shown although the concentration of dissolved hs fluctuated in the seawater intrusion phase the hs in the area affected by the recharge water was gradually depleted after the injection fig s4b 3 2 release and transformation of as in the contaminated aquifer arsenic was mobilized in both seawater intruded and non seawater intruded area but the release of as was greatly higher in seawater intrusion area fig 3 the aqueous concentration of total as in seawater intruded area ranged from 10 2 mg l to 11 1 mg l which was on average 10 3 higher than the 8 7 mg l to 10 4 mg l in the non seawater intrusion area fig 3d seawater intrusion also enhanced the reduction of as v to as iii the aqueous concentration of as iii in seawater intruded area was on average 47 1 higher than that in non seawater intruded area initially as v was the dominant aqueous as species in the as contaminated aquifer accounting for 95 4 99 0 of total as aqueous concentration of as iii increased rapidly and gradually outstripped as v in the seawater intruded area fig 3e and f the aqueous concentration of as in aquifer and effluent reached a stable level in the duration of the seawater intrusion phase implying that the system reached an equilibrium figs 3d and s5a the injection of oxygenated recharge water further enhanced the release of as aqueous concentration of total as increased to 11 2 13 0 mg l at the end of aquifer recharge phase fig 3d different release patterns of as from as contaminated aquifer were observed in three area fig 3d e and f 1 in the area only affected by seawater aqueous as iii at a 1 continued to rise while aqueous as v maintained at the original level 2 in the area affected first by seawater and then by recharge water aqueous concentration of both as iii and as v at a 2 maintained at the original level 3 in the area only affected by recharge water aqueous as iii at a 3 rose and then fell and aqueous as v rose after a delay specifically aqueous as iii decreased rapidly after day 30 while at the same time aqueous as v increased rapidly fig 3e and f the transformation of as valence was more obvious in the effluent the concentration of as v rapidly increased after injection and became dominant as species after day 30 fig s5a these phenomena suggested that the as variation affected by recharge water was due to the oxidation of as iii 3 3 transport of as from contaminated aquifer to uncontaminated aquifers flow velocity and flow field are shown in fig s6 the wedge shaped flow fields evoked by seawater intrusion enabled as to transport to the upper uncontaminated aquifer in the seawater intrusion phase aqueous concentration of as in the upper uncontaminated aquifer rapidly reached the peak 0 11 mg l 1 and then began to gradually decrease and the aqueous concentration of as was obviously higher at seawater intruded area 0 05 0 11 mg l 1 compared to non seawater intruded area 0 02 0 04 mg l 1 fig 3a the dominant species of as was initially as v but the aqueous concentration of as v 0 006 0 028 mg l gradually decreased and was surpassed by that of as iii 0 020 0 106 mg l by the end of seawater intrusion phase fig 3b and c after injection of recharge water aqueous concentration of as in seawater intruded area decreased and reached similar value to that of area only affected by recharge water fig 3a b and c low concentration of as was also detected in the lower uncontaminated aquifer aqueous concentration of as was stable at about 0 05 mg l during seawater intrusion phase with aqueous concentration of as iii slightly higher than that of as v fig 3g h and i note that a surge in aqueous concentration of as especially as v was observed immediately after the injection followed by a decrease in aqueous concentration of as to 0 02 0 04 mg l fig 3g h and i overall as released from contaminated aquifer can penetrate the upper aquifer its transport into the lower aquifer is less possible 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of as mobilization with seawater intrusion seawater intrusion exposed aquifers to different hydrochemical conditions which induced the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of as concentrations in aquifers seawater intrusion exacerbated the mobilization of as in contaminated aquifer the introduction of substantial anions such as so4 2 cl no3 and hco3 with seawater intrusion could cause the competitive desorption of as table 1 as shown in fig 4 a a large decrease in non specifically sorbed as occurred in the seawater intrusion area morelli et al 2017 also observed a positive correlation between the release of as and salinity during seawater intrusion through simulation experiments apart from anions the aqueous as v was found positively correlated with ph r2 0 55 fig s7 suggested that the elevated ph with seawater intrusion might lead to the competitive desorption of as v from iron hydr oxides however the aqueous as iii showed no obvious correlation with ph fig s7 because as v existed mainly as haso4 2 and h2aso4 anions under weakly basic conditions while as iii existed mainly as uncharged h3aso3 yan et al 2000 although the ph had an effect on the as mobilization especially for the as v release it could not be the main reason for enhanced as mobilization by seawater intrusion since the change in ph was less considering that the ph in seawater intruded areas ranged from 7 55 to 7 59 while the ph in the non seawater intrusion area ranged from 7 69 to 7 88 fig 2d and f the aqueous concentration of total as was inversely proportional to eh r2 0 68 fig s7 decrease in eh might lead to the reductive dissolution of amorphous iron hydr oxides fig 4b resulting in the release of amorphous iron hydr oxides bound as fig 4a the increased fe ii content demonstrated by xps spectra of fe 2p verified the reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxides fig s8 the decrease of eh could also induce the reduction of as v to the more labile as iii contributing to the accelerated mobilization of as by seawater intrusion according to the as 3d xps spectra as v was the only species on the surface of sediment before and after seawater intrusion fig s9 indicating that the reduction of as v to as iii happened in the solution which also explained the increased concentration of as iii along with seawater intrusion biotic reduction of as v might also exist in this system the dominant specie in seawater intruded area desulfotomaculum table s2 has been proved to possess the ability to reduce as v newman et al 1997 another important mechanism for as mobilization evoked by seawater intrusion was that seawater intrusion altered the transformation pathways of iron hydr oxides as shown in fig 4b crystalline iron hydr oxides were formed in the contaminated aquifer transformation of amorphous iron hydr oxides to crystalline iron hydr oxides at the presence of fe ii is regular under reducing conditions the addition of as little as 40 μmol l fe ii could lead to the conversion of nearly half of the amorphous iron hydr oxides within 9 days burton et al 2011 hansel et al 2003 during the transformation process as can be sequestered by incorporation into the structure of the newly formed crystalline iron hydr oxides which was demonstrated by the result of sequential extraction of as that the content of crystalline iron hydr oxides bound as increased in non seawater intruded area fig 4a however seawater intrusion inhibited this process the amount of newly formed crystalline iron hydr oxides and as sequestered by crystalline iron hydr oxides was less in seawater intruded area fig 4 instead iron sulfide was formed in seawater intruded area fig s10 the stem eds elemental mapping showed a good association between as fe and s fig 5 indicating partial as was bound to iron sulfide however the affinity of iron sulfide for as was several orders of magnitude smaller than that of iron hydr oxides cao et al 2020 as a result the formation of iron sulfide could lead to the mobilization of as 4 2 mechanism of as mobilization with aquifer recharge injection of oxygenated recharge water further contributed to the transformation of as the recharge water contained substantial hco3 table 1 which is more effective than so4 2 and cl in competing with arsenic for adsorption sites charlet et al 2007 as a result large amounts of non specifically sorbed as were released after injection fig 4a the increase in ph due to mar also contributed to the desorption of as fig 2f moreover mar altered the geochemistry of as contaminated aquifer formed during seawater intrusion in area only affected by seawater content of iron sulfide continued to increase while in area affected by recharge water iron sulfide was oxidized and dissolved fig s10 the content of amorphous iron hydr oxides in the recharged area were elevated compared to that at the end of seawater intrusion implying the formation of neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides fig 4b the fe 2p xps spectra also indicated that fe iii content in this area increased after injection fig s8 at a mar site in orange county california usa the oxidative dissolution of as bearing iron sulfide caused by injection of oxygenated recharge water was also documented fakhreddine et al 2020 however the oxidative precipitation of fe ii was not observed in this study this might be due to the higher no3 concentration in recharge water we used 8 0 mg l vs 24 8 mg l table 1 considering that no3 could facilitate the oxidation of fe ii under anoxic conditions jamieson et al 2018 the neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides provided sorption sites for as that moderated the release of as from the aquifer to some extent fig 4a while in area only affected by seawater iron sulfide continued to be formed fig s10 and no neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides were generated fig 4b the oxidation of as iii to as v was also attributed to the action of no3 since the oxidation of as iii by oxygen is particularly slow smedley et al 2002 neil et al 2014 demonstrated through batch reactor experiments that no3 in the recharge water could oxidize as iii to as v within several hours even under anaerobic conditions the delayed oxidation of as iii might be due to the preferential oxidation of fe ii such as iron sulfide and fe2 over as iii which was consistent with the observation of hashimoto et al 2018 in short increases in anion concentration and ph were partly responsible for as mobilization in both seawater intrusion and mar phase high levels of sulfate and low eh environments caused by seawater intrusion led to the conversion of iron hydr oxides to form iron sulfides with much lower affinity to as resulting in the release of as mar introduced oxidants such as no3 which led to the formation neo precipitated amorphous iron hydr oxides however the strong competitive desorption still caused as to exhibit release during mar 4 3 transport of as in coastal aquifers variations in flow field flow velocity and hydrochemistry due to seawater intrusion and mar led to heterogeneity in the transport of as in different phases under the action of the flow field both seawater and freshwater caused upward migration of as in the contaminated aquifer fig s6 aqueous concentration of as v rapidly increased upon seawater intrusion since the contaminated aquifer initially dominated by as v aqueous concentration of as v decreased after a few days fig 3b matching the time when the eh of the upper aquifer dropped to a negative value fig 2a aqueous concentration of as iii did not rise with it probably because it was more mobile under flow condition higher aqueous concentration of as was observed in seawater intruded area fig 2a which could be explained by the competitive desorption of as by anions in seawater aqueous concentration of as in the upper aquifer was at low level below 0 3 mg l according to the results of the sequential extraction of solid as in the upper uncontaminated aquifer fig s11 most of the upward transporting as was sorbed by the iron hydr oxides in the aquifer note that seawater decreased the ph of upper aquifer fig 2c which also contributed to the retention of as injection of recharge water forced back the seawater interface and narrowed the differences in hydrochemistry especially ec of the aquifers fig 2a b and c thus eliminated the differences in aqueous concentration of as in the upper aquifer fig 3a the downward transport of as was not driven by the flow field but by gravity and dispersion at present conditions wei et al 2022 in the seawater intrusion phase aqueous concentration of as iii in the lower aquifer was higher than that of as v which was consistent with the fact that the dispersion coefficient of as iii is higher than that of as v under weak alkaline conditions tanaka et al 2013 the possibility of downward migration of colloidal as under gravity cannot be excluded existing studies have emphasized the effect of gravity on the downward migration of colloidal contaminants in aquifer media james et al 2011 the sudden increase in aqueous concentration of as v after recharge water injection was unanticipated which might be related to the mobilization of colloids during fluctuations at the seawater freshwater interface tan et al 2022 in fact as an important carrier of contaminants the effect of colloids on contaminant transport under seawater intrusion conditions remains to be clarified 4 4 reactive transport model seawater intrusion and subsequent mar tremendously shifted the fractionation distribution and partitioning of both aqueous and solid phase as redox induced minerals transformation and anion induced competitive desorption dominated the mobilization and retention of as and the fate of as was intimately bound with fe and s based on the key chemical processes controlling the mobilization and retention of as an as transport model was constructed following the variable density flow and the parameters were calibrated based on the experimental data or literatures text s3 table s1 a nonreactive model considering only adsorption and desorption processes was also developed for comparison in order to further explore the transport of as during the seawater intrusion and subsequent mar in the actual coastal aquifer a two dimensional numerical model was constructed as shown in fig s12 the observed and simulated concentrations of as and sulfate in contaminated aquifer were well fitted during the seawater intrusion phase as was mainly transported upward along the interface between seawater and freshwater under the stress of the flow field fig 6 c mar enhanced the release of as and expanded the spread range of as fig 6d and this effect was more pronounced at larger injection rates or larger hydraulic conductivity fig s13 the difference in simulated concentrations of as between reactive and nonreactive models was not very large fig s12 considering the small amount of iron sulfide relative to iron hydr oxides in the current system the release of sulfide minerals related arsenic could be neglected the amount of as sequestered during the fe ii catalyzed iron hydr oxide crystal transformation process was roughly equivalent to the as released by the reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxide which was consistent with the experimental results reported by kocar et al 2006 both the reactive and nonreactive models showed that as concentrations in the contaminated aquifer reached the highest at the junction of the two flow fields at the end of the seawater intrusion phase rather than at the place closest to the seawater intrusion figs 6c and s14 which was also consistent with our experimental results fig 3d this phenomenon emphasized the importance of flow field on as transport under seawater intrusion the flow field determined the rate of replenishment of reactive materials in the aquifer and different flow rates in the flow field could affect the redox conditions in the aquifer guo et al 2012 simulated concentrations of sulfate in seawater intruded area by the reactive model were lower than that by the nonreactive model during the seawater intrusion phase and gradually caught up in the recharge phase which implied microbial sulfate reduction and oxidation of iron sulfide occurred in two separate phases fakhreddine et al 2020 5 conclusion and outlook arsenic is a ubiquitous contaminant in coastal aquifers which is extremely sensitive to ambient geochemistry conditions this study showed that both seawater intrusion and mar could intensively alter the native geochemistry of aquifer resulting in the mobilization and repartition of as both seawater intrusion and mar led to an increase in aquifer ph and the introduction of large amounts of anions which resulted in the desorption and release of as seawater intrusion inhibited fe ii catalyzed crystalline iron hydr oxide production instead of the generation of iron sulfide portion of the as was sequestered in the iron sulfide and subsequently released by oxidative dissolution caused by mar however the formation of amorphous iron hydr oxides by oxidative precipitation of fe ii during mar inhibited as mobilization to some extent in all this work emphasized the threatening of seawater intrusion to mobilize as from aquifer and investigated the as mobilization mechanisms on distinct geological zonation divided by seawater intrusion and mar still given the complexity of seawater intrusion and mar process and heterogeneity of the aquifer it is essential to understand at the field scale that how variations of hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry can affect the transport and transformation of as in coastal aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

antiscalants type on coral holobiont physiology 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design three different colonies of montipora capricornis were fragmented 12 fragments from each colony and kept in controlled conditions to recover and acclimate these parental colonies were cultured in the aquarium facility of the laboratory for molecular marine ecology at bar ilan university israel for at least one year before fragmentation the fragments were randomly distributed in 2 8 l aquaria and kept in a flow through system with artificial seawater 35 psu constant temperature 25 c and illuminated at 90 µmol quanta m 2 s 1 in a daily cycle 12 12h it should be noted that the aquaria were randomly shuffled every three days to minimize any position effects each aquarium included four fragments

controls the final as concentration was set by adding 10 of the typical dose of polyphosphonate based as spiked by desalination operators into the reverse osmosis feed which should represent the

biological endpoints described in detail below were assessed after one and two weeks of exposure to the experimental treatments 2 2 physiological parameters to assess holobiont specific effects the biological endpoints were classified into three groups response of the coral host tissue alteration polyp activity protein content and oxidative stress biomarkers the response of the symbionts pulse

100nmol the fragments were incubated at ambient temperature for four h in the dark at the end of the incubation period the samples were spiked with trichloroacetic acid 100 tca to halt the bacterial

statistical analysis results were expressed as mean standard error statistical analyses were conducted using the r statistical environment r core team 2021 the effects of the antiscalant s treatment fixed factor treatment levels control polymer based and phosphonate based antiscalant and exposure duration fixed factor time levels one and two weeks and the interaction between both factors were assessed by generalized linear models glms when appropriate pairwise comparisons were performed a posteriori tests using the package emmeans with bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons 3 results and discussion exposure to antiscalants led to significant changes in most of the coral responses under study these results raise a red flag about the use of antiscalants on swro facilities operating close to coral reef ecosystems the effects of the treatments and exposure time are summarized in table s1 the results were further detailed and discussed considering the responses of the animal host the symbiotic microalgae and the associated bacteria 3 1 impaired coral vitality by antiscalants exposure the tissue appearance of m capricornis corals that were kept under ambient conditions i e control remained unchanged for two weeks fig 1 a c in contrast corals exposed for the same period to environmentally relevant concentrations of polymer based fig 1d g and polyphosphonate based fig 1h j antiscalants 0 025 ml l sw displayed visual signs of stress like mucus production and tissue loss the percentage of damaged tissue bleaching tissue loss was negligible for control fragments at the end of the experiment 1 of the surface area differently up to 30 of the coral s surface area subjected to polymer based as was bleached and or undergone tissue loss table s1 fig 1k it should be noted that more extensive tissue damage 40 was observed after two weeks of exposure to polyphosphonate based as table s1 fig 1k in addition polyp activity decreased from 90 in the control corals to 25 after two weeks of exposure to either ass table s1 fig 1l the observed effects including the activity of the polyps may severely impair the feeding behavior of the coral previati et al 2010 this scenario is even more severe once coupled with impaired autotrophic behavior of the holobiont which may be expected from the observed responses of the symbiotic microalgae similar polyp retraction has been reported for other corals exposed to different classes of chemicals ferreira et al 2021 white et al 2012 as well as climate change related stressors cerrano et al 2013 previati et al 2010 this behavior could likely be a strategy to reduce the energetic costs as polyp activity consumes more energy levy et al 2006 3 1 1 biochemical responses of the coral host corals exposed to phosphonate based as for one week increased protein values by 2 3 fold compared to the control corals table s1 fig 2 a the total antioxidant capacity tac was lower by 41 after one week of exposure to polyphosphonate based as table s1 fig 2b however after two weeks tac was over synthesized by 45 table s1 fig 2b in contrast the host s lipid oxidative damage lpo was similar between all treatments in both sampling times table s1 fig 2c considering the biochemical responses of the host after one week of exposure increased protein levels in corals exposed to polyphosphonate based as suggest that the coral host attempted to cope with the changes in seawater chemical properties recent studies indicated that corals under heat and light stress had higher protein values usually related to increased production of heat stress and antioxidant proteins corinaldesi et al 2021 cziesielski et al 2019 tisthammer et al 2021 similarly lower levels of tac compared to control indicated that the non enzymatic antioxidant reserves were depleted flieger et al 2021 huang et al 2005 marangoni et al 2019 after one week of exposure to polyphosphonate based as at the same time total protein content was upregulated suggesting a high metabolism of antioxidants marangoni et al 2019 reported decreased tac levels followed by a bleaching event in hard corals during an el nino event in south america similarly our results showed that reduced levels of tac in the first week were followed by a reduction in symbiont algae abundance section 3 2 during the following week we suggest that the later swift rise in antioxidant capacity combined with the reduced activity of polyps may be a physiological strategy to conserve energy by the host overall the animal s physiological responses to as such as lower polyp activity increased production of proteins and non enzymatic antioxidants were efficient in keeping the oxidative balance as no differential damages to lipids lpo of host cells were detected on the other hand exposure to polymer based as did not induce any significant alterations on the biochemical parameters of the coral host the difference between effects of the two types of as may be related to a lower toxicity of the polymer based compared to the polyphosphonate in the time frame and concentration applied or to different modes of action e g no oxidative stress mechanisms related to the polymer based as 3 2 effects of antiscalants on microalgae symbionts only the polyphosphonate based as significantly altered the abundance of symbiotic algae and chlorophyll a content compared to control a significant reduction 39 in symbiotic microalgae abundance was measured after two weeks of polyphosphonate based as exposure fig 3 a at the same time a sharp increase 79 in chlorophyll a per cell after one and two weeks of exposure to polyphosphonate based as table s1 fig 3b photosynthetic efficiency fv fm was affected after two weeks of exposure to both as table s1 fig 3c increased chlorophyll production per cell after adding polyphosphonate based as indicates that the microalgal symbionts were utilizing the phosphorus that has likely leached from biodegradation of these ass by associated bacteria sisma ventura et al 2022 many other studies indicated that symbiotic microalgae abundance and chlorophyll a concentration increased after phosphate addition hall et al 2018 pogoreutz et al 2018 in general many studies advocate that an imbalanced ratio of nutrients impacts coral physiology ferrier pages et al 2016 hall et al 2018 rosset et al 2017 wiedenmann et al 2013 highlighted that increased inorganic nitrogen levels led to a proliferation of symbiodinium that exhausted the inorganic phosphate reserves and was related to later detrimental health effects therefore the difference in symbiotic algae abundance compared to the control may be related to limited reserves of iron or other micronutrients after the proliferation of the population by the initial phosphate enrichment d angelo and wiedenmann 2014 and or oxidative stress additionally exposure to polyphosphonate based as increased total antioxidant capacity tac while also inducing oxidative damage to microalgal lipids during the first week table s1 fig 4 following the above it can be surmised that the endosymbiotic algae experienced oxidative stress in a short time of one week of as exposure as indicated by the changes in tac levels and an increase in oxidative damage fig 4 it can be concluded that the abundance of symbiotic algae decreased after polyphosphonate based exposure suggesting that oxidative stress might be a strong biological indicator of the impact of ass it should be highlighted that under severe oxidative stress namely when symbiotic algae produce excess reactive oxygen or nitrogen species ros rns the host often mitigates the stress by expelling the algal symbionts leading to coral bleaching downs et al 2002 3 3 effects of antiscalants on coral associated bacteria compared to the control one week of polyphosphonate based as led to a significant increase 59 in bacteria cell numbers fig 5 a by the second week bacteria cell numbers increased in both treatments 38 41 compared to control table s1 fig 5a after two weeks of exposure compared to the control polymer based as caused a significant 3 fold decrease in bacterial production table s1 fig 5b while polyphosphonates further increased the activity by 28 which however was not statistically significant it can be surmised that polymer based as can provide a source of labile carbon while polyphosphonate based as acts as a source of both dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus al ashhab et al 2022 ashfaq et al 2020 sisma ventura et al 2022 therefore biodegradation of both types of as by the microbial community has biochemically promoted bacterial growth an altered bacteria community can lead to a process named dysbiosis which has been shown to negatively impact the whole holobiont morris et al 2019 van oppen and blackall 2019 recent reports highlighted that antiscalants could undergo biodegradation and leach dissolved organic phosphorus sisma ventura et al 2022 enhancing bacterial activity belkin et al 2017 correspondingly it was reported that polyphosphonate based as enhanced the activity of bacteria found in symbiotic interactions with three types of hard corals petersen et al 2018 when combined with salinity increase indeed we can expect that the overall nutrient enrichment from as exposure varies between antiscalant type depending on the composition and on the biodegradation rate the degradation rate is lower in polyphosphonate based as compared to other common types of as al ashhab et al 2022 yet literature indicates that even in short periods of exposure to polyphosphonate ass the medium has increased content of phosphate belkin et al 2017 sisma ventura et al 2022 it is also important to highlight that the bacteria community of hard corals was never investigated regarding antiscalant exposure and biodegradation rate 3 4 holobiont fitness under antiscalants exposure a critical review by roberts et al 2010 highlighted that basic information on the ecotoxicological effects of commonly used antiscalants is needed the results of this study indicate that altered bacteria abundance and oxidative stress were the main drivers of the coral holobiont response to as exposure variations in the ph of the exposure water and its consequent physiological effects can be expected after antiscalant addition al ashhab et al 2022 sweity et al 2013 yu et al 2020 yet no difference in the ph of seawater between treatments means of 8 18 8 19 for the seawater and ass respectively moreover considering the lack of information about the actual formula of each antiscalant it is important to consider that these commercial products contain impurities that may be relevant drivers of the adverse effects different classes of ass increase organic carbon levels and promote bacteria growth sweity et al 2015 dissolved organic carbon was associated with higher bacterial growth tissue sloughing and mortality in corals kline et al 2006 phosphate in low levels can often benefit corals and its enrichment rarely induces strong adverse effects on corals however the dissolved organic phosphate levels that can be found in the brine plume after discharge of polyphosphonate based as were reported to be significantly higher up to 40 times than ambient seawater sisma ventura et al 2022 in a different study that exposed algae to ass phosphonates have likely impaired the assimilation of iron by complexation wang et al 2020 which in turn reduced growth and photosynthesis moreover boosted symbiotic algae populations from nutrient enrichment experiments often lead the to depletion of other micronutrients such as iron and trace vitamins d angelo and wiedenmann 2014 li et al 2020 wiedenmann et al 2013 it is also plausible that iron deficiency could have resulted from antiscalant complexation and or iron over consumption iron deficiency induces oxidative stress in terrestrial plants phytoplankton and coral algal symbionts leaden et al 2018 li et al 2020 shick et al 2011 in this study we tested concentrations of antiscalants that are commonly used in desalination plants belkin et al 2017 sisma ventura et al 2022 but further studies should explore the hypothesis that reduced as concentrations would minimize the environmental footprint of desalination facilities in sensitive areas such as coral reef ecosystems 4 conclusion our results shed new insights into the effects of brine waste on the physiology and vitality of montipora capricornis scleractinian coral highlighting the ecotoxicological potential of ass the exposure to both antiscalants affected the physiology of the holobiont which is mostly clear by the tissue damage reduction in polyp activity decreased photosynthetic efficiency increased bacteria abundance and oxidative stress after two weeks of exposure nonetheless since adding of as is required for swro it may be assumed that polymer based ass would be more environmentally coral friendly than polyphosphonate based ones if dosed at similar concentrations the polyphosphonate treatment led to more significant changes compared to control in the ecophysiology of all three holobiont compartments i e the animal host symbiotic microalgae and associated bacteria it is plausible that the observed impact was time dependent and that the effects recuperate or total demise would be different after longer exposure times therefore we stress that chronic exposure to these ass should be tested in dedicated experiments to determine the influence of chronic exposure on these holobiont responses in summary these results should be considered in desalination management around coral reefs considering the results of this first screening it is suggested to minimize the use of phosphorus based as thus reducing the risk of a chronic impact of desalination effluents on corals yet it is important to note that it will be necessary to test the effects of these chemicals on multiple coral species in larger mesocosms to definitively argue which antiscalant should be used in the vicinity of coral reefs the results of the present study can guide the choice of biological parameters to be monitored in future studies water scarcity is a global issue and since desalinated volumes are predicted to increase over time it is imperative to develop and apply approaches that monitor e g identify biomarkers of exposure and minimize the impacts of desalination effluents e g minimal liquid discharge on sensitive coastal ecosystems

1997 schelske et al 2021 most coral reefs are found in a narrow and arid geophysical belt between 30 n to 30 s that often face severe water scarcity many of these arid regions depend on seawater desalination for freshwater production eke et al 2020 therefore a tight nexus between the desalination industry and coral reefs is inevitable petersen et al 2018 for example more than 15000 desalination plants are operating around the world and 48 jones et al 2019 of these plants are in the middle east mainly in countries hosting a significant coverage of coral reefs around the red sea fine et al 2019 petersen et al 2018 or the persian gulf burt 2014 2013 currently seawater reverse osmosis desalination swro is the most viable approach 65 and rising used to mitigate the growing demand for freshwater darre and toor 2018 reverse osmosis desalination is achieved by pressurizing seawater over a semipermeable membrane that rejects all salts and minerals producing freshwater as well as concentrated brine this hypersaline brine waste is typically discharged back into the adjacent coastal environment the potential impacts of brine waste discharge on marine environments are mostly related to hypersalinity affecting biochemistry parameters benaissa et al 2020 physiology capó et al 2020 and or community structure de la ossa carretero et al 2016 however less is currently known about the specific effects of chemical additives e g antiscalants and coagulants that are commonly used in the desalination process and often discharged with the brine also only sparse studies have directly assessed the effects of brine discharge on corals mabrook 1994 petersen et al 2018 van der merwe et al 2014 which is insufficient to understand predict and mitigate the impacts of desalination plants on reef ecosystems despite all the progress in the desalination field antiscalants as are often added to reduce membrane scaling and maintain freshwater production yu et al 2020 antiscalants are dosed in the swro feedwater stream typically between 1 and 15 mg l greenlee et al 2009 the specific composition of ass is mostly a trade secret feiner et al 2015 yet typically based on polyphosphonates e g phosphonic acids nowack 2003 or polymers e g polycarboxylic acids ashfaq et al 2019 jain et al 2019 although ass are regarded to have minimal ecotoxicity their impact on the coastal environment and especially on hard corals were hardly investigated in this study we quantified the effects of polyphosphonate and polymer based ass on the health of a common reef building coral montipora capricornis was chosen as a model species in this first screening study that determined the impacts of antiscalants on hard corals this specie is ascribed to a genus of reef building corals widespread around the indo pacific bessell browne et al 2017 where many desalination plants are operated jones et al 2019 the ecotoxicological responses of the coral holobiont namely the coral host endosymbiotic algae and associated microbiota were monitored over 14 days of exposure in a laboratory based experiment the results and corresponding insights clarify the impact of the antiscalants type on coral holobiont physiology 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design three different colonies of montipora capricornis were fragmented 12 fragments from each colony and kept in controlled conditions to recover and acclimate these parental colonies were cultured in the aquarium facility of the laboratory for molecular marine ecology at bar ilan university israel for at least one year before fragmentation the fragments were randomly distributed in 2 8 l aquaria and kept in a flow through system with artificial seawater 35 psu constant temperature 25 c and illuminated at 90 µmol quanta m 2 s 1 in a daily cycle 12 12h it should be noted that the aquaria were randomly shuffled every three days to minimize any position effects each aquarium included four fragments from each colony 12 in total artificial seawater was prepared every two days by mixing double distilled water and sea salts royal nature advanced pro formula salt until reaching a salinity of 35 psu in beakers and transferred to header tanks 10l that would feed the aquarium system with or without as addition seawater was delivered to the aquaria by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s in a flow through approach and at a turnover rate of 3 aquarium volumes per day 9 l per day per aquarium after acclimation corals were exposed to realistic concentrations 0 025 ml l of the commercial polymer based polycarboxylic acid flocon 260 and polyphosphonate based nitrilotris methylene trisphosphonic acid disodium phosphonate hypersperse mdc714 antiscalants depotchem ltd while compared to unamended controls the final as concentration was set by adding 10 of the typical dose of polyphosphonate based as spiked by desalination operators into the reverse osmosis feed which should represent the concentrations in the outflow belkin et al 2017 kress et al 2020 sisma ventura et al 2022 seawater salinity temperature dissolved oxygen do and ph were monitored daily from each aquarium the biological endpoints described in detail below were assessed after one and two weeks of exposure to the experimental treatments 2 2 physiological parameters to assess holobiont specific effects the biological endpoints were classified into three groups response of the coral host tissue alteration polyp activity protein content and oxidative stress biomarkers the response of the symbionts pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry symbiotic algae abundance chlorophyll content and oxidative stress biomarkers and the response of coral associated bacteria bacteria abundance and production fragments

100nmol the fragments were incubated at ambient temperature for four h in the dark at the end of the incubation period the samples were spiked with trichloroacetic acid 100 tca to halt the bacterial activity the coral fragments were then bath sonicated for 20 min three times to detach the bacteria cells samples treated with tca before the incubation was used as a blank the bacteria activity rate was calculated according to simon et al 1990 and normalized to the surface area of the incubated fragments the surface area was determined by analyzing digital photographs of the fragments with imagej

statistical analysis results were expressed as mean standard error statistical analyses were conducted using the r statistical environment r core team 2021 the effects of the antiscalant s treatment fixed factor treatment levels control polymer based and phosphonate based antiscalant and exposure duration fixed factor time levels one and two weeks and the interaction between both factors were assessed by generalized linear models glms when appropriate pairwise comparisons were performed a posteriori tests using the package emmeans with bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons 3 results and discussion exposure to antiscalants led to significant changes in most of the coral responses under study these results raise a red flag about the use of antiscalants on swro facilities operating close to coral reef ecosystems the effects of the treatments and exposure time are summarized in table s1 the results were further detailed and discussed considering the responses of the animal host the symbiotic microalgae and the associated bacteria 3 1 impaired coral vitality by antiscalants exposure the tissue appearance of m capricornis corals that were kept under ambient conditions i e control remained unchanged for two weeks fig 1 a c in contrast corals exposed for the same period to environmentally relevant concentrations of polymer based fig 1d g and polyphosphonate based fig 1h j antiscalants 0 025 ml l sw displayed visual signs of stress like mucus production and tissue loss the percentage of damaged tissue bleaching tissue loss was negligible for control fragments at the end of the experiment 1 of the surface area differently up to 30 of the coral s surface area subjected to polymer based as was bleached and or undergone tissue loss table s1 fig 1k it should be noted that more extensive tissue damage 40 was observed after two weeks of exposure to polyphosphonate based as table s1 fig 1k in addition polyp activity decreased from 90 in the control corals to 25 after two weeks of exposure to either ass table s1 fig 1l the observed effects including the activity of the polyps may severely impair the feeding behavior of the coral previati et al 2010 this scenario is even more severe once coupled with impaired autotrophic behavior of the holobiont which may be expected from the observed responses of the symbiotic microalgae similar polyp retraction has been reported for other corals exposed to different classes of chemicals ferreira et al 2021 white et al 2012 as well as climate change related stressors cerrano et al 2013 previati et al 2010 this behavior could likely be a strategy to reduce the energetic costs as polyp activity consumes more energy levy et al 2006 3 1 1 biochemical responses of the coral host corals exposed to phosphonate based as for one week increased protein values by 2 3 fold compared to the control corals table s1 fig 2 a the total antioxidant capacity tac was lower by 41 after one week of exposure to polyphosphonate based as table s1 fig 2b however after two weeks tac was over synthesized by 45 table s1 fig 2b in contrast the host s lipid oxidative damage lpo was similar between all treatments in both sampling times table s1 fig 2c considering the biochemical responses of the host after one week of exposure increased protein levels in corals exposed to polyphosphonate based as suggest that the coral host attempted to cope with the changes in seawater chemical properties recent studies indicated that corals under heat and light stress had higher protein values usually related to increased production of heat stress and antioxidant proteins corinaldesi et al 2021 cziesielski et al 2019 tisthammer et al 2021 similarly lower levels of tac compared to control indicated that the non enzymatic antioxidant reserves were depleted flieger et al 2021 huang et al 2005 marangoni et al 2019 after one week of exposure to polyphosphonate based as at the same time total protein content was upregulated suggesting a high metabolism of antioxidants marangoni et al 2019 reported decreased tac levels followed by a bleaching event in hard corals during an el nino event in south america similarly our results showed that reduced levels of tac in the first week were followed by a reduction in symbiont algae abundance section 3 2 during the following week we suggest that the later swift rise in antioxidant capacity combined with the reduced activity of polyps may be a physiological strategy to conserve energy by the host overall the animal s physiological responses to as such as lower polyp activity increased production of proteins and non enzymatic antioxidants were efficient in keeping the oxidative balance as no differential damages to lipids lpo of host cells were detected on the other hand exposure to polymer based as did not induce any significant alterations on the biochemical parameters of the coral host the difference between effects of the two types of as may be related to a lower toxicity of the polymer based compared to the polyphosphonate in the time frame and concentration applied or to different modes of action e g no oxidative stress mechanisms related to the polymer based as 3 2 effects of antiscalants on microalgae symbionts only the polyphosphonate based as significantly altered the abundance of symbiotic algae and chlorophyll a content compared to control a significant reduction 39 in symbiotic microalgae abundance was measured after two weeks of polyphosphonate based as exposure fig 3 a at the same time a sharp increase 79 in chlorophyll a per cell after one and two weeks of exposure to polyphosphonate based as table s1 fig 3b photosynthetic efficiency fv fm was affected after two weeks of exposure to both as table s1 fig 3c increased chlorophyll production per cell after adding polyphosphonate based as indicates that the microalgal symbionts were utilizing the phosphorus that has likely leached from biodegradation of these ass by associated bacteria sisma ventura et al 2022 many other studies indicated that symbiotic microalgae abundance and chlorophyll a concentration increased after phosphate addition hall et al 2018 pogoreutz et al 2018 in general many studies advocate that an imbalanced ratio of nutrients impacts coral physiology ferrier pages et al 2016 hall et al 2018 rosset et al 2017 wiedenmann et al 2013 highlighted that increased inorganic nitrogen levels led to a proliferation of symbiodinium that exhausted the inorganic phosphate reserves and was related to later detrimental health effects therefore the difference in symbiotic algae abundance compared to the control may be related to limited reserves of iron or other micronutrients after the proliferation of the population by the initial phosphate enrichment d angelo and wiedenmann 2014 and or oxidative stress additionally exposure to polyphosphonate based as increased total antioxidant capacity tac while also inducing oxidative damage to microalgal lipids during the first week table s1 fig 4 following the above it can be surmised that the endosymbiotic algae experienced oxidative stress in a short time of one week of as exposure as indicated by the changes in tac levels and an increase in oxidative damage fig 4 it can be concluded that the abundance of symbiotic algae decreased after polyphosphonate based exposure suggesting that oxidative stress might be a strong biological indicator of the impact of ass it should be highlighted that under severe oxidative stress namely when symbiotic algae produce excess reactive oxygen or nitrogen species ros rns the host often mitigates the stress by expelling the algal symbionts leading to coral bleaching downs et al 2002 3 3 effects of antiscalants on coral associated bacteria compared to the control one week of polyphosphonate based as led to a significant increase 59 in bacteria cell numbers fig 5 a by the second week bacteria cell numbers increased in both treatments 38 41 compared to control table s1 fig 5a after two weeks of exposure compared to the control polymer based as caused a significant 3 fold decrease in bacterial production table s1 fig 5b while polyphosphonates further increased the activity by 28 which however was not statistically significant it can be surmised that polymer based as can provide a source of labile carbon while polyphosphonate based as acts as a source of both dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus al ashhab et al 2022 ashfaq et al 2020 sisma ventura et al 2022 therefore biodegradation of both types of as by the microbial community has biochemically promoted bacterial growth an altered bacteria community can lead to a process named dysbiosis which has been shown to negatively impact the whole holobiont morris et al 2019 van oppen and blackall 2019 recent reports highlighted that antiscalants could undergo biodegradation and leach dissolved organic phosphorus sisma ventura et al 2022 enhancing bacterial activity belkin et al 2017 correspondingly it was reported that polyphosphonate based as enhanced the activity of bacteria found in symbiotic interactions with three types of hard corals petersen et al 2018 when combined with salinity increase indeed we can expect that the overall nutrient enrichment from as exposure varies between antiscalant type depending on the composition and on the biodegradation rate the degradation rate is lower in polyphosphonate based as compared to other common types of as al ashhab et al 2022 yet literature indicates that even in short periods of exposure to polyphosphonate ass the medium has increased content of phosphate belkin et al 2017 sisma ventura et al 2022 it is also important to highlight that the bacteria community of hard corals was never investigated regarding antiscalant exposure and biodegradation rate 3 4 holobiont fitness under antiscalants exposure a critical review by roberts et al 2010 highlighted that basic information on the ecotoxicological effects of commonly used antiscalants is needed the results of this study indicate that altered bacteria abundance and oxidative stress were the main drivers of the coral holobiont response to as exposure variations in the ph of the exposure water and its consequent physiological effects can be expected after antiscalant addition al ashhab et al 2022 sweity et al 2013 yu et al 2020 yet no difference in the ph of seawater between treatments means of 8 18 8 19 for the seawater and ass respectively moreover considering the lack of information about the actual formula of each antiscalant it is important to consider that these commercial products contain impurities that may be relevant drivers of the adverse effects different classes of ass increase organic carbon levels and promote bacteria growth sweity et al 2015 dissolved organic carbon was associated with higher bacterial growth tissue sloughing and mortality in corals kline et al 2006 phosphate in low levels can often benefit corals and its enrichment rarely induces strong adverse effects on corals however the dissolved organic phosphate levels that can be found in the brine plume after discharge of polyphosphonate based as were reported to be significantly higher up to 40 times than ambient seawater sisma ventura et al 2022 in a different study that exposed algae to ass phosphonates have likely impaired the assimilation of iron by complexation wang et al 2020 which in turn reduced growth and photosynthesis moreover boosted symbiotic algae populations from nutrient enrichment experiments often lead the to depletion of other micronutrients such as iron and trace vitamins d angelo and wiedenmann 2014 li et al 2020 wiedenmann et al 2013 it is also plausible that iron deficiency could have resulted from antiscalant complexation and or iron over consumption iron deficiency induces oxidative stress in terrestrial plants phytoplankton and coral algal symbionts leaden et al 2018 li et al 2020 shick et al 2011 in this study we tested concentrations of antiscalants that are commonly used in desalination plants belkin et al 2017 sisma ventura et al 2022 but further studies should explore the hypothesis that reduced as concentrations would minimize the environmental footprint of desalination facilities in sensitive areas such as coral reef ecosystems 4 conclusion our results shed new insights into the effects of brine waste on the physiology and vitality of montipora capricornis scleractinian coral highlighting the ecotoxicological potential of ass the exposure to both antiscalants affected the physiology of the holobiont which is mostly clear by the tissue damage reduction in polyp activity decreased photosynthetic efficiency increased bacteria abundance and oxidative stress after two weeks of exposure nonetheless since adding of as is required for swro it may be assumed that polymer based ass would be more environmentally coral friendly than polyphosphonate based ones if dosed at similar concentrations the polyphosphonate treatment led to more significant changes compared to control in the ecophysiology of all three holobiont compartments i e the animal host symbiotic microalgae and associated bacteria it is plausible that the observed impact was time dependent and that the effects recuperate or total demise would be different after longer exposure times therefore we stress that chronic exposure to these ass should be tested in dedicated experiments to determine the influence of chronic exposure on these holobiont responses in summary these results should be considered in desalination management around coral reefs considering the results of this first screening it is suggested to minimize the use of phosphorus based as thus reducing the risk of a chronic impact of desalination effluents on corals yet it is important to note that it will be necessary to test the effects of these chemicals on multiple coral species in larger mesocosms to definitively argue which antiscalant should be used in the vicinity of coral reefs the results of the present study can guide the choice of biological parameters to be monitored in future studies water scarcity is a global issue and since desalinated volumes are predicted to increase over time it is imperative to develop and apply approaches that monitor e g identify biomarkers of exposure and minimize the impacts of desalination effluents e g minimal liquid discharge on sensitive coastal ecosystems

15219,much attention has been paid to ca2 ion removal by biomineralization due to the dangers of ca2 on industrial processes and human health however ca2 removal from hypersaline water by biomineralization is quite difficult due to there being few halophilic bacteria tolerating higher salinities in this study free and immobilized virgibacillus massiliensis c halophilic bacteria exhibiting carbonic anhydrase activity were used to remove ca2 ions from water at different nacl concentrations with increasing nacl concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l ca2 ion concentrations in the presence of free bacteria and in two groups of immobilized bacteria for a period of 6 days sharply decreased from 1200 mg l to 219 562 mg l 71 214 mg l and 21 159 mg l respectively ca2 precipitation ratios were 55 81 82 94 and 87 98 respectively the humic acid like substances protein dna and polysaccharide released by the bacteria promoted the ca2 ion removal the immobilized bacteria were able to be recycled and precultured which would save industry costs and increase ca2 ion removal efficiency biological processes for ca2 ion removal include cell surface intracellular and extracellular biomineralization the biogenesis of calcium carbonate was proved by sem eds ftir xps and stable carbon isotope values this study provides insights into the effective removal of ca2 ions by biomineralization in hypersaline water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium removal biomineralization higher nacl concentrations virgibacillus massiliensis precipitation ratio softening of hypersaline water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the use of hypersaline water hw or seawater as an alternative to freshwater in industrial processes has increased in countries where freshwater is scarce hw has been widely used as a coolant in nuclear and thermal power plants the petrochemical industry and in steel production it has been reported that the qingdao power plant in china has been using hw such as seawater as a coolant for more than 85 years since at least 1936 yan et al 2022a however secondary ions like calcium ions ca2 are always present in hw and are very dangerous to industrial processes due to the lime scale that is easily formed by ca2 ions in cooling systems reverse osmosis plants mining and other industries thus resulting in increased industrial production costs and a decline in efficiency every year the replacement and repair of pipelines and equipment requires millions of dollars expenditure because of the scale problem in addition when particles of lime scale enter the stomach it reacts with hydrochloric acid and then releases ca2 ions and carbon dioxide co2 the former may lead to diseases such as kidney stones and ureteral stones and people with stomach ulcers may be at risk of stomach perforation from the effects of the co2 the concentration of ca2 ions should be decreased to a lower degree in hw to ensure safe industrial production and to protect human health there are four types of methods for removing ca2 ions from hw they are physical chemical physicochemical and biological methods li et al 2022 the first three methods have many disadvantages such as higher upfront industrial costs and a potential consequence of secondary contamination moreover ca2 ions are still present and cannot be recovered as a resource thus an economic and environmentally friendly biological method which not only easily removes ca2 ions from hw but also transforms soluble ca2 ions into a useful solid resource is urgently needed microbially induced calcium precipitation micp has been widely applied in many fields such as in bio cement production gebru et al 2021 improving well bore integrity and addressing thief zone permeability kirkland et al 2020 repairing cracks in concrete sun et al 2022 and wastewater treatment wang et al 2021 micp is an economic and environmentally friendly method to remove metal ions and has been a research hot spot in the field of wastewater treatment in recent years yan et al 2022a when using free bacteria long term exposure to higher concentrations of metal ions does inevitably affect cell growth and the physiological and biochemical metabolic activities of bacteria baldrian 2003 liao et al 2005 decreasing its long term application value and the removal efficiency of metal ions in water therefore seeking an effective recycling method to increase the long term application value would be a major breakthrough in the application of biomineralization for the removal of metal ions immobilized bacteria always have a much higher ability than free bacteria to remove metal ions from a polluted environment bouabidi et al 2018 partovinia and rasekh 2018 pseudomonas sp wz39 bacteria immobilized by fungal sponge carriers can remove 72 ca2 ions wang et al 2021 and a chromium cr resistant microbial flora immobilized by humic acid coated nano ferrous sulfide fes can remove 99 cr vi tan et al 2020 both much higher than using free bacteria halophilic bacteria have a great application potential in the field of wastewater treatment however experiments using immobilized halophiles to remove metal ions in hw have rarely been reported the dms6 halophile immobilized by activated carbon fiber can remove 99 95 of ca2 ions at 30 g l sodium chloride nacl concentration li et al 2022 using immobilized halovibrio mesolongii hmy2 halophiles ca2 ion precipitation ratios increased to 79 89 with a variation of mg ca ratios yan et al 2022a at 100 g l nacl concentration the main reason for the significant difference in the ca2 ion removal ratio is the higher nacl concentration as well as the different species of bacteria since there are only a few species of halophiles that can survive in an extremely hypersaline environment there are only a handful of studies on the removal of ca2 ions by immobilized halophiles from waters with higher nacl concentrations such as 150 g l and 200 g l thus experiments using immobilized halophiles to remove ca2 ions in hw with different nacl concentrations are urgently needed to decrease industrial costs the re utilization of immobilized bacteria is also worthy of examination it has been reported that the protein content in halophile extracellular polymers eps increases with increasing nacl concentrations and also that the contents of aspartic acid and glutamic acid increase correspondingly han et al 2022 these changes may also affect the nucleation and growth of ca bearing minerals because eps can act as nucleation sites in the biomineralization process hence there is a need to examine how the eps components change with the variation of nacl concentrations what effect the various eps components have on ca2 ion removal and how to prove the biogenesis of ca bearing minerals precipitated when analyzing ultrathin slices of bacteria by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem some nanocrystalline particles are observed in the eps cell wall periplasmic space and cytoplasm in a biomineralized system if the biomass of the bacteria is large enough the total amount of ca2 ions diffusing into the bacterial cells would also be large so facilitating the removal of ca2 ions from hw study of the intracellular biomineralization of halophiles is also helpful to further document the precise reasons for the removal of ca2 ions from hw in this study the removal of ca2 ions in hw nacl concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l by free and immobilized halophiles were studied and the optimal immobilization conditions were analyzed using the six factors and five levels of the orthogonal test and response surface method moreover ca2 ion removal by recycled and precultured immobilized bacteria was also investigated the detailed reasons for ca2 ion removal was further explored by examining cell surface biomineralization and intracellular and extracellular biomineralization to further examine the mechanism of ca2 ion adsorption and ca2 ion biomineralization the components in the eps were analyzed and the physiological and biochemical properties of the bacterial strain were studied finally the biogenesis of the harvested ca bearing minerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria was also confirmed and the characteristics of these minerals were also compared this study provides insights into ca2 ion removal from hw with different nacl concentrations through biomineralization and the results have application to industrial processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain and culture medium virgibacillus massiliensis c bacteria were isolated from the yinjiashan saltworks qingdao china and preserved in the geomicrobiology laboratory in shandong university of science and technology qingdao china the methods used to preserve the bacteria are as follows 30 glycerol

v massiliensis c bacteria and other bacteria in the ncbi genbank was compared and the phylogenetic tree of the v massiliensis c strain was constructed by mega 7 0 software through the neighbor joining method han et al 2022 2 3 physiological and biochemical characteristics of v massiliensis c bacteria the optimal nacl concentration for bacterial survival was determined by using the following nacl concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l v massiliensis c bacterial concentrations and ph values were measured with a spectrophotometer 721 g china at 600 nm and a ph meter phs 25 china ammonium nh4 concentrations ph values calculated via nh4 concentrations and carbonic anhydrase ca activities were also investigated according to zhuang et al 2018 the ca activity refers to the amount of p nitrophenol μmol produced per min in 1 l of the culture system and one unit of ca activity was set as μmol min l namely u eps were extracted according to the method reported by yan et al 2020 and the contents of dna polysaccharide and protein in eps were analyzed as described by zhang et al 2007 the humic acids and tyrosine and tryptophan protein like substances in eps were identified by the three

reported by yan et al 2022a and the detailed steps were as follows 20 ml of bacterial suspension od600 1 0 was added into 80 ml of the solution containing polyvinyl alcohol 3 g sodium alginate 3 g and nacl 5 g and the mixture was then mixed well and squeezed into the solution containing nacl 50 g l boric acid h3bo3 40 g l and calcium chloride cacl2 20 g l with a 20 ml syringe solidified at 4 c for 24 h to further optimize the above immobilization conditions six variables at five different levels were investigated fig s1 namely h3bo3 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l sodium alginate 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l polyvinyl alcohol 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l cacl2 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l v massiliensis c bacteria 1 5 10 20 and 30 volume ratio and the cross linking time 3 6 12 24 and 36 h the nacl concentration in the immobilization system was 50 g l on the 2nd day and 5th day the effect of the six variables on the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was determined and expressed by the w value in general a larger w value indicates a greater effect of that variable on the ca2 ion precipitation ratio yan et al 2022a according to the w values three variables can be selected from the six on the 2nd day and 5th day respectively the optimal conditions of the selected three factors were obtained with the response surface method as for the other factors the concentrations time at the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were used when investigating the optimal immobilization conditions the first and second group of optimal immobilization conditions were obtained according to the ca2 ion precipitation ratios on the 2nd day and 5th day 2 5 ca2 ion removal by free and immobilized bacteria at different nacl concentrations the ability of free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria to remove ca2 ions under the conditions of different nacl concentrations namely 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l was determined respectively the solutions used to perform the experiments of ca2 ion biomineralization were composed of beef extract 5 0 g l tryptone 10 0 g l ca2 1200 mg l and different amounts of nacl 5 ml of sodium carbonate na2co3 1 mol l and 3 ml of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 1 mol l were added in 150 ml of the above mentioned solutions to keep the ph balance all the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to 6 8 to avoid the production of minerals under the physicochemical conditions the first experimental group was inoculated with 1 bacterial solution od600 1 0 and to the control group was added with sterilized nacl solutions 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l at the same volume ratio to compare the difference in ca2 ion removal ratios between the free and immobilized bacteria 50 pellets of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria prepared with the first and second immobilization method were added into the biomineralization system to replace the free bacteria namely the second and third experimental group all solutions were cultured in a thermostatic shaker hzq f160 china at 120 rpm and 37 c at certain intervals 1 ml of the liquid was taken out from the above solution to measure the ca2 ion concentration by a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas tas 986 china the precipitation ratios and precipitate rates were calculated as reported by yan et al 2022a and the detailed equations were as follows 1 a c o c i c o 100 2 b c o c i t i 100 a precipitation ratio co the initial ca2 ion

immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria were determined by ibm spss 26 statistics software 2 6 re utilization and preculture of the immobilized bacteria after one cycle of ca2 ion removal the immobilized bacteria which had the higher ca2 ion removal ratio were re utilized to remove ca2 ions in the second cycle after being washed with a sterilized nacl solution 50 g l the ph values were also measured the differences in the ca2 ion concentration ca2 ion precipitation ratio and ca2 ion precipitation rate under the conditions of immobilized bacteria between the first and second cycle of ca2 ion removal were also analyzed by ibm spss 26 statistics software the morphology of immobilized bacteria sodium alginate pellets before and after biomineralization was also analyzed by fesem at the same time the immobilized bacteria prepared under the optimal immobilization conditions according to the ca2 ion precipitation ratio on the 5th day were precultured in the medium beef extract 5 0 g l tryptone 10 0 g l nacl 50 g l for one day washed with sterilized nacl solution 50 g l and then inoculated into the biomineralization system for ca2 ion removal the difference in ca2 ion removal efficiency between the precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria was also analyzed by ibm spss 26 statistics software the changes of ca activities under the action of precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria were also compared 2 7 surface biomineralization and intracellular biomineralization ultrathin slices of v massiliensis c bacteria were prepared as reported by han et

results and discussion 3 1 16s rdna identification and physiological and biochemical characteristics of bacteria c bacteria living in extremely hypersaline environments are important microbial resources for the removal of ca2 ions in hw giovanella et al 2020 in this study the bacteria isolated from the yinjiashan salt works qingdao china were identified by homology comparison of their 16s rdna sequence the 16s rdna sequence of this strain accession number om339847 was 1466 bp in length and the phylogenetic tree fig s2 showed that this strain was most closely related to virgibacillus massiliensis therefore the bacterial strain is identified as virgibacillus massiliensis it has been reported that biomineralization is one of the most popular biological approaches in metal ion removal because of its advantages of higher efficiency lower cost and no secondary pollution zhang et al 2019 additionally the effective biomineralization activity of each species existing in highly diverse microbial communities in nature is different and should also be further studied li et al 2013 therefore the characteristics of this bacterial strain were further studied to explore their ability to remove ca2 ions in hw with different nacl concentrations by biomineralization the v massiliensis c bacterium is about 1 0 µm in length and 0 5 µm in width fig s3a the gram staining result is positive as shown by the purple color fig s3b after being cultured for 24 h the v massiliensis c bacterial concentration at 50 g l of nacl was significantly higher than that at 10 100 150 200 250 and 300 g l of nacl p 0 01 table s1 indicating that the optimal nacl concentration for v massiliensis c bacterial growth was 50 g l fig 1 a at 50 g l of nacl concentration ph increased sharply with increasing bacterial concentration before 72 h most importantly ph still increased sharply to 9 1 during the decline stage of cell concentration from 96 h to the end of the experiment fig 1b the ph increase promotes ca2 ion precipitation in a hypersaline fluid system when precipitating certain metal ions in water alkaline reagents such as sodium hydroxide naoh and na2co3 are always used to increase ph e g struvite precipitation in eutrophic water and this results in higher industrial costs it has been found that bacteria can precipitate struvite through increasing ph values in eutrophic water through their activities wang et al 2022b thereby decreasing the industrial costs li et al 2017 luo et al 2018 in this study ca2 ion precipitation induced by v massiliensis c bacteria could also be economically significant since the metabolic activity of this bacteria also resulted in a higher ph value similar to the struvite precipitation induced by bacteria the reason for the ph increase in the decline stage of bacterial growth deserved further study because the available nitrogen and carbon sources in the liquid medium necessary for microbial growth were used up and ammonia nh3 which plays an important role in ph increase was not released at this stage zhuang et al 2018 the following reaction shows the role of nh3 3 n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h it can be seen from fig 1c that the ammonium nh4 ion concentration increases sharply before 96 h and stays almost stable from 96 h to the end of this experiment the decline stage indicating that ammonia nh3 was not produced during the decline stage moreover the ph increased to 8 3 or so fig 1c based on the nh3 released by v massiliensis c bacteria whereas the ph value was 9 1 under the action of total metabolic activity of v massiliensis c bacteria fig 1b meaning that some other factors except nh3 were affecting the ph increase ph 9 1 during the decline stage of cell concentration in fact even if the bacteria were dead the activity of certain enzymes could still have taken place due to the presence of the stable messenger ribonucleic acid mrna of this enzyme in the culture system this kind of enzyme could still be synthesized by the stable mrna in the decline stage and so it is named as a continuously synthesized enzyme ca is almost certainly present in all the organisms and its significant role played in biomineralization has been reported by many researchers zhuang et al 2018 the ca activity was further examined and the results show that it was 4 8 u almost unchanged in the time range of 70 230 h fig 1d suggesting that higher ca activity was still present even during the decline stage of bacterial growth therefore the ca in this study could be considered a continuously synthesized enzyme the reaction of co2 hydration is very slow in the absence of ca catalysis thatcher et al 1998 and the catalytic rate of co2 hydration under the action of different types of ca can be increased to 104 106 s lindskog 1997 the following reaction of co2 hydration can occur 4 c o 2 h 2 o ca relased by bacteria h 2 c o 3 considering the higher ph of 8 3 resulted from the metabolic activity of v massiliensis c bacteria in the initial stage the product carbonic acid h2co3 cannot have existed in such an alkaline condition then the following reactions of h2co3 hydrolysis can occur 5 h 2 c o 3 o h hco 3 h 2 o hco 3 o h co 3 2 h 2 o from the above reactions it can be seen that a large number of bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 ions will be produced in this study the higher ph value of 9 1 8 3 may have resulted from the increasing co3 2 ion concentrations due to the fact that the ph of a saturated na2co3 solution is 11 6 much higher than the 8 3 of the saturated nahco3 solution at normal temperature and pressure moreover the production of hco3 and co3 2 ions can increase the supersaturation of calcium carbonate caco3 further promoting the precipitation of caco3 and facilitating the removal of ca2 from hw the detailed reaction is as follows 6 hco 3 co 3 2 o h 2 c a 2 2 cac o 3 h 2 o 3 2 optimization of immobilization conditions microbially induced calcite precipitation micp has been widely used in soil remediation and improvement co2 sequestration concrete crack repair and wastewater treatment hu et al 2021 based on this point in this study v massiliensis c bacteria were also used to remove ca2 ions in hw at different nacl concentrations because this strain has a stronger ability for micp in order to better remove ca2 ions in hw at different nacl concentrations the effect of free and immobilized bacteria on ca2 ion removal needed to be compared firstly the immobilized bacteria were prepared according to the optimal immobilization methods the components used to prepare the immobilized bacteria include h2bo3 polyvinyl alcohol cacl2 and sodium alginate cacl2 is used as a curing agent and h3bo3 as a cross linking agent the monodiol gel is formed by chemical reaction of h3bo3 with water soluble polyvinyl alcohol the sodium ions in sodium alginate are replaced by ca2 ions in cacl2 to form calcium alginate which is insoluble in water forming a cross linked gel system with eggshell structure the immobilization conditions were optimized by performing the six factors five levels orthogonal experiments the results show that under the action of the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria for 2 days 3 sodium alginate 3 polyvinyl alcohol 3 5 h3bo3 solution 1 cacl2 21 9 h cross linking time and 10 bacterial solution were the best conditions the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 94 15 92 91 93 58 94 14 93 41 and 93 35 respectively the w values of six factors were 0 1623 0 0628 0 3263 0 2272 0 0280 and 0 1932 respectively fig 2a c according to the largest three w values 0 3263 0 2272 and 0 1932 cacl2 h3bo3 solution and cross linking time were selected out and the optimal immobilization conditions determined through the response surface method were 1 3 49 and 21 9 h respectively fig 2g i on the 5th day the best conditions were 3 sodium alginate 3 polyvinyl alcohol 4 h3bo3 solution 1 cacl2 18 h cross linking time and 20 bacterial solution the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 98 60 98 31 96 77 97 28 96 80 and 96 72 respectively the w values of 6 factors were 0 2072 0 0832 0 2447 0 0106 0 2251 and 0 3953 respectively fig 2d f according to the largest three w values 0 3953 0 2447 and 0 2251 cross linking time cacl2 and bacterial solution were selected out and the optimal immobilization conditions determined through the response surface method were 18 h 1 and 20 respectively fig 2j l thus two kinds of optimal immobilization conditions were determined and two groups of immobilized bacteria were prepared according to these two kinds of optimal immobilization conditions and used to remove ca2 ions at different nacl concentrations after the above immobilized bacteria were prepared the next stage of the work was to compare the efficiency of ca2 ion removal in hw by the free and immobilized bacteria 3 3 ca2 ion removal by free and immobilized bacteria mineral scaling is the main challenge of membrane desalination technology in the process of hw desalination the solute concentration exceeds the solubility after the hw is concentrated resulting in the precipitation of mineral scales on the membrane surface and further blocking of the membrane holes the mineral scale reduces membrane lifespan increasing the industrial costs of the membrane desalination technology tong et al 2019 ca2 ion is one of the factors forming the mineral scales the industrial costs would be greatly decreased if ca2 ions could be removed under the action of bacteria in hw before desalination thus research on the removal of ca2 ions induced by bacteria from hw at different nacl concentrations was undertaken the changes in ca2 ion concentrations under the action of free v massiliensis c bacteria fig 3 a1 show that at different nacl concentrations ca2 ion concentrations sharply decreased from the original concentration of 1200 mg l in the first two days to 219 562 mg l on the 6th day and finally to 116 247 mg l on the 14th day it has been reported that ca2 ion concentration decreased from 400 to 18 mg l under the action of the halophile rhodococcus erythropolis after 14 days arias et al 2017 much lower than the 116 247 mg l in our study the reason may be related to the lower ability of v massiliensis c bacteria in ca2 ion removal or due to the fact that the initial ca2 ion concentration was 1200 mg l in our study much higher than the 400 mg l of arias et al 2017 at each day ca2 ion concentrations at 200 g l of nacl concentration were obviously higher than those at 150 g l of nacl concentration indicating that a higher nacl concentration indeed hindered the precipitation of ca2 ions how to solve this is an important problem under the action of immobilized bacteria the inhibition effect of higher nacl concentration on ca2 ion precipitation was significantly reduced moreover ca2 ion concentrations decreased to 71 214 mg l and 21 159 mg l with increasing nacl concentrations under the action of these two groups of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria on the 6th day fig 3a2 and a3 much lower than 116 247 mg l for the free bacteria p 0 01 fig 3a1 suggesting that the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria prepared according to the optimal immobilization conditions attained by the ca2 precipitation ratios on the 5th day were most suitable to ca2 ion removal in this study the best result was that ca2 ion concentrations decreased from 1200 to 21 mg l at 50 g l of nacl concentration for 6 days under the action of the second group of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria close to the final ca2 ion concentration of 18 mg l under the effect of free r erythropolis for 14 days this indicates that the removal efficiency of ca2 ions could be greatly enhanced under the action of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria compared with free v massiliensis c bacteria and that the immobilized bacteria could make up for the poor ca2 ion removal ability of free bacteria in hw may be due to the protection of the bacteria by the sodium alginate gel beads bouabidi et al 2018 on the 6th day ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 55 81 under the action of free bacteria much lower than 82 94 and 87 98 under the action of immobilized bacteria fig 3b1 b3 the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 81 94 and 98 under the action of free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria two groups at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 3b1 b3 higher than those at other nacl concentrations this may be due to the fact that 50 g l is the optimal nacl concentration for the bacterial growth fig 1a this also suggests that the immobilized bacteria play a much more important role than the free bacteria in ca2 ion precipitation p 0 01 at 200 g l of nacl concentration ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 55 82 and 87 under the action of free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria fig 3b1 b3 indicating that there was an extremely significant difference in ca2 ion removal in a hypersaline environment between the immobilized bacteria and the free bacteria p 0 01 compared with the free bacteria ca2 ion precipitation ratios could be significantly increased at higher nacl concentrations in the presence of the immobilized bacteria this may be due to the higher bacterial activity resulting from the protective effects of the embedding gel sodium alginate halophiles adapted to a hypersaline environment can be used to remove ca2 ions by micp rivadeneyra et al 2006 rhodococcus erythropolis tn24f cultivated in a culture medium supplemented with 35 g l of nacl could precipitate 95 of the soluble ca2 ions for 7 days by forming calcium carbonate minerals arias et al 2017 the much higher precipitation ratio indicates that r erythropolis tn24f has a stronger ability for ca2 removal than the v massiliensis c bacteria in this study because ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 55 81 under the action of free v massiliensis c bacteria with increasing nacl concentrations from 10 to 200 g l however when using the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria ca2 ion precipitation ratios were able to reach 94 and 98 at a higher nacl concentration of 50 g l on the 6th day close to the result of r erythropolis tn24f 95 at 35 g l of nacl for 7 days thus ca2 ion removal ratios could be greatly increased under the condition that the free bacteria were changed into the immobilized bacteria even if the free bacteria had a lower ability of ca2 ion removal in hw as for the ca2 ion precipitation rates on the 6th day the result was similar to that of the ca2 ion precipitation ratios maybe due to the fact that the optimal nacl concentration is 50 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ion rate is the highest at 50 g l of nacl concentration on the 6th day and is 165 188 and 196 mg l d for the free and two kinds of immobilized bacteria fig 3c1 c3 respectively this result also suggests that the immobilized bacteria are superior to the free bacteria in terms of ca2 ion precipitation especially at higher nacl concentrations p 0 01 to further confirm the significant role played by v massiliensis c bacteria in ca2 ion removal two groups of control experiments were also performed compared with the experimental group inoculated with free bacteria the first control group used nacl solution with a concentration corresponding to the nacl concentration in each group to replace the bacterial solution fig s4a1 s4b1 and s4c1 compared with the experimental group inoculated with immobilized bacteria the second control group was using sodium alginate gel beads without any bacteria to replace the original immobilized bacteria fig s4a2 s4b2 and s4c2 without any bacteria ca2 ion concentrations slowly decreased from 1200 mg l fig s4a1 and s4a2 on the 4th day ca2 ion concentrations were still higher than 1100 mg l fig s4a1 and s4a2 significantly higher than those in the presence of free and immobilized bacteria fig 3a1 a3 indicating that free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria indeed played an important role in ca2 ion removal fig s4b1 and s4b2 revealed that ca2 ion precipitation ratios were not beyond 10 on the 4th day in the absence of bacteria significantly much lower than those in the presence of free and immobilized bacteria fig 3b1 b3 ca2 ion precipitation rates were also much lower in the absence of any bacteria not beyond 60 mg l d fig s4c1 and s4c2 also proving that it was the bacteria not the physical and chemical factors that significantly removed the ca2 ions from the hw it has been reported that the removal efficiency of metallic ions induced by bacteria is significantly higher than that treated by physical and chemical methods zhang et al 2022 because bacteria do not only supply nucleation sites but also provide an alkaline environment to promote the further growth of metallic minerals stocks fischer et al 1999 our experiments showed the same results 3 4 changes of humic acid like substances in eps with salinity in view of the broad structural diversity of eps and their ability to bind metal ions and remove them from the environment there has been increasing interest in their possible use in bioremediation pal and paul 2008 giovanella et al 2020 eps were separated from v massiliensis c bacteria and analyzed by eem spectroscopy to further explore the detailed reason for ca2 ion removal in hw according to the eem fluorescence spectra protein like substances regions i and ii can be observed in all eps samples shown in fig 4 region i is located in the range of excitation wavelength 250 340 nm and emission wavelength 380 nm indicating that tyrosine and tryptophan protein like substances are present in the eps wang et al 2022a region ii is distributed in the excitation wavelength range 200 250 nm and emission wavelength range 380 nm suggesting that all groups of eps contain the aromatic protein substances wang et al 2022a region iii iv v in the range of excitation wavelength 250 400 nm and emission wavelength 370 520 nm reveal that humic acid like substances are present wang et al 2022a at 50 g l nacl concentration the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was the highest this may be due to the fact that a large number of humic acid like substances were released by bacteria moreover more kinds of humic acid like substances were produced at such a nacl concentration than at other nacl concentrations eem fluorescence spectra fig 4 show that there are three areas indicating the presence of humic acid like substances at 50 g l of nacl concentration and with increasing nacl concentrations there are only two areas of humic acid like substances at 150 g l of nacl concentration moreover there are no areas proving the release of humic acid like substances from bacteria at 200 g l of nacl concentration it has been reported that organomineralization is produced probably via the permineralization of non living organic substrates adsorbing dissolved metal humate complexes shen and neuweiler 2018 directly suggesting that humic acid like substances played an important role in the adsorption of dissolved metal ions in this study the humic acid like substances could be deprotonated in the alkaline conditions created by the bacteria thus promoting the adsorption of ca2 ions stevenson humic acid was used as a simplified model in this study stevenson 1982 the detailed reactions 7 were as follows 7 in addition the more humic acid like substances were released the greater the number of ca2 ions adsorbed resulting in ca2 ion precipitation ratios being the highest at 50 g l of nacl concentration it has also been reported that humus like substances can act as the communication medium between bacteria and minerals affecting electron transfer between microorganisms and extracellular electron receptors and promoting the formation of minerals wang et al 2022b 3 5 recycling of the immobilized bacteria the lack of bacterial re utilization may strongly affect the wide application of biomineralization induced by free bacteria zhang et al 2021 a very significant advantage of immobilized bacteria is that they can be recycled in this study the immobilized bacteria prepared at the optimal immobilization conditions according to the ca2 ion precipitation ratio on the 5th day were recycled to analyze the ca2 ion removal efficiency the results show that the recycled immobilized bacteria still played an important role in the ph increase and ph could increase to 8 24 8 06 8 01 7 88 and 7 79 on the 1st day with increasing nacl concentrations from 10 to 200 g l fig 5 a still much higher than 7 26 at 24 h caused by free bacteria at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 1b on the 7th day 168 h or so the ph increased to beyond 8 0 some beyond 8 5 at different nacl concentrations fig 5a slightly lower than 8 56 8 72 in the time range of 150 174 h caused by free bacteria at a 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 1b this result suggests that the immobilized bacteria could be recycled in the removal of ca2 ions from hw at different nacl concentrations due to its significant role in ph increase the results about the recycling of immobilized bacteria show that ca2 ion concentration could sharply decrease to 337 mg l at the highest nacl concentration 200 g l on the 6th day fig 5b still significantly lower than 546 mg l fig 3a1 under the action of free bacteria at the same nacl concentration and the same time p 0 01 indicating that the efficiency of ca2 ion removal by the recycled immobilized bacteria was still much higher than that by the free bacteria on the 5th day the ca2 concentration decreased to lower than 200 mg l at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 5b satisfying the requirement of industrial circulating cooling water the national standard gb t15454 2009 china on the 6th day the ca2 ion precipitation ratio reached 87 at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 5c higher than the 81 fig 3b1 at the same nacl concentration under the action of free bacteria especially at the highest nacl concentration of 200 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ratio reached 71 fig 5c much higher than the 55 fig 3b1 in the presence of free bacteria indicating that the difference in ca2 ion precipitation ratio between the recycled immobilized bacteria and free bacteria at lower nacl concentration was far less than that at higher nacl concentrations thus the immobilized bacteria can be recycled and still play a significant role in ca2 ion removal the results of ca2 ion precipitation rates fig 5d were similar to those of ca2 ion precipitation ratios also further confirming the advantages of the recycled immobilized bacteria however when comparing the ca2 ion removal efficiency between the newly prepared immobilized bacteria fig 3a3 b3 c3 and the recycled immobilized bacteria fig 5b d it was found that the efficiency under the action of the recycled immobilized bacteria was slightly lower that is to say the recycled immobilized bacteria had a higher activity in ca2 ion removal than the free bacteria but a lower activity than the immobilized bacteria used for the first time to explore further the detailed reason for the decrease in ca2 ion removal efficiency when using the recycled immobilized bacteria the morphology of immobilized bacteria before and after biomineralization was examined fig 5e shows the morphology of immobilized bacteria before biomineralization in addition to bacteria marked by yellow circle there are also a large number of nano scale marked by yellow arrow and micron scale holes marked by red circle inside the sodium alginate gel beads which was conducive to the diffusion of ca2 ions from the liquid culture to the gel beads and also conducive to the release of bacterial metabolites into the liquid culture after the biomineralization the sodium alginate beads were encased by dense minerals fig 5f these could inhibit the diffusion of ca2 ions and metabolites of bacteria thus ca2 ion precipitation ratios under the effect of the recycled immobilized bacteria decreased compared to the newly prepared immobilized bacteria in view of the oxidative decomposition of sodium alginate by sodium hypochlorite only the mineralized shells with holes were left fig 5f fig 5g shows the incomplete mineralized shells and fig 5f shows a part of some mineralized shells fig 5i shows that many micron scale mineral spherulites formed inside the sodium alginate beads and the enlarged figure fig 5j shows that there are many linear indentations left by microorganisms shedding from the surface of the mineral spherulites the formation of minerals on the surface and inside the sodium alginate gel beads inhibited the transfer of ca2 ions and ca resulting in a slightly lower ca2 ion removal efficiency when using the recycled immobilized bacteria compared to the newly prepared immobilized bacteria based on the higher ca2 ion removal efficiency under the action of the recycled immobilized bacteria compared to the free bacteria the recycled immobilized bacteria still have the potential to remove ca2 ions in hw biomineralization of lead pb2 in wastewater by bacterial re utilization has been studied and the results show that the removal efficiency of pb2 ions increased continuously after the immobilized bacteria were washed by nitric acid hno3 zhang et al 2021 the method of hno3 washing may also be suitable to the re utilization of the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria to further increase ca2 ion removal efficiency this work will be performed in the future 3 6 preculture of the immobilized bacteria chen et al 2021 studied the significant difference in fermentative hydrogen production between the immobilized and free bacteria and found that the hydrogen yield was enhanced by immobilized bacteria due to the favorable micro environment for bacteria in immobilized beads our results also prove that the immobilized bacteria have a stronger ability to remove ca2 ions than the free bacteria all these studies reveal the advantages of immobilized bacteria in addition to this point studies about increasing the activity of immobilized bacteria have rarely been reported it is worth studying whether the immobilized bacteria can improve their activity after preculture in this study the changes of ca2 ion removal efficiency under the action of the precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria were also examined the results show that on the 6th day ca2 ion concentrations decreased to 219 182 175 109 and 67 mg l at nacl concentration 200 150 100 10 and 50 g l under the action of the precultured immobilized bacteria fig 6 a1 and 252 210 202 161 88 mg l for the un precultured immobilized bacteria fig 6a2 indicating that the precultured immobilized bacteria have a higher ca2 ion removal efficiency than the un precultured bacteria at the optimal nacl concentration 50 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was 94 fig 6b1 and the ca2 ion precipitation rate was 188 mg l d fig 6c1 in the presence of precultured immobilized bacteria on the 6th day higher than 92 fig 6b2 and 185 mg l d fig 6c2 under the action of un precultured immobilized bacteria at the highest nacl concentration 200 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was 81 fig 6b1 and the ca2 ion precipitation rate was 163 mg l d fig 6c1 in the presence of precultured immobilized bacteria on the 6th day higher than 79 fig 6b2 and 158 mg l d fig 6c2 under the action of un precultured immobilized bacteria these results suggest that the precultured immobilized bacteria are superior to the un precultured immobilized bacteria at 10 150 and 200 g l nacl concentration ca2 ion precipitation ratios on the 6th day were much higher in the presence of the precultured immobilized bacteria than in the presence of the un precultured immobilized bacteria p 0 01 and 0 05 table s2 as for the reason of the higher ca2 ion precipitation ratio under the action of the precultured immobilized bacteria maybe ca activity played a significant role the inset in fig 6b2 shows the difference in ca activity between the precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria at the optimal nacl concentration it can be concluded that ca activity of the precultured immobilized bacteria reached the maximum of 7 3 u on the 3rd day much higher than the maximum value 4 9 u of the un precultured immobilized bacteria on the 2nd day moreover from the 3rd to the 6th day the ca activity of the precultured immobilized bacteria was also higher than that of the un precultured immobilized bacteria thus if increasing the efficiency of ca2 ion removal is required preculture of the immobilized bacteria may be a good way 3 7 process and mechanism of ca2 ion removal the cell surface and intracellular cytoplasm are able to provide nucleation sites promoting the formation of ca bearing biominerals and further facilitating the ca2 ion removal to explore the process and mechanism of ca2 ion removal further the surface and intracellular and extracellular biomineralization of ca2 ions were studied and the results are as follows 3 7 1 cell surface biomineralization it has been reported that citrobacter can produce a great number of hydrogen phosphate ions and remove metal ions from solutions through the formation of minerals on the bacterial cell surface macaskie et al 1987 in this study when analyzing the ultrathin slices of v massiliensis c bacteria harvested in the process of ca2 ion removal particles in the shape of fibers were observed on the cell surface fig 7 similar to minerals formed on the cell surface reported by macaskie et al 1987 the comparison of mineral morphology between the bright fig 7a and dark fields fig 7b reveals that the fiber shaped particles may be minerals due to the fact that the minerals in the dark field are bright the elements ca c o na n p and s shown in fig 7j prove that the v massiliensis c bacteria have attracted these elements the ca c and o elements have likely originated from the fiber shaped minerals na will be from the culture medium and n p and s will have come from the cell itself the elemental mapping results show that the fiber shaped minerals indeed contain ca c and o fig 7c e further study would be needed to identify the mineral phase it has been reported that molecular composition of dissolved organic matter dom differs significantly with salinity and microorganisms can explain the dom composition jiang et al 2022 according to this point eps of v massiliensis c bacteria were isolated and the concentration of polysaccharides proteins and dna were determined fig 7k the results show that with increasing nacl concentrations dna and protein concentrations increased sharply and there was a significant difference in concentration between 0 and 50 g l 50 and 200 g l and 0 and 200 g l of nacl p 0 01 tables s3 and s4 the presence of dna and protein suggests that these components in eps can adsorb a large number of ca2 ions facilitating the nucleation of ca2 ions there the polysaccharide concentration was the least at the optimal nacl concentration 50 g l and much higher at other nacl concentrations p 0 01 table s5 indicating that in a situation of adversity the bacteria could produce more polysaccharide to survive the changes in the eps components correspond well to those reported by han et al 2022 suggesting that variations in the environmental conditions also result in changes in eps components hence affecting ca2 ion removal as for the protein there are always 20 kinds of amino acids that act as the monomer for protein synthesis except for arginine and lysine the isoelectric points of all the other amino acids are less than 9 0 in the alkaline environment created by microorganisms all amino acids except arginine and lysine become negatively charged especially aspartic acid and glutamic acid as a result most proteins also become negatively charged in this environment it has been reported that acidic amino acids such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid in the eps of halophiles increase with increasing nacl concentrations leading to more cooh qiu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 the changes in acidic amino acids in eps of v massiliensis c bacteria with increasing nacl concentrations will be further studied in the future dna is a long chain of many deoxynucleotides connected to each other by 3 5 phosphodiester bonds in a certain sequence of bases 5 phosphoric acid groups of dna are deprotonated in an alkaline environment and also become negatively charged in essence polysacharides are long chains formed by polymerization of monosaccharide molecules through glycosidic bonds co c some polysaccharides have many hydroxyl groups and hydroxyl groups will lose the proton in such an alkaline condition and then polysaccharides also carry a large number of negative charges the negatively charged humic acid like substances 3 4 section protein dna and polysaccharides in eps could adsorb a large number of ca2 ions increasing the supersaturation of calcium carbonate minerals and conducive to the removal of ca2 ions the area of fiber shaped minerals on the cell surface selected by the yellow circle in fig 8 a was further analyzed by saed and hrtem saed results show that there were many diffraction spots fig 8b indicating that the selected area had good crystalline structures and that eps of v massiliensis c bacteria can act as the nucleation sites the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ were 3 8542 3 0356 2 8449 2 2823 2 0959 1 9286 1 9131 1 8719 and 1 6249 corresponding well to the indices hkl for 012 104 006 113 202 024 018 116 and 211 respectively indicating that the crystals nucleated on the eps were calcite pdf 83 1762 two sites were also selected from a larger mineral fig 8c to be analyzed by hrtem and the results show that the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ were 2 8441 fig 8d and 2 2840 fig 8e corresponding well to hkl 006 and 113 of calcite pdf 83 1762 it has been reported that bacteria can act as nucleation sites and so reduce the concentrations of metal ions in solution by inducing the nucleation and precipitation of minerals mahasti et al 2017 the formation of calcite on the cell surface of v massiliensis c bacteria is in line with the above mentioned results reported by macaskie et al 1987 also facilitating the removal of ca2 ions in hw 3 7 2 intracellular biomineralization it has been reported that cr iii can be detected inside bacterial cells by tem eds analyses using thin section technology chen et al 2012 suggesting that metal ions can be transferred into cells from the water to further explore the process and mechanism of ca2 ion removal intracellular biomineralization was also studied from the mapping of the elements n p and s the outline of v massiliensis c bacteria can be discerned fig 9 besides these elements others present include ca c o and na fig 9a the presence of ca c and o suggest that there might be some minerals formed inside the cell thus the light area inside the cell was analyzed further by hrtem and saed fig 10 a is the enlarged part of the light area inside the v massiliensis c bacteria four areas were selected fig 10b for analyses by hrtem and saed the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ are 3 0310 fig 10c 3 0360 fig 10d 2 8420 fig 10e and 2 4950 fig 10f corresponding well to the indices for 104 104 006 and 110 of calcite pdf 83 1762 the saed results fig 10g show that the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ are 3 8558 3 0343 2 8432 2 2843 2 0924 1 9282 1 9124 1 8741 and 1 4723 corresponding well to hkl 012 104 006 113 202 024 018 116 and 125 of calcite pdf 83 1762 respectively the formation of this intracellular calcite also contributes to the removal of ca2 in hw always neglected by most researchers zhang et al 2022 also found that the intracellular lead pb2 content of lysinibacillus increases gradually in the process of biomineralization with increasing time directly proving that pb2 ions can diffuse from the water into the bacterial cells our results are in line with the conclusions of zhang et al 2022 more and more ca2 ions diffused into the cells and the intracellular supersaturation was clearly reached such that intracellular calcite was formed it has been reported that intracellular crystalline aragonite can be formed inside bacillus subtilis daniel 1 bacteria due to the diffusion of ca2 and magnesium ions mg2 yan et al 2021 the intracellular biomineralization of ca bearing biominerals is also beneficial to the removal of ca2 ions from hw contributing further to the treatment of hypersaline hardwater 3 7 3 extracellular biomineralization biomineralization is generally considered to be the result of the interaction between bacterial metabolites and metal ions in the surrounding environment mann 1992 in this study co3 2 and hco3 ions produced by bacteria react with ca2 ions to form biotic ca bearing minerals no minerals were detected in the control group maybe due to the lower ph 6 8 so that the following experiments were directed to the minerals obtained in the experimental group to further confirm the biogenesis of these minerals the characteristics of these ca bearing minerals are as follows xrd and rietveld refinement analyses there was a significant difference in the mineral phases between the free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria all the minerals induced by free bacteria are calcite at the different nacl concentrations fig 11 a1 f1 corresponding well to the saed and hrtem results shown in fig 8 vaterite can also be formed besides the calcite in the presence of immobilized bacteria at 10 50 and 100 g l of nacl concentrations fig 11a2 d2 but only calcite at the higher nacl concentrations fig 11e2f2 the production of vaterite might be due to the much higher ca2 precipitation rates under the action of the immobilized bacteria fig 3c3 than the free bacteria fig 3c1 p 0 01 it has been reported that calcite can be induced by free halovibrio mesolongii hmy2 bacteria in wastewater containing 400 mg l ca2 ions and 100 g l of nacl and calcite and vaterite under the action of immobilized h mesolongii hmy2 bacteria yan et al 2022 in this study vaterite was also harvested when using the immobilized bacteria to remove ca2 ions similar to the results reported by yan et al 2022 calcite has a higher stability than vaterite the precipitation rate of ca2 ions in the presence of immobilized bacteria was much higher than that under the condition of free bacteria fig 3c1 and c2 p 0 01 always leading to the formation of metastable minerals such as vaterite and amorphous calcium carbonate acc in this study calcite and vaterite formed by v massiliensis c bacteria can also be applied to wastewater treatment for example caco3 aggregates formed by vaterite and calcite prepared with the precipitation method at normal temperature can be used to remove copper ions cu2 from wastewater song et al 2021a the full width at half maximum fwhm o of calcite 104 formed in the free bacterial group was 0 163 0 166 0 183 0 203 0 214 at 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l nacl concentration respectively and the increasing fwhm values suggest that higher nacl concentrations could damage the crystal structure of calcite resulting in the significant decrease of calcite crystallinity p 0 01 table s6 sem eds analyses there is also a significant difference in morphology of caco3 minerals between the free and immobilized bacteria fig 12 almost all the minerals are rhombohedral spherical dumbbell and short rod shaped under the action of free bacteria with a smaller size of 10 15 µm figs 12a1 a4 and s5 by contrast most minerals formed in the presence of immobilized bacteria were always aggregated to form irregular mineral aggregates with a larger size more than 50 µm fig s6 some larger than 100 µm figs 12b1 and s6 besides the larger minerals there are few dumbbell shaped and spherical minerals with a length of 28 and 30 µm fig 12b2 and b3 there are also many spherical particles collected together to form irregular mineral clusters fig 12b4 the presence of the element p and holes within the minerals marked by the red squares in figs s5 and s6 and the mineralized shells of bacteria fig s6d3 and s6e3 further demonstrates that these minerals are biotic generally speaking the morphology of caco3 minerals formed by physical and chemical methods is relatively simple whereas those induced by microorganisms are always more diverse zhuang et al 2018 ftir analyses the characteristic bands 712 875 1427 and 2514 cm 1 confirm the presence of calcite kalmar et al 2012 and those of 745 871 1082 and 1421 cm 1 further prove the formation of vaterite song et al 2021b there is also a significant difference in the characteristic bands of minerals between the free and immobilized bacteria 712 875 1421 and 2514 cm 1 bands of calcite are found in the presence of free bacteria table 1 fig s7a1 a3 and some other bands such as 745 and 870 cm 1 of vaterite are also observed besides the bands of calcite under the action of immobilized bacteria at 10 50 and 100 g l nacl concentrations table 1 fig s7b1 s7b3 all the minerals are calcite in the free bacteria group at all concentrations of nacl and as for the immobilized bacteria group one mineral phase calcite was only formed at 150 and 200 g l nacl concentrations table 1 fig s7a4 s7a5 and s7b4 s7b5 the mineral phases detected by ftir are consistent with the results obtained from xrd analyses in addition to the characteristics bands of caco3 minerals a number of organic functional groups were also found from the ftir analyses including c o 1654 from proteins schulz and baranska 2007 c o 1654 1638 1636 1635 1633 cm 1 from tertiary amide lopes and fascio 2004 c c 1618 and 1617 cm 1 from alkene lopes and fascio 2004 ch 2874 2928 2926 2924 2921 2920 2919 cm 1 from alkane lopes and fascio 2004 and co c 1164 1162 1121 1105 1058 1054 cm 1 from ether lopes and fascio 2004 table 1 and fig s7 some scholars have proposed that the co c group plays a huge role in the process of biomineralization wang et al 2013 the carboxyl and amide functional groups of the bacteria can provide the binding sites for metal ions facilitating the formation of nanocrystals chen et al 2016 it has also been reported that the removal of cr iii in water is due to the adsorption of carboxyl and amide functional groups from the bacterial cells detected by further x ray absorption fine structure and ftir analyses chen et al 2012 the ftir results shown in fig s7 are well in line with the previous views the biogenesis of these minerals is also confirmed through these functional groups of the minerals in the process of biomineralization these functional groups combined with the bacterial biomacromolecules and played an important role in the formation of the biomineral s peculiar morphology the co c groups ethers or glycosides contribute to the formation of specific calcite shapes such as elongate and bundle shaped calcite zhou et al 2010 some protein secondary structures can also be found in these minerals including β sheet α helix 310 helix and β turn table 2 and fig s8 there are four kinds of protein secondary structures in calcite induced by free bacteria at 50 100 150 and 200 g l nacl concentrations three kinds at 10 g l nacl concentration table 2 suggesting that nacl concentrations can affect the number of protein secondary structures in biominerals there are four species of protein secondary structures in caco3 minerals induced by immobilized bacteria at 200 g l nacl concentration and only three kinds at 10 50 100 and 150 g l nacl concentrations table 2 the species of protein secondary structures in the minerals induced by immobilized bacteria are less than those induced by free bacteria at 50 100 and 150 g l nacl concentrations table 2 this might indicate that less protein could be released by immobilized bacteria than by free bacteria due to the larger mass transfer resistance it has been reported that the protein secondary structures are not very well developed in biominerals induced by immobilized halovibrio mesolongii hmy2 bacteria due to the higher precipitation rate of ca2 ions compared to the free bacteria yan et al 2022 our results correspond well to this view when a great number of dissolved proteins are released by bacteria the proteins would usually be incorporated into caco3 minerals which would hinder the precipitation of caco3 pearson et al 2020 maybe this was the main reason for the higher precipitation ratio and precipitation rate under the action of immobilized bacteria because fewer proteins could be released into the liquid by immobilized bacteria as a result of the sodium alginate gel barrier the difference in protein secondary structures present in biominerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria has rarely been studied these all suggest that v massiliensis c bacteria are involved in the biomineralization of caco3 minerals and influence the precipitation of ca2 ions xps analyses the xps results of these biominerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria show that the elements ca c o n p and s are present on the mineral surface fig 13 ca shows two different peaks which have been ascribed to ca 2p3 2 around 346 ev and ca 2p 1 2 around 350 ev liu et al 2021 yan et al 2022 three prominent c1s peaks located at around 289 286 and 284 ev indicate the presence of oc o co co c and c c h likely derived from esters ethers alcohols and amino acid side chains respectively paulo et al 2018 the oxygen peak o1s can be deconvoluted into four sub peaks 533 532 531 and 530 ev representing different states of oxygen o coh o co c c o nc o and o co from carboxylic acids carboxylates esters carbonyls and amides paulo et al 2018 the n1s peaks located at the binding energy 400 4 399 9 399 4 398 9 ev are ascribed to the nh nc o c nh2 azole cn c yan et al 2022a dong et al 2022 there is a significant difference in n1s peaks of the biominerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria there are four prominent n1s peaks under the action of free bacteria and there are two smaller n1s peaks at the most in the presence of immobilized bacteria the results suggest that more kinds of nitrogenous compounds protein were released by free bacteria and maybe the protein content was higher than that released by immobilized bacteria this conclusion is well in line with the ftir results the p2p spectra can be deconvoluted into two sub peaks namely 134 7 ev and 133 2 ev indicating that the p o and p c bond originated from dna rna and phospholipids yan et al 2022a it could be interpreted that under the action of free bacteria the p c content is the minimum at the optimal nacl concentration of 50 g l and with increasing nacl concentrations from 100 through 150 to 200 g l the p c content also increased from 73 86 through 93 81 to 96 61 the results correspond well to those in the presence of immobilized bacteria the increasing p c content is probably due to more lipoproteins being secreted by halophiles with increasing nacl concentrations further confirming the biogenesis of these caco3 minerals the s2p peaks fig 13a at 169 4 168 4 164 0 and 160 7 ev confirm the presence of sulfate so4 2 oxidized s at oxidation state 6 so2 2 s s and s2 debiemme chouvy et al 2007 yan et al 2022a s s and s2 may have originated from protein cystine and cysteine yan et al 2022a in view of the fact that the signal to noise ratio is particularly poor fig 13b the peak deconvolution of s spectra was not performed in the immobilized bacteria group indicating that there is a lower s content incorporated onto the mineral surface than in the free bacteria group from the significant difference in s peak deconvolution it could be deduced that the content of protein especially sulfur containing protein released by immobilized bacteria was much lower than that released by free bacteria due to the main barrier sodium alginate gel the presence of these chemical bonds oc o co co c c c h nc o c nh cn c p o p c and s s indicates that metabolites released by v massiliensis c bacteria were involved in the growth of these minerals further illustrating the important role played by the bacteria in the biomineralization of ca2 ions it has been reported that in soils and sediments organic matter om can be incorporated into different kinds of minerals producing mineral organic matter complexes hu et al 2022 in this study the harvested caco3 minerals are also mineral om complexes well in line with the opinion of hu et al 2022 stable carbon isotope composition of the biominerals the carbon source of carbonate minerals is one crucial issue for understanding the mechanism of micp huang et al 2022 δ13cpdb of these biominerals changed slightly from 16 10 to 17 54 at different nacl concentrations much more negative than the 5 95 of calcite formed only by cacl2 and na2co3 table 3 indicating that there is a significant difference in stable carbon isotope composition between the biotic and abiotic carbonate minerals the c source of abiotic calcite came from the nahco3 na2co3 and atmospheric co2 8 and that of biotic caco3 was diversified including beef extract 18 4 yan et al 2022a tryptone 21 3 yan et al 2022a co2 released by bacterial metabolism nahco3 and na2co3 as well as atmospheric co2 therefore it can be inferred that part of the c source in these biotic minerals originated from the organics due to the similar δ13cpdb values sánchez román et al 2011 in the process of ca2 ion precipitation co2 coming from the microbial metabolization could be transformed into co3 2 and hco3 ions under the action of ca in alkaline conditions thus increasing the supersaturation of caco3 minerals and resulting in the sharp decrease of ca2 ion concentration thermogravimetry derivative thermogravimetry tg dtg and differential scanning calorimetry dsc analyses of biominerals from the tg curve fig s9a it can be seen that there is a significant weight loss in the temperature range 600 800 c well in line with the decomposition of caco3 minerals dtg results show that the peak temperature of calcite was 751 9 748 1 and 693 9 c at nacl concentrations of 50 100 and 150 g l fig s9b respectively indicating that the thermal stability of calcite decreases with increasing nacl concentrations well in line with the decreasing crystallinity deduced from the increasing fwhm the dsc results show that the enthalpy change h of calcite was 4742 4367 and 4321 j mol at nacl concentrations of 50 100 and 150 g l fig s9c respectively also revealing that the thermal stability of calcite decreased with increasing nacl concentrations 4 conclusions v massiliensis c bacteria can create an alkaline environment by increasing ph to 9 1 and increasing the supersaturation of caco3 by producing hco3 and co3 2 ions promoting the precipitation of caco3 and facilitating the removal of ca2 in hypersaline water with increasing nacl concentrations ca2 concentrations decreased from the original concentration of 1200 mg l to 219 562 mg l for 6 days under the action of free bacteria and 71 214 mg l and 21 159 mg l for the two groups of optimal immobilized bacteria on the 6th day ca2 precipitation ratios were 55 81 under the action of free bacteria much lower than the 82 94 and 87 98 under the action of immobilized bacteria without any bacteria ca2 ion concentrations slowly decreased and ca2 ion precipitation ratios were not beyond 10 on the 4th day significantly lower than those under the action of bacteria the recycled immobilized bacteria had a higher activity in ca2 removal than the free bacteria preculture of the immobilized bacteria was a good way to increase the efficiency of ca2 ion removal due to the higher ca activity compared to the un precultured immobilized bacteria the humic acid like substances protein dna and polysaccharides released by bacteria promoted the removal of ca2 ions the cell surface and intracellular cytoplasm acted as the nucleation sites promoting the formation of ca bearing biominerals and further facilitating the ca2 ion removal in hw the harvested calcium carbonate minerals were

15219,much attention has been paid to ca2 ion removal by biomineralization due to the dangers of ca2 on industrial processes and human health however ca2 removal from hypersaline water by biomineralization is quite difficult due to there being few halophilic bacteria tolerating higher salinities in this study free and immobilized virgibacillus massiliensis c halophilic bacteria exhibiting carbonic anhydrase activity were used to remove ca2 ions from water at different nacl concentrations with increasing nacl concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l ca2 ion concentrations in the presence of free bacteria and in two groups of immobilized bacteria for a period of 6 days sharply decreased from 1200 mg l to 219 562 mg l 71 214 mg l and 21 159 mg l respectively ca2 precipitation ratios were 55 81 82 94 and 87 98 respectively the humic acid like substances protein dna and polysaccharide released by the bacteria promoted the ca2 ion removal the immobilized bacteria were able to be recycled and precultured which would save industry costs and increase ca2 ion removal efficiency biological processes for ca2 ion removal include cell surface intracellular and extracellular biomineralization the biogenesis of calcium carbonate was proved by sem eds ftir xps and stable carbon isotope values this study provides insights into the effective removal of ca2 ions by biomineralization in hypersaline water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium removal biomineralization higher nacl concentrations virgibacillus massiliensis precipitation ratio softening of hypersaline water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent years the use of hypersaline water hw or seawater as an alternative to freshwater in industrial processes has increased in countries where freshwater is scarce hw has been widely used as a coolant in nuclear and thermal power plants the petrochemical industry and in steel production it has been reported that the qingdao power plant in china has been using hw such as seawater as a coolant for more than 85 years since at least 1936 yan et al 2022a however secondary ions like calcium ions ca2 are always present in hw and are very dangerous to industrial processes due to the lime scale that is easily formed by ca2 ions in cooling systems reverse osmosis plants mining and other industries thus resulting in increased industrial production costs and a decline in efficiency every year the replacement and repair of pipelines and equipment requires millions of dollars expenditure because of the scale problem in addition when particles of lime scale enter the stomach it reacts with hydrochloric acid and then releases ca2 ions and carbon dioxide co2 the former may lead to diseases such as kidney stones and ureteral stones and people with stomach ulcers may be at risk of stomach perforation from the effects of the co2 the concentration of ca2 ions should be decreased to a lower degree in hw to ensure safe industrial production and to protect human health there are four types of methods for removing ca2 ions from hw they are physical chemical physicochemical and biological methods li et al 2022 the first three methods have many disadvantages such as higher upfront industrial costs and a potential consequence of secondary contamination moreover ca2 ions are still present and cannot be recovered as a resource thus an economic and environmentally friendly biological method which not only easily removes ca2 ions from hw but also transforms soluble ca2 ions into a useful solid resource is urgently needed microbially induced calcium precipitation micp has been widely applied in many fields such as in bio cement production gebru et al 2021 improving well bore integrity and addressing thief zone permeability kirkland et al 2020 repairing cracks in concrete sun et al 2022 and wastewater treatment wang et al 2021 micp is an economic and environmentally friendly method to remove metal ions and has been a research hot spot in the field of wastewater treatment in recent years yan et al 2022a when using free bacteria long term exposure to higher concentrations of metal ions does inevitably affect cell growth and the physiological and biochemical metabolic activities of bacteria baldrian 2003 liao et al 2005 decreasing its long term application value and the removal efficiency of metal ions in water therefore seeking an effective recycling method to increase the long term application value would be a major breakthrough in the application of biomineralization for the removal of metal ions immobilized bacteria always have a much higher ability than free bacteria to remove metal ions from a polluted environment bouabidi et al 2018 partovinia and rasekh 2018 pseudomonas sp wz39 bacteria immobilized by fungal sponge carriers can remove 72 ca2 ions wang et al 2021 and a chromium cr resistant microbial flora immobilized by humic acid coated nano ferrous sulfide fes can remove 99 cr vi tan et al 2020 both much higher than using free bacteria halophilic bacteria have a great application potential in the field of wastewater treatment however experiments using immobilized halophiles to remove metal ions in hw have rarely been reported the dms6 halophile immobilized by activated carbon fiber can remove 99 95 of ca2 ions at 30 g l sodium chloride nacl concentration li et al 2022 using immobilized halovibrio mesolongii hmy2 halophiles ca2 ion precipitation ratios increased to 79 89 with a variation of mg ca ratios yan et al 2022a at 100 g l nacl concentration the main reason for the significant difference in the ca2 ion removal ratio is the higher nacl concentration as well as the different species of bacteria since there are only a few species of halophiles that can survive in an extremely hypersaline environment there are only a handful of studies on the removal of ca2 ions by immobilized halophiles from waters with higher nacl concentrations such as 150 g l and 200 g l thus experiments using immobilized halophiles to remove ca2 ions in hw with different nacl concentrations are urgently needed to decrease industrial costs the re utilization of immobilized bacteria is also worthy of examination it has been reported that the protein content in halophile extracellular polymers eps increases with increasing nacl concentrations and also that the contents of aspartic acid and glutamic acid increase correspondingly han et al 2022 these changes may also affect the nucleation and growth of ca bearing minerals because eps can act as nucleation sites in the biomineralization process hence there is a need to examine how the eps components change with the variation of nacl concentrations what effect the various eps components have on ca2 ion removal and how to prove the biogenesis of ca bearing minerals precipitated when analyzing ultrathin slices of bacteria by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem some nanocrystalline particles are observed in the eps cell wall periplasmic space and cytoplasm in a biomineralized system if the biomass of the bacteria is large enough the total amount of ca2 ions diffusing into the bacterial cells would also be large so facilitating the removal of ca2 ions from hw study of the intracellular biomineralization of halophiles is also helpful to further document the precise reasons for the removal of ca2 ions from hw in this study the removal of ca2 ions in hw nacl concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l by free and immobilized halophiles were studied and the optimal immobilization conditions were analyzed using the six factors and five levels of the orthogonal test and response surface method moreover ca2 ion removal by recycled and precultured immobilized bacteria was also investigated the detailed reasons for ca2 ion removal was further explored by examining cell surface biomineralization and intracellular and extracellular biomineralization to further examine the mechanism of ca2 ion adsorption and ca2 ion biomineralization the components in the eps were analyzed and the physiological and biochemical properties of the bacterial strain were studied finally the biogenesis of the harvested ca bearing minerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria was also confirmed and the characteristics of these minerals were also compared this study provides insights into ca2 ion removal from hw with different nacl concentrations through biomineralization and the results have application to industrial processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strain and culture medium virgibacillus massiliensis c bacteria were isolated from the yinjiashan saltworks qingdao china and preserved in the geomicrobiology laboratory in shandong university of science and technology qingdao china the methods used to preserve the bacteria are as follows 30 glycerol

acids 16s rdna of v massiliensis c bacteria sequenced by the shanghai biological engineering co ltd shanghai china were uploaded to the national center of biotechnology information ncbi genbank the primers used for bacterial sequencing were the universal primers 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 tacgacttaaccccaatcgc 3 using the basic local alignment search tool blast the homology between v massiliensis c bacteria and other bacteria in the ncbi genbank was compared and the phylogenetic tree of the v massiliensis c strain was constructed by mega 7 0 software through the neighbor joining method han et al 2022 2 3 physiological and biochemical characteristics of v massiliensis c bacteria the optimal nacl concentration for bacterial survival was determined by using the following nacl concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l v massiliensis c bacterial concentrations and ph values were measured with a spectrophotometer 721 g china at 600 nm and a ph meter phs 25 china ammonium nh4 concentrations ph values calculated via nh4 concentrations and carbonic anhydrase ca activities were also investigated according to zhuang et al 2018 the ca activity refers to the amount of p nitrophenol μmol produced per min in 1 l of the culture system and one unit of ca activity was set as μmol min l namely u eps were extracted according to the method reported by yan et al 2020 and the contents of dna polysaccharide and protein in eps were analyzed as described by zhang et al 2007 the humic acids and tyrosine and tryptophan protein like substances in eps were identified by the three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy f7000 japan 2 4 optimization of the immobilization conditions v massiliensis c bacteria were immobilized with sodium alginate as reported by yan et al 2022a and the detailed steps were as follows 20 ml of bacterial suspension od600 1 0 was added into 80 ml of the solution containing polyvinyl alcohol 3 g sodium alginate 3 g and nacl 5 g and the mixture was then mixed well and squeezed into the solution containing nacl 50 g l boric acid h3bo3 40 g l and calcium chloride cacl2 20 g l with a 20 ml syringe solidified at 4 c for 24 h to further optimize the above immobilization conditions six variables at five different levels were investigated fig s1 namely h3bo3 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l sodium alginate 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l polyvinyl alcohol 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l cacl2 10 20 30 40 and 50 g l v massiliensis c bacteria 1 5 10 20 and 30 volume ratio and the cross linking time 3 6 12 24 and 36 h the nacl concentration in the immobilization system was 50 g l on the 2nd day and 5th day the effect of the six variables on the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was determined and expressed by the w value in general a larger w value indicates a greater effect of that variable on the ca2 ion precipitation ratio yan et al 2022a according to the w values three variables can be selected from the six on the 2nd day and 5th day respectively the optimal conditions of the selected three factors were obtained with the response surface method as for the other factors the concentrations time at the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were used when investigating the optimal immobilization conditions the first and second group of optimal immobilization conditions were obtained according to the ca2 ion precipitation ratios on the 2nd day and 5th day 2 5 ca2 ion removal by free and immobilized bacteria at different nacl concentrations the ability of free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria to remove ca2 ions under the conditions of different nacl concentrations namely 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l was determined respectively the solutions used to perform the experiments of ca2 ion biomineralization were composed of beef extract 5 0 g l tryptone 10 0 g l ca2 1200 mg l and different amounts of nacl 5 ml of sodium carbonate na2co3 1 mol l and 3 ml of sodium bicarbonate nahco3 1 mol l were added in 150 ml of the above mentioned solutions to keep the ph balance all the ph values of the solutions were adjusted to 6 8 to avoid the production of minerals under the physicochemical conditions the first experimental group was inoculated with 1 bacterial solution od600 1 0 and to the control group was added with sterilized nacl solutions 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l at the same volume ratio to compare the difference in ca2 ion removal ratios between the free and immobilized bacteria 50 pellets of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria prepared with the first and second immobilization method were added into the biomineralization system to replace the free bacteria namely the second and third experimental group all solutions were cultured in a thermostatic shaker hzq f160 china at 120 rpm and 37 c at certain intervals 1 ml of the liquid was taken out from the above solution to measure the ca2 ion concentration by a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas tas 986 china the precipitation ratios and precipitate rates were calculated as reported by yan et al 2022a and the detailed equations were as follows 1 a c o c i c o 100 2 b c o c i t i 100 a precipitation ratio co the initial ca2 ion concentration mg l ci the ca2 ion concentration mg l at time i b precipitation rate ti time i the differences in ca2 ion concentration precipitation ratio and precipitate rate between the free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria were determined by ibm spss 26 statistics software 2 6 re utilization and preculture of the immobilized bacteria after one cycle of ca2 ion removal the immobilized bacteria which had the higher ca2 ion removal ratio were re utilized to remove ca2 ions in the second cycle after being washed with a sterilized nacl solution 50 g l the ph values were also measured the differences in the ca2 ion concentration ca2 ion precipitation ratio and ca2 ion precipitation rate under the conditions of immobilized bacteria between the first and second cycle of ca2 ion removal were also analyzed by ibm spss 26 statistics software the morphology of immobilized bacteria sodium alginate pellets before and after biomineralization was also analyzed by fesem at the same time the immobilized bacteria prepared under the optimal immobilization conditions according to the ca2 ion precipitation ratio on the 5th day were precultured in the medium beef extract 5 0 g l tryptone 10 0 g l nacl 50 g l for one day washed with sterilized nacl solution 50 g l and then inoculated into the biomineralization system for ca2 ion removal the difference in ca2 ion removal efficiency between the precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria was also analyzed by ibm spss 26 statistics software the changes of ca activities under the action of precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria were also compared 2 7 surface biomineralization and intracellular biomineralization ultrathin slices of v massiliensis c bacteria were prepared as reported by han et al 2019 and observed with high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem jem 2100 japan coupled with selected area electron diffraction saed and mapping 2 8 characterization of the ca bearing

results and discussion 3 1 16s rdna identification and physiological and biochemical characteristics of bacteria c bacteria living in extremely hypersaline environments are important microbial resources for the removal of ca2 ions in hw giovanella et al 2020 in this study the bacteria isolated from the yinjiashan salt works qingdao china were identified by homology comparison of their 16s rdna sequence the 16s rdna sequence of this strain accession number om339847 was 1466 bp in length and the phylogenetic tree fig s2 showed that this strain was most closely related to virgibacillus massiliensis therefore the bacterial strain is identified as virgibacillus massiliensis it has been reported that biomineralization is one of the most popular biological approaches in metal ion removal because of its advantages of higher efficiency lower cost and no secondary pollution zhang et al 2019 additionally the effective biomineralization activity of each species existing in highly diverse microbial communities in nature is different and should also be further studied li et al 2013 therefore the characteristics of this bacterial strain were further studied to explore their ability to remove ca2 ions in hw with different nacl concentrations by biomineralization the v massiliensis c bacterium is about 1 0 µm in length and 0 5 µm in width fig s3a the gram staining result is positive as shown by the purple color fig s3b after being cultured for 24 h the v massiliensis c bacterial concentration at 50 g l of nacl was significantly higher than that at 10 100 150 200 250 and 300 g l of nacl p 0 01 table s1 indicating that the optimal nacl concentration for v massiliensis c bacterial growth was 50 g l fig 1 a at 50 g l of nacl concentration ph increased sharply with increasing bacterial concentration before 72 h most importantly ph still increased sharply to 9 1 during the decline stage of cell concentration from 96 h to the end of the experiment fig 1b the ph increase promotes ca2 ion precipitation in a hypersaline fluid system when precipitating certain metal ions in water alkaline reagents such as sodium hydroxide naoh and na2co3 are always used to increase ph e g struvite precipitation in eutrophic water and this results in higher industrial costs it has been found that bacteria can precipitate struvite through increasing ph values in eutrophic water through their activities wang et al 2022b thereby decreasing the industrial costs li et al 2017 luo et al 2018 in this study ca2 ion precipitation induced by v massiliensis c bacteria could also be economically significant since the metabolic activity of this bacteria also resulted in a higher ph value similar to the struvite precipitation induced by bacteria the reason for the ph increase in the decline stage of bacterial growth deserved further study because the available nitrogen and carbon sources in the liquid medium necessary for microbial growth were used up and ammonia nh3 which plays an important role in ph increase was not released at this stage zhuang et al 2018 the following reaction shows the role of nh3 3 n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h it can be seen from fig 1c that the ammonium nh4 ion concentration increases sharply before 96 h and stays almost stable from 96 h to the end of this experiment the decline stage indicating that ammonia nh3 was not produced during the decline stage moreover the ph increased to 8 3 or so fig 1c based on the nh3 released by v massiliensis c bacteria whereas the ph value was 9 1 under the action of total metabolic activity of v massiliensis c bacteria fig 1b meaning that some other factors except nh3 were affecting the ph increase ph 9 1 during the decline stage of cell concentration in fact even if the bacteria were dead the activity of certain enzymes could still have taken place due to the presence of the stable messenger ribonucleic acid mrna of this enzyme in the culture system this kind of enzyme could still be synthesized by the stable mrna in the decline stage and so it is named as a continuously synthesized enzyme ca is almost certainly present in all the organisms and its significant role played in biomineralization has been reported by many researchers zhuang et al 2018 the ca activity was further examined and the results show that it was 4 8 u almost unchanged in the time range of 70 230 h fig 1d suggesting that higher ca activity was still present even during the decline stage of bacterial growth therefore the ca in this study could be considered a continuously synthesized enzyme the reaction of co2 hydration is very slow in the absence of ca catalysis thatcher et al 1998 and the catalytic rate of co2 hydration under the action of different types of ca can be increased to 104 106 s lindskog 1997 the following reaction of co2 hydration can occur 4 c o 2 h 2 o ca relased by bacteria h 2 c o 3 considering the higher ph of 8 3 resulted from the metabolic activity of v massiliensis c bacteria in the initial stage the product carbonic acid h2co3 cannot have existed in such an alkaline condition then the following reactions of h2co3 hydrolysis can occur 5 h 2 c o 3 o h hco 3 h 2 o hco 3 o h co 3 2 h 2 o from the above reactions it can be seen that a large number of bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 ions will be produced in this study the higher ph value of 9 1 8 3 may have resulted from the increasing co3 2 ion concentrations due to the fact that the ph of a saturated na2co3 solution is 11 6 much higher than the 8 3 of the saturated nahco3 solution at normal temperature and pressure moreover the production of hco3 and co3 2 ions can increase the supersaturation of calcium carbonate caco3 further promoting the precipitation of caco3 and facilitating the removal of ca2 from hw the detailed reaction is as follows 6 hco 3 co 3 2 o h 2 c a 2 2 cac o 3 h 2 o 3 2 optimization of immobilization conditions microbially induced calcite precipitation micp has been widely used in soil remediation and improvement co2 sequestration concrete crack repair and wastewater treatment hu et al 2021 based on this point in this study v massiliensis c bacteria were also used to remove ca2 ions in hw at different nacl concentrations because this strain has a stronger ability for micp in order to better remove ca2 ions in hw at different nacl concentrations the effect of free and immobilized bacteria on ca2 ion removal needed to be compared firstly the immobilized bacteria were prepared according to the optimal immobilization methods the components used to prepare the immobilized bacteria include h2bo3 polyvinyl alcohol cacl2 and sodium alginate cacl2 is used as a curing agent and h3bo3 as a cross linking agent the monodiol gel is formed by chemical reaction of h3bo3 with water soluble polyvinyl alcohol the sodium ions in sodium alginate are replaced by ca2 ions in cacl2 to form calcium alginate which is insoluble in water forming a cross linked gel system with eggshell structure the immobilization conditions were optimized by performing the six factors five levels orthogonal experiments the results show that under the action of the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria for 2 days 3 sodium alginate 3 polyvinyl alcohol 3 5 h3bo3 solution 1 cacl2 21 9 h cross linking time and 10 bacterial solution were the best conditions the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 94 15 92 91 93 58 94 14 93 41 and 93 35 respectively the w values of six factors were 0 1623 0 0628 0 3263 0 2272 0 0280 and 0 1932 respectively fig 2a c according to the largest three w values 0 3263 0 2272 and 0 1932 cacl2 h3bo3 solution and cross linking time were selected out and the optimal immobilization conditions determined through the response surface method were 1 3 49 and 21 9 h respectively fig 2g i on the 5th day the best conditions were 3 sodium alginate 3 polyvinyl alcohol 4 h3bo3 solution 1 cacl2 18 h cross linking time and 20 bacterial solution the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 98 60 98 31 96 77 97 28 96 80 and 96 72 respectively the w values of 6 factors were 0 2072 0 0832 0 2447 0 0106 0 2251 and 0 3953 respectively fig 2d f according to the largest three w values 0 3953 0 2447 and 0 2251 cross linking time cacl2 and bacterial solution were selected out and the optimal immobilization conditions determined through the response surface method were 18 h 1 and 20 respectively fig 2j l thus two kinds of optimal immobilization conditions were determined and two groups of immobilized bacteria were prepared according to these two kinds of optimal immobilization conditions and used to remove ca2 ions at different nacl concentrations after the above immobilized bacteria were prepared the next stage of the work was to compare the efficiency of ca2 ion removal in hw by the free and immobilized bacteria 3 3 ca2 ion removal by free and immobilized bacteria mineral scaling is the main challenge of membrane desalination technology in the process of hw desalination the solute concentration exceeds the solubility after the hw is concentrated resulting in the precipitation of mineral scales on the membrane surface and further blocking of the membrane holes the mineral scale reduces membrane lifespan increasing the industrial costs of the membrane desalination technology tong et al 2019 ca2 ion is one of the factors forming the mineral scales the industrial costs would be greatly decreased if ca2 ions could be removed under the action of bacteria in hw before desalination thus research on the removal of ca2 ions induced by bacteria from hw at different nacl concentrations was undertaken the changes in ca2 ion concentrations under the action of free v massiliensis c bacteria fig 3 a1 show that at different nacl concentrations ca2 ion concentrations sharply decreased from the original concentration of 1200 mg l in the first two days to 219 562 mg l on the 6th day and finally to 116 247 mg l on the 14th day it has been reported that ca2 ion concentration decreased from 400 to 18 mg l under the action of the halophile rhodococcus erythropolis after 14 days arias et al 2017 much lower than the 116 247 mg l in our study the reason may be related to the lower ability of v massiliensis c bacteria in ca2 ion removal or due to the fact that the initial ca2 ion concentration was 1200 mg l in our study much higher than the 400 mg l of arias et al 2017 at each day ca2 ion concentrations at 200 g l of nacl concentration were obviously higher than those at 150 g l of nacl concentration indicating that a higher nacl concentration indeed hindered the precipitation of ca2 ions how to solve this is an important problem under the action of immobilized bacteria the inhibition effect of higher nacl concentration on ca2 ion precipitation was significantly reduced moreover ca2 ion concentrations decreased to 71 214 mg l and 21 159 mg l with increasing nacl concentrations under the action of these two groups of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria on the 6th day fig 3a2 and a3 much lower than 116 247 mg l for the free bacteria p 0 01 fig 3a1 suggesting that the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria prepared according to the optimal immobilization conditions attained by the ca2 precipitation ratios on the 5th day were most suitable to ca2 ion removal in this study the best result was that ca2 ion concentrations decreased from 1200 to 21 mg l at 50 g l of nacl concentration for 6 days under the action of the second group of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria close to the final ca2 ion concentration of 18 mg l under the effect of free r erythropolis for 14 days this indicates that the removal efficiency of ca2 ions could be greatly enhanced under the action of immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria compared with free v massiliensis c bacteria and that the immobilized bacteria could make up for the poor ca2 ion removal ability of free bacteria in hw may be due to the protection of the bacteria by the sodium alginate gel beads bouabidi et al 2018 on the 6th day ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 55 81 under the action of free bacteria much lower than 82 94 and 87 98 under the action of immobilized bacteria fig 3b1 b3 the maximum ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 81 94 and 98 under the action of free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria two groups at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 3b1 b3 higher than those at other nacl concentrations this may be due to the fact that 50 g l is the optimal nacl concentration for the bacterial growth fig 1a this also suggests that the immobilized bacteria play a much more important role than the free bacteria in ca2 ion precipitation p 0 01 at 200 g l of nacl concentration ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 55 82 and 87 under the action of free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria fig 3b1 b3 indicating that there was an extremely significant difference in ca2 ion removal in a hypersaline environment between the immobilized bacteria and the free bacteria p 0 01 compared with the free bacteria ca2 ion precipitation ratios could be significantly increased at higher nacl concentrations in the presence of the immobilized bacteria this may be due to the higher bacterial activity resulting from the protective effects of the embedding gel sodium alginate halophiles adapted to a hypersaline environment can be used to remove ca2 ions by micp rivadeneyra et al 2006 rhodococcus erythropolis tn24f cultivated in a culture medium supplemented with 35 g l of nacl could precipitate 95 of the soluble ca2 ions for 7 days by forming calcium carbonate minerals arias et al 2017 the much higher precipitation ratio indicates that r erythropolis tn24f has a stronger ability for ca2 removal than the v massiliensis c bacteria in this study because ca2 ion precipitation ratios were 55 81 under the action of free v massiliensis c bacteria with increasing nacl concentrations from 10 to 200 g l however when using the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria ca2 ion precipitation ratios were able to reach 94 and 98 at a higher nacl concentration of 50 g l on the 6th day close to the result of r erythropolis tn24f 95 at 35 g l of nacl for 7 days thus ca2 ion removal ratios could be greatly increased under the condition that the free bacteria were changed into the immobilized bacteria even if the free bacteria had a lower ability of ca2 ion removal in hw as for the ca2 ion precipitation rates on the 6th day the result was similar to that of the ca2 ion precipitation ratios maybe due to the fact that the optimal nacl concentration is 50 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ion rate is the highest at 50 g l of nacl concentration on the 6th day and is 165 188 and 196 mg l d for the free and two kinds of immobilized bacteria fig 3c1 c3 respectively this result also suggests that the immobilized bacteria are superior to the free bacteria in terms of ca2 ion precipitation especially at higher nacl concentrations p 0 01 to further confirm the significant role played by v massiliensis c bacteria in ca2 ion removal two groups of control experiments were also performed compared with the experimental group inoculated with free bacteria the first control group used nacl solution with a concentration corresponding to the nacl concentration in each group to replace the bacterial solution fig s4a1 s4b1 and s4c1 compared with the experimental group inoculated with immobilized bacteria the second control group was using sodium alginate gel beads without any bacteria to replace the original immobilized bacteria fig s4a2 s4b2 and s4c2 without any bacteria ca2 ion concentrations slowly decreased from 1200 mg l fig s4a1 and s4a2 on the 4th day ca2 ion concentrations were still higher than 1100 mg l fig s4a1 and s4a2 significantly higher than those in the presence of free and immobilized bacteria fig 3a1 a3 indicating that free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria indeed played an important role in ca2 ion removal fig s4b1 and s4b2 revealed that ca2 ion precipitation ratios were not beyond 10 on the 4th day in the absence of bacteria significantly much lower than those in the presence of free and immobilized bacteria fig 3b1 b3 ca2 ion precipitation rates were also much lower in the absence of any bacteria not beyond 60 mg l d fig s4c1 and s4c2 also proving that it was the bacteria not the physical and chemical factors that significantly removed the ca2 ions from the hw it has been reported that the removal efficiency of metallic ions induced by bacteria is significantly higher than that treated by physical and chemical methods zhang et al 2022 because bacteria do not only supply nucleation sites but also provide an alkaline environment to promote the further growth of metallic minerals stocks fischer et al 1999 our experiments showed the same results 3 4 changes of humic acid like substances in eps with salinity in view of the broad structural diversity of eps and their ability to bind metal ions and remove them from the environment there has been increasing interest in their possible use in bioremediation pal and paul 2008 giovanella et al 2020 eps were separated from v massiliensis c bacteria and analyzed by eem spectroscopy to further explore the detailed reason for ca2 ion removal in hw according to the eem fluorescence spectra protein like substances regions i and ii can be observed in all eps samples shown in fig 4 region i is located in the range of excitation wavelength 250 340 nm and emission wavelength 380 nm indicating that tyrosine and tryptophan protein like substances are present in the eps wang et al 2022a region ii is distributed in the excitation wavelength range 200 250 nm and emission wavelength range 380 nm suggesting that all groups of eps contain the aromatic protein substances wang et al 2022a region iii iv v in the range of excitation wavelength 250 400 nm and emission wavelength 370 520 nm reveal that humic acid like substances are present wang et al 2022a at 50 g l nacl concentration the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was the highest this may be due to the fact that a large number of humic acid like substances were released by bacteria moreover more kinds of humic acid like substances were produced at such a nacl concentration than at other nacl concentrations eem fluorescence spectra fig 4 show that there are three areas indicating the presence of humic acid like substances at 50 g l of nacl concentration and with increasing nacl concentrations there are only two areas of humic acid like substances at 150 g l of nacl concentration moreover there are no areas proving the release of humic acid like substances from bacteria at 200 g l of nacl concentration it has been reported that organomineralization is produced probably via the permineralization of non living organic substrates adsorbing dissolved metal humate complexes shen and neuweiler 2018 directly suggesting that humic acid like substances played an important role in the adsorption of dissolved metal ions in this study the humic acid like substances could be deprotonated in the alkaline conditions created by the bacteria thus promoting the adsorption of ca2 ions stevenson humic acid was used as a simplified model in this study stevenson 1982 the detailed reactions 7 were as follows 7 in addition the more humic acid like substances were released the greater the number of ca2 ions adsorbed resulting in ca2 ion precipitation ratios being the highest at 50 g l of nacl concentration it has also been reported that humus like substances can act as the communication medium between bacteria and minerals affecting electron transfer between microorganisms and extracellular electron receptors and promoting the formation of minerals wang et al 2022b 3 5 recycling of the immobilized bacteria the lack of bacterial re utilization may strongly affect the wide application of biomineralization induced by free bacteria zhang et al 2021 a very significant advantage of immobilized bacteria is that they can be recycled in this study the immobilized bacteria prepared at the optimal immobilization conditions according to the ca2 ion precipitation ratio on the 5th day were recycled to analyze the ca2 ion removal efficiency the results show that the recycled immobilized bacteria still played an important role in the ph increase and ph could increase to 8 24 8 06 8 01 7 88 and 7 79 on the 1st day with increasing nacl concentrations from 10 to 200 g l fig 5 a still much higher than 7 26 at 24 h caused by free bacteria at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 1b on the 7th day 168 h or so the ph increased to beyond 8 0 some beyond 8 5 at different nacl concentrations fig 5a slightly lower than 8 56 8 72 in the time range of 150 174 h caused by free bacteria at a 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 1b this result suggests that the immobilized bacteria could be recycled in the removal of ca2 ions from hw at different nacl concentrations due to its significant role in ph increase the results about the recycling of immobilized bacteria show that ca2 ion concentration could sharply decrease to 337 mg l at the highest nacl concentration 200 g l on the 6th day fig 5b still significantly lower than 546 mg l fig 3a1 under the action of free bacteria at the same nacl concentration and the same time p 0 01 indicating that the efficiency of ca2 ion removal by the recycled immobilized bacteria was still much higher than that by the free bacteria on the 5th day the ca2 concentration decreased to lower than 200 mg l at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 5b satisfying the requirement of industrial circulating cooling water the national standard gb t15454 2009 china on the 6th day the ca2 ion precipitation ratio reached 87 at 50 g l of nacl concentration fig 5c higher than the 81 fig 3b1 at the same nacl concentration under the action of free bacteria especially at the highest nacl concentration of 200 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ratio reached 71 fig 5c much higher than the 55 fig 3b1 in the presence of free bacteria indicating that the difference in ca2 ion precipitation ratio between the recycled immobilized bacteria and free bacteria at lower nacl concentration was far less than that at higher nacl concentrations thus the immobilized bacteria can be recycled and still play a significant role in ca2 ion removal the results of ca2 ion precipitation rates fig 5d were similar to those of ca2 ion precipitation ratios also further confirming the advantages of the recycled immobilized bacteria however when comparing the ca2 ion removal efficiency between the newly prepared immobilized bacteria fig 3a3 b3 c3 and the recycled immobilized bacteria fig 5b d it was found that the efficiency under the action of the recycled immobilized bacteria was slightly lower that is to say the recycled immobilized bacteria had a higher activity in ca2 ion removal than the free bacteria but a lower activity than the immobilized bacteria used for the first time to explore further the detailed reason for the decrease in ca2 ion removal efficiency when using the recycled immobilized bacteria the morphology of immobilized bacteria before and after biomineralization was examined fig 5e shows the morphology of immobilized bacteria before biomineralization in addition to bacteria marked by yellow circle there are also a large number of nano scale marked by yellow arrow and micron scale holes marked by red circle inside the sodium alginate gel beads which was conducive to the diffusion of ca2 ions from the liquid culture to the gel beads and also conducive to the release of bacterial metabolites into the liquid culture after the biomineralization the sodium alginate beads were encased by dense minerals fig 5f these could inhibit the diffusion of ca2 ions and metabolites of bacteria thus ca2 ion precipitation ratios under the effect of the recycled immobilized bacteria decreased compared to the newly prepared immobilized bacteria in view of the oxidative decomposition of sodium alginate by sodium hypochlorite only the mineralized shells with holes were left fig 5f fig 5g shows the incomplete mineralized shells and fig 5f shows a part of some mineralized shells fig 5i shows that many micron scale mineral spherulites formed inside the sodium alginate beads and the enlarged figure fig 5j shows that there are many linear indentations left by microorganisms shedding from the surface of the mineral spherulites the formation of minerals on the surface and inside the sodium alginate gel beads inhibited the transfer of ca2 ions and ca resulting in a slightly lower ca2 ion removal efficiency when using the recycled immobilized bacteria compared to the newly prepared immobilized bacteria based on the higher ca2 ion removal efficiency under the action of the recycled immobilized bacteria compared to the free bacteria the recycled immobilized bacteria still have the potential to remove ca2 ions in hw biomineralization of lead pb2 in wastewater by bacterial re utilization has been studied and the results show that the removal efficiency of pb2 ions increased continuously after the immobilized bacteria were washed by nitric acid hno3 zhang et al 2021 the method of hno3 washing may also be suitable to the re utilization of the immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria to further increase ca2 ion removal efficiency this work will be performed in the future 3 6 preculture of the immobilized bacteria chen et al 2021 studied the significant difference in fermentative hydrogen production between the immobilized and free bacteria and found that the hydrogen yield was enhanced by immobilized bacteria due to the favorable micro environment for bacteria in immobilized beads our results also prove that the immobilized bacteria have a stronger ability to remove ca2 ions than the free bacteria all these studies reveal the advantages of immobilized bacteria in addition to this point studies about increasing the activity of immobilized bacteria have rarely been reported it is worth studying whether the immobilized bacteria can improve their activity after preculture in this study the changes of ca2 ion removal efficiency under the action of the precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria were also examined the results show that on the 6th day ca2 ion concentrations decreased to 219 182 175 109 and 67 mg l at nacl concentration 200 150 100 10 and 50 g l under the action of the precultured immobilized bacteria fig 6 a1 and 252 210 202 161 88 mg l for the un precultured immobilized bacteria fig 6a2 indicating that the precultured immobilized bacteria have a higher ca2 ion removal efficiency than the un precultured bacteria at the optimal nacl concentration 50 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was 94 fig 6b1 and the ca2 ion precipitation rate was 188 mg l d fig 6c1 in the presence of precultured immobilized bacteria on the 6th day higher than 92 fig 6b2 and 185 mg l d fig 6c2 under the action of un precultured immobilized bacteria at the highest nacl concentration 200 g l the ca2 ion precipitation ratio was 81 fig 6b1 and the ca2 ion precipitation rate was 163 mg l d fig 6c1 in the presence of precultured immobilized bacteria on the 6th day higher than 79 fig 6b2 and 158 mg l d fig 6c2 under the action of un precultured immobilized bacteria these results suggest that the precultured immobilized bacteria are superior to the un precultured immobilized bacteria at 10 150 and 200 g l nacl concentration ca2 ion precipitation ratios on the 6th day were much higher in the presence of the precultured immobilized bacteria than in the presence of the un precultured immobilized bacteria p 0 01 and 0 05 table s2 as for the reason of the higher ca2 ion precipitation ratio under the action of the precultured immobilized bacteria maybe ca activity played a significant role the inset in fig 6b2 shows the difference in ca activity between the precultured and un precultured immobilized bacteria at the optimal nacl concentration it can be concluded that ca activity of the precultured immobilized bacteria reached the maximum of 7 3 u on the 3rd day much higher than the maximum value 4 9 u of the un precultured immobilized bacteria on the 2nd day moreover from the 3rd to the 6th day the ca activity of the precultured immobilized bacteria was also higher than that of the un precultured immobilized bacteria thus if increasing the efficiency of ca2 ion removal is required preculture of the immobilized bacteria may be a good way 3 7 process and mechanism of ca2 ion removal the cell surface and intracellular cytoplasm are able to provide nucleation sites promoting the formation of ca bearing biominerals and further facilitating the ca2 ion removal to explore the process and mechanism of ca2 ion removal further the surface and intracellular and extracellular biomineralization of ca2 ions were studied and the results are as follows 3 7 1 cell surface biomineralization it has been reported that citrobacter can produce a great number of hydrogen phosphate ions and remove metal ions from solutions through the formation of minerals on the bacterial cell surface macaskie et al 1987 in this study when analyzing the ultrathin slices of v massiliensis c bacteria harvested in the process of ca2 ion removal particles in the shape of fibers were observed on the cell surface fig 7 similar to minerals formed on the cell surface reported by macaskie et al 1987 the comparison of mineral morphology between the bright fig 7a and dark fields fig 7b reveals that the fiber shaped particles may be minerals due to the fact that the minerals in the dark field are bright the elements ca c o na n p and s shown in fig 7j prove that the v massiliensis c bacteria have attracted these elements the ca c and o elements have likely originated from the fiber shaped minerals na will be from the culture medium and n p and s will have come from the cell itself the elemental mapping results show that the fiber shaped minerals indeed contain ca c and o fig 7c e further study would be needed to identify the mineral phase it has been reported that molecular composition of dissolved organic matter dom differs significantly with salinity and microorganisms can explain the dom composition jiang et al 2022 according to this point eps of v massiliensis c bacteria were isolated and the concentration of polysaccharides proteins and dna were determined fig 7k the results show that with increasing nacl concentrations dna and protein concentrations increased sharply and there was a significant difference in concentration between 0 and 50 g l 50 and 200 g l and 0 and 200 g l of nacl p 0 01 tables s3 and s4 the presence of dna and protein suggests that these components in eps can adsorb a large number of ca2 ions facilitating the nucleation of ca2 ions there the polysaccharide concentration was the least at the optimal nacl concentration 50 g l and much higher at other nacl concentrations p 0 01 table s5 indicating that in a situation of adversity the bacteria could produce more polysaccharide to survive the changes in the eps components correspond well to those reported by han et al 2022 suggesting that variations in the environmental conditions also result in changes in eps components hence affecting ca2 ion removal as for the protein there are always 20 kinds of amino acids that act as the monomer for protein synthesis except for arginine and lysine the isoelectric points of all the other amino acids are less than 9 0 in the alkaline environment created by microorganisms all amino acids except arginine and lysine become negatively charged especially aspartic acid and glutamic acid as a result most proteins also become negatively charged in this environment it has been reported that acidic amino acids such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid in the eps of halophiles increase with increasing nacl concentrations leading to more cooh qiu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 the changes in acidic amino acids in eps of v massiliensis c bacteria with increasing nacl concentrations will be further studied in the future dna is a long chain of many deoxynucleotides connected to each other by 3 5 phosphodiester bonds in a certain sequence of bases 5 phosphoric acid groups of dna are deprotonated in an alkaline environment and also become negatively charged in essence polysacharides are long chains formed by polymerization of monosaccharide molecules through glycosidic bonds co c some polysaccharides have many hydroxyl groups and hydroxyl groups will lose the proton in such an alkaline condition and then polysaccharides also carry a large number of negative charges the negatively charged humic acid like substances 3 4 section protein dna and polysaccharides in eps could adsorb a large number of ca2 ions increasing the supersaturation of calcium carbonate minerals and conducive to the removal of ca2 ions the area of fiber shaped minerals on the cell surface selected by the yellow circle in fig 8 a was further analyzed by saed and hrtem saed results show that there were many diffraction spots fig 8b indicating that the selected area had good crystalline structures and that eps of v massiliensis c bacteria can act as the nucleation sites the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ were 3 8542 3 0356 2 8449 2 2823 2 0959 1 9286 1 9131 1 8719 and 1 6249 corresponding well to the indices hkl for 012 104 006 113 202 024 018 116 and 211 respectively indicating that the crystals nucleated on the eps were calcite pdf 83 1762 two sites were also selected from a larger mineral fig 8c to be analyzed by hrtem and the results show that the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ were 2 8441 fig 8d and 2 2840 fig 8e corresponding well to hkl 006 and 113 of calcite pdf 83 1762 it has been reported that bacteria can act as nucleation sites and so reduce the concentrations of metal ions in solution by inducing the nucleation and precipitation of minerals mahasti et al 2017 the formation of calcite on the cell surface of v massiliensis c bacteria is in line with the above mentioned results reported by macaskie et al 1987 also facilitating the removal of ca2 ions in hw 3 7 2 intracellular biomineralization it has been reported that cr iii can be detected inside bacterial cells by tem eds analyses using thin section technology chen et al 2012 suggesting that metal ions can be transferred into cells from the water to further explore the process and mechanism of ca2 ion removal intracellular biomineralization was also studied from the mapping of the elements n p and s the outline of v massiliensis c bacteria can be discerned fig 9 besides these elements others present include ca c o and na fig 9a the presence of ca c and o suggest that there might be some minerals formed inside the cell thus the light area inside the cell was analyzed further by hrtem and saed fig 10 a is the enlarged part of the light area inside the v massiliensis c bacteria four areas were selected fig 10b for analyses by hrtem and saed the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ are 3 0310 fig 10c 3 0360 fig 10d 2 8420 fig 10e and 2 4950 fig 10f corresponding well to the indices for 104 104 006 and 110 of calcite pdf 83 1762 the saed results fig 10g show that the calculated interplanar spacings unit ǻ are 3 8558 3 0343 2 8432 2 2843 2 0924 1 9282 1 9124 1 8741 and 1 4723 corresponding well to hkl 012 104 006 113 202 024 018 116 and 125 of calcite pdf 83 1762 respectively the formation of this intracellular calcite also contributes to the removal of ca2 in hw always neglected by most researchers zhang et al 2022 also found that the intracellular lead pb2 content of lysinibacillus increases gradually in the process of biomineralization with increasing time directly proving that pb2 ions can diffuse from the water into the bacterial cells our results are in line with the conclusions of zhang et al 2022 more and more ca2 ions diffused into the cells and the intracellular supersaturation was clearly reached such that intracellular calcite was formed it has been reported that intracellular crystalline aragonite can be formed inside bacillus subtilis daniel 1 bacteria due to the diffusion of ca2 and magnesium ions mg2 yan et al 2021 the intracellular biomineralization of ca bearing biominerals is also beneficial to the removal of ca2 ions from hw contributing further to the treatment of hypersaline hardwater 3 7 3 extracellular biomineralization biomineralization is generally considered to be the result of the interaction between bacterial metabolites and metal ions in the surrounding environment mann 1992 in this study co3 2 and hco3 ions produced by bacteria react with ca2 ions to form biotic ca bearing minerals no minerals were detected in the control group maybe due to the lower ph 6 8 so that the following experiments were directed to the minerals obtained in the experimental group to further confirm the biogenesis of these minerals the characteristics of these ca bearing minerals are as follows xrd and rietveld refinement analyses there was a significant difference in the mineral phases between the free and immobilized v massiliensis c bacteria all the minerals induced by free bacteria are calcite at the different nacl concentrations fig 11 a1 f1 corresponding well to the saed and hrtem results shown in fig 8 vaterite can also be formed besides the calcite in the presence of immobilized bacteria at 10 50 and 100 g l of nacl concentrations fig 11a2 d2 but only calcite at the higher nacl concentrations fig 11e2f2 the production of vaterite might be due to the much higher ca2 precipitation rates under the action of the immobilized bacteria fig 3c3 than the free bacteria fig 3c1 p 0 01 it has been reported that calcite can be induced by free halovibrio mesolongii hmy2 bacteria in wastewater containing 400 mg l ca2 ions and 100 g l of nacl and calcite and vaterite under the action of immobilized h mesolongii hmy2 bacteria yan et al 2022 in this study vaterite was also harvested when using the immobilized bacteria to remove ca2 ions similar to the results reported by yan et al 2022 calcite has a higher stability than vaterite the precipitation rate of ca2 ions in the presence of immobilized bacteria was much higher than that under the condition of free bacteria fig 3c1 and c2 p 0 01 always leading to the formation of metastable minerals such as vaterite and amorphous calcium carbonate acc in this study calcite and vaterite formed by v massiliensis c bacteria can also be applied to wastewater treatment for example caco3 aggregates formed by vaterite and calcite prepared with the precipitation method at normal temperature can be used to remove copper ions cu2 from wastewater song et al 2021a the full width at half maximum fwhm o of calcite 104 formed in the free bacterial group was 0 163 0 166 0 183 0 203 0 214 at 10 50 100 150 and 200 g l nacl concentration respectively and the increasing fwhm values suggest that higher nacl concentrations could damage the crystal structure of calcite resulting in the significant decrease of calcite crystallinity p 0 01 table s6 sem eds analyses there is also a significant difference in morphology of caco3 minerals between the free and immobilized bacteria fig 12 almost all the minerals are rhombohedral spherical dumbbell and short rod shaped under the action of free bacteria with a smaller size of 10 15 µm figs 12a1 a4 and s5 by contrast most minerals formed in the presence of immobilized bacteria were always aggregated to form irregular mineral aggregates with a larger size more than 50 µm fig s6 some larger than 100 µm figs 12b1 and s6 besides the larger minerals there are few dumbbell shaped and spherical minerals with a length of 28 and 30 µm fig 12b2 and b3 there are also many spherical particles collected together to form irregular mineral clusters fig 12b4 the presence of the element p and holes within the minerals marked by the red squares in figs s5 and s6 and the mineralized shells of bacteria fig s6d3 and s6e3 further demonstrates that these minerals are biotic generally speaking the morphology of caco3 minerals formed by physical and chemical methods is relatively simple whereas those induced by microorganisms are always more diverse zhuang et al 2018 ftir analyses the characteristic bands 712 875 1427 and 2514 cm 1 confirm the presence of calcite kalmar et al 2012 and those of 745 871 1082 and 1421 cm 1 further prove the formation of vaterite song et al 2021b there is also a significant difference in the characteristic bands of minerals between the free and immobilized bacteria 712 875 1421 and 2514 cm 1 bands of calcite are found in the presence of free bacteria table 1 fig s7a1 a3 and some other bands such as 745 and 870 cm 1 of vaterite are also observed besides the bands of calcite under the action of immobilized bacteria at 10 50 and 100 g l nacl concentrations table 1 fig s7b1 s7b3 all the minerals are calcite in the free bacteria group at all concentrations of nacl and as for the immobilized bacteria group one mineral phase calcite was only formed at 150 and 200 g l nacl concentrations table 1 fig s7a4 s7a5 and s7b4 s7b5 the mineral phases detected by ftir are consistent with the results obtained from xrd analyses in addition to the characteristics bands of caco3 minerals a number of organic functional groups were also found from the ftir analyses including c o 1654 from proteins schulz and baranska 2007 c o 1654 1638 1636 1635 1633 cm 1 from tertiary amide lopes and fascio 2004 c c 1618 and 1617 cm 1 from alkene lopes and fascio 2004 ch 2874 2928 2926 2924 2921 2920 2919 cm 1 from alkane lopes and fascio 2004 and co c 1164 1162 1121 1105 1058 1054 cm 1 from ether lopes and fascio 2004 table 1 and fig s7 some scholars have proposed that the co c group plays a huge role in the process of biomineralization wang et al 2013 the carboxyl and amide functional groups of the bacteria can provide the binding sites for metal ions facilitating the formation of nanocrystals chen et al 2016 it has also been reported that the removal of cr iii in water is due to the adsorption of carboxyl and amide functional groups from the bacterial cells detected by further x ray absorption fine structure and ftir analyses chen et al 2012 the ftir results shown in fig s7 are well in line with the previous views the biogenesis of these minerals is also confirmed through these functional groups of the minerals in the process of biomineralization these functional groups combined with the bacterial biomacromolecules and played an important role in the formation of the biomineral s peculiar morphology the co c groups ethers or glycosides contribute to the formation of specific calcite shapes such as elongate and bundle shaped calcite zhou et al 2010 some protein secondary structures can also be found in these minerals including β sheet α helix 310 helix and β turn table 2 and fig s8 there are four kinds of protein secondary structures in calcite induced by free bacteria at 50 100 150 and 200 g l nacl concentrations three kinds at 10 g l nacl concentration table 2 suggesting that nacl concentrations can affect the number of protein secondary structures in biominerals there are four species of protein secondary structures in caco3 minerals induced by immobilized bacteria at 200 g l nacl concentration and only three kinds at 10 50 100 and 150 g l nacl concentrations table 2 the species of protein secondary structures in the minerals induced by immobilized bacteria are less than those induced by free bacteria at 50 100 and 150 g l nacl concentrations table 2 this might indicate that less protein could be released by immobilized bacteria than by free bacteria due to the larger mass transfer resistance it has been reported that the protein secondary structures are not very well developed in biominerals induced by immobilized halovibrio mesolongii hmy2 bacteria due to the higher precipitation rate of ca2 ions compared to the free bacteria yan et al 2022 our results correspond well to this view when a great number of dissolved proteins are released by bacteria the proteins would usually be incorporated into caco3 minerals which would hinder the precipitation of caco3 pearson et al 2020 maybe this was the main reason for the higher precipitation ratio and precipitation rate under the action of immobilized bacteria because fewer proteins could be released into the liquid by immobilized bacteria as a result of the sodium alginate gel barrier the difference in protein secondary structures present in biominerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria has rarely been studied these all suggest that v massiliensis c bacteria are involved in the biomineralization of caco3 minerals and influence the precipitation of ca2 ions xps analyses the xps results of these biominerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria show that the elements ca c o n p and s are present on the mineral surface fig 13 ca shows two different peaks which have been ascribed to ca 2p3 2 around 346 ev and ca 2p 1 2 around 350 ev liu et al 2021 yan et al 2022 three prominent c1s peaks located at around 289 286 and 284 ev indicate the presence of oc o co co c and c c h likely derived from esters ethers alcohols and amino acid side chains respectively paulo et al 2018 the oxygen peak o1s can be deconvoluted into four sub peaks 533 532 531 and 530 ev representing different states of oxygen o coh o co c c o nc o and o co from carboxylic acids carboxylates esters carbonyls and amides paulo et al 2018 the n1s peaks located at the binding energy 400 4 399 9 399 4 398 9 ev are ascribed to the nh nc o c nh2 azole cn c yan et al 2022a dong et al 2022 there is a significant difference in n1s peaks of the biominerals induced by free and immobilized bacteria there are four prominent n1s peaks under the action of free bacteria and there are two smaller n1s peaks at the most in the presence of immobilized bacteria the results suggest that more kinds of nitrogenous compounds protein were released by free bacteria and maybe the protein content was higher than that released by immobilized bacteria this conclusion is well in line with the ftir results the p2p spectra can be deconvoluted into two sub peaks namely 134 7 ev and 133 2 ev indicating that the p o and p c bond originated from dna rna and phospholipids yan et al 2022a it could be interpreted that under the action of free bacteria the p c content is the minimum at the optimal nacl concentration of 50 g l and with increasing nacl concentrations from 100 through 150 to 200 g l the p c content also increased from 73 86 through 93 81 to 96 61 the results correspond well to those in the presence of immobilized bacteria the increasing p c content is probably due to more lipoproteins being secreted by halophiles with increasing nacl concentrations further confirming the biogenesis of these caco3 minerals the s2p peaks fig 13a at 169 4 168 4 164 0 and 160 7 ev confirm the presence of sulfate so4 2 oxidized s at oxidation state 6 so2 2 s s and s2 debiemme chouvy et al 2007 yan et al 2022a s s and s2 may have originated from protein cystine and cysteine yan et al 2022a in view of the fact that the signal to noise ratio is particularly poor fig 13b the peak deconvolution of s spectra was not performed in the immobilized bacteria group indicating that there is a lower s content incorporated onto the mineral surface than in the free bacteria group from the significant difference in s peak deconvolution it could be deduced that the content of protein especially sulfur containing protein released by immobilized bacteria was much lower than that released by free bacteria due to the main barrier sodium alginate gel the presence of these chemical bonds oc o co co c c c h nc o c nh cn c p o p c and s s indicates that metabolites released by v massiliensis c bacteria were involved in the growth of these minerals further illustrating the important role played by the bacteria in the biomineralization of ca2 ions it has been reported that in soils and sediments organic matter om can be incorporated into different kinds of minerals producing mineral organic matter complexes hu et al 2022 in this study the harvested caco3 minerals are also mineral om complexes well in line with the opinion of hu et al 2022 stable carbon isotope composition of the biominerals the carbon source of carbonate minerals is one crucial issue for understanding the mechanism of micp huang et al 2022 δ13cpdb of these biominerals changed slightly from 16 10 to 17 54 at different nacl concentrations much more negative than the 5 95 of calcite formed only by cacl2 and na2co3 table 3 indicating that there is a significant difference in stable carbon isotope composition between the biotic and abiotic carbonate minerals the c source of abiotic calcite came from the nahco3 na2co3 and atmospheric co2 8 and that of biotic caco3 was diversified including beef extract 18 4 yan et al 2022a tryptone 21 3 yan et al 2022a co2 released by bacterial metabolism nahco3 and na2co3 as well as atmospheric co2 therefore it can be inferred that part of the c source in these biotic minerals originated from the organics due to the similar δ13cpdb values sánchez román et al 2011 in the process of ca2 ion precipitation co2 coming from the microbial metabolization could be transformed into co3 2 and hco3 ions under the action of ca in alkaline conditions thus increasing the supersaturation of caco3 minerals and resulting in the sharp decrease of ca2 ion concentration thermogravimetry derivative thermogravimetry tg dtg and differential scanning calorimetry dsc analyses of biominerals from the tg curve fig s9a it can be seen that there is a significant weight loss in the temperature range 600 800 c well in line with the decomposition of caco3 minerals dtg results show that the peak temperature of calcite was 751 9 748 1 and 693 9 c at nacl concentrations of 50 100 and 150 g l fig s9b respectively indicating that the thermal stability of calcite decreases with increasing nacl concentrations well in line with the decreasing crystallinity deduced from the increasing fwhm the dsc results show that the enthalpy change h of calcite was 4742 4367 and 4321 j mol at nacl concentrations of 50 100 and 150 g l fig s9c respectively also revealing that the thermal stability of calcite decreased with increasing nacl concentrations 4 conclusions v massiliensis c bacteria can create an alkaline environment by increasing ph to 9 1 and increasing the supersaturation of caco3 by producing hco3 and co3 2 ions promoting the precipitation of caco3 and facilitating the removal of ca2 in hypersaline water with increasing nacl concentrations ca2 concentrations decreased from the original concentration of 1200 mg l to 219 562 mg l for 6 days under the action of free bacteria and 71 214 mg l and 21 159 mg l for the two groups of optimal immobilized bacteria on the 6th day ca2 precipitation ratios were 55 81 under the action of free bacteria much lower than the 82 94 and 87 98 under the action of immobilized bacteria without any bacteria ca2 ion concentrations slowly decreased and ca2 ion precipitation ratios were not beyond 10 on the 4th day significantly lower than those under the action of bacteria the recycled immobilized bacteria had a higher activity in ca2 removal than the free bacteria preculture of the immobilized bacteria was a good way to increase the efficiency of ca2 ion removal due to the higher ca activity compared to the un precultured immobilized bacteria the humic acid like substances protein dna and polysaccharides released by bacteria promoted the removal of ca2 ions the cell surface and intracellular cytoplasm acted as the nucleation sites promoting the formation of ca bearing biominerals and further facilitating the ca2 ion removal in hw the harvested calcium carbonate minerals were
