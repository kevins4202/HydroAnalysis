more attentions in the past two decades due to its widespread applications in military and civilian fields peng et al 2020d xiang et al 2018 shi et al 2017 dong et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 wang et al 2021 many challenging tasks that are difficult to perform by the individual vehicle can be completed by a collection of vehicles in a collaborative behavior li et al 2020 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 cheng and li 2019 coordinated control of asvs can be categorized into these topics flocking peng et al 2020b formation dai et al 2018 he et al 2019 li et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 jin 2016 surroundinghu et al 2020 liu et al 2020a consensus liu et al 2018 do 2016 and containment yoo and park 2017 yu et al 2019 qin et al 2019a b the aforementioned works presented in peng et al 2020b dai et al 2018 he et al 2019 li et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 jin 2016 hu et al 2020 liu et al 2020a 2018 do 2016 yoo and park 2017 yu et al 2019 qin et al 2019a b focus on trajectory based coordinated control where the update of leader information is determinate and time related however in many scenarios asvs are guided by paths where the update of leader information is parameterized zheng 2020 yu et al 2017 zheng and feroskhan 2017 coordinated control of multiple asvs guided by parameterized paths can be found in ghommam and mnif 2009 vanni et al 2008 liu et al 2020b peng et al 2018 2017a 2017b 2020c gu et al 2019 path guided coordinated control of asvs are widely reported such as criteria and rule based coordinated control eriksen et al 2020 tan et al 2010 coordinated control guided by full path information ghommam and mnif 2009 liu et al 2020b coordinated control guided by a single path vanni et al 2008 peng et al 2018 and coordinated control guided by multiple paths peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 specifically the case of multiple paths has aroused great attentions peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 in peng et al 2017a a modular control method is designed for fully actuated asvs to decouple the control loop and the estimation loop the work in peng et al 2017a addresses the state feedback case distributed output feedback controllers are designed in peng et al 2017b for multiple vessels based on a neural observer in peng et al 2020c output feedback controllers with the capacity of collision avoidance and connection preservation are developed for asvs without velocity measurements based on potential functions in gu et al 2019 a finite time anti disturbance rejection control method is developed for under actuated asvs by using modified extended state observers and artificial potential fields the existing results in peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 assume that the information transmission and control update are executed in a periodic manner which demands large communication and actuation resources therefore the aperiodic control strategy is highly expected for asvs especially in the complex sea environment ding et al 2017 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 peng et al 2020a jain et al 2018 hung et al 2020 it is of great challenge to design distributed coordinated controllers for asvs subject to unknown kinetics including external disturbances model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients in order to address this issue many approximators are introduced to estimate external disturbances and model uncertainties in kinetic control methods tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a such as feed forward neural networks tee and ge 2006 radial basis function neural networks chen et al 2020 dai et al 2018 single hidden layer neural networks liu et al 2019 recurrent neural networks peng et al 2017a b and fuzzy logic systems peng et al 2020a in general these methods tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a can achieve improved performance in the presence of unknown vehicle dynamics while they may suffer from two limitations firstly the unknown input coefficients are assumed to be a priori the exact input coefficients of asvs need to be determined by a series of time consuming and expensive experiments in applications such as sea trials and pond experiments besides the exact input coefficients identified by experiment in advance may be invalid when actuator faults or load changes occur suddenly secondly historical data of asvs is not utilized in these methods it is known that historical data has rich motion information and it is desirable to utilize these data to improve the performance of the adaptive control systems hou and wang 2013 in light of the above observations a path guided distributed coordinated control method is proposed based on event triggered mechanisms for networked multiple asvs in the presence of fully unknown kinetics firstly an event triggered kinematic control law is developed by utilizing the aperiodic information received from the communication network and the last event triggered velocity is utilized to predict the desired path during the triggering interval then an event triggered kinetic control law is designed by using a third order linear tracking differentiator ltd and the control input is updated by judging the predefined event a concurrent learning based neural predictor is constructed based on historical data to identify model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients simultaneously finally an event triggered path update law is designed for path variables to achieve synchronization by using the aperiodic information the proposed method can ensure the input to state stability of the resulting closed loop system and error signals converge to a residual set besides zeno behavior is excluded for the closed loop compared with the existing works the main features of this paper are listed as below in contrast to the existing coordinated control methods guided by the full path information ghommam and mnif 2009 liu et al 2020b the single path vanni et al 2008 peng et al 2018 and multiple paths peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 with the continuous or periodic communication the proposed coordinated control method herein is event driven and the asvs communicate only if appropriate events are triggered besides in contrast to the methods in ghommam and mnif 2009 liu et al 2020b vanni et al 2008 peng et al 2018 2017a 2017b 2020c gu et al 2019 based on continuous or periodic update of path variables the update of leader variable herein is also event driven and the transmitting of leader information is aperiodic therefore the proposed coordinated control method is able to reduce the communication times of asvs in contrast to the existing kinetic control methods in tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a based on neural networks and fuzzy logic systems for asvs where input coefficients are assumed to be a priori a concurrent learning based neural predictor is proposed to identify the unknown input coefficients the convergence of adaptive parameters can be guaranteed besides in contrast to the kinetics control methods in tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a the control input is updated with an aperiodic scheme only if the predefined event is triggered therefore the proposed kinetics control method is capable of reducing the actuation update of asvs the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the necessary preliminaries and the formulation of path guided distributed coordinated control of asvs section 3 elaborates on the distributed coordinated controller design based on event triggered mechanisms and

assumption 2 if the distributed coordinated controllers are chosen as table 1 the closed loop system cascaded by 32 and 35 is input to state stable and the control objectives are achieved proof the total closed loop system can be regarded as a cascade system consisting of two subsystems 32 and 35 the input to state stability property of 32 and 35 has been established in lemma 1 and lemma 2 separately therefore the closed loop system is input to state stable based on cascade stability theory lemma 4 6 in khalil 2002 furthermore 39 yields that 40 e 3 t max κ o e 3 0 t i 1 n f φ c x i 2 x

definition 2 8 in wang and hill 2009 has shown that ε i is bounded with an upper bound ε i r theorem 3 2 in guo and zhao 2011 has shown that ι i is bounded with an upper bound ι i r thus the bound of

f σ f with σ f σ 1 1 σ n f 1 t and σ p σ p with σ p σ n f 1 2 σ n 2 t due to s i 1 s s i 1 is bounded let x 1 x 1 1 t x n f 1 t t x r x r n f 1 t x r n t t and s 1 s i 1 t s n f 1 t t along 2 one yields that s 1 l 1 i 3 x 1 l 2 i 3 x r furthermore it yields that x 1 l 1 1 l 2 i 3 x r s 1 l 1 where i 3 denotes the 3 by 3 unitary matrix and l 1 is the minimum singular value of l 1 by lemma 1 l 1 1 l 2 is equal to 1 such that x 1 x r s 1 l 1 it is demonstrated in lemma 2 that z j is bounded and it follows that θ j θ 0 z j l l by using lemma 2 in zhang and lewis 2012 with l l being the minimum singular value of l l to sum up error signals in the closed loop converge to a residual set and the geometric objective and the dynamic objective are achieved 4 3 zeno behavior analysis of the closed loop system next it is shown that zeno behavior does not occur based on the proposed event triggered mechanism by the following theorem theorem 2 consider the asv governed by 1 if controllers are chosen as table 1 zeno behavior does not occur during the control process such that t i 1 p 1 t i 1 p 0 t i 2 p 1 t i 2 p 0 t j 1 p 1 t j 1 p 0 t j 2 p 1 t j 2 p 0 proof the proofs of t i 1 p 1 t i 1 p 0 t j 1 p 1 t j 1 p 0 t j 2 p 1 t j 2 p 0 are similar to theorem 3 2 in seyboth et al 2013 and are omitted the derivative of over t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 is given by d d t u i d d t u i t u i 1 2 u i τ r i over t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 is given by τ r i θ ˆ i θ ˆ i t θ ˆ i σ k i 2 s i 2 α r i d w ˆ i t ϕ i ξ i 1 θ ˆ i σ k i 2 s i 2 α r i d d w ˆ i ϕ i w ˆ i ϕ i ξ i based on theorem 1 the error signals in the closed loop system are bounded ϕ i ξ i is also bounded over t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 due to the bound activation function therefore u i always exists an upper bound u i with lim t t i 2 p u i 0 one yields that u i u i t t i 2 p with t t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 due to the equation 21 lim t t i 2 p u i σ i 2 it follows that t i 2 p 1 t i 2 p σ i 2 u i because the minimum inter event interval time converges to a lower bound zeno behavior does not occur in communication and actuation remark 3 the upper bounds of error signals in the closed loop system contain three thresholds of event triggered mechanisms therefore the control performance is influenced by the predefined thresholds because the thresholds of triggering errors converge to non zero constants ultimately zeno behavior can be avoided 5 simulation results in this section two simulation scenarios are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed path guided distributed coordinated control method 5 1 formation control scenario guided by three lines consider a vehicle fleet consisting of seven asvs and three virtual leaders and the dynamics of asv employed herein is given in fossen 2011 three virtual leaders are set to move along the parameterized paths governed by x r 8 θ 8 θ 8 24 π 4 t x r 9 θ 9 12 θ 9 86 π 4 t and x r 10 θ 10 θ 10 124 π 4 t with u s 0 25 the environment disturbance w i is modeled as first order gauss markov processes with w i γ w i w i w d i where γ w i r 3 3 and w d i r 3 denotes the white noise the communication topology among the fleet is described as fig 4 in the simulation the control parameters are selected as table 2 the control gains k i 1 and k i 2 can be selected according to the desired output response large k i 1 and k i 2 can increase the tracking speed and reduce the steady state error but too large k i 1 and k i 2 may cause oscillations in the transient stage the adaptation parameters γ i and k ξ i can be selected according to the desired identification response large γ i and k ξ i can increase the speed and accuracy of identification but too large γ i and k ξ i may cause oscillations in the transient stage parameters related to event triggering scheme σ i 1 σ i 2 σ j 1 σ j 2 ε i 1 ε i 2 ε j 1 ε j 2 ℏ i 1 ℏ i 2 ℏ j 1 and ℏ j 2 are selected according to the desired control accuracy large event triggered thresholds can reduce the times of communication and actuation whereas the tracking errors will increase small event triggered thresholds can reduce the tracking errors whereas frequency of communication and actuation would increase there exists a trade off between the control accuracy and the triggering times in the simulation the proposed method is compared with an event triggered control etc method based on a neural predictor including an event triggered kinematic control law 10 an event triggered kinetic control law 19 and 20 an event triggered path update law 29 and a neural predictor in peng et al 2019 43 x ˆ i 2 y i ξ ˆ i k i 2 ρ i x i 2 ξ ˆ i γ i p r o j ξ ˆ i y i x i 2 t where p r o j denotes the projection operator simulation results are provided as follows output trajectories of asvs are shown in fig 5 it can be observed that the outputs of seven asvs converge to a convex hull spanned by three parameterized paths and the geometric objective of path guided distributed coordinated control objective described in section ii is achieved fig 6 gives the evolution of event triggered coordinated error s i 1 e and it is shown that s i 1 e converges to a boundary in the steady state fig 7 depicts the evolution of three path variables θ 8 θ 9 and θ 10 and it demonstrates that the dynamic objective of path guided distributed coordinated control described in section ii is achieved the triggering times of followers and leaders are listed in table 3 including communication and actuation times of asvs and communication times of leaders it is demonstrated in table 3 that the event triggering times by using the proposed event triggered control method is less than the total time triggered sampling times and therefore the proposed event triggered control method is able to reduce the burden of communication and actuation fig 8 depicts the evolution of control input u using the proposed method and the event triggered control method based on the neural predictor where u u 1 t u 7 t t the estimation performance of the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictors and the neural predictor in peng et al 2019 are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 fig 9 depicts the estimation performance of unknown input coefficients of the two methods it is observed from fig 9 that unknown input coefficients can be accurately identified by using the proposed method whereas the unknown input gain cannot be identified by using the neural predictor in peng et al 2019 fig 10 depicts the learning performance of the neural networks by using the two methods the model uncertainties can be approximated by using the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictors thanks to the accurate identification of unknown input coefficients moreover figs 9 and 10 imply that the model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients can be simultaneously estimated by the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictor 5 2 formation control scenario guided by three curves in this subsection a simulation example with a new motion scenario is introduced to further demonstrate the efficacy of the distributed coordinated control method based on event triggered mechanisms where sudden change of input coefficients is considered consider the asv fleet utilized in subsection 5 1 the communication topology among the fleet is described as fig 4 three virtual leaders are set to move along the parameterized paths governed by x r 8 θ 8 5 sin θ 8 θ 8 24 atan 5 cos θ 8 1 t x r 9 θ 9 5 sin θ 9 θ 9 74 atan 5 cos θ 9 1 t and x r 10 θ 10 5 sin θ 10 θ 10 124 atan 5 cos θ 10 1 t with u s 0 23 the environment disturbance w i is modeled as first order gauss markov processes using in subsection 5 1 in the simulation the control parameters are selected as table 4 and input coefficients is changed suddenly at t 50 s for illustrating the efficacy the proposed method is also compared with the event triggered control method based on the neural predictor in subsection 5 1 simulation results are provided as follows output trajectories of asvs are shown in fig 11 it is observed from fig 11 that outputs of asvs converge to a convex hull spanned by parameterized paths and therefore the geometric objective is achieved fig 12 depicts the evolution of event triggered coordinated error s 1 e using two methods where s 1 e s 1 1 e t s 7 1 e t t it is shown in fig 12 that the tracking speed of the proposed method is faster than the tracking speed of the event triggered control method based on the neural predictor fig 13 depicts the evolution of the path variables and it demonstrates that the dynamic objective is achieved fig 14 depicts the norm of control input u by using two methods and a quantitative analysis is presented in table 5 table 5 shows that the average value median and control signal metric of the control input by using the proposed method is lower than those by using the etc method based on the neural predictor where control signal metric csm refer to 25 in stepanyan et al 2009 fig 15 depicts the identification of the unknown input coefficients by using two methods it is observed from fig 15 that the unknown input coefficients can be accurately identified by using the proposed method although the sudden change of input coefficients occurs at t 50 s the identification based on the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictor is also accurate fig 16 shows the learning performance of the neural network using two methods due to the accurate identification of the unknown input coefficients model uncertainties can be approximated by the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictor as shown in fig 16 6 conclusions path guided distributed coordinated control is investigated for networked asvs in the presence of fully unknown kinetics based on event triggered mechanisms herein the proposed method consists of an event triggered kinematic control law an event triggered kinetic control law and an event triggered path update law the system resource can be saved due to aperiodic communication and actuation a concurrent learning based neural predictor is constructed by using the historical data such that model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients can be estimated simultaneously by using the cascade stability theory the resulting closed loop system is proved to input to state stable and the resulting error signals are proved to be bounded the efficacy of the proposed distributed coordinated control method for networked asvs subject to fully unknown kinetics is demonstrated by theoretical analyses and simulation

20565,this paper is concerned with distributed coordinated control of networked autonomous surface vehicles asvs guided by multiple parameterized paths the model of each asv is subject to fully unknown kinetics including environment disturbances model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients a coordinated control method is presented for multiple asvs to achieve a containment formation based on event triggered mechanisms specifically an event triggered kinematic control law is firstly developed based on aperiodic communication the desired path during the triggering interval is predicted by the last event triggered velocity then an event triggered kinetic control law is developed a third order linear tracking differentiator is introduced to take the derivative of the kinematic control law and the control input is updated only if the predefined event is triggered a concurrent learning based neural predictor is constructed by using historical data such that model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients are identified simultaneously next an event triggered path update law is constructed by using a path maneuvering design and the aperiodic information received from the network the proposed method ensures the input to state stability of the resulting closed loop system finally simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed coordinated control for networked asvs by using event triggered mechanisms and concurrent learning based neural predictors keywords path guided coordinated control autonomous surface vehicles event triggered communication and actuation concurrent learning based neural predictor 1 introduction coordinated control of autonomous surface vehicles asvs has received more and more attentions in the past two decades due to its widespread applications in military and civilian fields peng et al 2020d xiang et al 2018 shi et al 2017 dong et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 wang et al 2021 many challenging tasks that are difficult to perform by the individual vehicle can be completed by a collection of vehicles in a collaborative behavior li et al 2020 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 cheng and li 2019 coordinated control of asvs can be categorized into these topics flocking peng et al 2020b formation dai et al 2018 he et al 2019 li et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 jin 2016 surroundinghu et al 2020 liu et al 2020a consensus liu et al 2018 do 2016 and containment yoo and park 2017 yu et al 2019 qin et al 2019a b the aforementioned works presented in peng et al 2020b dai

control where the update of leader information is determinate and time related however in many scenarios asvs are guided by paths where the update of leader information is parameterized zheng 2020 yu et al 2017 zheng and feroskhan 2017 coordinated control of multiple asvs guided by parameterized paths can be found in ghommam and mnif 2009 vanni et al 2008 liu et al 2020b peng et al 2018 2017a 2017b 2020c gu et al 2019 path guided coordinated control of asvs are widely reported such as criteria and rule based coordinated control eriksen et al 2020 tan et al 2010 coordinated control guided by full path information ghommam and mnif 2009 liu et al 2020b coordinated control guided by a single path vanni et al 2008 peng et al 2018 and coordinated control guided by multiple paths peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 specifically the case of multiple paths has aroused great attentions peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 in peng et al 2017a a modular control method is designed for fully actuated asvs to decouple the control loop and the estimation loop the work in peng et al 2017a addresses the state feedback case distributed output feedback controllers are designed in peng et al 2017b for multiple vessels based on a neural observer in peng et al 2020c output feedback controllers with the capacity of collision avoidance and connection preservation are developed for asvs without velocity measurements based on potential functions in gu et al 2019 a finite time anti disturbance rejection control method is developed for under actuated asvs by using modified extended state observers and artificial potential fields the existing results in peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 assume that the information transmission and control update are executed in a periodic manner which demands large communication and actuation resources therefore the aperiodic control strategy is highly expected for asvs especially in the complex sea environment ding et al 2017 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 peng et al 2020a jain et al 2018 hung et al 2020 it is of great challenge to design distributed coordinated controllers for asvs subject to unknown kinetics including external disturbances model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients in order to address this issue many approximators are introduced to estimate external disturbances and model uncertainties in kinetic control methods tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a such as feed forward neural networks tee and ge 2006 radial basis function neural networks chen et al 2020 dai et al 2018 single hidden layer neural networks liu et al 2019 recurrent neural networks peng et al 2017a b and fuzzy logic systems peng et al 2020a in general these methods tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a can achieve improved performance in the presence of unknown vehicle dynamics while they may suffer from two limitations firstly the unknown input coefficients are assumed to be a priori the exact input coefficients of asvs need to be determined by a series of time consuming and expensive experiments in applications such as sea trials and pond experiments besides the exact input coefficients identified by experiment in advance may be invalid when actuator faults or load changes occur suddenly secondly historical data of asvs is not utilized in these methods it is known that historical data has rich motion information and it is desirable to utilize these data to improve the performance of the adaptive control systems hou and wang 2013 in light of the above observations a path guided distributed coordinated control method is proposed based on event triggered mechanisms for networked multiple asvs in the presence of fully unknown kinetics firstly an event triggered kinematic control law is developed by utilizing the aperiodic information received from the communication network and the last event triggered velocity is utilized to predict the desired path during the triggering interval then an event triggered kinetic control law is designed by using a third order linear tracking differentiator ltd and the control input is updated by judging the predefined event a concurrent learning based neural predictor is constructed based on historical data to identify model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients simultaneously finally an event triggered path update law is designed for path variables to achieve synchronization by using the aperiodic information the proposed method can ensure the input to state stability of the resulting closed loop system and error signals converge to a residual set besides zeno behavior is excluded for the closed loop compared with the existing works the main features of this paper are listed as below in contrast to the existing coordinated control methods guided by the full path information ghommam and mnif 2009 liu et al 2020b the single path vanni et al 2008 peng et al 2018 and multiple paths peng et al 2017a b 2020c gu et al 2019 with the continuous or periodic communication the proposed coordinated control method herein is event driven and the asvs communicate only if appropriate events are triggered besides in contrast to the methods in ghommam and mnif 2009 liu et al 2020b vanni et al 2008 peng et al 2018 2017a 2017b 2020c gu et al 2019 based on continuous or periodic update of path variables the update of leader variable herein is also event driven and the transmitting of leader information is aperiodic therefore the proposed coordinated control method is able to reduce the communication times of asvs in contrast to the existing kinetic control methods in tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a based on neural networks and fuzzy logic systems for asvs where input coefficients are assumed to be a priori a concurrent learning based neural predictor is proposed to identify the unknown input coefficients the convergence of adaptive parameters can be guaranteed besides in contrast to the kinetics control methods in tee and ge 2006 zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 dai et al 2018 peng et al 2017a b 2020a the control input is updated with an aperiodic scheme only if the predefined event is triggered therefore the proposed kinetics control method is capable of reducing the actuation update of asvs the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the necessary preliminaries and the formulation of path guided distributed coordinated control of asvs section 3 elaborates on the distributed coordinated controller design based on event triggered mechanisms and the concurrent learning based neural predictor section 4 establishes the stability property of the closed loop system section 5 presents simulation results finally the conclusion of this paper is given in the last section 2 problem statement and preliminaries 2 1 graph theory the communication topology among a fleet of asvs can be described by a directed graph define a directed graph g v e where v n 1 n n is a node set with n i being the ith node and n being the index of the fleet and e n j n i v v is an edge set with n j n i being an edge if n j n i e the node n j is a neighbor of the node n i a directed spanning tree denotes that there exists a root node with directed paths to all other nodes in the directed graph define a follower set f i δ 1 n f and a leader set p i δ n f 1 n for the ith node n i the directed graph g can be represented by an adjacency matrix a a i j r n n a degree matrix d diag d i and a laplacian matrix l where a i j is an adjacency weight d i is a degree

chosen as table 1 zeno behavior does not occur during the control process such that t i 1 p 1 t i 1 p 0 t i 2 p 1 t i 2 p 0 t j 1 p 1 t j 1 p 0 t j 2 p 1 t j 2 p 0 proof the proofs of t i 1 p 1 t i 1 p 0 t j 1 p 1 t j 1 p 0 t j 2 p 1 t j 2 p 0 are similar to theorem 3 2 in seyboth et al 2013 and are omitted the derivative of over t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 is given by d d t u i d d t u i t u i 1 2 u i τ r i over t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 is given by τ r i θ ˆ i θ ˆ i t θ ˆ i σ k i 2 s i 2 α r i d w ˆ i t ϕ i ξ i 1 θ ˆ i σ k i 2 s i 2 α r i d d w ˆ i ϕ i w ˆ i ϕ i ξ i based on theorem 1 the error signals in the closed loop system are bounded ϕ i ξ i is also bounded over t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 due to the bound activation function therefore u i always exists an upper bound u i with lim t t i 2 p u i 0 one yields that u i u i t t i 2 p with t t i 2 p t i 2 p 1 due to the equation 21 lim t t i 2 p u i σ i 2 it follows that t i 2 p 1 t i 2 p σ i 2 u i because the minimum inter event interval time converges to a lower bound zeno behavior does not occur in communication and actuation remark 3 the upper bounds of error signals in the closed loop system contain three thresholds of event triggered mechanisms therefore the control performance is influenced by the predefined thresholds because the thresholds of triggering errors converge to non zero constants ultimately zeno behavior can be avoided 5 simulation results in this section two simulation scenarios are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed path guided distributed coordinated control method 5 1 formation control scenario guided by three lines consider a vehicle fleet consisting of seven asvs and three virtual leaders and the dynamics of asv employed herein is given in fossen 2011 three virtual leaders are set to move along the parameterized paths governed by x r 8 θ 8 θ 8 24 π 4 t x r 9 θ 9 12 θ 9 86 π 4 t and x r 10 θ 10 θ 10 124 π 4 t with u s 0 25 the environment disturbance w i is modeled as first order gauss markov processes with w i γ w i w i w d i where γ w i r 3 3 and w d i r 3 denotes the white noise the communication topology among the fleet is described as fig 4 in the simulation the control parameters are selected as table 2 the control gains k i 1 and k i 2 can be selected according to the desired output response large k i 1 and k i 2 can increase the tracking speed and reduce the steady state error but too large k i 1 and k i 2 may cause oscillations in the transient stage the adaptation parameters γ i and k ξ i can be selected according to the desired identification response large γ i and k ξ i can increase the speed and accuracy of identification but too large γ i and k ξ i may cause oscillations in the transient stage parameters related to event triggering scheme σ i 1 σ i 2 σ j 1 σ j 2 ε i 1 ε i 2 ε j 1 ε j 2 ℏ i 1 ℏ i 2 ℏ j 1 and ℏ j 2 are selected according to the desired control accuracy large event triggered thresholds can reduce the times of communication and actuation whereas the tracking errors will increase small event triggered thresholds can reduce the tracking errors whereas frequency of communication and actuation would increase there exists a trade off between the control accuracy and the triggering times in the simulation the proposed method is compared with an event triggered control etc method based on a neural predictor including an event triggered kinematic control law 10 an event triggered kinetic control law 19 and 20 an event triggered path update law 29 and a neural predictor in peng et al 2019 43 x ˆ i 2 y i ξ

be observed that the outputs of seven asvs converge to a convex hull spanned by three parameterized paths and the geometric objective of path guided distributed coordinated control objective described in section ii is achieved fig 6 gives the evolution of event triggered coordinated error s i 1 e and it is shown that s i 1 e converges to a boundary in the steady state fig 7 depicts the evolution of three path variables θ 8 θ 9 and θ 10 and it demonstrates that the dynamic objective of path guided distributed coordinated control described in section ii is achieved the triggering times of followers and leaders are listed in table 3 including communication and actuation times of asvs and communication times of leaders it is demonstrated in table 3 that the event triggering times by using the proposed event triggered control method is less than the total time triggered sampling times and therefore the proposed event triggered control method is able to reduce the burden of communication and actuation fig 8 depicts the evolution of control input u using the proposed method and the event triggered control method based on the neural predictor where u u 1 t u 7 t t the estimation performance of the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictors and the neural predictor in peng et al 2019 are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 fig 9 depicts the estimation performance of unknown input coefficients of the two methods it is observed from fig 9 that unknown input coefficients can be accurately identified by using the proposed method whereas the unknown input gain cannot be identified by using the neural predictor in peng et al 2019 fig 10 depicts the learning performance of the neural networks by using the two methods the model uncertainties can be approximated by using the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictors thanks to the accurate identification of unknown input coefficients moreover figs 9 and 10 imply that the model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients can be simultaneously estimated by the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictor 5 2 formation control scenario guided by three curves in this subsection a simulation example with a new motion scenario is introduced to further demonstrate the efficacy of the distributed coordinated control method based on event triggered mechanisms where sudden change of input coefficients is considered consider the asv fleet utilized in subsection 5 1 the communication topology among the fleet is described as fig 4 three virtual leaders are set to move along the parameterized paths governed by x r 8 θ 8 5 sin θ 8 θ 8 24 atan 5 cos θ 8 1 t x r 9 θ 9 5 sin θ 9 θ 9 74 atan 5 cos θ 9 1 t and x r 10 θ 10 5 sin θ 10 θ 10 124 atan 5 cos θ 10 1 t with u s 0 23 the environment disturbance w i is modeled as first order gauss markov processes using in subsection 5 1 in the simulation the control parameters are selected as table 4 and input coefficients is changed suddenly at t 50 s for illustrating the efficacy the proposed method is also compared with the event triggered control method based on the neural predictor in subsection 5 1 simulation results are provided as follows output trajectories of asvs are shown in fig 11 it is observed from fig 11 that outputs of asvs converge to a convex hull spanned by parameterized paths and therefore the geometric objective is achieved fig 12 depicts the evolution of event triggered coordinated error s 1 e using two methods where s 1 e s 1 1 e t s 7 1 e t t it is shown in fig 12 that the tracking speed of the proposed method is faster than the tracking speed of the event triggered control method based on the neural predictor fig 13 depicts the evolution of the path variables and it demonstrates that the dynamic objective is achieved fig 14 depicts the norm of control input u by using two methods and a quantitative analysis is presented in table 5 table 5 shows that the average value median and control signal metric of the control input by using the proposed method is lower than those by using the etc method based on the neural predictor where control signal metric csm refer to 25 in stepanyan et al 2009 fig 15 depicts the identification of the unknown input coefficients by using two methods it is observed from fig 15 that the unknown input coefficients can be accurately identified by using the proposed method although the sudden change of input coefficients occurs at t 50 s the identification based on the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictor is also accurate fig 16 shows the learning performance of the neural network using two methods due to the accurate identification of the unknown input coefficients model uncertainties can be approximated by the proposed concurrent learning based neural predictor as shown in fig 16 6 conclusions path guided distributed coordinated control is investigated for networked asvs in the presence of fully unknown kinetics based on event triggered mechanisms herein the proposed method consists of an event triggered kinematic control law an event triggered kinetic control law and an event triggered path update law the system resource can be saved due to aperiodic communication and actuation a concurrent learning based neural predictor is constructed by using the historical data such that model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients can be estimated simultaneously by using the cascade stability theory the resulting closed loop system is proved to input to state stable and the resulting error signals are proved to be bounded the efficacy of the proposed distributed coordinated control method for networked asvs subject to fully unknown kinetics is demonstrated by theoretical analyses and simulation

20566,the acoustic properties of seafloor coral sand sediments are of significant meaning for accurately modeling underwater sound propagation in sea areas around coral reef islands to ultrasonically measure coral sand sediments with different grain sizes sediment samples from coral islands were screened and remolded into five types of samples with different grain sizes this study measured the sound speed and attenuation in the frequency range of 27 247 khz and analyzed the frequency dependence of the acoustic properties the results showed that the sound speed increased significantly with frequency suggesting an approximately linear relation the sound speed dispersion in the coarse grained sediments was larger than that in the fine grained sediments the measured attenuation data showed a variable frequency dependence among the different sediment types the measured data were compared with biot stoll model bs model predictions and the fitting results showed that intergranular pores can lead to sound speed data model mismatches the attenuation data model comparisons revealed that sediments with different grain sizes have different sound wave energy loss mechanisms the bs model with grain contact squirt flow and shear drag bicsqs model can match the attenuation data more consistently than the bs model the results show that scattering is an important factor in sound attenuation in coral sand sediment and the attenuation scattering factors for different grain size sediments were provided keywords sound speed attenuation coral sand sediments frequency dependence geo acoustic models 1 introduction the acoustic properties of seafloor sediments are important for understanding underwater acoustic propagation and are basic data in several fields such as underwater engineering and sediment classification jackson and richardson 2007 therefore the acoustic parameters of seafloor sediments mainly the sound speed and attenuation need to be accurately determined so that they can be used as input data for modeling sea bottom reflection and bottom scattering sessarego et al 2008 many studies have focused on the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation with frequencies ranging from a few hundred hertz up to a few thousands of kilohertz zimmer et al 2010 and have used the measured data to assess the ability of geo acoustic propagation models the study of the frequency dependence of acoustic properties is important and can realize the extrapolation of sound speed and attenuation outside the measured frequency range the frequency dependence relationships combined with the biot stoll model can be used to predict the sound speed and convert the high frequency measurements to low to mid frequency conditions endler et al 2016 the methods used to obtain the frequency dependence of acoustic properties of seafloor sediments commonly include in situ measurements lee et al 2016 yang and tang 2017 li et al 2019 ballard et al 2020 laboratory measurements lee et al 2007 huang et al 2013 kim et al 2019 and remote sensing zhou et al 2009 but most of the previous measurement objects were siliceous sand sediments nosal et al 2008 since coral sand sediment is common in coral island areas and has very different physical properties than siliceous sediment the measurements of acoustic properties in coral sand sediment need to be targeted and more comprehensive however the acoustic properties still need to be measured over a broad range of frequencies to establish reliable empirical or theoretical relationships zimmer et al 2010 which can be used to extrapolate the frequency dependence of the sound speed and attenuation in seafloor coral sand sediments over the desired frequency range several studies have determined the acoustic properties of coral sand sediments by performing sampling measurements or in situ measurements hamilton 1980 presented that there is no significant relation between sound speed and caco3 content while a lower caco3 content can lead to a higher porosity and lower wet density brandes et al 2001 measured the sound speed and attenuation in coral sand sediments in florida keys and found that the acoustic characterization displays a good correlation with the shell lag deposits in gravity cores richardson and briggs 2004 reported the sound speed and attenuation in sediments measured at 400 khz from 12 carbonate sites and demonstrated that coral sand sediments have higher attenuations than siliceous sediments while they have similar sound speeds fu et al 2004 measured the in situ acoustic properties of coral sand sediments offshore of oahu hawaii and considered that coral sand sound speeds are lower than quartz sand sound speeds while coral sand attenuation are slightly higher than those of other sediment types the above measurements for coral sand sediments mainly focused on the sound speed and attenuation at a single frequency and discussed the relationships between acoustic properties and physical properties nosal et al 2008 reported a small but observable sound speed dispersion in carbonate sediments at a frequency of 20 100 khz using an in situ measurement method and compared the measured data to predictions of two common geo acoustic models the biot stoll hereafter called the bs model and grain shearing models however the abovementioned studies focused on the measurement of a single type of coral sand sediment kimura 2011 reported the sound speed dispersion and attenuation in four kinds of water saturated silica sands with different grain sizes and analyzed the grain size dependence of acoustic properties in silica sands the grain size dependence of sound speed dispersion and attenuation in coral sand sediments has not been clarified yet therefore it is necessary to establish the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in coral sand sediments with different grain sizes the object of this study is to measure the acoustic properties of coral sand sediments over the frequency range of 25 247 khz the original sediments were screened and remolded and these measured samples have narrow size distributions the measurement results were used to determine the relationship between the mean grain size and other physical properties including the wet bulk density and porosity this study also considered the dispersion of sound speed and the frequency dependence of attenuation in sediments with different grain sizes and compared the measured results to the bs model and bs model with grain contact squirt flow and shear drag model bicsqs model predictions 2 materials and measuring methods 2 1 coral sand sediments the coral sand sediment samples were collected from coral reef islands in the south china sea the samples had a complex granular composition the component of 2 5 mm grains was 9 6 the component of 1 2 mm grains was 9 1 the component of 0 5 1 mm grains was 18 6 the component of 0 075 0 5 mm grains was 48 9 and the component of 0 075 mm grains was 13 8 to measure the acoustic properties of coral sand sediments with different grain sizes we remolded the samples in the laboratory first we dried the samples then we screened the sediments into five classes following the granular components fig 1 and boiled the samples to remove bubbles thus the coral sand sediments were remolded in plexiglass tubes to create the following remolded samples silt sediment ss fine sand fs coarse sand cs very coarse sand vcs and fine gravel fg these remolded samples were saturated and well sorted the inner diameters of the plexiglass tubes were 94 60 mm and the lengths of the samples were approximately 40 cm the mean grain sizes of the remolded samples were measured in the plexiglass tubes under the conditions of atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of 21 6 21 9 c 2 2 microscopic structure measurements the microscopic structure of the intergranular pore distribution was studied using a ge phoenix v tome x x ray computed tomography xct system xct was applied to describe the internal structure and the intergranular pores of the coral sand sediment samples from the 2d and 3d images of xct scanning the spatial distributions of sediment water and pores could be clearly observed using the scanning images the main pores of the sediment samples were distinguished and the porosity of the sediment samples were roughly calculated 2 3 ultrasonic measurements the measurement method referenced the technique developed by richardson and briggs richardson 1986 which is useful for measuring the acoustic properties of sediments the details of the water coupling laboratory acoustic measurement system were described in sun et al 2020 the whole measurement system consists of an acoustic measuring platform a signal generator a power amplifier a pulser receiver instrument and two planar acoustic transducers to ultrasonically measure the sediment samples the sediment cores were placed on the acoustic measuring platform as shown in fig 2 the planar transmitting and receiving transducers were pressed onto opposite sides of the sample cores the sediment and measuring platform were placed in the water tank which ensured that the sediments were saturated during the acoustic measurement the water can increase the coupling between the acoustic transducers and the tube wall which can avoid direct contact between the sediment and the transducers the acoustic transducers maintained a constant distance apart and maintained contact with the core tube the ultrasonic measurement parameters included a sampling interval of 0 1 μs a single channel sampling length of 4096 points and 3 or 5 cycle pulsed sine waves the dominant frequencies of the 8 transmitting transducers were 25 khz 47 khz 73 khz 87 khz 111 khz 165 khz 216 khz and 247 khz for each sample the acoustic measurement was repeated six times after measuring the sound speed in the sediments the water sample was measured using the same method the acoustic measurement was conducted under the conditions of atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of 21 6 22 2 c 2 4 data processing the measurement system used a water filled core tube as a standard to obtain the travel time through the core liner and the electronic time delays as shown in fig 3 the acoustic signals in the sediments and in the water had a certain relationship which made it easy to calculate the travel time differences δt using a cross correlation or a peak picking method the sound speed was calculated using the travel time differences between the acoustic signals transmitted through the sediment samples and those transmitted through the identical reference tubes filled with water the attenuation was calculated from the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of the received amplitude in the water to that in the sediments the sound speed and attenuation were calculated with the following expressions jackson and richardson 2007 1 c p c w 1 c w δ t d 2 α p 20 d log 10 e w e s where cp and cw are the sound speeds of the sediment and water m s d is the inner diameter of the tube m δt is the travel time difference between the signals in the water and sediment and αp is the attenuation in sediment db m the value of cw was obtained using the relation given by medwin s equation medwin 1975 for the sound speed in fresh water as a function of temperature 3 measurement results 3 1 physical property measurement results the physical parameters of the sediments with different grain sizes are shown in table 1 the grain size distribution curves for different types of sediments are drawn in fig 4 as shown in table 1 both the mean grain size and porosity differ greatly among the five types of samples the ss and fs samples with relatively fine grains have lower porosities the cs vcs and fg samples with relatively coarse grains have higher porosities this is an unusual relationship compared to porosity found in saturated marine sediments since the sample we used is single grain size sample and in the single grain size no smaller particles are filled between the single particles thus coarse particles have greater porosity because they have a larger contact surface which is different from the natural sediments this indicates that even though natural sediments have the same grain size as our samples their porosity can vary greatly from the natural sediments 3 2 acoustic measurement results table 2 shows the average repeated measurement sound speed ratios at different frequencies in the sediment samples with different grain sizes the sound speed ratio was calculated as the ratio of the sediment sound speed c p to the water sound speed c w within 25 247 khz the sound speed ratio of ss was 1 054 1 083 that of fs was 1 054 1 083 that of cs was 1 029 1 047 and that of vcs was 1 030 1 074 as the high frequency part of a signal attenuates significantly the sound speed in fg sediments at 216 khz and 247 khz could not be calculated using the high frequency signals here a comparison of the sound speed ratios among the sediment samples with different grain sizes showed that the ss and fs samples with high bulk densities had higher sound speeds than the other three samples with low bulk densities the relations between the bulk densities and the sound speeds were consistent with the study results obtained and conformed to the relationships between the sound speed and physical properties of the sediments according to measurement results in section 3 1 the fine grained sediments have lower porosity so their higher bulk density and sound speeds are not surprising table 3 shows the measured attenuation at different frequencies for the sediment samples with different grain sizes the measured attenuation varied from approximately 9 25 db m to 207 310 db m in the measurement frequency range of 25 250 khz the sediments with different grain sizes had similar attenuation at low frequencies while the vcs and fg had higher attenuation at the higher frequencies in general the attenuation has no obvious relationships with the sediment types and physical properties nosal et al 2008 reported that the in situ attenuation in carbonate sediments varied from 15 to 75 db m in coarse grained sediment and 22 62 db m in fine grained sediment in the frequency range of 20 100 khz the measured data for cs and ss in this study are close to but slightly higher than the measurement results presented in nosal et al 2008 the frequency dependencies of the sound speed ratio and the attenuation are illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in these two figures each data point indicates the mean value calculated from six repetitive measurements the maximum standard deviations of these six measurements were approximately 4 m s for sound speed and approximately 9 db m for attenuation the regression equations between the acoustic properties and the measurement frequency are listed in table 4 according to these relations the sound speed ratio of these sediments increases weakly as the measurement frequency increases from 25 to 247 khz suggesting a weak positive linear relationship between the sound speed ratio and the measurement frequency the attenuation in the sediment increases greatly within the measured frequency range the attenuation is proportional to the frequency to a power of 0 86 1 62 in this study as shown in table 4 and shows different frequency dependence for the sediments with different grain sizes which indicates a discrepancy between our data and the previously reported data the deviation of the attenuation coefficient from a first power dependence to the square root dependence on frequency has been reported in several studies williams et al 2002 reported that the attenuation of the water saturated sand measured during sax99 shows a linear frequency dependence the grain shearing model for wave propagation in saturated unconsolidated sediments showed that the attenuation varies with frequency as approximately f 1 buckingham 2005 the sax04 data for water saturated sand showed that the attenuation varies with frequency as approximately f 1 2 hefner and jackson 2010 while several laboratory measurements suggested a squared frequency dependence seifert et al 1999 differing opinions on the frequency dependence of attenuation and on the sound propagation attenuation mechanism have been presented in recent studies as shown in table 4 the attenuations for the fine grain sediments ss and fs show a linear variation with frequency the exponent is about 1 0 which is consistent with grain shearing model the attenuations for another three sediments show the obviously frequency dependence the exponent is larger than 1 0 than the fine grain sediments 4 discussions in this section the sound speed dispersion and attenuation data are compared with the results of the bs model and the bicsqs model the bs model and the bicsqs model are geo acoustic propagation models that can predict the sound speed and attenuation of seafloor sediments and the specific equations and the main properties of the bs model and the bicsqs model are listed in the appendix furthermore both of these models can be used to predict the dispersion of sound speed and the frequency dependence of attenuation the bs model for elastic wave propagation in porous media has been applied to water saturated sediments williams 2001 in response to acoustic excitation the bs model accounts for the relative motion between pore fluids and this model assumes that the shear and bulk frame moduli are complex and frequency dependent chotiros and isakson 2004 the bicsqs model extends the bs model by incorporating frequency dependent losses that arise from the inclusion of grain contact squirt flow and viscous shear drag into frequency dependent complex frame moduli lee et al 2016 the input parameters for these acoustic models are first discussed and then a comparison of the measured data and the modelled curves is performed as the porosity determined with xct has a low accuracy the appropriate porosity is obtained by the sound speed dispersion model data fit 4 1 the input parameters for acoustic models the empirical equations from several studies have provided the calculation method for input parameters to establish the bs model and the bicsqs model prediction curves the mean grain size and xct porosity measured in the laboratory from each core sample table 1 were used to calculate or predict input parameters for the sediment acoustic models the bs model and bicsqs model input parameters can be divided into three categories solid particle parameters pore fluid parameters and solid frame parameters the grain bulk modulus fluid bulk modulus viscosity of water and fluid density were obtained from the literature williams et al 2002 a tabulated grain bulk modulus of 74 gpa was used for the coral sand sediments sumino and anderson 1984 nosal et al 2008 a fluid bulk modulus of 2 24 gpa was used for the pore water according to chotiros and isakson 2004 the relaxation frequencies for bicsqs model were obtained by the data model fitting method when the attenuation data are fit only in a least squares sense the permeability pore size tortuosity frame shear modulus and frame bulk modulus were calculated using the equations introduced in schock 2004 according to the physical relationship of kozeny carman holland and brunson 1988 the permeability κ in m2 can be approximated by 3 κ 1 k s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 where s 0 is the specific surface of the particles in the sediment m 1 and can be defined as s0 6 μ g where u g is the mean grain diameter m as shown in table 1 k is an empirical constant approximately equal to 5 and n is the porosity schock 2004 established the error introduced by eq 3 in calculating permeability assuming that eq 3 overestimates the permeability by a factor of 10 on average and extended the equation as 4 κ u g 2 180 n 3 1 n 2 1 10 the tortuosity α can be calculated following stoll 1977 5 α 1 35 0 3 0 4125 ϕ 3 0 ϕ 4 4 ϕ 8 ϕ 8 where ϕ is the mean grain size dimensionless and ϕ log 2 u g where u g is the mean grain diameter mm hovem and ingram 1979 established an equation developed using the hydraulic radius concept for uniform spherical grains to calculate the pore radius to consider the estimation error schock 2004 provided a factor of 10 4 for the equation that overestimates the pore radius and extended the equation to calculate the pore size a in meters 6 a u g 3 n 1 n 1 1 8 the input physical parameters of the bs model using the xct porosity are summarized in table 5 4 2 comparison between measured data and the model curves the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in sediments with different grain sizes were experimentally measured and theoretically predicted by the bs and bicsqs models and the results are plotted in figs 7 11 note that the sound speed data were presented as the ratio of the sound speed measured in the sediment to the sound speed measured in the water in these figures the red dotted lines were plotted by considering the parameters in table 5 in which the parameters were obtained or calculated using the xct porosity as shown in these figures both the predicted sound speed and attenuation curves of the bs model deviate from the measured data the predicted sound speed and the predicted attenuation are considerably higher than the measured data considering that the xct porosity has low measurement accuracy because intragranular and very small pores cannot be distinguished by the scanning images the xct porosity underestimated the actual porosity of the coral sand sediment and an incorrect input porosity may lead to data model mismatch to compare the measured data with the predictions it is essential to adjust the model porosity to achieve the best fit between the measured sound speed and the prediction curves in a least squares sense the optimum fitting solution of the measured sound speed and the predicted value of the bs model was used to obtain the fitted porosity that is the minimum deviation between the fitted value and the measured value was reached then the fitted porosity was input to the bs and bicsqs models to obtain the sound speed dispersion and attenuation dispersion the input physical parameters of the bs model and the bicsqs model using the corrected porosity are summarized in table 6 in figs 7 11 the red solid lines for bs model and the black solid lines for bicsqs model were plotted by considering the parameters in table 6 these lines show that the measured sound speed has a small positive dispersion in the frequency range of 27 247 khz we also note that the sound speeds in the vcs fg and cs sediments with larger grain sizes are smaller than those in the ss and fs sediments with smaller grain sizes the predicted results of the bs and bicsqs models are also consistent with the measured sound speeds especially in the ss fs and cs sediments with smaller grain sizes and as the grain size increases the curves of the bs and bicsqs models deviate from the measured sound speeds and the measured values lie between the prediction curves of the bs and bicsqs models the predicted values of the bicsqs model depend strongly on the relaxation frequency chotiros and isakson 2004 these values were obtained in our work by fitting the attenuation data it is not fully understood why the same model parameters do not fit the sound speed data well at the highest frequencies in figs 7 11 the measured attenuations show clear positive dispersion in the frequency range of 27 247 khz generally the variation trend of the predicted curve of the bicsqs model is consistent with the measured data and the predicted values slightly underestimate the measured values however in the bs model the predicted values clearly underestimate the measured values and as the frequency increases the discrepancy becomes larger the attenuation data increase nonlinearly with frequency whereas the bs model yields an attenuation coefficient that increases almost the f1 2 frequency dependence this is because the bs model predicts absorption due to the viscous dissipation of pore fluid only kimura 2011 seifert et al 1999 also proved that for unconsolidated sand fluid flow models that imply significant effects of viscous pore fluids on ultrasonic waves cannot accurately reflect laboratory measurements scattering is the main attenuation mechanism for ultrasonic p waves and the attenuation shows a frequency squared dependence for all measurements regardless of viscosity in the measurement frequency range here we used a three dimensional generalized dynamic composite elastic medium model to simulate attenuation which includes scattering from the pores and grains as well as intrinsic attenuation caused by the viscous pore fluids seifert et al 1999 ohkawa 2006 ohkawa 2006 found an excellent agreement between the sax99 attenuation data and the calculated attenuation coefficient given by the algebraic sum of absorption and scattering components the absorption attenuation corresponds to the viscous dissipation of the pore fluid following the f1 2 dependence as the bs model predicts and the scattering attenuation is given by the empirical f2 dependence obtained by curve fitting to the experimental data seifert et al 1999 ohkawa 2006 lee et al 2007 the scattering attenuation α s as a function of frequency is 7 α s a s 20 l o g 10 e f 2 where a s is the attenuation scattering factor and the units of frequency are hz the total attenuation coefficient is the algebraic sum of α p the absorption attenuation of the bs model and α s in figs 7 11 the attenuation calculated by the sum of the bs model and scattering shows reasonable agreement with the measured data across all the tested frequencies in the ss the intrinsic attenuation is dominant at frequencies below 100 khz while scattering is dominant at frequencies greater than 100 khz and the attenuation scattering factor of ss is a s 2e 11 in this study in the fs the intrinsic attenuation is dominant at frequencies below 50 khz but the scattering is dominant at frequencies greater than 50 khz and the attenuation scattering factor of fs is a s 2 5e 11 in this study when the grain size is greater than 0 5 mm scattering attenuation is dominant at all frequencies in this study the attenuation scattering factors of sediments with different grain sizes are listed in table 7 the results suggest that in coarse coral sand sediment scattering is likely to be the principal mechanism responsible for the attenuation in the frequency range of 27 247 khz this result is consistent with previous studies seifert et al 1999 ohkawa 2006 lee et al 2007 similar to siliceous sediment in saturated coral sand sediment scattering is the main attenuation mechanism for ultrasonic p waves in the range between 27 and 247 khz and different grain size sediments have different attenuation scattering factors the symbol indicates estimated parameters from the literature the symbol indicates parameters calculated using the measured parameters 5 conclusion in this study the sound speed and attenuation dispersion of coral sand sediments with different grain sizes were studied in the frequency range of approximately 27 247 khz the measured data were compared with the predicted values of the bs and bicsqs models in the silt sediment fine sand and coarse sand coral sediments the predicted sound speeds of the bs and bicsqs models are both consistent with the measured values and the measured sound speed results present a small positive dispersion with frequency as the grain size increases in the very coarse sand and fine gravel coral sand sediments the measured sound speed presents a considerable positive dispersion and the discrepancy between the measured and the values predicted with either the bs or bicsqs model increases as frequency increases the attenuations predicted by the bs model are lower than the measured values especially in the coarser sediments because the bs model only considers the intrinsic attenuation the sum of the intrinsic attenuation bs model and scattering attenuation show a reasonable agreement with the measured data in the frequency range of 27 247 khz and the attenuation scattering factors of the coral sand sediments with different grain sizes were given this study suggests that scattering is an important factor in sound attenuation in coral sand sediment as it is in siliceous sediment in particular scattering influences the variations in attenuation with frequency credit authorship contribution statement jingqiang wang

explain the propagation characteristics of acoustic waves in the porous fluid saturated medium the seafloor sediments are usually composed of solid particles and pore fluid and the acoustic properties

20566,the acoustic properties of seafloor coral sand sediments are of significant meaning for accurately modeling underwater sound propagation in sea areas around coral reef islands to ultrasonically measure coral sand sediments with different grain sizes sediment samples from coral islands were screened and remolded into five types of samples with different grain sizes this study measured the sound speed and attenuation in the frequency range of 27 247 khz and analyzed the frequency dependence of the acoustic properties the results showed that the sound speed increased significantly with frequency suggesting an approximately linear relation the sound speed dispersion in the coarse grained sediments was larger than that in the fine grained sediments the measured attenuation data showed a variable frequency dependence among the different sediment types the measured data were compared with biot stoll model bs model predictions and the fitting results showed that intergranular pores can lead to sound speed data model mismatches the attenuation data model comparisons revealed that sediments with different grain sizes have different sound wave energy loss mechanisms the bs model with grain contact squirt flow and shear drag bicsqs model can match the attenuation data more consistently than the bs model the results show that scattering is an important factor in sound attenuation in coral sand sediment and the attenuation scattering factors for different grain size sediments were provided keywords sound speed attenuation coral sand sediments frequency dependence geo acoustic models 1 introduction the acoustic properties of seafloor sediments are important for understanding underwater acoustic propagation and are basic data in several fields such as underwater engineering and sediment classification jackson and richardson 2007 therefore the acoustic parameters of seafloor sediments mainly the sound speed and attenuation need to be accurately determined so that they can be used as input data for modeling sea bottom reflection and bottom scattering sessarego et al 2008 many studies have focused on the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation with frequencies ranging from a few hundred hertz up to a few thousands of kilohertz zimmer et al 2010 and have used the measured data to assess the ability of geo acoustic propagation models the study of the frequency dependence of acoustic properties is important and can realize the extrapolation of sound speed and attenuation outside the measured frequency range the frequency dependence relationships combined with the biot stoll model can be used to predict the sound speed and convert the high frequency measurements to low to mid frequency conditions endler et al 2016 the methods used to obtain the frequency dependence of acoustic properties of seafloor sediments commonly include in situ measurements lee et al 2016 yang and tang 2017 li et al 2019 ballard et al 2020 laboratory measurements lee et al 2007 huang et al 2013 kim et al 2019 and remote sensing zhou et al 2009 but most of the previous measurement objects were siliceous sand sediments nosal et al 2008 since coral sand sediment is common in coral island areas and has very different physical properties than siliceous sediment the measurements of acoustic properties in coral sand sediment need to be targeted and more comprehensive however the acoustic properties still need to be measured over a broad range of frequencies to establish reliable empirical or theoretical relationships zimmer et al 2010 which can be used to extrapolate the frequency dependence of the sound speed and attenuation in seafloor coral sand sediments over the desired frequency range several studies have determined the acoustic properties of coral sand sediments by performing sampling measurements or in situ measurements hamilton 1980 presented that there is no significant relation between sound speed and caco3 content while a lower caco3 content can lead to a higher porosity and lower wet density brandes et al 2001 measured the sound speed and attenuation in coral sand sediments in florida keys and found that the acoustic characterization displays a good correlation with the shell lag deposits in gravity cores richardson and briggs 2004 reported the sound speed and attenuation in sediments measured at 400 khz from 12 carbonate sites and demonstrated that coral sand sediments have higher attenuations than siliceous sediments while they have similar sound speeds fu et al 2004 measured the in situ acoustic properties of coral sand sediments offshore of oahu hawaii and considered that coral sand sound speeds are lower than quartz sand sound speeds while coral sand attenuation are slightly higher than those of other sediment types the above measurements for coral sand sediments mainly focused on the sound speed and attenuation at a single frequency and discussed the relationships between acoustic properties and physical properties nosal et al 2008 reported a small but observable sound speed dispersion in carbonate sediments at a frequency of 20 100 khz using an in situ measurement method and compared the measured data to predictions of two common geo acoustic models the biot stoll hereafter called the bs model and grain shearing models however the abovementioned studies focused on the measurement of a single type of coral sand sediment kimura 2011 reported the sound speed dispersion and attenuation in four kinds of water saturated silica sands with different grain sizes and analyzed the grain size dependence of acoustic properties in silica sands the grain size dependence of sound speed dispersion and attenuation in coral sand sediments has not been clarified yet therefore it is necessary to establish the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in coral sand sediments with different grain sizes the object of this study is to measure the acoustic properties of coral sand sediments over the frequency range of 25 247 khz the original sediments were screened and remolded and these measured samples have narrow size distributions the measurement results were used to determine the relationship between the mean grain size and other physical properties including the wet bulk density and porosity this study also considered the dispersion of sound speed and the frequency dependence of attenuation in sediments with different grain sizes and compared the measured results to the bs model and bs model with grain contact squirt flow and shear drag model bicsqs model predictions 2 materials and measuring methods 2 1 coral sand sediments the coral sand sediment samples were collected from coral reef islands in the south china sea the samples had a complex granular composition the component of 2 5 mm grains was 9 6 the component of 1 2 mm grains was 9 1 the component of 0 5 1 mm grains was 18 6 the component of 0 075 0 5 mm grains was 48 9 and the component of 0 075 mm grains was 13 8 to measure the acoustic properties of coral sand sediments with different grain sizes we remolded the samples in the laboratory first we dried the samples then we screened the sediments into five classes following the granular components fig 1 and boiled the samples to remove bubbles thus the coral sand sediments were remolded in plexiglass tubes to create the following remolded samples silt sediment ss fine sand fs coarse sand cs very coarse sand vcs and fine gravel fg these remolded samples were saturated and well sorted the inner diameters of the plexiglass tubes were 94 60 mm and the lengths of the samples were approximately 40 cm the mean grain sizes of the remolded samples were measured in the plexiglass tubes under the conditions of atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of 21 6 21 9 c 2 2 microscopic structure measurements the microscopic structure of the intergranular pore distribution was studied using a ge phoenix v tome x x ray computed tomography xct system xct was applied to describe the internal structure and the intergranular pores of the coral sand sediment samples from the 2d and 3d images of xct scanning the spatial distributions of sediment water and pores could be clearly observed using the scanning images the main pores of the sediment samples were distinguished and the porosity of the sediment samples were roughly calculated 2 3 ultrasonic measurements the measurement method referenced the technique developed by richardson and briggs richardson 1986 which is useful for measuring the acoustic properties of sediments the details of the water coupling laboratory acoustic measurement system were described in sun et al 2020 the whole measurement system consists of an acoustic measuring platform a signal generator a power amplifier a pulser receiver instrument and two planar acoustic transducers to ultrasonically measure the sediment samples the sediment cores were placed on the acoustic measuring platform as shown in fig 2 the planar transmitting and receiving transducers were pressed onto opposite sides of the sample cores the sediment and measuring platform were placed in the water tank which ensured that the sediments were saturated during the acoustic measurement the water can increase the coupling between the acoustic transducers and the tube wall which can avoid direct contact between the sediment and the transducers the acoustic transducers maintained a constant distance apart and maintained contact with the core tube the ultrasonic measurement parameters included a sampling interval of 0 1 μs a single channel sampling length of 4096 points and 3 or 5 cycle pulsed sine waves the dominant frequencies of the 8 transmitting transducers were 25 khz 47 khz 73 khz 87 khz 111 khz 165 khz 216 khz and 247 khz for each sample the acoustic measurement was repeated six times after measuring the sound speed in the sediments the water sample was measured using the same method the acoustic measurement was conducted under the conditions of atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of 21 6 22 2 c 2 4 data processing the measurement system used a water filled core tube as a standard to obtain the travel time through the core liner and the electronic time delays as shown in fig 3 the acoustic signals in the sediments and in the water had a certain relationship which made it easy to calculate the travel time differences δt using a cross correlation or a peak picking method the sound speed was calculated using the travel time differences between the acoustic signals transmitted through the sediment samples and those transmitted through the identical reference tubes filled with water the attenuation was calculated from the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of the received amplitude in the water to that in the sediments the sound speed and attenuation were calculated with the following expressions jackson and richardson 2007 1 c p c w 1 c w δ t d 2 α p 20 d log 10 e w e s where cp and cw are the sound speeds of the sediment and water m s d is the inner diameter of the tube m δt is the travel time difference between the signals in the water and sediment and αp is the attenuation in sediment db m the value of cw was obtained using the relation given by medwin s equation medwin 1975 for the sound speed in fresh water as a function of temperature 3 measurement results 3 1 physical property measurement results the physical parameters of the sediments with different grain sizes are shown in table 1 the grain size distribution curves for different types of sediments are drawn in fig 4 as shown in table 1 both the mean grain size and porosity differ greatly among the five types of samples the ss and fs samples with relatively fine grains have lower porosities the cs vcs and fg samples with relatively coarse grains have higher porosities this is an unusual relationship compared to porosity found in saturated marine sediments since the sample we used is single grain size sample and in the single grain size no smaller particles are filled between the single particles thus coarse particles have greater porosity because they have a larger contact surface which is different from the natural sediments this indicates that even though natural sediments have the same grain size as our samples their porosity can vary greatly from the natural sediments 3 2 acoustic measurement results table 2 shows the average repeated measurement sound speed ratios at different frequencies in the sediment samples with different grain sizes the sound speed ratio was calculated as the ratio of the sediment sound speed c p to the water sound speed c w within 25 247 khz the sound speed ratio of ss was 1 054 1 083 that of fs was 1 054 1 083 that of cs was 1 029 1 047 and that of vcs was 1 030 1 074 as the high frequency part of a signal attenuates significantly the sound speed in fg sediments at 216 khz and 247 khz could not be calculated using the high frequency signals here a comparison of the sound speed ratios among the sediment samples with different grain sizes showed that the ss and fs samples with high bulk densities had higher sound speeds than the other three samples with low bulk densities the relations between the bulk densities and the sound speeds were consistent with the study results obtained and conformed to the relationships between the sound speed and physical properties of the sediments according to measurement results in section 3 1 the fine grained sediments have lower porosity so their higher bulk density and sound speeds are not surprising table 3 shows the measured attenuation at different frequencies for the sediment samples with different grain sizes the measured attenuation varied from approximately 9 25 db m to 207 310 db m in the measurement frequency range of 25 250 khz the sediments with different grain sizes had similar attenuation at low frequencies while the vcs and fg had higher attenuation at the higher frequencies in general the attenuation has no obvious relationships with the sediment types and physical properties nosal et al 2008 reported that the in situ attenuation in carbonate sediments varied from 15 to 75 db m in coarse grained sediment and 22 62 db m in fine grained sediment in the frequency range of 20 100 khz the measured data for cs and ss in this study are close to but slightly higher than the measurement results presented in nosal et al 2008 the frequency dependencies of the sound speed ratio and the attenuation are illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively in these two figures each data point indicates the mean value calculated from six repetitive measurements the maximum standard deviations of these six measurements were approximately 4 m s for sound speed and approximately 9 db m for attenuation the regression equations between the acoustic properties and the measurement frequency are listed in table 4 according to these relations the sound speed ratio of these sediments increases weakly as the measurement frequency increases from 25 to 247 khz suggesting a weak positive linear relationship between the sound speed ratio and the measurement frequency the attenuation in the sediment increases greatly within the measured frequency range the attenuation is proportional to the frequency to a power of 0 86 1 62 in this study as shown in table 4 and shows different frequency dependence for the sediments with different grain sizes which indicates a discrepancy between our data and the previously reported data the deviation of the attenuation coefficient from a first power dependence to the square root dependence on frequency has been reported in several studies williams et al 2002 reported that the attenuation of the water saturated sand measured during sax99 shows a linear frequency dependence the grain shearing model for wave propagation in saturated unconsolidated sediments showed that the attenuation varies with frequency as approximately f 1 buckingham 2005 the sax04 data for water saturated sand showed that the attenuation varies with frequency as approximately f 1 2 hefner and jackson 2010 while several laboratory measurements suggested a squared frequency dependence seifert et al 1999 differing opinions on the frequency dependence of attenuation and on the sound propagation attenuation mechanism have been presented in recent studies as shown in table 4 the attenuations for the fine grain sediments ss and fs show a linear variation with frequency the exponent is about 1 0 which is consistent with grain shearing model the attenuations for another three sediments show the obviously frequency dependence the exponent is larger than 1 0 than the fine grain sediments 4 discussions in this section the sound speed dispersion and attenuation data are compared with the results of the bs model and the bicsqs model the bs model and the bicsqs model are geo acoustic propagation models that can predict the sound speed and attenuation of seafloor sediments and the specific equations and the main properties of the bs model and the bicsqs model are listed in the appendix furthermore both of these models can be used to predict the dispersion of sound speed and the frequency dependence of attenuation the bs model for elastic wave propagation in porous media has been applied to water saturated sediments williams 2001 in response to acoustic excitation the bs model accounts for the relative motion between pore fluids and this model assumes that the shear and bulk frame moduli are complex and frequency dependent chotiros and isakson 2004 the bicsqs model extends the bs model by incorporating frequency dependent losses that arise from the inclusion of grain contact squirt flow and viscous shear drag into frequency dependent complex frame moduli lee et al 2016 the input parameters for these acoustic models are first discussed and then a comparison of the measured data and the modelled curves is performed as the porosity determined with xct has a low accuracy the appropriate porosity is obtained by the sound speed dispersion model data fit 4 1 the input parameters for acoustic models the empirical equations from several studies have provided the calculation method for input parameters to establish the bs model and the bicsqs model prediction curves the mean grain size and xct porosity measured in the laboratory from each core sample table 1 were used to calculate or predict input parameters for the sediment acoustic models the bs model and bicsqs model input parameters can be divided into three categories solid particle parameters pore fluid parameters and solid frame parameters the grain bulk modulus fluid bulk modulus viscosity of water and fluid density were obtained from the literature williams et al 2002 a tabulated grain bulk modulus of 74 gpa was used for the coral sand sediments sumino and anderson 1984 nosal et al 2008 a fluid bulk modulus of 2 24 gpa was used for the pore water according to chotiros and isakson 2004 the relaxation frequencies for bicsqs model were obtained by the data model fitting method when the attenuation data are fit only in a least squares sense the permeability pore size tortuosity frame shear modulus and frame bulk modulus were calculated using the equations introduced in schock 2004 according to the physical relationship of kozeny carman holland and brunson 1988 the permeability κ in m2 can be approximated by 3 κ 1 k s 0 2 n 3 1 n 2 where s 0 is the specific surface of the particles in the sediment m 1 and can be defined as s0 6 μ g where u g is the mean grain diameter m as shown in table 1 k is an empirical constant approximately equal to 5 and n is the porosity schock 2004 established the error introduced by eq 3 in calculating permeability assuming that eq 3 overestimates the permeability by a factor of 10 on average and extended the equation as 4 κ u g 2 180 n 3 1 n 2 1 10 the tortuosity α can be calculated following stoll 1977 5 α 1 35 0 3 0 4125 ϕ 3 0 ϕ 4 4 ϕ 8 ϕ 8 where ϕ is the mean grain size dimensionless and ϕ log 2 u g where u g is the mean grain diameter mm hovem and ingram 1979 established an equation developed using the hydraulic radius concept for uniform spherical grains to calculate the pore radius to consider the estimation error schock 2004 provided a factor of 10 4 for the equation that overestimates the pore radius and extended the equation to calculate the pore size a in meters 6 a u g 3 n 1 n 1 1 8 the input physical parameters of the bs model using the xct porosity are summarized in table 5 4 2 comparison between measured data and the model curves the frequency dependence of sound speed and attenuation in sediments with different grain sizes were experimentally measured and theoretically predicted by the bs and bicsqs models and the results are plotted in figs 7 11 note that the sound speed data were presented as the ratio of the sound speed measured in the sediment to the sound speed measured in the water in these figures the red dotted lines were plotted by considering the parameters in table 5 in which the parameters were obtained or calculated using the xct porosity as shown in these figures both the predicted sound speed and attenuation curves of the bs model deviate from the measured data the predicted sound speed and the predicted attenuation are considerably higher than the measured data considering that the xct porosity has low measurement accuracy because intragranular and very small pores cannot be distinguished by the scanning images the xct porosity underestimated the actual porosity of the coral sand sediment and an incorrect input porosity may lead to data model mismatch to compare the measured data with the predictions it is essential to adjust the model porosity to achieve the best fit between the measured sound speed and the prediction curves in a least squares sense the optimum fitting solution of the measured sound speed and the predicted value of the bs model was used to obtain the fitted porosity that is the minimum deviation between the fitted value and the measured value was reached then the fitted porosity was input to the bs and bicsqs models to obtain the sound speed dispersion and attenuation dispersion the input physical parameters of the bs model and the bicsqs model using the corrected porosity are summarized in table 6 in figs 7 11 the red solid lines for bs model and the black solid lines for bicsqs model were plotted by considering the parameters in table 6 these lines show that the measured sound speed has a small positive dispersion in the frequency range of 27 247 khz we also note that the sound speeds in the vcs fg and cs sediments with larger grain sizes are smaller than those in the ss and fs sediments with smaller grain sizes the predicted results of the bs and bicsqs models are also consistent with the measured sound speeds especially in the ss fs and cs sediments with smaller grain sizes and as the grain size increases the curves of the bs and bicsqs models deviate from the measured sound speeds and the measured values lie between the prediction curves of the bs and bicsqs models the predicted values of the bicsqs model depend strongly on the relaxation frequency chotiros and isakson 2004 these values were obtained in our work by fitting the attenuation data it is not fully understood why the same model parameters do not fit the sound speed data well at the highest frequencies in figs 7 11 the measured attenuations show clear positive dispersion in the frequency range of 27 247 khz generally the variation trend of the predicted curve of the bicsqs model is consistent with the measured data and the predicted values slightly underestimate the measured values however in the bs model the predicted values clearly underestimate the measured values and as the frequency increases the discrepancy becomes larger the attenuation data increase nonlinearly with frequency whereas the bs model yields an attenuation coefficient that increases almost the f1 2 frequency dependence this is because the bs model predicts absorption due to the viscous dissipation of pore fluid only kimura 2011 seifert et al 1999 also proved that for unconsolidated sand fluid flow models that imply significant effects of viscous pore fluids on ultrasonic waves cannot accurately reflect laboratory measurements scattering is the main attenuation mechanism for ultrasonic p waves and the attenuation shows a frequency squared dependence for all measurements regardless of viscosity in the measurement frequency range here we used a three dimensional generalized dynamic composite elastic medium model to simulate attenuation which includes scattering from the pores and grains as well as intrinsic attenuation caused by the viscous pore fluids seifert et al 1999 ohkawa 2006 ohkawa 2006 found an excellent agreement between the sax99 attenuation data and the calculated attenuation coefficient given by the algebraic sum of absorption and scattering components the absorption attenuation corresponds to the viscous dissipation of the pore fluid following the f1 2 dependence as the bs model predicts and the scattering attenuation is given by the empirical f2 dependence obtained by curve fitting to the experimental data seifert et al 1999 ohkawa 2006 lee et al 2007 the scattering attenuation α s as a function of frequency is 7 α s a s 20 l o g 10 e f 2 where a s is the attenuation scattering factor and the units of frequency are hz the total attenuation coefficient is the algebraic sum of α p the absorption attenuation of the bs model and α s in figs 7 11 the attenuation calculated by the sum of the bs model and scattering shows reasonable agreement with the measured data across all the tested frequencies in the ss the intrinsic attenuation is dominant at frequencies below 100 khz while scattering is dominant at frequencies greater than 100 khz and the attenuation scattering factor of ss is a s 2e 11 in this study in the fs the intrinsic attenuation is dominant at frequencies below 50 khz but the scattering is dominant at frequencies greater than 50 khz and the attenuation scattering factor of fs is a s 2 5e 11 in this study when the grain size is greater than 0 5 mm scattering attenuation is dominant at all frequencies in this study the attenuation scattering factors of sediments with different grain sizes are listed in table 7 the results suggest that in coarse coral sand sediment scattering is likely to be the principal mechanism responsible for the attenuation in the frequency range of 27 247 khz this result is consistent with previous studies seifert et al 1999 ohkawa 2006 lee et al 2007 similar to siliceous sediment in saturated coral sand sediment scattering is the main attenuation mechanism for ultrasonic p waves in the range between 27 and 247 khz and different grain size sediments have different attenuation scattering factors the symbol indicates estimated parameters from the literature the symbol indicates parameters calculated using the measured parameters 5 conclusion in this study the sound speed and attenuation dispersion of coral sand sediments with different grain sizes were studied in the frequency range of approximately 27 247 khz the measured data were compared with the predicted values of the bs and bicsqs models in the silt sediment fine sand and coarse sand coral sediments the predicted sound speeds of the bs and bicsqs models are both consistent with the measured values and the measured sound speed results present a small positive dispersion with frequency as the grain size increases in the very coarse sand and fine gravel coral sand sediments the measured sound speed presents a considerable positive dispersion and the discrepancy between the measured and the values predicted with either the bs or bicsqs model increases as frequency increases the attenuations predicted by the bs model are lower than the measured values especially in the coarser sediments because the bs model only considers the intrinsic attenuation the sum of the intrinsic attenuation bs model and scattering attenuation show a reasonable agreement with the measured data in the frequency range of 27 247 khz and the attenuation scattering factors of the coral sand sediments with different grain sizes were given this study suggests that scattering is an important factor in sound attenuation in coral sand sediment as it is in siliceous sediment in particular scattering influences the variations in attenuation with frequency credit authorship contribution statement jingqiang wang

20567,a simple nonlinear phase operator was recently introduced which when applied to standard sea wave models was able to generate many of the properties of extreme waves this technique was not able to describe the largest events observed the methodology is extended to include a second nonlinear operator which transfers part or all of the energy from the original wave spectrum into far more uniform real valued transient spectra this in combination with the original phase operator was able to describe all sizes of observed extreme wave phenomena and also provided some insights into the nonlinear mechanisms involved in such events keywords extreme waves nonlinear operator wave models 1 introduction extreme wave events have long been part of maritime mythology relatively recently they have become recognised as a very real and very dangerous phenomenon lehner et al 2002 rosenthal and lehner 2008 didenkulova et al 2006 haver 2004 dysthe et al 2008 stansell et al 2004 rosenthal and lehner 2008 2008 this has made it necessary to recognise the consequences of such extreme events in maritime design for very special wave focusing bathymetries linear wave theory can be employed kurkin and pelinovsk 2002 to describe such waves however in general it has been necessary to employ nonlinear model systems in particular the nonlinear schrödinger equation as illustrated by smith 1976 dai et al 2012 kruglov et al 2005 osborne et al 2000 solving nonlinear differential equations is not a particularly convenient approach for practical maritime designers partly in response to this a very simple to implement technique was described in belmont 2021 that emulated the emergence and collapse of extreme wave events from the underlying sea wave spectrum the method was based upon a nonlinear phase operator acting on traditional wave models as stated the methodology was originally intended mainly as the basis for a simple technique for maritime designers wishing to create extreme local waves from the underlying sea spectrum however with the extension of the method as described here the technique also appears to offer useful insights into the characteristics of the nonlinear mechanisms involved in the creation of such extreme wave events 2 the phase operator the underlying wave spectrum is f k φ and the corresponding sea surface elevation f r θ t are realted by the standard form 1 f r θ t 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ e j k r cos θ φ ω k t f k φ k d k d φ the spectral coordinates are wavenumber k and wave direction φ and the spatial coordinates are time t and spatial polar coordinates r θ the function f k φ e j f k φ is the polar form of the fourier transform of f r θ t t 0 in belmont 2021 a nonlinear phase operator γ was applied to f r θ t via the phase function ϕ α k φ r θ inducing the new wave system γ f r θ t given by 2 γ f r θ t 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ e j k r cos θ φ ω k t f k φ e j ϕ α k φ r θ k d k d φ by choosing ϕ α k φ r θ appropriately equation 2 can be forced to transiently exhibit a localised extreme wave event with a maximum at r 0 θ 0 t 0 the simplest possible choice of the phase function ϕ α k φ r θ to achieve this is the wavenumber independent form 3 ϕ k x t α f k u k t x where u k t x is a spatio temporal window function that has a single maximum value of unity at r 0 θ 0 t 0 the parameter α is a scalar 0 α 1 which cancels a fraction of the phase f k when α 1 an absolute maximum occurs as given by 4 γ f r θ t r 0 θ 0 t 0 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ k d k d φ 3 incorporation of a more general operator while the methodology described in section 2 0 leads to events which agree with many observed extreme wave properties it only involves the phase spectrum and does not readily account for the largest observed waves where the ratio of peak to the significant wave height can reach values close to 3 clearly where extreme waves are most appropriately described by nonlinear models as opposed to linear wave focusing process kurkin and pelinovsky 2002 it is also necessary to include transient modifications to the entire spectrum in addition to introducing the phase operator it was also recognised in belmont 2021 that if part or all of the underlying wave spectrum was transiently transformed into a more uniform shape with conservation of total power then the extreme wave height and slope would increase using the so called new year wave as an illustration it was demonstrated that if the extreme part of the wave is extracted by removing the extrapolated underlying sea wave profile then the remaining local peak structure had much in common with a sin c function the sin c form being the time function corresponding to the real valued heaviside function shaped spectrum the fundamental reason why uniform real valued spectra give larger extreme events for a given total wave power is because the asymptotic limiting case of such a uniform spectrum is a wideband band constant magnitude real fourier spectrum zero initial phases in the space or time domains this corresponds to a delta function this present report implements the principle behind the above comments made in belmont 2021 this is achieved via a more general nonlinear operator ω this acts transiently on the phases of the underlying wave spectrum and also transiently transfers energy from the underlying wave spectrum into a more uniform spectral object the very simplest approach to transiently transferring energy between the underlying sea spectrum f k φ and a uniform spectrum b k φ is to write the total transient statistically non stationary spectrum ϒ k φ r θ t as 5 ϒ k φ r θ t γ 1 r θ t f k φ γ 2 r θ t b k φ where the weights γ 1 r θ t and γ 2 r θ t are spatio temporal weighting functions the transient spectrum ϒ k φ r θ t arises from the application of the operator ω on the underlying wave spectrum i e 6 ϒ k φ r θ t ω f k φ f k φ r θ t clearly the sizes of the two weights γ 1 r θ t and γ 2 r θ t control how much energy is transferred between the two spectral forms for subsequent convenience b k φ is chosen such that 7 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 b k φ 2 k d k d φ 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ 2 k d k d φ this does not mean that the power in the uniform part of the spectrum transiently formed during the energy exchange equals that in the underlying sea model it is the weight functions that determine this equation 7 is just a technical convenience for a standard statistically stationary sea model the total power p 0 is constant i e using the parseval theorem 8 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f k φ 2 k d k d φ p 0 to ensure conservation of the total power p 0 throughout the energy transfer process requires that 9 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 ϒ k φ r θ t 2 k d k d φ p 0 i e 10 p 0 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 γ 1 r θ t f k φ γ 2 r θ t b k φ γ 1 r θ t f k φ γ 2 r θ t b k φ k d k d φ where the bar denotes complex conjugation of f k φ recalling that b k φ is real now the standard oceanographic assumption is that f k φ is random the magnitudes being sampled from a rayleigh distribution at each frequency tucker and challenor 1984 and the phases being uniformly random over 0 2 π hence the integrals involving f k φ b k φ and f k φ b k φ both tend to zero this means equation 10 reduces to 11 p 0 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 γ 1 2 r θ t f k φ 2 γ 2 2 r θ t b 2 k φ k d k d φ using equations 7 8 and 11 produces 12 1 γ 1 2 r θ t γ 2 2 r θ t thus the total spectrum ϒ k φ r θ t is given by 13 ϒ k φ r θ t 1 γ 2 r θ t f k φ γ r θ t b k φ where the now superfluous index to the function γ x t has been dropped in order that the wave field is given by equation 1 at large x and t it is necessary that l i m x t γ 0 the other relevant limit at x 0 t 0 must be chosen partly to ensure that 1 γ 2 r θ t remains real and partly to set the amount of energy transfer occurring both these conditions mean that 0 γ 1 the actual value of γ 0 0 0 will be denoted by γ 0 0 0 δ applying the general operator ω to the wave equation 5 produces 14 ω f r θ t r θ t 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 1 γ 2 r θ t f k φ e j f k φ e j ϕ α k φ r θ γ r θ t b k φ e j k r cos θ φ ω k t k d k d φ rewriting equation 14 in terms of a nonstationary spectrum f r θ t k φ where 15 f r θ t k φ 1 γ 2 r θ t f k φ e j f k φ e j ϕ α k φ r θ γ r θ t b k φ and replacing the rather cumbersome operator notation ω f r θ t r θ t by the more sensible h r θ t this wave equation is simply 16 h r θ t 1 2 π 0 2 π 0 f f r θ t k φ r θ t k φ e j k r cos θ φ ω k t k d k d φ equation 16 shows that as with the phase only operator method described in belmont 2021 the wave equation can be recast in terms of the standard linear wave equation with a transiently non stationary spectrum 4 a numerical illustration equation 16 is entirely general and can even describes large highly three dimensional hills of water transiently rising out of the sea however a large body of observations suggest that this is not typical indicating that the length scales of the wave normal to and along its local direction of propagation must be very different this justifies restricting the following simple numerical illustration to quasi long crested extreme events in this case equations 15 and 16 reduce to 17 h x t 1 2 π f f k x t k e j k x ω k t d k where 18 f x t k 1 γ 2 x t f k e j f k e j ϕ α k x t γ x t b k to proceed further with a numerical illustration it is necessary to assign values to the transient spectrum in this one dimensional case b k is simply a constant b 0 over the bandwidth w 0 which is the width of the assumed heaviside functional form the total power in b k being p 0 i e 1 2 π b 0 w 0 which in the one dimensional equivalent to equation 7 reduces to 19 b 0 2 w 0 0 f k 2 d k the choice of bandwidth w 0 determines the characteristic frequency scale of the extreme wave event and as with the case of the phase operator γ belmont 2021 this will be set to the maximum of the underlying wave spectrum f k the parent power spectral density function psd used in the illustration is the pierson moskowitz form hence 20 w 0 0 877 g u 19 5 where g is the gravitational constant and u 19 5 the wind speed at 19 5 m above sea level a further choice remains as to whether b k is a low pass form or a band pass function centred around some frequency the comments made in belmont 2021 suggest that separating out the transient peak event from the background wave system for the so called new year wave indicate this has very much in common with the sin c function this very strongly indicates that b k should be a low pass rather than band pass spectrum further weigh to this view is given by the fact that the observed peak events are always substantially larger than the neighbouring troughs indicating that transiently the spectrum has a significant component at k 0 a band pass form would not exhibit this and would give rise to much more similar peak to trough sizes the illustrative simulation was carried out under the same conditions as in belmont 2021 but with the more general operator ω the same window function was employed in both ϕ α k x t and γ x t i e gaussians whose spatial and temporal length scales were chosen to be 3 times the characteristic period set by the pierson moskowitz psd the scales of ϕ α k x t and γ x t were set by α and δ respectively 21 ϕ α k x t α e x 2 λ x 2 t 2 λ t 2 f k and 22 γ δ x t δ e x 2 λ x 2 t 2 λ t 2 the wave number independence is probably an over simplification but this simple example does demonstrate the majority of the properties of the approach using a pierson moskowitz parent power density spectrum produces λ t 2 π u 19 5 0 887 g and λ x 2 π u 19 5 2 0 887 2 g the pierson and moskowitz wind speed parameter u 19 5 was set to 15 m sec 1 the individual realisations of f x t were produced as follows i the phases of each wave component were sampled from a uniform distribution over 0 2 π ii the magnitudes of each component were obtained by sampling from rayleigh distributions whose parameter was determined from the variance of the parent power density spectrum chong et al 1982 the later process means that both phase and amplitude are random this is necessary in order to obtain a wave model that creates sea wave elevation time series with the correct runs statistics tucker et al 1984 the remaining parameters employed were number of spatial samples 1000 number of time samples 1000 number of spectral component 100 time step 0 2 s space step

to facilitate comparison between cases the same set of magnitude and phase samples were used in all the results presented the results in figs 1 and 2 compare the time dependences of the sea surface elevation at the location x 0 for the case where the extreme wave event is present against the case where it is not fig 1 shows a plot of the time variation of the extreme wave event at the location x 0 for the phase weight operator parameter α set equal to unity and the magnitude weight operator δ set equal to zero the ratio of the peak sea surface elevation to significant wave height designated χ reaches a value of 2 1 fig 2 is the converse of fig 1 with the phase operator weight parameter α being set equal to zero and the magnitude operator weight δ set equal to unity in this case the ratio χ reaches a far larger value of 8 0 there is no requirement to show the case for α 1 and δ 1 because the maximum value of the magnitude operator weight guarantees that at the peak complete transfer has occurred of all the power out of the underlying wave spectrum into the uniform spectrum fig 3 is a surface plot that shows the overall dependence of the ratio χ on the magnitude and phase weight parameters δ and α 6 discussion and conclusions the very simple approach based upon nonlinear operators inducing both phase changes and energy transfer in the underlying wave spectrum appears to be capable of describing most of the features of extreme waves to well beyond the range of observed extreme wave events that can arise from conventional sea models this suggests that it may be of value as the basis of a simulation tool for maritime engineers which is more flexible and easy to employ than resorting to the solution nonlinear differential equations from a more fundamental perspective the methodology appears to offer more than just an empirical emulation technique given the following two properties it seems to help provide insights into the relative contributions of the different types of nonlinear mechanisms involved in extreme waves property 1 wave propagation can be considered as a cascade of weakly nonlinear processes which have the effect of averaging the phases producing products of spectral magnitudes and shifting energy throughout the frequency range property 2 the random nature of the phases in sea waves means that the averaging tends to produce zero phases and the frequency shifting will transfer significant power to lower frequencies as well as higher ones it is evident from figs 1 3 that transferring energy from the underlying wave spectrum to a more uniform spectrum leads to far larger extreme wave events than the phase averaging mechanism what was not anticipated is just how strong an effect the energy transfer process has given that the very largest observed extreme waves have χ values that barely exceed 3 it is evident from fig 3 that little more than half of the energy present in the underlying wave spectrum can actually be transferred in this

20568,ship trajectory information has made a significant contribution to the data based research in analyzing maritime transportation and has facilitated the improvement of maritime safety however the ais data which consists of ship trajectory inevitably contains noises or missing data that can interfere with the conclusion in this paper an improved kinematic interpolation is presented for ais

been playing a significant role in the industry of maritime transportation as it was designed to enhance maritime safety yang et al 2019 ais provides real time information of ships concerning their static and dynamic status e g longitude latitude speed course etc it serves as a big data source for various research such as traffic analysis logistics transport economy monitoring collision risk maritime safety etc svanberg et al 2019 one of the hottest areas for research and industrial application of ais data is the ship trajectory information analysis as it provides a precise detailed and massive amount of ship navigation data however ais messages are easily affected by bad weather blocked communication channel equipment errors etc last et al 2015 the utilization of raw ais data where missing data and abnormal data frequently occur in the analysis process may lead to incorrect conclusions though researchers have come up with methods based on ais base stations to correct this kind of data jiang et al 2014 it is of great significance to reconstruct the ais trajectory to improve the data quality for further analysis and applications the objective of ship trajectory reconstruction is to improve data quality using techniques such as interpolation etc to date many interpolation methods for ship trajectory reconstruction have been proposed a detailed literature review can be found in section 2 however even with the consideration of the trajectory type in some of the methods the interpolation processes still lack taking full consideration of the kinematic information that ais has and only utilizes mathematic interpolation methods to focus on the shape of the trajectory also methods based on deep learning and other aspects will bring extra computation load that in some situations is unbearable and limit their application to take full utilization of the kinematic information that ais has and reach a more accurate trajectory reconstruction result an improved kinematic interpolation iki method is proposed in this paper compared to the existed methods the main contributions of this work are as follows 1 an iterative abnormal data detection and removal method has been proposed and integrated into the reconstruction process 2 the position velocity and acceleration of the ship have been fully considered in the interpolation process 3 the data near the path which needs to be reconstructed is also considered 4 the application area of the proposed method is wide as a series of tests on a whole water area that has different types of trajectories are conducted the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a literature review over trajectory reconstruction elaborated in section 2 followed by the methodology framework with a brief in section 3 the details of the established models about date preprocessing trajectory refining and trajectory reconstruction are presented in section 4 after that a case study including a series of tests is shown in section 5 and the experimental results are discussed in section 6 section 7 gives a brief conclusion about the study and illustrates the possible improvement direction in the future 2 literature review various efforts have been devoted to the analysis and improvement of the quality of the ais data e g felski et al 2015 he et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 among the literature related to ship trajectory reconstruction various methods have been proposed generally such methods can be classified into the following groups according to the perspective they adopted when performing the trajectory interpolation 1 geometry based approach 2 navigation oriented geometry approach and 3 artificial intelligence based approach in this section an analysis of the existing ship trajectory interpolation methods is analyzed a detailed comparison table can be found in the appendix as for the geometry based approach the principle of these type of methods is that the ship trajectory is usually considered as a curve which can be represented by a series of mathematical functions out of this principle various methods are proposed and applied in ship trajectory reconstruction such as linear interpolation polynomial interpolation cubic spline interpolation and cubic hermit interpolation kolendo and śmierzchalski 2016 the linear interpolation methods perform well in high frequency trajectory data and the polynomial cubic spline or cubic hermit interpolation methods are suitable for curved trajectories with low data frequency although such methods have satisfactory efficiency in conducting the reconstruction and easy to be applied in practices the lack of consideration of the ship s navigation status and the kinematic information has restricted their applicability and the accuracy of the results because the trajectory is the results of ship s navigation under influence of multiple external factors such as wind current and wave etc and interaction with other ships the ais trajectory can be classified into different types in ship trajectory interpolation herrero et al 2019 to improve the results of trajectory reconstruction many researchers have combined the navigation status of the ships and geometry methods to consider the characteristics of ship trajectory under different navigation statuses zhang et al 2018a divided ship navigation status into three types mooring maneuvering and normal speed navigation to support ship trajectory reconstruction nguyen et al 2015 came up with a method including linear interpolation and cubic hermit interpolation zhang et al 2018b proposed a method using linear interpolation on the straight segment and cubic spline interpolation method on the curve segment based on data sparse processing sang et al 2015 identified ship navigational features with a line arc and curve segment to restore the ship trajectory different from cubic functions du et al 2017 proposed a polynomial interpolation using high level functions jeong et al 2020 used functional data analysis fda to deal with abnormal data and analyze the ship routes among all these methods the ship trajectory is firstly separated into different types that representing the ship s navigation status such as normal navigation maneuvering e g collision avoidance turning etc based on the different characteristics in the shape of trajectory under these scenarios different types of mathematical function of curves are applied to conduct the interpolation process zhang et al 2017 thoroughly discussed the performance of the cubic spline interpolation method compared with the cubic hermit interpolation using static and dynamic information on a specific trajectory in the meantime shi et al 2019 utilized empirical mode decomposition emd and fermat s spiral to fit the unmanned surface vessel s trajectory however due to the fact that fundamentally such a combination approach is still based on the geometry based approach the kinematic information of ships is not comprehensively utilized in the process therefore the accuracy of the results may be restricted with the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years such an approach has also been utilized in the reconstruction of ship trajectory e g hao 2019 the principle of such an approach is to train a deep learning model based on a large amount of historical data and to estimate the most probable data point of the target trajectory data set li et al 2020 proposed a trajectory reconstruction method based on u net convolutional networks which can be applied to different sampling frequencies liang et al 2019 proposed a long short term memory lstm based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories where the missing data is identified by random forest chen et al 2020b normalized the denoised data and put it into an artificial neural network to predict the ship trajectory dobrkovic et al 2018 used an improved genetic algorithm ga to extract maritime patterns and reconstruct routes from incomplete ais data chen et al 2020b applied data denoising techniques to exclude the abnormal data points and reconstruct the ship trajectory with artificial neural networks zhong et al 2019 incorporated the bidirectional lstm and recurrent neural network to restore the ais data of inland ships a similar approach has also been utilized by liu et al 2021 with the integration of the density based clustering method to improve the data quality for promoting the vessel traffic services through prior knowledge base construction a density weighted ant colony algorithm is proposed for the reconstruction of ship trajectory by zhang et al 2020 from the literature one can see that such methods have shown good interpolation results compared with the traditional methods however they demand a mass of historical data to extract the trajectory features to learn the ship motion and accurately give the reconstruction results therefore the deep learning based approach s calculation and learning process are complicated requesting a lot of calculation time and hardware devices with excellent performances from the aforementioned methods one can see that the geometry based approaches and consideration of ship navigation status are popular in the research and development of ship ais trajectory reconstruction however as aforementioned ship trajectory is the result of the overall influence of ship s navigation behavior external influences and the traffic characteristics etc solely relying on the shape characteristics of the trajectory may not be able to obtain highly accurate reconstructed results to solve such an issue kinematic interpolation ki has been proposed to estimate the unknown location of a moving object between collected data long 2015 the principle of such an approach is to incorporate the kinematic characteristics of the moving objects into the process of estimating the possible status position speed based on the law of physics besides an improved linear interpolation that considers the ship s velocity including speed and course has been proposed in xue et al 2017 such a method has already been widely utilized in the field of robotics as for the reconstruction of ship trajectory it is of great promise to improve the results by incorporating the ship s kinematic information into the process compared with the conventional geometry based approaches 3 methodology the purpose of this research is to propose a method for general and effective reconstruction of the ship trajectories considering the kinematic information within the ais data in addition to the information of longitude and latitude ais dynamic messages contain information such as speed over ground sog and course over ground cog the utilization of these parameters can increase the effectiveness and accuracy of reconstruction results however since the raw ais data inevitably have abnormal data and missing data caused by equipment errors transmission etc and the data of each ship are dispersedly distributed in the file there needs to be a procedure to obtain a high quality trajectory set before the reconstruction the main idea of the iki method is proposed in section 2 2 the methodology framework is shown in fig 1 3 1 data processing before the ship trajectory reconstruction the quality of the ais data must be verified and improved to remove the abnormal data points first data preprocessing including ais decoding data cleaning and trajectory extraction is conducted the trajectory refining process can then be divided into two modules 1 analysis of time interval distribution 2 abnormal data detection and removal data preprocessing aims to decode the raw ais data following the standard in itu 2010 and remove the wrong data with obvious anomalies in longitude latitude sog or cog of the ships notice that heading is not considered in this research because the value of it is not always available and reliable based on the decoded and cleansed data the trajectory will be extracted referring to the ship s maritime mobile service identifier mmsi so the ais trajectory data of each ship will be formed in a time series according to itu 2010 the transmitting frequency of ais data varies from 3s to 3 min depending on the navigation status of the ship besides due to the traffic volume and the transmitting capacity of the ais system in certain areas the ais messages could be delayed to a certain extent for any trajectory the analysis of its ais sending time interval distribution can help reveal the ship s navigation characteristics in the aspect of ais transmission frequency providing a facilitator for the trajectory construction process data cleaning can remove points with obvious errors such as mmsi format error latitude and longitude out of range and other illegal errors refer to itu 2010 however there will still be some abnormal data remained thus a further step to identify these abnormal data should be performed the procedure of abnormal data detection and removal is based on average speed and the average change rate of cog between two adjacent points in addition this process will be performed in a loop a convergent judgment is added as a termination condition which takes the number of total points in a trajectory into account to ensure that all the abnormal data have been removed then the processed ship trajectory set is obtained 3 2 kinematic interpolation there are many methods proposed to estimate unknown locations among a moving object s trajectory such as linear interpolation xue et al 2017 cubic spline interpolation zhang et al 2017 etc to calculate the possible locations using objects kinematics i e velocity and acceleration etc is called kinematic interpolation ki long 2015 the main idea of ki is to establish an acceleration function of the moving object in a period according to the kinematic formula the velocity function can be obtained by integrating the acceleration and the position function is then obtained the kinematic equations used in this method are shown in eq 1 1 x t x t i t i t v t d t v t v t i t i t a t d t where t i t t j t i and t j denote the time of two given adjacent points p and q x t is the estimated position between p and q at time t with velocity v t and acceleration a t please be noted that the velocity in this research is termed as the variable to describe the numerical value of the object s speed and direction at the same time the detailed meaning of these terms for the improved kinematic interpolation of ship trajectory is furtherly elaborated in section 4 3 in most situations a t is unknown and assumed the following linear function 2 a t b m t t i the parameters b and m will be solved when applying the velocity and position information of p and q to the equations set ki performs well with fast moving objects where the trajectory points are sampled at high frequency long 2015 refer to itu 2010 and appendix i the trajectory points that transmitted by ais can be considered as a high frequency sample considering the kinematic information that ais has it is reasonable to apply the ki on ais trajectory reconstruction however since most points of the trajectory are known the calculated value of the object s acceleration at p and q is not unique if it is put into a different period of time at once to further use kinematic information that a trajectory has and obtain more accurate reconstruction results this paper improves how to establish better acceleration function and the improved model will be elaborated in section 3 4 model design in the previous sections the methodology of this research and the objective are elaborated in this section details on the model design and parameter settings will be illustrated 4 1 data preprocessing refer to itu 2010 a program is written to decode the raw ais data and sort the decoded data by their mmsi where the data cleaning process is also included then extract the ship trajectories to obtain the original ship trajectory set t which is described as follows let t r a c k i m m s i i p o i n t s i where t r a c k i denotes the i th ship trajectory in t m m s i i represents the ship s mmsi corresponding to the i th ship trajectory and p o i n t s i denotes the trajectory point set of t r a c k i for a trajectory point p i j p o i n t s i 0 j p o i n t s i p o i n t s i denotes the number of total points in t r a c k i there is p i j t i j l o n i j l a t i j s o g i j c o g i j where t i j l o n i j l a t i j s o g i j and c o g i j represent the time stamp longitude latitude sog and cog of j th trajectory point in t r a c k i in general the ais data also contains the dynamic information of the ships such as the heading of the ship etc however during the analysis of the data we have found that there are too many missing values in these variables to maintain the quality of the reconstruction we have to therefore exclude such information in the reconstruction process 4 2 trajectory refining 4 2 1 analysis of time interval distribution though the ais transmitting frequency can indicate the ship navigation characteristic as it must follow the standard requested by itu 2010 it is difficult to ensure that the messages are not affected by the traffic volume and the transmitting capacity during transmission to get the transmission characteristics of a ship trajectory and help determine the reconstruction time interval which fits the reconstructed path into the real environment the analysis of time interval distribution is conducted for a trajectory t r a c k i m m s i i p o i n t s i in trajectory set t two adjacent points p i j t i j l o n i j l a t i j s o g i j c o g i j and p i j 1 t i j 1 l o n i j 1 l a t i j 1 s o g i j 1 c o g i j 1 in p o i n t s i the time interval between p i j and p i j 1 is shown in eq 3 3 δ t i j t i j 1 t i j and i i δ t i j j n 1 j p o i n t s i 1 denotes the time interval set of t r a c k i then the time interval distribution is obtained reorder i i in ascending order and denote the sorted set as i i s o r t e d the reconstruction time interval t i s t e p corresponding to m m s i i is 4 t i s t e p i i s o r t e d 0 9 where i i s o r t e d 0 9 is the 90 quantile in i i s o r t e d such a value is set by considering the time interval distributions of the trajectory data in this research an example is shown in fig 2 and appendix ii in practice such value can be adjustable according to the demand from the researchers and the time interval distribution characteristics of the data t i s t e p is an essential value to determine the timestamp of the interpolation point that will be furtherly mentioned in section 4 3 4 2 2 iterative abnormal data detection and removal in data preprocessing the data cleaning process can only remove obvious wrong data that violate the standard requested by itu 2010 it is essential to design a further step to detect and remove the potential abnormal data for each t r a c k i in t let p n u m p o i n t s i the average speed v i j between two adjacent points p i j and p i j 1 in p o i n t s i can be calculated by eq 5 5 v i j δ d i j δ t i j δ δ d i j distance l o n i j l a t i j l o n i j 1 l a t i j 1 where δ d i j is the distance between p i j and p i j 1 similarly the average change rate δ c i j can be calculated by eq 6 6 δ c i j c o g i j 1 c o g i j δ t i j c o g i j 1 c o g i j 180 360 c o g i j 1 c o g i j δ t i j c o g i j 1 c o g i j 180 to effectively detect abnormal data if the data are correct v i j and δ c i j must obey the following rules 1 in a specific water area the threshold of ship speed v l i m exists and v i j will not expand v l i m 2 p i j and p i j 1 contain data field s o g i j and s o g i j 1 to describe the ship speed at t i m e i j and t i m e i j 1 respectively v i j will not be far away from s o g i j and s o g i j 1 since the time interval is not that long 3 δ c i j cannot expand a threshold c l i m since the ship turning ability is limited refer to ship maneuvering characters thus if there exists abnormal data v i j and δ c i j must satisfy one of the following inequations 7 v i j v lim max v i j s o g i j v i j s o g i j 1 0 δ c i j c lim suppose p i j is a correct track point when either v i j or δ c i j is considered illegitimate p i j 1 is regarded as an outlier and would be removed this processing of t r a c k i is set in a loop after each processing p o i n t s i might be modified since some illegal points have been removed update p n u m through p n u m p o i n t s i and repeat this procedure until p n u m converges to a certain value when all trajectories have been processed the processed ship trajectory set is obtained to simplify the description the t mentioned in the following sections denotes the processed ship trajectory set after iterative abnormal data detection and removal 4 3 trajectory reconstruction in the interpolation stage the missing path of t r a c k i will be identified and reconstructed a trajectory s missing path is defined by it s t i s t e p which is obtained in the analysis of the time interval distribution stage to reconstruct the missing path an iki is applied to estimate the location and velocity between the start point and end point of the missing path when the ki method takes two points p i j and p i j 1 into account as shown in fig 3 a the iki method proposed in this research adding a group of harmonic points p i j f r o n t and p i j 1 b e h i n d as shown in fig 3 b the definition of harmonic points will be illustrated in section 4 3 3 a a ship trajectory with missing path b harmonic points in improved interpolation 4 3 1 interpolation time determination to reconstruct the trajectory points in the missing path the path should be found firstly in t r a c k i for every two adjacent points p i j and p i j 1 in p o i n t s i if the time interval of p i j and p i j 1 is greater than t i s t e p which means δ t i j t i s t e p then there exists a missing path between p i j and p i j 1 where they serve as start point and end point respectively once the missing path has been found out the interpolation time should be determined the number of reconstructed points in the missing path between p i j and p i j 1 is n where n is the maximum integer number that satisfies eq 8 8 t i j n t i s t e p t i j 1 and the timestamp t u of each reconstruction point is calculated by eq 9 9 t u t i j k t i s t e p where k is an integer and 1 k n 4 3 2 basic kinematic interpolation in section 3 2 a t is assumed to follow a linear function the acceleration of all the points including p i j and p i j 1 in the missing path satisfy a t to estimate a point in the missing path firstly use eq 2 to transfer eq 1 to the following equations 10 x t x t i v t i t t i 1 2 b t t i 2 1 6 m t t i 3 v t v t i b t t i 1 2 m t t i 2 secondly since p i j and p i j 1 are known the parameters b and m can be solved by substituting the velocity and position of p i j and p i j 1 it should be noted that the ship motion can be regarded as two dimensional thus the velocity of the ship includes speed and course since there are sog and cog in ais data indicating the speed over ground and course over ground of the ship respectively to fully estimate the reconstruction points the motion of the ship is divided into two directions by cog longitude direction causes longitudinal changes and latitude direction causes latitudinal changes the whole trajectory will be projected to the mercator coordinate system therefore the speed in each direction p i j is calculated by 11 v i j l o n s o g i j sin c o g i j 1852 3600 v i j l a t s o g i j cos c o g i j 1852 3600 the position of p i j is x i j y i j where x i j is l o n i j and y i j is l a t i j in the mercator coordinate system taking longitude direction for example substitute v i j l o n v i j 1 l o n x i j x i j 1 t i j t i j 1 into eq 10 parameters b and m can be solved then for each timestamp t u determined by eq 9 x t u v t u and a t u are obtained by eq 2 and eq 10 the key step is using known points p i j and p i j 1 to solve parameters b and m then calculate a t u where a t i j and a t i j 1 are also estimated 4 3 3 improved kinematic interpolation since a t i j and a t i j 1 of p i j and p i j 1 are also estimated value there must exist errors compared to the true acceleration value to reduce these errors a group of harmonic points is introduced here in the iki the harmonic points are defined as follows if there exists a group of integers f r o n t and b e h i n d that satisfies eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 t i j t i j f r o n t δ t i j t i s t e p 13 t i j 1 b e h i n d t i j 1 δ t i j t i s t e p points p i j f r o n t and p i j 1 b e h i n d are called a group of harmonic points corresponding to p i j and p i j 1 the front points refer to the data points before the time spot t i j in the trajectory that satisfy eq 12 and behind points refer to the data points after the time spot t i j 1 in the trajectory that satisfies eq 13 the aim of introducing harmonic points is to refine the acceleration a i j and a i j 1 of p i j and p i j 1 in the ki method it considers all the points in the missing path satisfy hypothetical function a t eq 2 which is solved by endpoints p i j and p i j 1 however the continuity of the acceleration should also be considered as shown in fig 3 b a i j and a i j 1 can be also calculated by p i j f r o n t and p i j p i j 1 and p i j 1 b e h i n d respectively therefore consider the continuity of a i j and a i j 1 adopt the same time intervals while taking account of p i j f r o n t and p i j 1 b e h i n d when respectively substituting p i j f r o n t and p i j p i j 1 and p i j 1 b e h i n d into the kinematic equations the solved acceleration of p i j and p i j 1 are a t i j f r o n t and a t i j 1 b e h i n d then the estimated acceleration of p i j and p i j 1 are refined by 14 a i j a t i j f r o n t a t i j 2 a i j 1 a t i j 1 a t i j 1 b e h i n d 2 using a i j and a i j 1 to solve b and m in eq 2 which are re denoted by b and m 15 b a i j m a i j 1 a i j δ t i j rewrite eq 2 and eq 10 by b and m then the reconstructed points are estimated by the following equation set 16 x t x t i v t i t t i 1 2 b t t i 2 1 6 m t t i 3 v t v t i b t t i 1 2 m t t i 2 a t b m t t i 4 3 4 algorithm design since the whole trajectory reconstruction process has been divided into several modules taking p o i n t s i as initial input the whole algorithm is designed and implemented through python to simplify the description the function explanation is shown in appendix ii algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of the ki algorithm 2 illustrates the iki and the trajectory reconstruction method is demonstrated in algorithm 3 algorithm 1 ki image 1 algorithm 2 iki image 2 algorithm 3 trajectory reconstruction based on iki image 3 5 case study in this section a case study is illustrated to validate the iki method an ais dataset of zhoushan area china is randomly chosen within the following spatio temporal information longitude 121 4110 e to 122 8897 e latitude 29 3587 n to 30 5392 time 2018 10 15 12 00 00 to 2018 10 15 18 00 00 the raw data is preprocessed to obtain the original trajectory set to exclude the influence of non sailing ships trajectories the original trajectory set abandoned those trajectories with an average sog of less than 2 knots 5 1 data processing the original trajectory set contains 591 trajectories with 756552 points as shown in fig 4 a there exists obvious abnormal data and after the iterative abnormal data detection and removal the processed trajectory set contains 583 trajectories with 729448 points shown in fig 4 b when the original trajectory set is being processed 8 trajectories with less than 4 points are removed due to the data amount is too small to conduct reconstruction therefore they are excluded from the data set as noises it should be mentioned that fig 4 is drawn by opencpn 1 1 https www opencpn org and the white lines denote ship trajectories a original trajectory set with abnormal data b processed trajectory set 5 2 macroscopic time interval distribution the time interval distribution of a trajectory not only indicates the navigation characteristics but also shows the transmitting environment features as illustrated in section 4 2 1 for each trajectory in the processed trajectory set a reconstruction time interval t i s t e p is determined to reflect the features of the transmitting environment that the chosen dataset in a view of all the t i s t e p values is shown in fig 5 varying from 6 s to 30 s the results of the analysis indicate that ships in the processed trajectory set are in a normal sailing state and well transmitting environment 5 3 trajectory reconstruction tests in this section to show the performance of iki as it takes position and velocity into consideration a missing path reconstruction experiment on a single trajectory is conducted firstly taking the ki method as a comparison secondly a reconstruction experiment on the whole processed trajectory set is carried out 5 3 1 single trajectory reconstruction the case study takes the trajectory of the ship with mmsi 412xxx890 as an example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method the trajectory has 1357 points with a length of 30 01 n miles and an average speed of 5 04 kn the trajectory is shown in fig 6 to effectively and unbiasedly compare the performances several constant points are randomly selected deleted and reconstructed the reconstruction result is shown in fig 7 secondly a delete procedure is applied to generate missing paths of the trajectory through a scale factor p r o p as it can be regarded as the loss rate in this procedure k points are randomly deleted where k p r o p p o i n t s i and the point chosen to delete is determined by a random number sequence with size k the pseudocode of the delete procedure is shown in algorithm 4 where the function random i j k means to select k numbers from i to j randomly then to evaluate the performance of the iki and ki method the root means square error rmse is introduced since the interpolation methods take position and velocity into consideration wherein velocity cog is used to divide sog into two directions the rmse indicator will be calculated in two aspects position and sog it should be mentioned that the rmse of position is dependent on the distance between the reconstruction points and deleted points in meters and the rmse of sog is dependent on the sog differences between the reconstruction points and deleted points in knots the value of rmse in a trajectory is calculated by a mean value of all reconstruction points rmse set p r o p 0 1 and gradually raise it up to 20 by a step of 0 1 for each p r o p value the rmse of reconstruction points position and sog are calculated respectively the result can be seen in fig 8 and fig 9 it s obvious that both in position and sog the iki method performs better than ki on this trajectory algorithm 4 trajectory point random delete algorithm image 4 5 3 2 trajectory reconstruction on the large scale data sets in the previous section a trajectory is randomly selected to show the performance of the iki method compared with ki in this section the interpolation methods are applied to the processed trajectory set to reconstruct all the ship trajectories and evaluate the performances of the proposed method compare to other classic interpolations methods the reason to choose these methods is that they are the popular geometry based trajectory interpolation methods utilized in the related works the description of each method used in this section is shown in table 1 5 4 rmse distribution first set a certain value of scale factor p r o p in this section 5 in algorithm 4 and apply it to all trajectories for each interpolation method an rmse distribution can be obtained it should be noticed that the result of rmse of sog is not calculated for li v and csi v since they directly use the velocity information to reconstruct points the test is repeated 100 times to reduce the uncertainty of the performance of each method the rmse performance of each method on the whole trajectory is shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively using boxplots combined with violin plots it can be seen that for both the rmse of position and rmse of sog iki shows a good performance on reconstructing the missing path at a low loss rate to evaluate the performance of each method under a different loss rate similar to section 4 3 1 set p r o p 0 1 and gradually raise it to 20 by a step of 0 1 the rmse mean value of each method is calculated and for each value of p r o p consider the large amount of data the process will be repeated five times the results are plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively in the rmse of position it can be seen that all the methods show a similar rising trend of their curves but iki gives the lowest results compared to others in rmse of sog although iki gives an rising curve it s still significantly lower than other curves indicating it has the best performance among these methods 5 5 p best and p worst p b e s t and p w o r s t are a pair of comparative indicators the definition of p b e s t and p w o r s t are as follows for each point that needs to be reconstructed since six interpolation methods are applied to estimate the reconstruction point and the real point is known because it has been deleted artificially there exists a comparison of reconstruction results if a method s reconstruction point result has the minimum rmse compare to others it means that this method works best on this point on the contrary if it has the maximum rmse this method works worst in this comparison p b e s t and p w o r s t are utilized to represent the ratio of the best reconstruction points that a method generates and the ratio of the worst ones the higher p b e s t a method has the more accurate reconstruction performance that this method is likely to have the higher p w o r s t a method has the more inaccurate reconstruction performance that this method is likely to have if a method has both high p b e s t and p w o r s t it proves that this method is not stable to obtain p b e s t and p w o r s t under different loss rates still set p r o p 0 1 and gradually raise it to 20 by a step of 0 1 and the result is shown from figss 14 17 one can see that the iki method can give a stable and accurate reconstruction result compared to other methods especially for iki with ki where a noticeable improvement can be seen from the figures 6 discussion different interpolation methods are added in the previous section and a case study including several performance tests is conducted in this section the proposed method will be discussed based on the result in the previous sections 6 1 performances on single trajectory reconstruction as for the selected trajectory reconstruction the reconstructed trajectory has a strong similarity in the entire trajectory s shape on the macroscopic scale when the scale is magnified it s evident that the reconstruction path that iki gives is more accurate than the traditional ki gives in fig 7 one can see that in path 2 the randomly deleted path frequently changes its direction while path 1 and path 3 have the stronger linear characteristic the reconstruction path that ki gives on path 2 doesn t match the deleted one so well but iki gives a more similar reconstruction path to the deleted ones so does it in path 1 and path 3 this means that the iki method proposed in this paper works better on shape when compared with ki however only compare the shape of the path is unconvincing as shown in figs 8 and 9 when set the trajectory under different loss rates the iki method has lower rmse of position and rmse of sog such results show that iki has stronger performance than the ki method the discussion aforementioned proves that iki has better performance than ki on a single trajectory due to the consideration of forward and backward known points the acceleration estimated in iki has been revised to approach the real one thus there is a noticeable improvement between iki and ki 6 2 macroscopic perspective performances 6 2 1 performances when prop 5 the iki method has better performance in reconstructing the entire processed trajectory set given p r o p which can be considered as a low loss rate the eigenvalues in boxplots in fig 10 are shown in table 2 six methods are divided into two groups based on the similarity of their boxplots group 1 has iki li v and csi v methods group 2 has ki li p and csi p methods it can be seen that methods in group 1 outperform those in group 2 with lower values of rmse the violin plots also show that group 1 has more concentration rmse values between the min value and q1 the first quartile and this area is called the min q1 area than those in group 2 in group 1 iki has the lowest extreme value with a slightly higher q1 and median value csi v has the most concentration rmse values in the min q1 area with the lowest median and means the highest min value and li v plays a median role in group 1 except its max value in this circumstance we can say that group 1 s methods have similar performances as boxplots will remove the outliers which will be taken into consideration in the next section same as the consideration of sog in group 2 we focus on ki it can be seen that it has the highest min value but the lowest max value and a median role considering the rest of the eigenvalues it is therefore iki outperforms ki as for sog as shown in fig 11 and the eigenvalues can be seen in table 3 since li v and csi v are no longer considered the iki method has the most accurate reconstruction result on sog 6 2 2 performances when prop rises the boxplots and violin plots will take some rmse values as outliers which cannot be ignored in the tests of performance when taking these values into consideration iki still shows great performance in rmse of position as shown in fig 12 at first all the methods have an abrupt rising of rmse value and then the rising trend of curves stabilizes the csi v method no longer performs so well on the rmse of position since it has a very unstable curve when p r o p rises though the li v performs better than the csi v with more stable curve and lower rmse value the rmse value of it is still higher than iki proposed in this paper which performs best with the lowest rmse curve ki has almost the same shape of the rmse curve as li p the explanation is that the li p method is a special case of ki with b 0 m 0 it can be seen that csi p performs worst in the rmse of sog as shown in fig 13 iki also performs best with minimum rmse value but a little bit more sensitive to the change of loss rate it also shows that even ki considers kinematic information it incredibly has a higher rmse of sog than li p as mentioned in section 3 2 the acceleration function in ki is assumed to follow a linear function when a ship is in a normal navigation status its acceleration rarely changes in a short period of time in this aspect the experiment result indicates that the acceleration estimated in ki is inaccurate and the utilization of more harmonic points in iki has been proved to overcome this drawback as for p b e s t and p w o r s t experiment of position shown in figs 14 and 15 the iki is sensitive to the change of loss rate and the p b e s t value gradually reduces when the loss rate rises it has the second largest p b e s t value at a low loss rate and has the third largest p b e s t value at a high loss rate which is not stable as li v it keeps the second lowest p w o r s t value which is close to 0 while li v has even lower p w o r s t value by contrast the ki method is not only the most difficult to get the best reconstruction points but also ranks the third on p w o r s t though csi v has the largest p b e s t value it takes the second place of p w o r s t value which also indicates that csi v is not stable the li p method only outperforms ki on p b e s t and has the third lowest p w o r s t the csi p is likely to reconstruct the worst points and performs not so good on p b e s t it turns out that in p b e s t and p w o r s t experiment of position iki and li v have the best and most balanced performances while iki performs better at a low loss rate and li v performs better at a high loss rate however in practice the loss rate is hard to reach so high as for p b e s t and p w o r s t experiment of sog shown in figs 16 and 17 the iki method has a clear advantage over the other three methods having the highest p b e s t value ki ranks second on p b e s t but with the highest p w o r s t proves the conclusion in the previous section while the other two methods having the lowest p b e s t values near zero the iki method sometimes has the worst reconstruction result on sog but the p w o r s t value of it is still very low only higher than the linear interpolation of position method while ki and csi p having the worst reconstruction result on the sog which rank first place and second place on p w o r s t the iki method with its high p b e s t and low p w o r s t value shows accurate reconstruction ability on sog 6 3 limitations and implication of the proposed method with the proposed iki method the kinematic information in ais has been comprehensively used to reach accurate reconstruction results although the performance of the proposed method is good compared with the classic geometry based interpolation methods for the next step of the research several aspects could be furtherly improved which are as follows 1 the adaptivity for the ship behavior in a short time for the current proposed method the acceleration function is adjusted for most of the ship behaviors however for ships with excellent maneuverability their sudden change in the navigation status is difficult to be accurately estimated in the reconstruction process 2 the adaptivity for the ship ais data with low frequency for the low frequency ais data due to various influences the extent of information loss is significant the proposed method may not be able to provide accurate reconstruction results due to such loss in kinematic information for these limitations in the next step of the research the deep learning based approaches are of great promise to be integrated with our method to learn the typical characteristics of the data to provide better results ship trajectory information is one of the fundamental data sources for the research and development in the field of the maritime transportation system e g chen et al 2020a 2021 felski et al 2015 mazaheri et al 2014 qu et al 2011 with the application of the proposed trajectory reconstruction method the accuracy frequency of the ais data can be furtherly improved with consideration of the kinematic information of the ship such improvement could then facilitate the research in various aspects such as the collision risk analysis and monitoring research development of autonomous shipping the identification of ship behavior and simulation and management of the regional maritime transportation system etc in general the proposed method provides a promising tool for ship trajectory based research and development in the future 7 conclusion the missing and abnormal messages in ais are inevitable due to various factors in practices therefore trajectory reconstruction becomes a critical part of improving the ais data quality in this research an iki method is proposed to reconstruct the ais trajectory this method s contribution is that instead of only considering the start point and endpoint of the missing path it also considers forward and backward points near the missing path to revise the kinematic equation and reach accurate reconstruction results to obtain a high quality trajectory set before the reconstructing process an effective trajectory refining process has also been proposed in this paper it uses an iterative abnormal detection and removal process to identify the potential incorrect data meanwhile the analysis of time interval distribution has also been conducted to reveal the ais transmitting environment features and facilitate the trajectory reconstruction process a case study based on several experiments is conducted comprehensively to avoid prejudice in testing the performance of the proposed method in this research the experiments are designed from a single trajectory to the entire ais trajectory set besides the performance of the reconstruction are also validated via comparison between the original trajectory data and corresponding reconstructed trajectory based on randomly damaged data set not only the shape has been compared but also the reconstructed points are taken into consideration the comparisons of rmse p b e s t and p w o r s t comprehensively shows each interpolation method s performance and the result proves that the proposed method has a stronger performance and more practical application value than other methods in the meantime a cross validation procedure between the radar images of the ship navigation and ais data could be introduced to furtherly analyze the performance of the method credit authorship contribution statement shaoqing guo conceptualization

20568,ship trajectory information has made a significant contribution to the data based research in analyzing maritime transportation and has facilitated the improvement of maritime safety however the ais data which consists of ship trajectory inevitably contains noises or missing data that can interfere with the conclusion in this paper an improved kinematic interpolation is presented for ais trajectory reconstruction which integrates data preprocessing and interpolation that considers the ships kinematic information the improved kinematic reconstruction method includes four steps 1 data preprocessing 2 analysis of time interval distribution 3 abnormal data detection and removal 4 kinematic interpolation that takes the kinematic feature of ships i e velocity and acceleration into account adding forward and backward track points to help correct the acceleration function of reconstruction points the proposed method is tested on the ais dataset of zhoushan port and was compared with traditional ship trajectory reconstruction methods the comparison indicates that the proposed method can effectively reconstruct the ship trajectory with higher performance on a single ship trajectory and a large ais data set of certain water areas keywords ais ship trajectory trajectory reconstruction kinematic interpolation 1 introduction the automatic identification system ais has been playing a significant role in the industry of maritime transportation as it was designed to enhance maritime safety yang et al 2019 ais provides real time information of ships concerning their static and dynamic status e g longitude latitude speed course etc it serves as a big data source for various research such as traffic analysis logistics transport economy monitoring collision risk maritime safety etc svanberg et al 2019 one of the hottest areas for research and industrial application of ais data is the ship trajectory information analysis as it provides a precise detailed and massive amount of ship navigation data however ais messages are easily affected by bad weather blocked communication channel equipment errors etc last et al 2015 the utilization of raw ais data where missing data and abnormal data frequently occur in the analysis process may lead to incorrect conclusions though researchers have come up with methods based on ais base stations to correct this kind of data jiang et al 2014 it is of great significance to reconstruct the ais trajectory to improve the data quality for further analysis and applications the objective of ship trajectory reconstruction is to improve data quality using techniques such as interpolation etc to date many interpolation methods for ship trajectory reconstruction have been proposed a detailed literature review can be found in section 2 however even with the consideration of the trajectory type in some of the methods the interpolation processes still lack taking full consideration of the kinematic information that ais has and only utilizes mathematic interpolation methods to focus on the shape of the trajectory also methods based on deep learning and other aspects will bring extra computation load that in some situations is unbearable and limit their application to take full utilization of the kinematic information that ais has and reach a more accurate trajectory reconstruction result an improved kinematic interpolation iki method is proposed in this paper compared to the existed methods the main contributions of this work are as follows 1 an iterative abnormal data detection and removal method has been proposed and integrated into the reconstruction process 2 the position velocity and acceleration of the ship have been fully considered in the interpolation process 3 the data near the path which needs to be reconstructed is also considered 4 the application area of the proposed method is wide as a series of tests on a whole water area that has different types of trajectories are conducted the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a literature review over trajectory reconstruction elaborated in section 2 followed by the methodology framework with a brief in section 3 the details of the established models about date preprocessing trajectory refining and trajectory reconstruction are presented in section 4 after that a case study including a series of tests is shown in section 5 and the experimental results are discussed in section 6 section 7 gives a brief conclusion about the study and illustrates the possible improvement direction in the future 2 literature review various efforts have been devoted to the analysis and improvement of the quality of the ais data e g felski et al 2015 he et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 among the literature related to ship trajectory reconstruction various methods have been proposed generally such methods can be classified into the following groups according to the perspective they adopted when performing the trajectory interpolation 1 geometry based approach 2 navigation oriented geometry approach and 3 artificial intelligence based approach in this section an analysis of the existing ship trajectory interpolation methods is analyzed a detailed comparison table can be found in the appendix as for the geometry based approach the principle of these type of methods is that the ship trajectory is usually considered as a curve which can be represented by a series of mathematical functions out of this principle various methods are proposed and applied in ship trajectory reconstruction such as linear interpolation polynomial interpolation cubic spline interpolation and cubic hermit interpolation kolendo and śmierzchalski 2016 the linear interpolation methods perform well in high frequency trajectory data and the polynomial cubic spline or cubic hermit interpolation methods are suitable for curved trajectories with low data frequency although such methods have satisfactory efficiency in conducting the reconstruction and easy to be applied in practices the lack of consideration of the ship s navigation status and the kinematic information has restricted their applicability and the accuracy of the results because the trajectory is the results of ship s navigation under influence of multiple external factors such as wind current and wave etc and interaction with other ships the ais trajectory can be classified into different types in ship trajectory interpolation herrero et al 2019 to improve the results of trajectory reconstruction many researchers have combined the navigation status of the ships and geometry methods to consider the characteristics of ship trajectory under different navigation statuses zhang et al 2018a divided ship navigation status into three types mooring maneuvering and normal speed navigation to support ship trajectory reconstruction nguyen et al 2015 came up with a method including linear interpolation and cubic hermit interpolation zhang et al 2018b proposed a method using linear interpolation on the straight segment and cubic spline interpolation method on the curve segment based on data sparse processing sang et al 2015 identified ship navigational features with a line arc and curve segment to restore the ship trajectory different from cubic functions du et al 2017 proposed a polynomial interpolation using high level functions jeong et al 2020 used functional data analysis fda to deal with abnormal data and analyze the ship routes among all these methods the ship trajectory is firstly separated into different types that representing the ship s navigation status such as normal navigation maneuvering e g collision avoidance turning etc based on the different characteristics in the shape of trajectory under these scenarios different types of mathematical function of curves are applied to conduct the interpolation process zhang et al 2017 thoroughly discussed the performance of the cubic spline interpolation method compared with the cubic hermit interpolation using static and dynamic information on a specific trajectory in the meantime shi et al 2019 utilized empirical mode decomposition emd and fermat s spiral to fit the unmanned surface vessel s trajectory however due to the fact that fundamentally such a combination approach is still based on the geometry based approach the kinematic information of ships is not comprehensively utilized in the process therefore the accuracy of the results may be restricted with the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years such an approach has also been utilized in the reconstruction of ship trajectory e g hao 2019 the principle of such an approach is to train a deep learning model based on a large amount of historical data and to estimate the most probable data point of the target trajectory data set li et al 2020 proposed a trajectory reconstruction method based on u net convolutional networks which can be applied to different sampling frequencies liang et al 2019 proposed a long short term memory lstm based supervised learning method to reconstruct the vessel trajectories where the missing data is identified by random forest chen et al 2020b normalized the denoised data and put it into an artificial neural network to predict the ship trajectory dobrkovic et al 2018 used an improved genetic algorithm ga to extract maritime patterns and reconstruct routes from incomplete ais data chen et al 2020b applied data denoising techniques to exclude the abnormal data points and reconstruct the ship trajectory with artificial neural networks zhong et al 2019 incorporated the bidirectional lstm and recurrent neural network to restore the ais data of inland ships a similar approach has also been utilized by liu et al 2021 with the integration of the density based clustering method to improve the data quality for promoting the vessel traffic services through prior knowledge base construction a density weighted ant colony algorithm is proposed for the reconstruction of ship trajectory by zhang et al 2020 from the literature one can see that such methods have shown good interpolation results compared with the traditional methods however they demand a mass of historical data to extract the trajectory features to learn the ship motion and accurately give the reconstruction results therefore the deep learning based approach s calculation and learning process are complicated requesting a lot of calculation time and hardware devices with excellent performances from the aforementioned methods one can see that the geometry based approaches and consideration of ship navigation status are popular in the research and development of ship ais trajectory reconstruction however as aforementioned ship trajectory is the result of the overall influence of ship s navigation behavior external influences and the traffic characteristics etc solely relying on the shape characteristics of the trajectory may not be able to obtain highly accurate reconstructed results to solve such an issue kinematic interpolation ki has been proposed to estimate the unknown location of a moving object between collected data long 2015 the principle of such an approach is to incorporate the kinematic characteristics of the moving objects into the process of estimating the possible status position speed based on the law of physics besides an improved linear interpolation that considers the ship s velocity including speed and course has been proposed in xue et al 2017 such a method has already been widely utilized in the field of robotics as for the reconstruction of ship trajectory it is of great promise to improve the results by incorporating the ship s kinematic information into the process compared with the conventional geometry based approaches 3 methodology the purpose of this research is to propose a method for general and effective reconstruction of the ship trajectories considering the kinematic information within the ais data in addition to the information of longitude and latitude ais dynamic messages contain information such as speed over ground sog and course over ground cog the utilization of these parameters can increase the effectiveness and accuracy of reconstruction results however since the raw ais data inevitably have abnormal data and missing data caused by equipment errors transmission etc and the data of each ship are dispersedly distributed in the file there needs to be a procedure to obtain a high quality trajectory set before the reconstruction the main idea of the iki method is proposed in section 2 2 the methodology framework is shown in fig 1 3 1 data processing before the ship trajectory reconstruction the quality of the ais data must be verified and improved to remove the abnormal data points first data preprocessing including ais decoding data cleaning and trajectory extraction is conducted the trajectory refining process can then be divided into two modules 1 analysis of time interval distribution 2 abnormal data detection and removal data preprocessing aims to decode the raw ais data following the standard in itu 2010 and remove the wrong data with obvious anomalies in longitude latitude sog or cog of the ships notice that heading is not considered in this research because the value of it is not always available and reliable based on the decoded and cleansed data the trajectory will be extracted referring to the ship s maritime mobile service identifier mmsi so the ais trajectory data of each ship will be formed in a time series according to itu 2010 the transmitting frequency of ais data varies from 3s to 3 min depending on the navigation status of the ship besides due to the traffic volume and the transmitting capacity of the ais system in certain areas the ais messages could be delayed to a certain extent for any trajectory the analysis of its ais sending time interval distribution can help reveal the ship s navigation characteristics in the aspect of ais transmission frequency providing a facilitator for the trajectory construction process data cleaning can remove points with obvious errors such as mmsi format error latitude and longitude out of range and other illegal errors refer to itu 2010 however there will still be some abnormal data remained thus a further step to identify these abnormal data should be performed the procedure of abnormal data detection and removal is based on average speed and the average change rate of cog between two adjacent points in addition this process will be performed in a loop a convergent judgment is added as a termination condition which takes the number of total points in a trajectory into account to ensure that all the abnormal data have been removed then the processed ship trajectory set is obtained 3 2 kinematic interpolation there are many methods proposed to estimate unknown locations among a moving object s trajectory such as linear interpolation xue et al 2017 cubic spline interpolation zhang et al 2017 etc to calculate the possible locations using objects kinematics i e velocity and acceleration etc is called kinematic interpolation ki long 2015 the main idea of ki is to establish an acceleration function of the moving object in a period according to the kinematic formula the velocity function can be obtained by integrating the acceleration and the position function is then obtained the kinematic equations used in this method are shown in eq 1 1 x t x t i t i t v t d t v t v t i t i t a t d t where t i t t j t i and t j denote the time of two given adjacent points p and q x t is the estimated position between p and q at time t with velocity v t and acceleration a t please be noted that the velocity in this research is termed as the variable to describe the numerical value of the object s speed and direction at the same time the detailed meaning of these terms for the improved kinematic interpolation of ship trajectory is furtherly elaborated in section 4 3 in most situations a t is unknown and assumed the following linear function 2 a t b m t t i the parameters b and m will be solved when applying the velocity and position information of p and q to the equations set ki performs well with fast moving objects where the trajectory points are sampled at high frequency long 2015 refer to itu 2010 and appendix i the trajectory points that transmitted by ais can be considered as a high frequency sample considering the kinematic information that ais has it is reasonable to apply the ki on ais trajectory reconstruction however since most points of the trajectory are known the calculated value of the object s acceleration at p and q is not unique if it is put into a different period of time at once to further use kinematic information that a trajectory has and obtain more accurate reconstruction results this paper improves how to establish better acceleration function and the improved model will be elaborated in section 3 4 model design in the previous sections the methodology of this research and the objective are elaborated in this section details on the model design and parameter settings will be illustrated 4 1 data preprocessing refer to itu 2010 a program is written to decode the raw ais data and sort the decoded data by their mmsi where the data cleaning process is also included then extract the ship trajectories to obtain the original ship trajectory set t which is described as follows let t r a c k i m m s i i p o i n t s i where t r a c k i denotes the i th ship trajectory in t m m s i i represents the ship s mmsi corresponding to the i th ship trajectory and p o i n t s i denotes the trajectory point set of t r a c k i for a trajectory point p i j p o i n t s i 0 j p o i n t s i p o i n t s i denotes the number of total points in t r a c k i there is p i j t i j l o n i j l a t i j s o g i j c o g i j where t i j l o n i j l a t i j s o g i j and c o g i j represent the time stamp longitude latitude sog and cog of j th trajectory point in t r a c k i in general the ais data also contains the dynamic information of the ships such as the heading of the ship etc however during the analysis of the data we have found that there are too many missing values in these variables to maintain the quality of the reconstruction we have to therefore exclude such information in the reconstruction process 4 2 trajectory refining 4 2 1 analysis of time interval distribution though the ais transmitting frequency can indicate the ship navigation characteristic as it must follow the standard requested by itu 2010 it is difficult to ensure that the messages are not affected by the traffic volume and the transmitting capacity during transmission to get the transmission characteristics of a ship trajectory and help determine the reconstruction time interval which fits the reconstructed path into the real environment the analysis of time interval distribution is conducted for a trajectory t r a c k i m m s i i p o i n t s i in trajectory set t two adjacent points p i j t i j l o n i j l a t i j s o g i j c o g i j and p i j 1 t i j 1 l o n i j 1 l a t i j 1 s o g i j 1 c o g i j 1 in p o i n t s i the time interval between p i j and p i j 1 is shown in eq 3 3 δ t i j t i j 1 t i j and i i δ t i j j n 1 j p o i n t s i 1 denotes the time interval set of t r a c k i then the time interval distribution is obtained reorder i i in ascending order and denote the sorted set as i i s o r t e d the reconstruction time interval t i s t e p corresponding to m m s i i is 4 t i s t e p i i s o r t e d 0 9 where i i s o r t e d 0 9 is the 90 quantile in i i s o r t e d such a value is set by considering the time interval distributions of the trajectory data in this research an example is shown in fig 2 and appendix ii in practice such value can be adjustable according to the demand from the researchers and the time interval distribution characteristics of the data t i s t e p is an essential value to determine the timestamp of the interpolation point that will be furtherly mentioned in section 4 3 4 2 2 iterative abnormal data detection and removal in data preprocessing the data cleaning process can only remove obvious wrong data that violate the standard requested by itu 2010 it is essential to design a further step to detect and remove the potential abnormal data for each t r a c k i in t let p n u m p o i n t s i the average speed v i j between two adjacent points p i j and p i j 1 in p o i n t s i can be calculated by eq 5 5 v i j δ d i j δ t i j δ δ d i j distance l o n i j l a t i j l o n i j 1 l a t i j 1 where δ d i j is the distance between p i j and p i j 1 similarly the average change rate δ c i j can be calculated by eq 6 6 δ c i j c o g i j 1 c o g i j δ t i j c o g i j 1 c o g i j 180 360 c o g i j 1 c o g i j δ t i j c o g i j 1 c o g i j 180 to effectively detect abnormal data if the data are correct v i j and δ c i j must obey the following rules 1 in a specific water area the threshold of ship speed v l i m exists and v i j will not expand v l i m 2 p i j and p i j 1 contain data field s o g i j and s o g i j 1 to describe the ship speed at t i m e i j and t i m e i j 1 respectively v i j will not be far away from s o g i j and s o g i j 1 since the time interval is not that long 3 δ c i j cannot expand a threshold c l i m since the ship turning ability is limited refer to ship maneuvering characters thus if there exists abnormal data v i j and δ c i j must satisfy one of the following inequations 7 v i j v lim max v i j s o g i j v i j s o g i j 1 0 δ c i j c lim suppose p i j is a correct track point when either v i j or δ c i j is considered illegitimate p i j 1 is regarded as an outlier and would be removed this processing of t r a c k i is set in a loop after each processing p o i n t s i might be modified since some illegal points have been removed update p n u m through p n u m p o i n t s i and repeat this procedure until p n u m converges to a certain value when all trajectories have been processed the processed ship trajectory set is obtained to simplify the description the t mentioned in the following sections denotes the processed ship trajectory set after iterative abnormal data detection and removal 4 3 trajectory reconstruction in the interpolation stage the missing path of t r a c k i will be identified and reconstructed a trajectory s missing path is defined by it s t i s t e p which is obtained in the analysis of the time interval distribution stage to reconstruct the missing path an iki is applied to estimate the location and velocity between the start point and end point of the missing path when the ki method takes two points p i j and p i j 1 into account as shown in fig 3 a the iki method proposed in this research adding a group of harmonic points p i j f r o n t and p i j 1 b e h i n d as shown in fig 3 b the definition of harmonic points will be illustrated in section 4 3 3 a a ship trajectory with missing path b harmonic points in improved interpolation 4 3 1 interpolation time determination to reconstruct the trajectory points in the missing path the path should be found firstly in t r a c k i for every two adjacent points p i j and p i j 1 in p o i n t s i if the time interval of p i j and p i j 1 is greater than t i s t e p which means δ t i j t i s t e p then there exists a missing path between p i j and p i j 1 where they serve as start point and end point respectively once the missing path has been found out the interpolation time should be determined the number of reconstructed points in the missing path between p i j and p i j 1 is n where n is the maximum integer number that satisfies eq 8 8 t i j n t i s t e p t i j 1 and the timestamp t u of each reconstruction point is calculated by eq 9 9 t u t i j k t i s t e p where k is an integer and 1 k n 4 3 2 basic kinematic interpolation in section 3 2 a t is assumed to follow a linear function the acceleration of all the points including p i j and p i j 1 in the missing path satisfy a t to estimate a point in the missing path firstly use eq 2 to transfer eq 1 to the following equations 10 x t x t i v t i t t i 1 2 b t t i 2 1 6 m t t i 3 v t v t i b t t i 1 2 m t t i 2 secondly since p i j and p i j 1 are known the parameters b and m can be solved by substituting the velocity and position of p i j and p i j 1 it should be noted that the ship motion can be regarded as two dimensional thus the velocity of the ship includes speed and course since there are sog and cog in ais data indicating the speed over ground and course over ground of the ship respectively to fully estimate the reconstruction points the motion of the ship is divided into two directions by cog longitude direction causes longitudinal changes and latitude direction causes latitudinal changes the whole trajectory will be projected to the mercator coordinate system therefore the speed in each direction p i j is calculated by 11 v i j l o n s o g i j sin c o g i j 1852 3600 v i j l a t s o g i j cos c o g i j 1852 3600 the position of p i j is x i j y i j where x i j is l o n i j and y i j is l a t i j in the mercator coordinate system taking longitude direction for example substitute v i j l o n v i j 1 l o n x i j x i j 1 t i j t i j 1 into eq 10 parameters b and m can be solved then for each timestamp t u determined by eq 9 x t u v t u and a t u are obtained by eq 2 and eq 10 the key step is using known points p i j and p i j 1 to solve parameters b and m then calculate a t u where a t i j and a t i j 1 are also estimated 4 3 3 improved kinematic interpolation since a t i j and a t i j 1 of p i j and p i j 1 are also estimated value there must exist errors compared to the true acceleration value to reduce these errors a group of harmonic points is introduced here in the iki the harmonic points are defined as follows if there exists a group of integers f r o n t and b e h i n d that satisfies eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 t i j t i j f r o n t δ t i j t i s t e p 13 t i j 1 b e h i n d t i j 1 δ t i j t i s t e p points p i j f r o n t and p i j 1 b e h i n d are called a group of harmonic points corresponding to p i j and p i j 1 the front points refer to the data points before the time spot t i j in the trajectory that satisfy eq 12 and behind points refer to the data points after the time spot t i j 1 in the trajectory that satisfies eq 13 the aim of introducing harmonic points is to refine the acceleration a i j and a i j 1 of p i j and p i j 1 in the ki method it considers all the points in the missing path satisfy hypothetical function a t eq 2 which is solved by endpoints p i j and p i j 1 however the continuity of the acceleration should also be considered as shown in fig 3 b a i j and a i j 1 can be also calculated by p i j f r o n t and p i j p i j 1 and p i j 1 b e h i n d respectively therefore consider the continuity of a i j and a i j 1 adopt the same time intervals while taking account of p i j f r o n t and p i j 1 b e h i n d when respectively substituting p i j f r o n t and p i j p i j 1 and p i j 1 b e h i n d into the kinematic equations the solved acceleration of p i j and p i j 1 are a t i j f r o n t and a t i j 1 b e h i n d then the estimated acceleration of p i j and p i j 1 are refined by 14 a i j a t i j f r o n t a t i j 2 a i j 1 a t i j 1 a t i j 1 b e h i n d 2 using a i j and a i j 1 to solve b and m in eq

n t s i as initial input the whole algorithm is designed and implemented through python to simplify the description the function explanation is shown in appendix ii algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of the ki algorithm 2 illustrates the iki and the trajectory reconstruction method is demonstrated in algorithm 3 algorithm 1 ki image 1 algorithm 2 iki image 2 algorithm 3 trajectory reconstruction based on iki image 3 5 case study in this section a case study is illustrated to validate the iki method an ais dataset of zhoushan area china is randomly chosen within the following spatio temporal information longitude 121 4110 e to 122 8897 e latitude 29 3587 n to 30 5392 time 2018 10 15 12 00 00 to 2018 10 15 18 00 00 the raw data is preprocessed to obtain the original trajectory set to exclude the influence of non sailing ships trajectories the original trajectory set abandoned those trajectories with an average sog of less than 2 knots 5 1 data processing the original trajectory set contains 591 trajectories with 756552 points as shown in fig 4 a there exists obvious abnormal data and after the iterative abnormal data detection and removal the processed trajectory set contains 583 trajectories with 729448 points shown in fig 4 b when the original trajectory set is being processed 8 trajectories with less than 4 points are removed due to the data amount is too small to conduct reconstruction therefore they are excluded from the data set as noises it should be mentioned that fig 4 is drawn by opencpn 1 1 https www opencpn org and the white lines denote ship trajectories a original trajectory set with abnormal data b processed trajectory set 5 2 macroscopic time interval distribution the time interval distribution of a trajectory not only indicates the navigation characteristics but also shows the transmitting environment features as illustrated in section 4 2 1 for each trajectory in the processed trajectory set a reconstruction time interval t i s t e p is determined to reflect the features of the transmitting environment that the chosen dataset in a view of all the t i s t e p values is shown in fig 5 varying from 6 s to 30 s the results of the analysis indicate that ships in the processed trajectory set are in a normal sailing state and well transmitting environment 5 3 trajectory reconstruction tests in this section to show the performance of iki as it takes position and velocity into consideration a missing path reconstruction experiment on a single trajectory is conducted firstly taking the ki method as a comparison secondly a reconstruction experiment on the whole processed trajectory set is carried out 5 3 1 single trajectory reconstruction the case study takes the trajectory of the ship with mmsi 412xxx890 as an example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method the trajectory has 1357 points with a length of 30 01 n miles and an average speed of 5 04 kn the trajectory is shown in fig 6 to effectively and unbiasedly compare the performances several constant points are randomly selected deleted and reconstructed the reconstruction result is shown in fig 7 secondly a delete procedure is applied to generate missing paths of the trajectory through a scale factor p r o p as it can be regarded as the loss rate in this procedure k points are randomly deleted where k p r o p p o i n t s i and the point chosen to delete is determined by a random number sequence with size k the pseudocode of the delete procedure is shown in algorithm 4 where the function random i j k means to select k numbers from i to j randomly then to evaluate the performance of the iki and ki method the root means square error rmse is introduced since the interpolation methods take position and velocity into consideration wherein velocity cog is used to divide sog into two directions the rmse indicator will be calculated in two aspects position and sog it should be mentioned that the rmse of position is dependent on the distance between the reconstruction points and deleted points in meters and the rmse of sog is dependent on the sog differences between the reconstruction points and deleted points in knots the value of rmse in a trajectory is calculated by a mean value of all reconstruction points rmse set p r o p 0 1 and gradually raise it up to 20 by a step of 0 1 for each p r o p value the rmse of reconstruction points position and sog are calculated respectively the result can be seen in fig 8 and fig 9 it s obvious that both in position and sog the iki method performs better than ki on this trajectory algorithm 4 trajectory point random delete algorithm image 4 5 3 2 trajectory reconstruction on the large scale data sets in the previous section a trajectory is randomly selected to show the performance of the iki method compared with ki in this section the interpolation methods are applied to the processed trajectory set to reconstruct all the ship trajectories and evaluate the performances of the proposed method compare to other classic interpolations methods the reason to choose these methods is that they are the popular geometry based trajectory interpolation methods utilized in the related works the description of each method used in this section is shown in table 1 5 4 rmse distribution first set a certain value of scale factor p r o p in this section 5 in algorithm 4 and apply it to all trajectories for each interpolation method an rmse distribution can be obtained it should be noticed that the result of rmse of sog is not calculated for li v and csi v since they directly use the velocity information to reconstruct points the test is repeated 100 times to reduce the uncertainty of the performance of each method the rmse performance of each method on the whole trajectory is shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively using boxplots combined with violin plots it can be seen that for both the rmse of position and rmse of sog iki shows a good performance on reconstructing the missing path at a low loss rate to evaluate the performance of each method under a different loss rate similar to section 4 3 1 set p r o p 0 1 and gradually raise it to 20 by a step of 0 1 the rmse mean value of each method is calculated and for each value of p r o p consider the large amount of data the process will be repeated five times the results are plotted in fig 12 and fig 13 respectively in the rmse of position it can be seen that all the methods show a similar rising trend of their curves but iki gives the lowest results compared to others in rmse of sog although iki gives an rising curve it s still significantly lower than other curves indicating it has the best performance among these methods 5 5 p best and p worst p b e s t and p w o r s t are a pair of comparative indicators the definition of p b e s t and p w o r s t are as follows for each point that needs to be reconstructed since six interpolation methods are applied to estimate the reconstruction point and the real point is known because it has been deleted artificially there exists a comparison of reconstruction results if a method s reconstruction point result has the minimum rmse compare to others it means that this method works best on this point on the contrary if it has the maximum rmse this method works worst in this comparison p b e s t and p w o r s t are utilized to represent the ratio of the best reconstruction points that a method generates and the ratio of the worst ones the higher p b e s t a method has the more accurate reconstruction performance that this method is likely to have the higher p w o r s t a method has the more inaccurate reconstruction performance that this method is likely to have if a method has both high p b e s t and p w o r s t it proves that this method is not stable to obtain p b e s t and p w o r s t under different loss rates still set p r o p 0 1 and gradually raise it to 20 by a step of 0 1 and the result is shown from figss 14 17 one can see that the iki method can give a stable and accurate reconstruction result compared to other methods especially for iki with ki where a noticeable improvement can be seen from the figures 6 discussion different interpolation methods are added in the previous section and a case study including several performance tests is conducted in this section the proposed method will be discussed based on the result in the previous sections 6 1 performances on single trajectory reconstruction as for the selected trajectory reconstruction the reconstructed trajectory has a strong similarity in the entire trajectory s shape on the macroscopic scale when the scale is magnified it s evident that the reconstruction path that iki gives is more accurate than the traditional ki gives in fig 7 one can see that in path 2 the randomly deleted path frequently changes its direction while path 1 and path 3 have the stronger linear characteristic the reconstruction path that ki gives on path 2 doesn t match the deleted one so well but iki gives a more similar reconstruction path to the deleted ones so does it in path 1 and path 3 this means that the iki method proposed in this paper works better on shape when compared with ki however only compare the shape of the path is unconvincing as shown in figs 8 and 9 when set the trajectory under different loss rates the iki method has lower rmse of position and rmse of sog such results show that iki has stronger performance than the ki method the discussion aforementioned proves that iki has better performance than ki on a single trajectory due to the consideration of forward and backward known points the acceleration estimated in iki has been revised to approach the real one thus there is a noticeable improvement between iki and ki 6 2 macroscopic perspective performances 6 2 1 performances when prop 5 the iki method has better performance in reconstructing the entire processed trajectory set given p r o p which can be considered as a low loss rate the eigenvalues in boxplots in fig 10 are shown in table 2 six methods are divided into two groups based on the similarity of their boxplots group 1 has iki li v and csi v methods group 2 has ki li p and csi p methods it can be seen that methods in group 1 outperform those in group 2 with lower values of rmse the violin plots also show that group 1 has more concentration rmse values between the min value and q1 the first quartile and this area is called the min q1 area than those in group 2 in group 1 iki has the lowest extreme value with a slightly higher q1 and median value csi v has the most concentration rmse values in the min q1 area with the lowest median and means the highest min value and li v plays a median role in group 1 except its max value in this circumstance we can say that group 1 s methods have similar performances as boxplots will remove the outliers which will be taken into consideration in the next section same as the consideration of sog in group 2 we focus on ki it can be seen that it has the highest min value but the lowest max value and a median role considering the rest of the eigenvalues it is therefore iki outperforms ki as for sog as shown in fig 11 and the eigenvalues can be seen in table 3 since li v and csi v are no longer considered the iki method has the most accurate reconstruction result on sog 6 2 2 performances when prop rises the boxplots and violin plots will take some rmse values as outliers which cannot be ignored in the tests of performance when taking these values into consideration iki still shows great performance in rmse of position as shown in fig 12 at first all the methods have an abrupt rising of rmse value and then the rising trend of curves stabilizes the csi v method no longer performs so well on the rmse of position since it has a very unstable curve when p r o p rises though the li v performs better than the csi v with more stable curve and lower rmse value the rmse value of it is still higher than iki proposed in this paper which performs best with the lowest rmse curve ki has almost the same shape of the rmse curve as li p the explanation is that the li p method is a special case of ki with b 0 m 0 it can be seen that csi p performs worst in the rmse of sog as shown in fig 13 iki also performs best with minimum rmse value but a little bit more sensitive to the change of loss rate it also shows that even ki considers kinematic information it incredibly has a higher rmse of sog than li p as mentioned in section 3 2 the acceleration function in ki is assumed to follow a linear function when a ship is in a normal navigation status its acceleration rarely changes in a short period of time in this aspect the experiment result indicates that the acceleration estimated in ki is inaccurate and the utilization of more harmonic points in iki has been proved to overcome this drawback as for p b e s t and p w o r s t experiment of position shown in figs 14 and 15 the iki is sensitive to the change of loss rate and the p b e s t value gradually reduces when the loss rate rises it has the second largest p b e s t value at a low loss rate and has the third largest p b e s t value at a high loss rate which is not stable as li v it keeps the second lowest p w o r s t value which is close to 0 while li v has even lower p w o r s t value by contrast the ki method is not only the most difficult to get the best reconstruction points but also ranks the third on p w o r s t though csi v has the largest p b e s t value it takes the second place of p w o r s t value which also indicates that csi v is not stable the li p method only outperforms ki on p b e s t and has the third lowest p w o r s t the csi p is likely to reconstruct the worst points and performs not so good on p b e s t it turns out that in p b e s t and p w o r s t experiment of position iki and li v have the best and most balanced performances while iki performs better at a low loss rate and li v performs better at a high loss rate however in practice the loss rate is hard to reach so high as for p b e s t and p w o r s t experiment of sog shown in figs 16 and 17 the iki method has a clear advantage over the other three methods having the highest p b e s t value ki ranks second on p b e s t but with the highest p w o r s t proves the conclusion in the previous section while the other two methods having the lowest p b e s t values near zero the iki method sometimes has the worst reconstruction result on sog but the p w o r s t value of it is still very low only higher than the linear interpolation of position method while ki and csi p having the worst reconstruction result on the sog which rank first place and second place on p w o r s t the iki method with its high p b e s t and low p w o r s t value shows accurate reconstruction ability on sog 6 3 limitations and implication of the proposed method with the proposed iki method the kinematic information in ais has been comprehensively used to reach accurate reconstruction results although the performance of the proposed method is good compared with the classic geometry based interpolation methods for the next step of the research several aspects could be furtherly improved which are as follows 1 the adaptivity for the ship behavior in a short time for the current proposed method the acceleration function is adjusted for most of the ship behaviors however for ships with excellent maneuverability their sudden change in the navigation status is difficult to be accurately estimated in the reconstruction process 2 the adaptivity for the ship ais data with low frequency for the low frequency ais data due to various influences the extent of information loss is significant the proposed method may not be able to provide accurate reconstruction results due to such loss in kinematic information for these limitations in the next step of the research the deep learning based approaches are of great promise to be integrated with our method to learn the typical characteristics of the data to provide better results ship trajectory information is one of the fundamental data sources for the research and development in the field of the maritime transportation system e g chen et al 2020a 2021 felski et al 2015 mazaheri et al 2014 qu et al 2011 with the application of the proposed trajectory reconstruction method the accuracy frequency of the ais data can be furtherly improved with consideration of the kinematic information of the ship such improvement could then facilitate the research in various aspects such as the collision risk analysis and monitoring research development of autonomous shipping the identification of ship behavior and simulation and management of the regional maritime transportation system etc in general the proposed method provides a promising tool for ship trajectory based research and development in the future 7 conclusion the missing and abnormal messages in ais are inevitable due to various factors in practices therefore trajectory reconstruction becomes a critical part of improving the ais data quality in this research an iki method is proposed to reconstruct the ais trajectory this method s contribution is that instead of only considering the start point and endpoint of the missing path it also considers forward and backward points near the missing path to revise the kinematic equation and reach accurate reconstruction results to obtain a high quality trajectory set before the reconstructing process an effective trajectory refining process has also been proposed in this paper it uses an iterative abnormal detection and removal process to identify the potential incorrect data meanwhile the analysis of time interval distribution has also been conducted to reveal the ais transmitting environment features and facilitate the trajectory reconstruction process a case study based on several experiments is conducted comprehensively to avoid prejudice in testing the performance of the proposed method in this research the experiments are designed from a single trajectory to the entire ais trajectory set besides the performance of the reconstruction are also validated via comparison between the original trajectory data and corresponding reconstructed trajectory based on randomly damaged data set not only the shape has been compared but also the reconstructed points are taken into consideration the comparisons of rmse p b e s t and p w o r s t comprehensively shows each interpolation method s performance and the result proves that the proposed method has a stronger performance and more practical application value than other methods in the meantime a cross validation procedure between the radar images of the ship navigation and ais data could be introduced to furtherly analyze the performance of the method credit authorship contribution statement shaoqing guo conceptualization

20569,a two dimensional numerical model is employed to predict local scour around submarine pipelines under water waves in shoaling condition the motion of water under waves is simulated by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the wave surface is traced by the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method the evolution of the seabed surface near the pipeline is predicted by solving the conservation of the sediment mass which transport in the water in the forms of bed load and suspended load the main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the seabed slope on the scour profiles and scour depth to achieve this aim numerical simulations of scour around a pipeline on a flat seabed and on a slope seabed with a slope angle of 5 10 and 15 are conducted for various wave conditions the numerical results show that present numerical results of equilibrium scour depth below pipeline agree the values calculated by the suggested formula quite well for β 0 where β is the slope angle as β 0 the equilibrium scour depth agrees with the empirical formula as kc 8 and is greater than the latter for kc 8 keywords local scour pipeline wave 1 introduction submarine pipelines are commonly installed on the seabed to transport crude oil and gas from ocean to the land once the pipelines are installed the flow pattern around the pipelines will change due to the presence of the pipeline these changes cause an increase of the bed shear stress and an increase of turbulence level those two increases subsequently bring an increase in the local sediment transport capacity local scour which is defined as the erosion of seabed sediment around subsea structures will occur local scour is a main factor that affects the stability of subsea pipelines the failure of subsea pipelines will cause not only huge economic loss but also severe marine pollution local scour may occur under the condition of current waves and combined current and waves majority of the studies on the problem of local scour have been under steady current condition including mao 1986 chiew 1990 hensen 1986 li and cheng 1999 2001 cheng and li 2003 lu et al 2005 brørs 1999 sumer and fredsøe 1990 liang et al 2005 and zhao and cheng 2008 under steady current the pressure difference between the downstream side and the upstream side of the pipeline is the main factor leading to onset of local scour the velocity is very large because of amount of water diverted into the small gap between the pipeline and the seabed the large velocity in the gap plays dominant role in the local scour in the early stage at the late stage when the gap between the pipeline and the seabed has been large enough the vortex shedding from the pipeline dominates the scour process many experimental studies have also been carried out to investigate local scour around submarine pipelines under wave condition including bijker and leeuwestein 1984 gokce and gunbak 1991 mao and sumer 1986 and sumer and fredsøe 2001 and so on under the wave condition the pressure gradient necessary for the onset of local scour is available only in quite short period in the crest half period of the wave therefore the critical pressure gradient in wave condition is much larger than that in current condition sumer and fredsøe 1990 conducted an experimental study to study the effects of the keulegan carpenter kc number on the scour depth below pipelines under waves cevik and yuksel 1999 carried out an experimental study to investigate the problem of wave induced local scour under submarine pipeline laid on 1 5 and 1 10 slope seabed the relationship between the maximum equilibrium scour depth and the modified ursell number was proposed when local scour below waves is studied numerically sinusoidal oscillatory flow is generally used to model the fluid motion due to waves liang and cheng 2005 developed an oscillatory flow model to simulate local scour around pipeline in wave condition by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with a k ω turbulence closure the seabed morphology calculation was based on the period averaged sediment transport rate with a morphological time step that was chosen by designating a maximum allowable bed deformation in each update step the numerical results suggested that the scour profile and scour time history obtained from oscillatory flow model agreed well with the available experimental data measured by sumer and fredsøe 1990 fuhrman et al 2014 studied the backfill of sediment into an existing scour pit under a subsea pipeline in oscillatory flows over the range of keulegan carpenter number 5 6 kc 30 the seabed was updated continuously rather than being based on period or other time averaging techniques recently liu et al 2016 established a numerical model to investigate local scour around pipeline under wave condition by considering the effect of the motion of wave free surface the numerical model was based on the two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence closure both suspended load and bed load sediment transportations were considered the moving boundaries of free surface and the evolution of seabed due to local scour were tracked by using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method the streamline upwind petrove galerkin finite element method supg fem was used to discretize the governing equations the numerical results showed that the numerical model can predict scour profile and scour time history very well by comparing with experimental data measured by sumer and fredsøe 1990 the advantage of liu et al 2016 s numerical model is that the influences of the wave nonlinearity and seabed topography can be fully considered additional as the same boundary conditions are adopted for inlet boundary and outlet boundary in oscillatory flow model local scour around pipeline which are installed on uneven seabed can t be simulated but there is no such limitation for liu et al 2016 s numerical model there are also many other researchers studied local scour around pipeline lines tanking ahmad et al 2019 li et al 2020a b brown et al 2016 larsen et al 2016 li et al 2020a 2020b and sumer and fredsøe 1996 for example this study extends the investigation of liu et al 2016 which is mainly focused on a flat seabed to the scour around a pipeline in shoaling zones the organization of rest of this paper is as follows the details of the numerical model will be described in section 2 the numerical results of local scour in waves on flat and slope seabed will be presented in section 3 finally conclusions will be drawn in section 4 2 numerical model 2 1 flow model and boundary conditions the numerical model used to simulate the local scour around subsea pipelines is the same as the one used by liu et al 2016 the fluid motion under waves is simulated by solving the two dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans by using the petrov galerkin finite element method pgfem to consider the effect of moving wave surface and seabed surface the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method is adopted when solving the rans equations accordingly the rans equations can be written as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u j m u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 υ s i j u i u j g i where x 1 x x 2 y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively u i is the fluid velocity in the x i direction u j m is the velocity of moving grid in the x j direction t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid g i g 1 0 g 2 g denotes the gravitational acceleration and s ij is the mean strain rate tensor with s ij u i x j u j x i 2 the reynolds stress term in eq 2 can be written as u i u j υ t u i x j u j x i 2 k δ i j 3 where υ t is the turbulent eddy viscosity k the turbulence kinetic energy and δ ij is the kronecker operator the shear stress transport sst k ω two equation turbulence model is adopted to close the rans equations the detail of the sst k ω model can be found in menter 1994 and will not be repeated here the boundary conditions should be specified for solving the flow equations on the inlet boundary the fluid velocity and the wave elevation are imposed according to the linear wave theory and the gradient of the pressure gradient in the horizontal direction is zero the boundary conditions for the turbulent energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω on the inlet boundary are k 0 005 u 2 and ω 0 16 k 0 5 0 2 β h 1 respectively where u is the magnitude of the fluid velocity and the model constant β 0 09 the wave surface is updated by solving the following boundary condition equation 3 η t u 1 u 1 m η x u 2 where η is the elevation of the wave surface on the wave surface the pressure on the wave surface is zero and the gradients of the velocity and turbulent quantities in the vertical direction are zero on the seabed the evolution of the seabed surface is predicted using the conservation equation of the sediment mass 4 y b t 1 1 λ s x q s q b where yb is the seabed level λs 0 4 is the porosity of the sediment qs and qb are the bed load and suspended load sediment transport rates respectively which will be calculated in the next sub section on the seabed a wall function is used for the velocity in the wall function method the bottom layer of the finite element mesh nodes is some distance away from the seabed and the velocity between the seabed and the mesh is assumed to following logarithmic profile the gap between the bottom layer mesh nodes and the bed is chosen to be 2d50 in this study where d50 is the median sand particle size the boundary conditions k and ω are k u τ 2 c μ 1 2 and ω u τ c μ 1 2 κδ1 respectively where u τ is the friction velocity the coefficient c μ 0 09 κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and δ1 is the distance between the bottom layer mesh nodes and the seabed level a spongy layer proposed by zhao et al 2004 is employed in front of the outlet boundary to absorb the wave energy when the waves arrive at the outlet boundary their energy has almost dissipated to zero by the spongy layer so even the fully reflective boundary condition is used at the outlet boundary there will be no reflected waves back to the computational domain affecting the results the reflected waves from the outlet boundary back to the computational domain will be absorbed again by the spongy layer on the pipeline surface non slip boundary condition u 0 v 0 and p n 0 liu et al 2014 is imposed and boundary conditions for k and ω are k 0 and ω 6v 0 075δ1 2 respectively no sediment can go into or go out from the pipeline surface 2 2 sediment transportation model both bed load and suspended load sediment transports are considered in this numerical model the bed load transport rate is calculated by using the formula proposed by van rijn 1987 5 q b 0 053 s 1 g 0 5 d 50 1 5 t r 2 1 d s 0 3 t r 0

order to consider the effect of local slope of the scour hole the threshold shields parameter on a flatbed is modified to be θ cr θ cr0 cosα sinα tanφ where α is the angle of slope with respect to the

numerical set up for local scour around pipeline on a seabed with a slope seabed inviscid loose sand is considered in this study the pipeline is placed in the middle of the slope bed the local water depth at the position of the pipeline center is kept as a constant of 1 025 m the water depths at the inlet and outlet boundaries are defined as h 1 and h 2 respectively the diameter of the pipeline is d and the angle of the slope is defined as β the scour depth is the distance is defined as s the parameters used in this study are shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the computational meshes around pipeline 160 meshes were divided along the pipeline the meshes near pipeline and seabed were very dense while the meshes far away the pipeline were sparse this can both meet the demand of accuracy and efficiency by using intel core i7 9700k processor about 20 30 days are needed for one single test to reach equilibrium state mesh depending are caried out by dividing 120 160 and 200 grids around the pipeline under kc 11 98 and β 15 table 2 gives the details of the results 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 velocity in the location of the pipeline center to obtain undisturbed oscillatory velocity under waves wave propagation over a slope without pipeline is firstly simulated for every case the kc number under waves is defined as kc u h t d where u h is the undisturbed maximum flow velocity along the slope at the level of the pipeline center simulations of wave propagation over a slope bed for all the parameters listed in table 1 are performed and the kc numbers for all the cases are calculated then computational mesh with a pipeline at the center of the slope is used to simulate scour below a pipeline fig 3 shows the time histories of the velocity component along the slope bed u h under the same inlet wave height and period h 0 2m t 2 2s and different slope angles the positive direction of u h points upslope when simulating the cases with β 0 a computational domain with a flat seabed and a constant water depth of h is used instead of using the one shown in fig 1 the magnitude of the maximum negative velocity is slightly greater than the maximum positive velocity indicating the nonlinearity of the waves is not strong it can be seen from fig 3 that in spite of different slope angles the kc number at the center of the pipeline almost the same if the inlet wave parameters are the same if the bed slope is gentle after the waves with h 0 2m t 2 2s propagate from 2 425 m β 15 water depth to 1 025 m water depth where the pipeline is located the maximum fluid velocity in the direction of wave propagation at 0 025 m above the seabed is 0 215 m s based on the linear wave theory which is close to the ones calculated from the numerical simulations shown in fig 3 d this also can indict that present numerical model is reliable 3 2 scour time history and vorticity of the pipeline the range of kc number in the present study is from 3 0 to 20 fig 4 shows the scour profile around pipeline at different time instants with β 5 and kc 1 48 which is very small it can be seen that the scour profile around pipeline under very small kc number changes little from t 100s to t 1000s by comparing fig 4 a and b it is believed that the effect of lee wake of the pipe is the key element in the scour process which can be seen from sumer and fredsøe 1990 fig 5 gives the vorticity contour around the pipeline by comparing fig 5 a and b it can be seen that although separation can be found no vorticity sheds from the pipeline for very small kc number sarpkaya 1986 considered that the onset of separation can occur when 1 5 kc 3 0 and observation of vortices does necessarily mean that vortices are convected away from the vicinity of the body i e that vorticity shedding occurs but zhang and zhang 1997 found that separation can occur even for kc 0 2 williamson 1985 report that vortex shedding can be found for kc 4 0 while sumer and fredsøe 1990 considered that no vortex shedding occurs when kc 5 0 anyway it can be drawn that separation can be found at low kc number but no vortex shedding occurs for the present problem i e local scour around pipeline under wave condition very low kc number means no vortex shedding and no vortex shedding leads to no lee wake erosion around the pipeline fig 6 a d show the scour profile around pipeline with β 5 and kc 7 38 at instant t 100s t 500s t 1000s and t 3000s respectively by comparing fig 6 a d it can be seen that the scour depth below the pipeline increases with time and the scour scope also increases with time fig 7 a d show the vorticity contour around pipeline with β 5 and kc 7 38 at instant t 100s t 500s t 1000s and t 3000s respectively from the discussion above it can be seen that vortex shedding will occur when kc 4 0 or 5 0 for the present case kc 7 38 vortex shedding is found around the pipeline which can be seen from fig 7 this is different from low kc kc 1 48 for t 100 s a small positive vorticity is found shed from the right side of the pipeline which can be seen from fig 7 a the reason for the vorticity is not as big as that in fig 7 b d is that 1 the wave just propagates over the pipeline and the vorticity is not fully developed 2 the gap between the pipeline and the seabed is very small and the wall boundary also affect the develop of the vorticity with the development of the local scour form fig 7 a b the scour hole become gentler and the flow velocities below the pipe will increase because of the flow region below the pipe is less protected against the outer flow the increase of velocity below pipeline will lead to more scour below the pipe the gap between the pipeline and the seabed is getting larger and larger and the wave has propagated over 100 wave period from fig 7 a b those two reasons make the vorticity around pipeline much more fully developed in fig 7 b than in fig 7 a an obvious vortex street is from in both side of the pipeline when the vorticity is fully developed the vortex street makes the scour hole much gentler and the scour scope larger fig 8 a d show the scour profile around pipeline with β 5 and kc 14 47 at instant t 100s t 500s t 1000s and t 3000s respectively by comparing fig 8 a d it can be seen that the scour depth below the pipeline increases with time and the scour scope also increases with time which is the same with that of kc 7 38 fig 8 a show that the scour hole is small and almost symmetric the scour hole is deeper and the scour scope is larger for t 500s compared with t 100s two shoulders deposit parts are found at the two sides of the pipeline which can be seen in fig 8 b and the shoulder at the downslope of the pipeline is larger than that at the upslope of the pipeline this illustrates that sands deposit more at the downslope of the pipeline than that at the upslope of the pipeline this is because that gravity has a downward component along the slope which will result in the sediment moving more readily in the downward direction along the slope under the same flow conditions as can be seen at fig 3 that the velocity that parallel to the slope bed is almost symmetric this means that the velocity of flow that goes upslope is almost the same with that goes downslope the only difference is the contribution of gravity there is always a constituent part of gravity point to the downslope fig 8 c shows that the scour depth is getting deeper compared with fig 8 b and the shoulder at the downslope side of the pipeline getting larger and the shoulder at the upslope side of the pipeline getting smaller and the shoulder at the upslope side of the pipeline is lower than the original seabed level fig 9 a d show the vorticity contour around pipeline with β 5 and kc 14 47 it can be seen that vortex shedding is found in the upslope side of the pipeline in fig 9 a and the length of the vorticity is longer than that in figs 7 a and fig 5 a which is because the kc number is getting larger by comparing fig 9 a b and c it can be seen that the length of vorticity is also getting longer with time this is because the vorticity is developing more fully with time when the scour depth around pipeline is large enough the suppression of the seabed to the vorticity is reduced the vorticity length is shorter which is shown in fig 9 d this change makes the singular point at about t 1500s fig 10 gives the scour time history of the point below the pipeline the scour depth below the pipeline almost the same from t 0s 5000s for kc 1 48 this illustrate that no erosion occurs under very small condition for kc 7 38 it can clear see that the scour depth at the point below the pipeline increases with time which is different from low kc number and the equilibrium scour depth is about 0 25 times of the diameter of the pipeline and the scour depth almost keeps as a constant after 3000s for kc 14 47 it can clear see that the scour depth at the point below the pipeline increases with time it can be seen that the scour depth increases quickly at the first 400s and then the scour speed is low until about t 1500s after about t 1500s local scour develops with another larger speed until about t 2000 then the scour depth changes little with time which means that the scour depth arrives its equilibrium depth 3 3 equilibrium scour depth fig 11 shows the equilibrium scour profile around the pipeline under slope angles of β 0 5 10 and 15 for the slope angle of β 0 the scour profiles are nearly symmetric with respect to the pipeline position at small kc numbers in the cases of small kc numbers the wave height is small and the waves are nearly linear leading to symmetric oscillatory flow velocity and symmetric scour profile the erosion and deposition of the sediment only occurs in the vicinity of the pipeline at small kc numbers and the disturbed seabed area increases with increasing kc number far away from the pipeline the seabed is nearly flat the scour hole becomes slightly asymmetric when kc number increases because the nonlinearity of the waves increases when the seabed is flat β 0 the net sediment transport is nearly zero if there is not a pipeline if a pipeline exists scour only occurs near the pipeline the eroded sand beneath the pipeline piles up directly at the two sides of the pipeline instead of being convective far from the pipeline for the uneven seabed cases the deposition and scour occur on the downslope and upslope sides of the cylinder respectively because of the slope the critical shields parameter in the downslope direction is much smaller than that on a flatbed this makes the scour live bed scour in majority cases for β 5 10 and 15 on a slope seabed the sediment transport rate when the flow is in the downslope direction is greater than that when the flow is in the upslope direction the asymmetry of the sediment transport results in a net sediment transport rate in the downslope direction because of the downslope net sediment transport rate a deposition area is developed on the downslope side of the pipeline it can be seen in fig 4 b c and d that the left boundary of the scour hole extends towards the downslope direction with increasing kc number the scour area and scour depth on the upslope side of the pipeline also increases with increasing kc number similar to the cases of β 0 the extent of the scour area below the pipeline increases with increasing kc number fig 12 shows the equilibrium scour profile around the pipeline under slope angles of β 15 it can be seen that the position of the intersection of the scour profile with the original seabed in front of the pipeline becomes more distant as the period increases additionally it seems that the distance x increases linearly with increasing of the wave period the line slope varies with wave height to illustrate the phenomenon that this distance becomes larger with increasing of wave period the dependence of scour width in front of the pipeline x on wave period under different wave high is given in fig 13 it can be seen clearly that x increase linearly with wave period in present investigation scope with r2 0 95 fig 14 shows the variation of the equilibrium scour depth below the pipeline with the kc number the data calculated from different wave periods are presented using different symbols the equilibrium scour depth s is defined as the vertical depth of the scour depth at the center of the pipeline as shown in fig 1 sumer and fredsøe 2002 presented an empirical formula for predicting scour in waves on a flat seabed for 2 kc 1000 and re 1 4 103 1 3 104 11 s d 0 1 k c 0 5 the numerical results of the equilibrium scour depth are compared with the empirical formula eq 11 in fig 14 it can be seen that the predicted scour depth generally agrees with eq 11 when β 0 for smaller kc numbers kc 8 the simulated scour depth is slightly smaller than that calculated using eq 11 when β 0 the calculated scour depth agrees with eq 11 for about kc 8 as kc 8 the numerical results of the scour depth are greater than those calculated using eq 11 and the difference between the numerical and empirical formula results increases with increasing kc number the main reason of the difference is that there is a net sediment transport in the downslope direction on a sloped seabed making the scour process have some similarity with the scour under steady current or combined wave current conditions the dependence of equilibrium scour depth on the kc number for 5 β 15 and 2 kc 30 is shown in fig 15 it can be seen that s d 0 058kc0 76 can fit the data very well with r2 0 9551 4 conclusion a two dimensional numerical model base on navier stokes equations is developed to investigate local scour a pipeline on a slope seabed under wave condition the motions of free surface and the changes in the seabed due to sediment movement are traced by using ale method both the bedload and suspended load are considered when simulate the motion of the sediment though it can not consider the breaking wave this numerical model can be used to study local scour around pipeline on a slope seabed then local scour around a subsea pipeline in shoaling conditions is simulated numerically the simulations are conducted for slope angle β 0 5 10 and 15 and kc numbers in the range of 2 5 25 for a bed slope angle of β 0 the scour profiles are symmetric with respect to the pipeline position when kc number is small and becomes slightly asymmetric as the kc number is large mainly due the nonlinearity of the waves as β 0 deposition was found on the downslope side and erosion was found on the upslope side of the pipeline the extent of the scour pit increases with increasing kc number for all the cases present numerical results of equilibrium scour depth below pipeline agree the values calculated by the formula suggested by sumer and fredsøe 2002 quite well for β 0 as β 0 the equilibrium scour depth agrees with the empirical formula as kc 8 and is greater than the latter for kc 8 a fitting formula s d 0 058kc0 76 is given for 5 β 15 and 2 kc 30 based on the data obtained from present study credit authorship contribution

20569,a two dimensional numerical model is employed to predict local scour around submarine pipelines under water waves in shoaling condition the motion of water under waves is simulated by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the wave surface is traced by the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method the evolution of the seabed surface near the pipeline is predicted by solving the conservation of the sediment mass which transport in the water in the forms of bed load and suspended load the main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the seabed slope on the scour profiles and scour depth to achieve this aim numerical simulations of scour around a pipeline on a flat seabed and on a slope seabed with a slope angle of 5 10 and 15 are conducted for various wave conditions the numerical results show that present numerical results of equilibrium scour depth below pipeline agree the values calculated by the suggested formula quite well for β 0 where β is the slope angle as β 0 the equilibrium scour depth agrees with the empirical formula as kc 8 and is greater than the latter for kc 8 keywords local scour pipeline wave 1 introduction submarine pipelines are commonly installed on the seabed to transport crude oil and gas from ocean to the land once the pipelines are installed the flow pattern around the pipelines will change due to the presence of the pipeline these changes cause an increase of the bed shear stress and an increase of turbulence level those two increases subsequently bring an increase in the local sediment transport capacity local scour which is defined as the erosion of seabed sediment around subsea structures will occur local scour is a main factor that affects the stability of subsea pipelines the failure of subsea pipelines will cause not only huge economic loss but also severe marine pollution local scour may occur under the condition of current waves and combined current and waves majority of the studies on the problem of local scour have been under steady current condition including mao 1986 chiew 1990 hensen 1986 li and cheng 1999 2001 cheng and li 2003 lu et al 2005 brørs 1999 sumer and fredsøe 1990 liang et al 2005 and zhao and cheng 2008 under steady current the pressure difference between the downstream side and the upstream side of the pipeline is the main factor leading to onset of local scour the velocity is very large because of amount of water diverted into the small gap between the pipeline and the seabed the large velocity in the gap plays dominant role in the local scour in the early stage at the late stage when the gap between the pipeline and the seabed has been large enough the vortex shedding from the pipeline dominates the scour process many experimental studies have also been carried out to investigate local scour around submarine pipelines under wave condition including bijker and leeuwestein 1984 gokce and gunbak 1991 mao and sumer 1986 and sumer and fredsøe 2001 and so on under the wave condition the pressure gradient necessary for the onset of local scour is available only in quite short period in the crest half period of the wave therefore the critical pressure gradient in wave condition is much larger than that in current condition sumer and fredsøe 1990 conducted an experimental study to study the effects of the keulegan carpenter kc number on the scour depth below pipelines under waves cevik and yuksel 1999 carried out an experimental study to investigate the problem of wave induced local scour under submarine pipeline laid on 1 5 and 1 10 slope seabed the relationship between the maximum equilibrium scour depth and the modified ursell number was proposed when local scour below waves is studied numerically sinusoidal oscillatory flow is generally used to model the fluid motion due to waves liang and cheng 2005 developed an oscillatory flow model to simulate local scour around pipeline in wave condition by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with a k ω turbulence closure the seabed morphology calculation was based on the period averaged sediment transport rate with a morphological time step that was chosen by designating a maximum allowable bed deformation in each update step the numerical results suggested that the scour profile and scour time history obtained from oscillatory flow model agreed well with the available experimental data measured by sumer and fredsøe 1990 fuhrman et al 2014 studied the backfill of sediment into an existing scour pit under a subsea pipeline in oscillatory flows over the range of keulegan carpenter number 5 6 kc 30 the seabed was updated continuously rather than being based on period or other time averaging techniques recently liu et al 2016 established a numerical model to investigate local scour around pipeline under wave condition by considering the effect of the motion of wave free surface the numerical model was based on the two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence closure both suspended load and bed load sediment transportations were considered the moving boundaries of free surface and the evolution of seabed due to local scour were tracked by using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method the streamline upwind petrove galerkin finite element method supg fem was used to discretize the governing equations the numerical results showed that the numerical model can predict scour profile and scour time history very well by comparing with experimental data measured by sumer and fredsøe 1990 the advantage of liu et al 2016 s numerical model is that the influences of the wave nonlinearity and seabed topography can be fully considered additional as the same boundary conditions are adopted for inlet boundary and outlet boundary in oscillatory flow model local scour around pipeline which are installed on uneven seabed can t be simulated but there is no such limitation for liu et al 2016 s numerical model there are also many other researchers studied local scour around pipeline lines tanking ahmad et al 2019 li et al 2020a b brown et al 2016 larsen et al 2016 li et al 2020a 2020b and sumer and fredsøe 1996 for example this study extends the investigation of liu et al 2016 which is mainly focused on a flat seabed to the scour around a pipeline in shoaling zones the organization of rest of this paper is as follows the details of the numerical model will be described in section 2 the numerical results of local scour in waves on flat and slope seabed will be presented in section 3 finally conclusions will be drawn in section 4 2 numerical model 2 1 flow model and boundary conditions the numerical model used to simulate the local scour around subsea pipelines is the same as the one used by liu et al 2016 the fluid motion under waves is simulated by solving the two dimensional incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans by using the petrov galerkin finite element method pgfem to consider the effect of moving wave surface and seabed surface the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian method is adopted when solving the rans equations accordingly the rans equations can be written as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u j m u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 υ s i j u i u j g i where x 1 x x 2 y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively u i is the fluid velocity in the x i direction u j m is the velocity of moving grid in the x j direction t is the time p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid g i g 1 0 g 2 g denotes the gravitational acceleration and s ij is the mean strain rate tensor with s ij u i x j u j x i 2 the reynolds stress term in eq 2 can be written as u i u j υ t u i x j u j x i 2 k δ i j 3 where υ t is the turbulent eddy viscosity k the turbulence kinetic energy and δ ij is the kronecker operator the shear stress transport sst k ω two equation turbulence model is adopted to close the rans equations the detail of the sst k ω model can be found in menter 1994 and will not be repeated here the boundary conditions should be specified for solving the flow equations on the inlet boundary the fluid velocity and the wave elevation are imposed according to the linear wave theory and the gradient of the pressure gradient in the horizontal direction is zero the boundary conditions for the turbulent energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω on the inlet boundary are k 0 005 u 2 and ω 0 16 k 0 5 0 2 β h 1 respectively where u is the magnitude of the fluid velocity and the model constant β 0 09 the wave surface is updated by solving the following boundary condition equation 3 η t u 1 u 1 m η x u 2 where η is the elevation of the wave surface on the wave surface the pressure on the wave surface is zero and the gradients of the velocity and turbulent quantities in the vertical direction are zero on the seabed the evolution of the seabed surface is predicted using the conservation equation of the sediment mass 4 y b t 1 1 λ s x q s q b where yb is the seabed level λs 0 4 is the porosity of the sediment qs and qb are the bed load and suspended load sediment transport rates respectively which will be calculated in the next sub section on the seabed a wall function is used for the velocity in the wall function method the bottom layer of the finite element mesh nodes is some distance away from the seabed and the velocity between the seabed and the mesh is assumed to following logarithmic profile the gap between the bottom layer mesh nodes and the bed is chosen to be 2d50 in this study where d50 is the median sand particle size the boundary conditions k and ω are k u τ 2 c μ 1 2 and ω u τ c μ 1 2 κδ1 respectively where u τ is the friction velocity the coefficient c μ 0 09 κ 0 41 is the von karman constant and δ1 is the distance between the bottom layer mesh nodes and the seabed level a spongy layer proposed by zhao et al 2004 is employed in front of the outlet boundary to absorb the wave energy when the waves arrive at the outlet boundary their energy has almost dissipated to zero by the spongy layer so even the fully reflective boundary condition is used at the outlet boundary there will be no reflected waves back to the computational domain affecting the results the reflected waves from the outlet boundary back to the computational domain will be absorbed again by the spongy layer on the pipeline surface non slip boundary condition u 0 v 0 and p n 0 liu et al 2014 is imposed and boundary conditions for k and ω are k 0 and ω 6v 0 075δ1 2 respectively no sediment can go into or go out from the pipeline surface 2 2 sediment transportation model both bed load and suspended load sediment transports are considered in this numerical model the bed load transport rate is calculated by using the formula proposed by van rijn 1987 5 q b 0 053 s 1 g 0 5 d 50 1 5 t r 2 1 d s 0 3 t r 0 0 t r 0 where t r θ θ cr θ cr with θ the shields parameter defined as θ τ gd 50 ρ s ρ with ρ s the density of sediment grains and τ the bed shear stress and θ cr is the critical shields parameter in order to consider the effect of local slope of the scour hole the threshold shields parameter on a flatbed is modified to be θ cr θ cr0 cosα sinα tanφ where α is the angle of slope with respect to the horizontal plane φ is the angle of repose of the sediment and θ cr0 0 3 1 1 2d s 0 55 1 0 e 0 02ds is the critical shields parameter on a flat seabed soulsby and whitehouse 1997 where d s is the dimensionless grain size the suspended load transport rate q s is calculated by integrating the sediment flux over the water depth i e 6 q s y b y a y s c u d y where c is the volume concentration of the suspended sediment y s is the free surface level y b is the seabed level y a is a reference level of the interface between the bed load layer and suspended sediment domain in this work y a 2 0d 50 is adopted the suspended sediment concentration is calculated by solving the convection diffusion equation 7 c t u j u j m w s j c x j x j υ t σ c c x j where the parameter σ c 1 0 w sj is the settling velocity of the suspended sediment with w s1 0 and w s2 w s0 1 c 5 0 the settling velocity of a single particle 8 w s 0 υ d 50 10 36 2 1 049 d s 3 1 2 10 36 the boundary condition for eq 8 is c c a is given at a reference height y a above the sea where the reference centration c a is calculated according to zyserman and fredsøe 1994 9 c a 0 331 θ 0 045 1 75 1 0 720 θ 0 045 1 75 c a is zero if the seabed shields parameter is less than 0 045 because the distance between the bottom layer mesh nodes and the seabed δ1 is set to be δ1 y a 2 0d 50 when wall function is employed the sediment concentration at the bottom layer of nodes can be conveniently specified to save computational time the standard wall function is used on the seabed the mesh nodes of the first layer of are located at a distance δ1 away from the seabed where the logarithmic wall function is applied 10 u b u τ κ ln δ 1 δ b where u τ is the friction velocity κ 0 41 is the karman constant δ b is the bed roughness with δ b d 50 12 the shear stress τ can be obtained from τ ρu τ 2 for more details of present numerical model validation see please liu et al 2016 2 3 computational parameters fig 1 shows a sketch of numerical set up for local scour around pipeline on a seabed with a slope seabed inviscid loose sand is considered in this study the pipeline is placed in the middle of the slope bed the local water depth at the position of the pipeline center is kept as a constant of 1 025 m the water depths at the inlet and outlet boundaries are defined as h 1 and h 2 respectively the diameter of the pipeline is d and the angle of the slope is defined as β the scour depth is the distance is defined as s the parameters used in this study are shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the computational meshes around pipeline 160 meshes were divided along the pipeline the meshes near pipeline and seabed were very dense while the meshes far away the pipeline were sparse this can both meet the demand of accuracy and efficiency by using intel core i7 9700k processor about 20 30 days are needed for one single test to reach equilibrium state mesh depending are caried out by dividing 120 160 and 200 grids around the pipeline under kc 11 98 and β 15 table 2 gives the details of the results 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 velocity in the location of the pipeline center to obtain undisturbed oscillatory velocity under waves wave propagation over a slope without pipeline is firstly simulated for every case the kc number under waves is defined as kc u h t d where u h is the undisturbed maximum flow velocity along the slope at the level of the pipeline center simulations of wave propagation over a slope bed for all the parameters listed in table 1 are performed and the kc numbers for all the cases are calculated then computational mesh with a pipeline at the center of the slope is used to simulate scour below a pipeline fig 3 shows the time histories of the velocity component along the slope bed u h under the same inlet wave height and period h 0 2m t 2 2s and different slope angles the positive direction of u h points upslope when simulating the cases with β 0 a computational domain with a flat seabed and a constant water depth of h is used instead of using the one shown in fig 1 the magnitude of the maximum negative velocity is slightly greater than the maximum positive velocity indicating the nonlinearity of the waves is not strong it can be seen from fig 3 that in spite of different slope angles the kc number at the center of the pipeline almost the same if the inlet wave parameters are the same if the bed slope is gentle after the waves with h 0 2m t 2 2s propagate from 2 425 m β 15 water depth to 1 025 m water depth where the pipeline is located the maximum fluid velocity in the direction of wave propagation at 0 025 m above the seabed is 0 215 m s based on the linear wave theory which is close to the ones calculated from the numerical simulations shown in fig 3 d this also can indict that present numerical model is reliable 3 2 scour time history and vorticity of the pipeline the range of kc number in the present study is from 3 0 to 20 fig 4 shows the scour profile around pipeline at different time instants with β 5 and kc 1 48 which is very small it can be seen that the scour profile around pipeline under very small kc number changes little from t 100s to t 1000s by comparing fig 4 a and b it is believed that the effect of lee wake of the pipe is the key element in the scour process which can be seen from sumer and fredsøe 1990 fig 5 gives the vorticity contour around the pipeline by comparing fig 5 a and b it can be seen that although separation can be found no vorticity sheds from the pipeline for very small kc number sarpkaya 1986 considered that the onset of separation can occur when 1 5 kc 3 0 and observation of vortices does necessarily mean that vortices are convected away from the vicinity of the body i e that vorticity shedding occurs but zhang and zhang 1997 found that separation can occur even for kc 0 2 williamson 1985 report that vortex shedding can be found for kc 4 0 while sumer and fredsøe 1990 considered that no vortex shedding occurs when kc 5 0 anyway it can be drawn that separation can be found at low kc number but no vortex shedding occurs for the present problem i e local scour around pipeline under wave condition very low kc number means no vortex shedding and no vortex shedding leads to no lee wake erosion around the pipeline fig 6 a d show the scour profile around pipeline with β 5 and kc 7 38 at instant t 100s t 500s t 1000s and t 3000s respectively by comparing fig 6 a d it can be seen that the scour depth below the pipeline increases with time and the scour scope also increases with time fig 7 a d show the vorticity contour around pipeline with β 5 and kc 7 38 at instant t 100s t 500s t 1000s and t 3000s respectively from the discussion above it can be seen that vortex shedding will occur when kc 4 0 or 5 0 for the present case kc 7 38 vortex shedding is found around the pipeline which can be seen from fig 7 this is different from low kc kc 1 48 for t 100 s a small positive vorticity is found shed from the right side of the pipeline which can be seen from fig 7 a the reason for the vorticity is not as big as that in fig 7 b d is that 1 the wave just propagates over the pipeline and the vorticity is not fully developed 2 the gap between the pipeline and the seabed is very small and the wall boundary also affect the develop of the vorticity with the development of the local scour form fig 7 a b the scour hole become gentler and the flow velocities below the pipe will increase because of the flow region below the pipe is less protected against the outer flow the increase of velocity below pipeline will lead to more scour below the pipe the gap between the pipeline and the seabed is getting larger and larger and the wave has propagated over 100 wave period from fig 7 a b those two reasons make the vorticity around pipeline much more fully developed in fig 7 b than in fig 7 a an obvious vortex street is from in both side of the pipeline when the vorticity is fully developed the vortex street makes the scour hole much gentler and the scour scope larger fig 8 a d show the scour profile around pipeline with β 5 and kc 14 47 at instant t 100s t 500s t 1000s and t 3000s respectively by comparing fig 8 a d it can be seen that the scour depth below the pipeline increases with time and the scour scope also increases with time which is the same with that of kc 7 38 fig 8 a show that the scour hole is small and almost symmetric the scour hole is deeper and the scour scope is larger for t 500s compared with t 100s two shoulders deposit parts are found at the two sides of the pipeline which can be seen in fig 8 b and the shoulder at the downslope of the pipeline is larger than that at the upslope of the pipeline this illustrates that sands deposit more at the downslope of the pipeline than that at the upslope of the pipeline this is because that gravity has a downward component along the slope which will result in the sediment moving more readily in the downward direction along the slope under the same flow conditions as can be seen at fig 3 that the velocity that parallel to the slope bed is almost symmetric this means that the velocity of flow that goes upslope is almost the same with that goes downslope the only difference is the contribution of gravity there is always a constituent part of gravity point to the downslope fig 8 c shows that the scour depth is getting deeper compared with fig 8 b and the shoulder at the downslope side of the pipeline getting larger and the shoulder at the upslope side of the pipeline getting smaller and the shoulder at the upslope side of the pipeline is lower than the original seabed level fig 9 a d show the vorticity contour around pipeline with β 5 and kc 14 47 it can be seen that vortex shedding is found in the upslope side of the pipeline in fig 9 a and the length of the vorticity is longer than that in figs 7 a and fig 5 a which is because the kc number is getting larger by comparing fig 9 a b and c it can be seen that the length of vorticity is also getting longer with time this is because the vorticity is developing more fully with time when the scour depth around pipeline is large enough the suppression of the seabed to the vorticity is reduced the vorticity length is shorter which is shown in fig 9 d this change makes the singular point at about t 1500s fig 10 gives the scour time history of the point below the pipeline the scour depth below the pipeline almost the same from t 0s 5000s for kc 1 48 this illustrate that no erosion occurs under very small condition for kc 7 38 it can clear see that the scour depth at the point below the pipeline increases with time which is different from low kc number and the equilibrium scour depth is about 0 25 times of the diameter of the pipeline and the scour depth almost keeps as a constant after 3000s for kc 14 47 it can clear see that the scour depth at the point below the pipeline increases with time it can be seen that the scour depth increases quickly at the first 400s and then the scour speed is low until about t 1500s after about t 1500s local scour develops with another larger speed until about t 2000 then the scour depth changes little with time which means that the scour depth arrives its equilibrium depth 3 3 equilibrium scour depth fig 11 shows the equilibrium scour profile around the pipeline under slope angles of β 0 5 10 and 15 for the slope angle of β 0 the scour profiles are nearly symmetric with respect to the pipeline position at small kc numbers in the cases of small kc numbers the wave height is small and the waves are nearly linear leading to symmetric oscillatory flow velocity and symmetric scour profile the erosion and deposition of the sediment only occurs in the vicinity of the pipeline at small kc numbers and the disturbed seabed area increases with increasing kc number far away from the pipeline the seabed is nearly flat the scour hole becomes slightly asymmetric when kc number increases because the nonlinearity of the waves increases when the seabed is flat β 0 the net sediment transport is nearly zero if there is not a pipeline if a pipeline exists scour only occurs near the pipeline the eroded sand beneath the pipeline piles up directly at the two sides of the pipeline instead of being convective far from the pipeline for the uneven seabed cases the deposition and scour occur on the downslope and upslope sides of the cylinder respectively because of the slope the critical shields parameter in the downslope direction is much smaller than that on a flatbed this makes the scour live bed scour in majority cases for β 5 10 and 15 on a slope seabed the sediment transport rate when the flow is in the downslope direction is greater than that when the flow is in the upslope direction the asymmetry of the sediment transport results in a net sediment transport rate in the downslope direction because of the downslope net sediment transport rate a deposition area is developed on the downslope side of the pipeline it can be seen in fig 4 b c and d that the left boundary of the scour hole extends towards the downslope direction with increasing kc number the scour area and scour depth on the upslope side of the pipeline also increases with increasing kc number similar to the cases of β 0 the extent of the scour area below the pipeline increases with increasing kc number fig 12 shows the equilibrium scour profile around the pipeline under slope angles of β 15 it can be seen that the position of the intersection of the scour profile with the original seabed in front of the pipeline becomes more distant as the period increases additionally it seems that the distance x increases linearly with increasing of the wave period the line slope varies with wave height to illustrate the phenomenon that this distance becomes larger with increasing of wave period the dependence of scour width in front of the pipeline x on wave period under different wave high is given in fig 13 it can be seen clearly that x increase linearly with wave period in present investigation scope with r2 0 95 fig 14 shows the variation of the equilibrium scour depth below the pipeline with the kc number the data calculated from different wave periods are presented using different symbols the equilibrium scour depth s is defined as the vertical depth of the scour depth at the center of the pipeline as shown in fig 1 sumer and fredsøe 2002 presented an empirical formula for predicting scour in waves on a flat seabed for 2 kc 1000 and re 1 4 103 1 3 104 11 s d 0 1 k c 0 5 the numerical results of the equilibrium scour depth are compared with the empirical formula eq 11 in fig 14 it can be seen that the predicted scour depth generally agrees with eq 11 when β 0 for smaller kc numbers kc 8 the simulated scour depth is slightly smaller than that calculated using eq 11 when β 0 the calculated scour depth agrees with eq 11 for about kc 8 as kc 8 the numerical results of the scour depth are greater than those calculated using eq 11 and the difference between the numerical and empirical formula results increases with increasing kc number the main reason of the difference is that there is a net sediment transport in the downslope direction on a sloped seabed making the scour process have some similarity with the scour under steady current or combined wave current conditions the dependence of equilibrium scour depth on the kc number for 5 β 15 and 2 kc 30 is shown in fig 15 it can be seen that s d 0 058kc0 76 can fit the data very well with r2 0 9551 4 conclusion a two dimensional numerical model base on navier stokes equations is developed to investigate local scour a pipeline on a slope seabed under wave condition the motions of free surface and the changes in the seabed due to sediment movement are traced by using ale method both the bedload and suspended load are considered when simulate the motion of the sediment though it can not consider the breaking wave this numerical model can be used to study local scour around pipeline on a slope seabed then local scour around a subsea pipeline in shoaling conditions is simulated numerically the simulations are conducted for slope angle β 0 5 10 and 15 and kc numbers in the range of 2 5 25 for a bed slope angle of β 0 the scour profiles are symmetric with respect to the pipeline position when kc number is small and becomes slightly asymmetric as the kc number is large mainly due the nonlinearity of the waves as β 0 deposition was found on the downslope side and erosion was found on the upslope side of the pipeline the extent of the scour pit increases with increasing kc number for all the cases present numerical results of equilibrium scour depth below pipeline agree the values calculated by the formula suggested by sumer and fredsøe 2002 quite well for β 0 as β 0 the equilibrium scour depth agrees with the empirical formula as kc 8 and is greater than the latter for kc 8 a fitting formula s d 0 058kc0 76 is given for 5 β 15 and 2 kc 30 based on the data obtained from present study credit authorship contribution
