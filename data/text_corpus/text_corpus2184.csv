10920,it is necessary to quantify the hydrothermal processes by develop a water heat coupling model in rice fields where the transfer between water and energy is dramatically violent under the circumstance that water saving irrigation wsi was widely used in rice paddy due to the increasing water scarcity based on the theory of energy and water balance considering the interaction of impedance near the ground a simplified holistic recursive model of water heat coupling was proposed in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system at hourly and daily scales and the parameters were fitted based on water and energy balance components measured in wsi rice fields the model takes various soil moisture conditions into consideration integrates all the terms in the surface energy balance and the water balance with conventional meteorological data as inputs additionally the model accounts for the specific drying wetting cycles condition for wsi rice field in the calculation of the canopy resistance rc and the recursive process variations in crop growth and meteorology were also considered the results showed that the model performed well in simulating the water and heat fluxes and temperature profiles during the growth of the rice this is encouraging for modelling the response of hydrothermal process to drying wetting cycles or irrigation regimes which is help for improving the water use efficiency in rice field meanwhile this study indicates that the systemic model is efficient and useful for a better understanding the interaction between hydrological and

leaf and canopy stomatal resistance and plant growth harlan 1973 bayard and stahli 2005 zhou et al 2008 li et al 2013 which is usually developed for the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system such information is of great significance in guiding the agricultural irrigation practice and understanding the interaction between water status and energy fluxes zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 2017 many researchers described energy and water transport between the land surface and the adjacent atmosphere baldocchi 1992 steduto and hsiao 1998 wilson et al 2000 baldocchi et al 2001 lee et al 2002 shrestha et al 2014 efforts were done to improve the performance in simulating the hydrothermal coupling processes to quantify the utilization of water and the distribution of energy recently researchers are interested in modeling water status and heat fluxes components at various temporal and spatial scales generally there are several kind of models that were used to describe the relationship between water and heat the single layer big leaf model based on penman monteith formula monteith 1965 noilhan and planton 1989 the double layer model proposed by shuttleworth and wallace shuttleworth and wallace 1985 sellers 1986 ács et al 1991 and the multi layer model optimized by kustas et al 1996 kim and entekhabi 1998 oltchev et al 1996 and others based on the coupling mechanism of water and energy a number of hydrothermal processes have been coupled and tested in hydrological models such as the water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm the arctic hydrological and thermal process model arhythm the simultaneous heat and water model shaw the cold region hydrological model crhm the distributed water heat coupled model dwhc the geotop distributed hydrological model the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model svat and so on rigon et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2007 chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2000 guo et al 2011 ridler et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 müller et al 2014 shrestha et al 2014 however some of these water heat coupling models were proposed and optimized at a single layer soil plant canopy or atmosphere for instance in an early attempt to link hydrology to the energy balance swift et al 1975 used a model to examine the effects of modifications to the vegetation regime on soil and vegetation water balance they used the penman monteith equation as the basis for evapotranspiration from a single canopy layer soil water thermodynamics is connected with soil water dynamics and combined with crop growth kinetic to form a new soil water kinetic model and to realize the coupling simulation of water and heat at the soil interface wang et al 1994 fischer et al 2008 presented an approach to describe the water and energy coupling mechanism by upgrading the hirvac high resolution vegetation atmosphere coupler model in the vegetation boundary layer though considering the stomata reaction to a change in soil water content with the submodel psn6 expectedly the importance of the interactions between the atmosphere and the soil or crop surface is now well recognized for their impact on hydrological and atmospheric processes spac as a holistic system has been considered in the hydrothermal researches some water heat coupling models were developed for this system which usually focused on river basins zhang et al 2000 zhou et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2007 chen et al 2008 nasonova and gusev 2008 jia et al 2009 in addition these coupling models were composed of some independent sub module rather than consider them as a whole some researches involving plants varied from grassland larsen et al 2016 forests lafleur 1992 and to crop such as maize mcginn and king 1990 li et al 2013 vineyard marras et al 2014 lettuce luo et al 1992 and wheat alves et al 1998 usually focused on the energy partition and evapotranspiration in the system for instance li et al 2013 described the integration of shaw a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model with a stomatal photosynthesis model and wofost a crop growth model to simulate the water and energy budgets during maize growth aimed at optimized water use another model consists of a canopy evapotranspiration module a canopy photosynthesis module and a soil water and heat transfer module which can be used to simulate water heat and co2 flux in the north china plain wang et al 2006 on crop land surface the energy and water processes are closely linked with each other and are controlled by and give feedbacks to the lower atmosphere conditions kim et al 1989 ridler et al 2012 specifically the water transport process in the spac system determines the soil moisture and leaf water status and soil and plant canopy temperature through affecting the energy partitioning between latent heat and sensible heat of the canopy as well as soil heat flux which are the key variables in determining land surface energy balance however the temporal and spatial continuity of hydrothermal conversion cannot be well reflected by the model which consisits of different sub models and mostly with complex calculation process and many parameters a holistic recursive model based on water heat coupling could profoundly depict every component of water and energy cycle process and their inter relationship in a holistic manner which deliberately avoids the complex process of crop growth different from previous models a simplified simulation model will be very useful for improving the understanding in water resources evolution trend in environmental changes impacts on hydrothermal cycle from soil moisture variation and agricultural irrigation prediction in ungauged field meanwhile to cope with the increasing water scarcity several water saving irrigation wsi techniques have been recently applied to rice paddies kato et al 2011 rothenberg et al 2011 cui and huang 2012 when the field water condition is disturbed in the spac system water and energy balance will be changed greatly the drying wetting cycle in soil moisture condition not only modulates thermal gradients and hydraulic properties in the soil layer but also affects rice growth canopy resistance and water vapor transmission near the surface and in turn influences energy transfer and hydrologic cycle in a complex manner gao et al 2003 castellvi et al 2006 linquist et al 2015 xu et al 2017 although alteration of the water balance through reduced irrigation water usage by the crop is fairly well understood the effects of the soil moisture content changes on surface water balance and surface aerodynamics which drives the water and heat cycle are subtler therefore a novel water heat coupling model that considers the variation of soil moisture condition is necessary so as to further promote the application of wsi technology and the development of research on water and heat in farmland and to provide a reference for optimizing the irrigation management in paddy field in the present study fundamental theory of water and energy balance was described the simulation of variables along with the results were deduced orderly both in time and space the overall performance of the novel model with the validation dataset of 2016 rice season were validated and presented the key objective is to provides a new idea and an overall framework of water heat coupling model to simulate the flux transport and water and heat status orderly in the spac rice system under wsi conditions which will be greatly useful for irrigation strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and measurements 2 1 1 site description in situ measurements were conducted in 2014 2016 rice seasons at the kunshan irrigation and drainage experiment station 31 15 15 n 120 57 43 e the study area located in the taihu lake region of china has a subtropical monsoon climate annual average rainfall and annual pan evaporation was estimated as 1097 1 mm and 1365 9 mm for the past 50 years respectively average daily temperature and relative humidity during rice season 2014 2016 were 24 8 c and 79 2 during the rice season from 2014 to 2016 the rainfall was 478 325 and 564 9 mm and the irrigation was 410 9 394 8 and 418 3 mm respectively under similar conditions the soil is hydragric anthrosol with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 the soil volumetric saturated moisture θs field capacity θf measured by cutting ring method and wilting point θw are 0 502 0 392 and 0 179 m3 m 3 at the soil depth of 10 cm respectively seedlings were transplanted on june 26 2014 june 27 2015 and july 2 2016 followed by a 124 d 121 d and 125 d period of rice growth respectively planting at inter and intra row spacing of 0 23 and 0 16 m respectively rice was irrigated according to a local water saving irrigation wsi practice for three years xu et al 2012 if the heavy rain results in flooding water higher than 5 cm in the farmland the surface drainage tap was opened in time to let excessive water drained out and the surface water level before and after the drainage as well as the amount of drainage was recorded fertilizer and pesticides were applied according to local practice in three years 2 1 2 field measurements an ec system open path eddy covariance campbell scientific inc united states was installed in the site to measure the water and heat fluxes within the rice fields with a fetch of about 200 m in all directions around the ec system was aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction south east direction it was composed of a csat3a sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc usa and an ec150 open path infrared gas analyzer campbell scientific inc usa operating at a frequency of 10 hz both at 2 5 m above the soil surface the soil heat flux gs was measured at the depth of 0 08 m using hfp01sc heat flux plates campbell scientific inc usa volumetric soil moisture content θ and soil temperature ts were measured at 0 10 m 0 20 m and 0 30 m depths by cs616 soil moisture reflectometers campbell scientific inc usa and 109 tcav soil thermocouple probes campbell scientific inc usa respectively all observed variables were recorded every 30 min detailed information about field measurement as well as the data quality control of ec system has been presented by xu et al 2017 meteorological data were recorded within the wsi rice field at half hour intervals by sensors incorporated in an ec system and simultaneously by an automatic meteorological station ws std1 delta t uk over a well maintained meadow within the experiment station net radiation rn air relative humidity rh air temperature ta wind speed u atmospheric pressure pa and precipitation p were measured using both instruments rn rh ta and u were measured at 1 5 m 2 0 m and 2 5 m above ground surface respectively three automatic weighed micro lysimeters diameter of 30 cm without plants were used to measure soil evaporation e based on the hourly mass change which installed in the wsi rice field and aligned with the ec system in a northwest direction the configuration location and measurement of the micro lysimeters were described in liu et al 2018 in more detail the soil moisture condition in the micro lysimeters was managed to match the soil moisture condition in surrounding farmland deep seepage measured by drainage lysimeter which had an area of 2 5 m 2 m and a depth of 1 3 m drained through a water permeable tube 40 mm in inner diameter installed 1 2 m below the soil surface into the gallery deep seepage volumes were measured by using an automatic tipping bucket gauge placed at the end of the system the volumetric soil moisture content was also routinely monitored daily 08 00 lt by time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corporation united states at 0 0 2 m 0 1 0 3 m and 0 2 0 4 m depths the soil surface temperature ts 0 was calculated using a harmonic method horton et al 1983 horton and wierenga 1983 based on ts measured at a depth of 0 10 m ts 10 at 5 day intervals over the growing season canopy height hc and leaf area index lai were measured for five fixed plants and averaged for intervening days hc and lai was determined by linear interpolation 2 2 theory and formula 2 2 1 water balance equation in general et could be calculated directly from water balance equation applied over a given period evett et al 2012 1 δ m p i w d w s e t where δm is the sum of change during the period in soil water stored in the control volume mm p and i are precipitation and irrigation mm respectively wd and ws are drainage correspond to the surface runoff and deep seepage mm respectively and et is the field evapotranspiration mm side leakage of paddy field is not considered for the eq 1 p and i can be considered as known variables drainage is triggered by field water level after rainfall and wd is determined accordingly ws of paddy field is calculated according to an equation eq 6 proposed by shi et al 2013 for flooded and non flooded conditions respectively another unknown variable et in eq 1 can be calculated by p m formula based on the energy balance and aerodynamics theory so far δm can be calculated according to the water balance equation and then the soil moisture content at the next time step can also be inferred which implements a recurrence in time 2 2 2 energy balance equation assuming that the energy converted into chemical energy by green plants and the horizontal flow of energy caused by advection between the soil surface and the level of the eddy covariance instrumentation were negligible then the energy balance equation of a terrestrial surface is simplified as 2 l e h s r n g 0 s where le is the latent heat flux w m 2 hs is the sensible heat flux w m 2 rn is the net radiation w m 2 g0 is the surface soil heat flux w m 2 g0 gs q8 with gs being the soil heat flux measured at 8 cm beneath soil surface by heat flux plates and q8 being the change in soil heat storage in 0 8 cm surface soil s is the canopy heat storage in biomass and water content w m 2 detailed methods of the correction of energy imbalance and the enforcing closure have been presented by xu et al 2017 it is worth noting that q8 were not measured directly it can be determined approximately based on the change in soil temperature of 10 cm depth meyers and hollinger 2004 heitman et al 2010 following the equation of eq 25 for the eq 2 le in the energy balance equation is equivalent to et and can be calculated by multiplying with λ rn is the input which was measured directly g0 is calculated based on its correlation with net radiation which was calibrated using the measured dataset s is neglected since it accounted for less than 2 of the available energy during the rice cultivation season deduced from a concentration profile method inside the canopy leuning et al 2012 and then hs was calculated by energy balance equation eq 2 2 2 3 variables for water heat coupling the et water in millimeter equivalent to le and θ were considered as the key variables in the water heat coupling process of paddy field water balances are linked to energy balances because the latent energy evapotranspiration appears as a key element in both balances thus et le is the main way of water consumption and energy output in rice field ecosystem and is also a vital link between water and heat transformation fig 1 meanwhile θ as the main variable reflecting the particularity of the wsi environment is not only an important factor affecting the ws and et in the water balance equation but also affecting the energy flux g0 and q as well as the soil heat state ts 0 and ts 10 in the energy balance therefore the two variables are links to reflect the close relationship between water cycle and energy conversion for the simulation of hydrothermal state in the spac system and then the water heat coupling relationship can be constructed in the wsi rice field 2 3 statistical analysis performance of the model was verified using four indicators the linear regression slope coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement ioa these indicators were used to evaluate the correlation between the measured and simulated variables 3 model description and development 3 1 system schematization allocation and conversion of the water and energy in spac system of rice field can be described by a schematic diagram fig 1 which is divided into three layers an atmosphere layer at reference height a canopy layer at the height of momentum transfer confluence based on the p m big leaf model and a soil surface layer with the shallow flooding water occasionally the model emphasizes the state of hydrothermal equilibrium rather than the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic transport processes several assumptions are made on the canopy layer at this study the canopy layer between soil surface and crop height is considered as a big leaf when calculating energy and water balance and the canopy resistance is used to represent the critical controls on heat and vapor flux transfer through the spac system within the canopy monteith 1965 katerji et al 2011 the transfer amount from molecular diffusion is negligible comparing with that from turbulent diffusion due to the wind speed the net radiation is essentially balanced by the sum of soil heat sensible heat and latent heat flux 3 2 model development data in 2014 and 2015 n 5086 rice season were used as training datasets for calibration of the water heat coupling model the input meteorological variables of the model are rn ta d and v all of them are routine meteorological data the other inputs for soil crop and others are field specific values and model parameters should be calibrated values which are introduced in the following words in details given the initial values of soil moisture content θ10 0 and soil surface temperature ts 10 0 at a depth of 0 10 m the water and heat fluxes can be calculated according to the process of energy balance and water balance the main outputs of the model include g0 le hs et θ10 ts 0 ts 10 tc lai and hc the coupled model can not only simulate the variation of lai and hc but also reflect the processes of evapotranspiration as well as the energy balance conversion according to the surface water balance relationship evapotranspiration et can be expressed as 3 e t 3600 l e ρ λ p i w d w s δ m 4 δ m 1000 δ z θ 10 i θ 10 i 1 where ρ is the density of dry air kg m 3 λ is the latent flux of heat mj kg 1 λ 2 501 2 361 10 3 ta with ta being the average temperature c δz is the change in soil depth m which is equal to 0 1 m in this study the same as the depth of heat flux calculation θ10 is the average volumetric soil water content in the 0 1 m soil layer m3 m 3 δm is the sum of change during the time period in soil water stored in the control volume mm if shallow flooding water was maintained then δm is equal the change of the water layer δhw mm note that the number 3600 is a time conversion from s to h and the superscript i is time index variables for time steps indicating the time of calculation the meaning of other symbols is the same as before theoretically the water balance equation is applicable to any temporal scale but in practice soil moisture is considered to vary relatively slowly in diurnal variation althought the irrigation and rainfall is with strong real time feature and so the water balance equation was considered on a daily time step for computational efficiency and accuracy and the variation of θ10 was deduced recursively the θ10 value of the next prediction time was determined by water balance equation after the initial value of the soil moisture content θ10 0 was given at the initial time of the simulation when the real time information of the surface water layer followed a rainfall or irrigation was obtained the time was taken as a new initial state and the calculation recycle again notably the difference in time steps between model components does mean that diurnal variability of soil moisture is not simulated and its influence on the surface energy balance is therefore overlooked however it wass not considered as a very significant factor for long term water balance studies silberstein et al 1999 thus according to the water balance theory the recurrence equation of soil moisture content can be expressed as 5 θ 10 i θ 10 i 1 e t i 1 p i 1 i i 1 w d i 1 w s i 1 δ z 1000 where pi 1 ii 1 are known as inputs wd i 1 is judged by rainfall and soil moisture at the previous moment ws i 1 and eti 1 are variables that need to be further determined the seepage volume of paddy field was calculated according to the following linear and non linear model based on the flooded and non flooded paddy soil respectively shi et al 2013 6 w s i a h w i b flooded 1000 k 0 1 k 0 ε t i δ z non flooded where hw is the depth of water above the soil surface mm a and b are parameters which should be determined in the model calibration k0 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m d 1 generally taken 0 1 1 0 m d 1 mainly related to the soil texture and the greater the soil viscosity the smaller the value ε is the empirical constant generally from 50 to 250 and the greater the soil viscosity the greater the value ti is the number of days that soil moisture content from a resent saturation state to i days in this study the seepage rate in paddy field was measured by drainage lysimeter according to the measured results the deep seepage of paddy field mainly occurred with shallow flooding water maintained in the field as well as in the middle and later tiller jointing and booting and heading to flowering stages without flooding the seepage during the period without flooding layer after the milk ripening was not considered in the calculation thus coefficients a and b in eq 6 were determined to be 0 125 and 0 262 based on the calibration dataset with flooding layer respectively coefficient of determination r2 0 789 and k0 0 3 and ε 140 based on the calibration dataset without flooding r2 0 602 assuming the seepage rate is the same at each time of the day and then the seepage rate of rice fields on a daily and hourly scale can be calculated another unknown variable et in eq 5 can be calculated by p m formula based on the energy balance and aerodynamics theory 7 λ e t 3600 δ r n g 0 ρ c p d r a δ γ 1 r c r a where λ is the latent flux of heat mj kg 1 λ 2 501 2 361 10 3 ta with ta being the average temperature c δ is the slope of the saturation to

resistance rc affected by numerous environmental variables simultaneously was calculated through an empirical multi factorial approach by the following equations jarvis 1976 ershadi et al 2015 xu et al 2017 the determination of canopy resistance is the key to calculating the evapotranspiration of the pm model to improve the performance of canopy resistance model under wsi condition a term of effective leaf area index laia was used to reflect the influence of canopy coverage condition and coefficients a4 was added in soil water response functions of jarvis type rc model as well as θf mostly used for upland crops was replace by θs due to the specific soil moisture condition in wsi rice fields 9 r c r s l a i a r min f 1 r n f 2 d f 3 t a f 4 θ 10 l a i a 10 f 1 r n 1 exp r n a 1 11

are weighing functions representing the effects of solar radiation humidity air temperature and soil moisture on plant stress θs 50 2 and θw 17 9 are saturated soil moisture and wilting point m3 m 3 respectively a1 a2 a3 and a4 are coefficients which should be determined in the model calibration laia is the effective leaf area index which considers that only the upper leaves in the canopy are active in heat and vapor transfer alves et al 1998 laia is equal to actual laifor lai 2 equal to lai 2 for lai 4 and equal 2 for intermediate values of lai gardiol et al 2003 notably in the present study laia in eq 9 was used to reflect the influence of canopy lai θs instead of field capacity θf was used as a key parameter in the soil water response functions of eq 13 a coefficient a4 was introduced to reflect the specific wetting drying cycle condition of soil moisture the three distinguishing features were the specific of the rc model responded to the special wsi condition then coefficients a1 a2 a3 and a4 in eqs 10 13 were determined to be 45 8 0 006 0 005 and 6 0 based on the 2014 and 2015 calibration dataset respectively additionally hc and lai are unknown variables in eqs 8 and 9 that need to be solved to calculate ra and rc respectively a good agreement was found between measured and fitted hc and lai values fig 2 with high r2 of 0 976 and 0 952 respectively but some discrepancies were found between measured and fitted lai values during re greening period doy 10 d doy days after transplanting so the simulated lai value was set to a fixed value of 0 3 when doy 10 d the relationships between hc and lai with days after transplanting were established respectively according to the calibration samples as follow and it is believed that the hourly values equal to the daily mean 14 h c 0 007 d o y 2 1 495 d o y 14 753 100 15 l a i 0 001 d o y 2 0 168 d o y 1 605 d o y 10 the energy component g0 an unknown variable in the process of the model derivation was described in more detail in the same wsi region in our previous research liu et al 2017 which reported the diurnal variations of g0 varied in the same pattern as rn a unimodal shape with negative values at night but at a 0 5 1 5 h lag behind rn in the present study drawing on data on the diurnal pattern of the ratio of g0 to rn in the daytime the quadratic function over time was used to describe the variation of ratio g0 to rn during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime the ratio of g0 to rn changed drastically due to the smaller g0 and rn values therefore the monthly average of g0 rn in 8 00 17 00 period is used to establish the quadratic function the relationship between the ratio of g0 to rn and time was shown in fig 3 the regressions were significant at α 0 001 confidence level with a high r2 of 0 868 the relationship between the two components at other times can be better characterized by a linear relationship r2 0 534 α 0 001 thus the relation of eq 16 served in calculating the variation of surface soil heat flux g0 at hourly scale and the daily value was calculated by the average of hourly values 16 g 0 r n 0 0045 t 2 0 133 t 0 799 8 00 t 17 00 0 236 r n 8 427 other time by substituting eqs 6 16 into eq 5 θi value in the next day can be obtained which is in preparation for the calculation of et at the next moment according to this recursive relation five variables of lai daily scale hc daily scale θ daily scale g0 hourly and daily scale and et hourly and daily scale can be calculated and then hs can be obtained according to the energy balance equation eq 17 so far the main components of water balance and energy balance in paddy fields can be output recursively 17 h s r n g 0 l e notably changes in soil moisture of rice field lead to dramatic changes in the soil moisture cycle and an obvious one is manifested as changes in soil evaporation e which in turn exert a profound influence on the water heat transfer of ecosystem the daily variation during the whole growth period for evaporation e was analyzed and the ratio of e to et was also discussed from earlier studies in the current experiment station under same condition liu et al 2016 the variation of e et in the whole growth period can be described by a quadric curve with days after transplanting as independent variable the comparison between the fitted curve and the observed data is shown in fig 4 and the curvilinear equation can be expressed as 18 e et 9e 05 doy 2 0 016 doy 0 928 in addition to water and energy balance components the model also predicts the temperature variation in the spac system water vapor and heat are carried away from the immediate vicinity of the soil or the canopy surface by turbulent bulk flow of parcels of air containing quantities of heat and vapor this turbulent flux is proportional to the vapor concentration or temperature difference between z1 and z2 thus the turbulent flux of sensible heat away from the surface is written as 19 h s η ρ c p t 1 ρ c p t 2 η ρ c p t 1 t 2 where t1 and t2 are the temperatures at heights z1 the soil or the canopy surface and z2 an arbitrary elevation c and η is the turbulent transfer coefficient for heat between z1 and z2 according to the aerodynamic transport equation eq 19 hs monitored by the ec system can be decomposed into two parts the soil surface to the canopy surface and the canopy surface to the height of 2 5 m the net flux is a transport of heat and water vapor in two consecutive spatial extents the η within and above the canopy is affected by the aerodynamic resistance from the soil surface to in canopy flow and that from the canopy surface to the reference height thus eq 19 may be rewritten in terms of the aerodynamic resistance 20 h s c ρ c p t s 0 t c 1 r a s d ρ c p t c t a 1 r a a where ts 0 tc and ta are the temperature of soil surface canopy surface and reference height c respectively r a a is the aerodynamic resistance of the mean canopy flow s m 1 calculated by eq 8 the same as the calculation formula of r a r a s is the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface to in canopy flow s m 1 which is calculated from the vertical wind profile at the field and the eddy diffusion coefficient by eq 21 katerji and rana 2006 c and d are coefficients which should be determined in the model calibration for the calibration phase the coefficients c and d were determined to be 2 054 and 0 408 respectively the highly significant α 0 001 was confirmed by a r2 of 0 766 rmse of 11 435 w m 2 21 r a s ln z m d z o m k 2 u h c exp ζ ζ h c

other variable symbols are the same as before certainly ts 0 and tc in eq 20 are not input variables ts 0 is the key variable of water heat exchange between soil and atmosphere but only the measured values of soil temperature ts 10 ts 20 and ts 30 at 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m below the surface of the earth are available no measured value of ts 0 therefore based on the soil texture and soil moisture conditions in the experimental area the study results of jury and horton 2004 on the correlation between ts 0 and ts 10 ts 20 and ts 30 of heavy loam were analyzed it was found that the ratio of ts 0 to ts 10 had a sinusoidal variation relationship and the correlation of ts 0 ts 10 with time can be expressed as 22 t s 0 t s 10 a b sin π t c 12 where a b and c are model parameters t is time hourly time steps been chosen to calculate temperature and heat storage a 1 001 b 0 059 and c 15 504 were fitted with origin 85 good performance of the fitted model with a r2 0 979 fig 5 thus ts 0 can be expressed as 23 t s 0 t s 10 1 001 0 059 sin π t 15 504 12 in the above expression ts 10 can be calculated according to the change in soil heat storage in 0 10 cm surface soil q10 ochsner et al 2007

calculated by the training dataset fig 6 the variation trends of g10 and g0 are similar but the phase of the g10 wave is retarded with respect to the surface soil heat flux by a time lag of 1 h same as the time interval of the study period it can be assumed that q10 i is the response to g0 i 1 in the previous hour so that the correlation between q10 i and g0 i 1 was established based on training data samples fig 7 r2 0 814 α 0 001 27 q 10 i 0 513 g 0 i 1 3 115 as listed in the above derivation process five steps must be taken to determine three temperature variables ts 0 ts 10 and tc in the

is estimated based on the soil volumetric heat capacity and temperature and the formal relationship must be established fourth the sinusoidal variation relationship of ts 0 ts 10 with time should be calibrated fifth tc in eq 20 must be calculated using some specific calibration variables of eqs 21 27 so far all the non input variables in the above model can be recursively solved the model reflects the water heat relationship in the spac system and should be capable in coupling simulation of water heat in the water saving irrigated paddy field 3 3 model operation a simplified sequence flow diagram was used to illustrate the operation of water heat coupling model fig 8 the model was run in the rice growth stage at hourly time step initially the model driving variables included conventional meteorological data rn ta d and v which were obtained from the ec system and the automatic meteorological station measurements the model initial conditions of soil temperature at 0 1 m depths ts 10 0 and water content θ 0 were given based on the measurements by 109 tcav soil thermocouple probes and cs616 soil moisture reflectometers respectively the functions of crop growth lai and hc were fitted according to the training samples with the days after transplanting as independent variable laii and hc i were considered to be the same values at each hour of the day that is the daily average was equal to the hourly value then water and heat variables were calculated in turn all input variables for the model are hourly time steps and the output variables may be hourly or daily time steps the soil moisture condition needs to be re entered as initial condition when rainfall or irrigation results in the shallow flooding water to satisfy the calculation condition of seepage model and reduce the cumulative error in soil moisture calculation the input and output variables of the model were enumerated in tables 1 and 2 and the simulation results were presented in the following section 4 4 model verification and analysis verification of the proposed coupling model was done by comparing the recursive estimated with experimental data the model validation period was the rice season of year 2016 based on calibrated model profiles of crop growth characteristics water and heat balance components and soil and canopy temperatures could be simulated the feasibility and accuracy of the model were analyzed at hourly and daily time step 4 1 crop parameters lai and hc based on eq 15 the dynamic variation of lai along with days after rice transplantation was shown in fig 9 a lai increased gradually with the growth of rice reached its maximum at 80 90 days after transplanting and then decreased slightly the simulated values were slightly deviated at the early and the vigorous growth stage of rice closely matching the measured values in other periods fig 9b the highly significant α 0 001 linear regression was confirmed by r2 of 0 974 rmse of 0 293 and the index of agreement ioa of 0 994 the dynamic change of hc was also described along with the days after transplanting as the figure explained that the simulated value of hc was in good agreement with the measured value α 0 001 with a slight underestimation at peak period fig 10 with the increase of rice growth hc increased first and then tended to be flat after 100 days since transplantation r2 rmse and ioa were 0 948 3 742 cm and 0 987 respectively good performance of the crop lai and hc simulation provides reliable basic crop data for the accurate simulation of water and heat fluxes in wsi rice field 4 2 model response to water status of paddy field 4 2 1 soil moisture content one of the key points in verifying soil moisture variation process was ensuring that the soil moisture condition was re entered as initial condition when rainfall or irrigation resulted in the shallow flooding water fig 11 displayed the daily variation of soil water status in water saving irrigated paddy field the model captured the seasonal variation pattern of soil water content and surface water layer although some discrepancies occurred between the simulated and observed values it was slightly overestimated when a deeper flooding water was maintained possible as results that there were side seepage and other water consumption in the actual paddy field during flooded period and the actual water consumption was larger than the simulated condition by and large the model shows very good performance on θ and hw deduced by daily time step three indicators r2 rmse and ioa were 0 876 1 520 cm 3 cm 3 and 0 966 for θ and 0 991 1 362 mm and 0 997 for hw respectively fig 12 4 2 2 evapotranspiration and evaporation the most important process which determines the coupling between water and heat is the transport of latent heat by vapor flux within the soil and at the interface between the soil and the atmosphere in order to quantify the simulation performance of et an important component in water balance water in millimeter equivalent to le in energy balance when optimal parameterizations were adopted the modeled et were plotted against the observed ones as depicted in fig 13 a the scatter plots fig 13a confirmed that all the data were moderately little dispersed around the 1 1 line showing no significant biases in the modeled et α 0 001 the regression slopes were 1 023 rmse 0 047 mm h 1 with r2 of 0 964 and ioa of 0 991 both close to 1 0 the modeled e were also plotted against the observed ones showing a quite good agreement fig 13a although the distribution of discrete degree was slightly larger than et the regression slope r2 rmse and ioa were 0 978 0 770 0 061 mm h 1 and 0 932 respectively the latent heat le appears as evapotranspiration in the spac system which is a crucial component of its energy cycle in this study seven days in different growth periods were selected out in 2016 rice season either with sunny fig 14 a or cloudy days fig 14b respectively to analyze the performance of the simulated et and e variation of soil moisture condition θ and hw in the seven sunny days corresponded to days 16 22 35 62 74 101 and 115 after transplanting and corresponded to days 10 33 51 71 94 and 118 in the six cloudy days respectively in general the et calculated by the model were in a good agreement with the measured value ioa 0 993 and 0 973 for sunny and cloudy days the diurnal variation curves of e were basically the same as et although the simulation results were not as good as that of et due to the results containing the errors caused by the simulation of et in addition there were no significant difference in the simulation of et with or without flooding water from figs 11 and 14 however the model overestimated hourly e at noon time both in sunny i e july 23th and cloudy days i e july 11th and august 21th when flooding water was maintained or soil was saturated thus the agreement between hourly simulated and measured e values was good other than during the period with flooding or soil moisture saturation by substituting the daily scale data into water balance formula and pm model daily et can be also simulated drawing on data on the relationship between e and et proposed in previous studies the daily e was calculated and plotted in fig 13b the regressions between simulated and measured values were significant at α 0 001 confidence level the slope of the ols regression was 0 909 for et and 0 976 for e both close to 1 0 r2 and rmse were 0 977 and 0 218 mm d 1 for et and 0 896 and 0 402 mm d 1 for e respectively and ioa values were close to 1 with values of 0 990 and 0 970 respectively it indicated that the modeled et and e values were more consistent with measured values at daily scale than at hourly scale possible as results of the simulation errors of hourly et noon and during transition period from daytime to nighttime offset each other when et was calculated at daily scale same as the hourly scale calculation the performance of modeled e was not as good as that of et model performance in daily et and e calculation were assessed in wsi paddy fields fig 15 by and large the simulated and measured values of seasonally et and e varied in a similar trend while the simulated value tended to underestimate the measured value in varied degrees in re greening stage performed getting better along with the crop growth in late season the good performance of the proposed model at high lai may be linked to the assumption of the pm equation a single source big leaf model 4 3 model response to heat status of paddy field 4 3 1 soil heat flux surface soil heat flux g0 is an important heat flux for model output compared with the measured g0 which was derived from the soil heat flux measured at 8 cm beneath soil surface by heat flux plates gs and the change in soil heat storage in 0 8 cm surface soil q8 the coupled model resulted in acceptable accuracy fig 16 a the linear regression between the measured and simulated g0 was significant at α 0 001 confidence level r2 rmse and ioa were 0 789 17 500 w m 2 and 0 942 respectively the results also indicated that simulated hourly g0 was less accurate when g0 was higher than 40 w m 2 the simulated daily g0 accumulated as the sum of hourly data was compared with the measured values and the ols regression between them were plotted in fig 16b r2 rmse and ioa were 0 561 4 394 w m 2 and 0 899 respectively the confidential level of is high with α 0 001 also typical diurnal g0 variations in sunny fig 17 a and cloudy days fig 17b were selected out to evaluate the performance of the water heat coupling model in hourly g0 calculation at different rice growth stages simulated g0 varied in the same pattern as measured values in sunny days in all the growth stages while tending to overestimate or underestimate the measured values in various degrees at noontime or during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime especially in early growth stage considering with the soil moisture content simulated hourly g0 did not always predict the actual values when the soil was flooded either in sunny i e july 23th and october 24th or cloudy days i e july 11th august 21th and october 27th especially during noon with higher available energy it showed that the distribution of energy was changed when flooding water was maintained which had a certain influence on the simulation of g0 notably using ts 10 instead of soil temperature at depths of 8 cm to calculate q8 then the q8 at daytime will be lower this might be the reason why simulated g0 was greater in sunny days in fig 17 a in addition the measured g0 decreased suddenly and abruptly during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime resulting in fairly large simulation error which was subject to the measurement error due to the phase lag of the measured value some time being necessary for the heat flux plate to response to the energy change poblete echeverría et al 2014 fig 18 shows the daily variation of measured and simulated g0 corresponding variation of rn generally the g0 varied with rn showed a tendency of gradually decreasing during the whole growth period the correlation between simulated and measured values was better at the regreening and early tillering stages because of the canopy coverage was low the conversion of rn to g0 was less affected by the underlying surface and canopy heat storage during the vigorous period of rice growth middle or later tillering and jointing to booting stages the simulated g0 differed greatly from the measured value with a certain degree of overestimation the reasons might be that some energy losses such as canopy or water heat storage energy advection losses etc was neglected in simulating g0 and the measured values greatly affected by various energy transfer resistance so the calculated results were larger in addition the accumulation of errors in the calculation from hourly scale to daily scale also led to the difference between the simulated and measured values after heading to flowering the model performed better for g0 simulation due to the flat and uniform underlying surface which is close to the ideal condition for ec measurement and also conforms to the assumption of the single source big leaf model xu et al 2017 4 3 2 sensible heat flux in the water heat coupling model the residual term of the energy balance equation was deemed to represent the sensible heat flux hs regardless of the hourly or daily scale therefore the error in hs simulation reflect the cumulative error of the model to a certain extent regression analysis of the simulation results of hourly and daily scale hs was shown in fig 19 the regressions were significant at α 0 001 confidence level and the regression slopes of hourly and daily data were 0 913 and 0 941 respectively which were slightly underestimated r2 rmse and ioa were 0 595 and 0 562 20 915 and 5 697 w m 2 0 871 and 0 841 respectively the performance in hs simulation was slightly lower than that of g0 and le the diurnal variation of simulated and measured hs values in typical sunny and cloudy days in light of subplots in fig 20 was roughly the same but the simulation error was larger than that of other heat fluxes the big gap between the two hs data sets at noon time or during the transition period from day to night was ascribed to the accumulative error in simulation of et and g0 especially obvious in cloudy days the simulation of hs was also directly affected by soil moisture content the water heat coupling model substantially overestimated hourly hs at noon time in cloudy days i e july 11th august 21th and october 27th under waterlogged condition reason might be that change in energy storage in the flooding water was not considered in the calculation of energy balance thus hs as the residual of the energy balance equation was overestimated especially in the period with larger water consumption at noon for daily flux of hs the simulated value and measured value were consistent in temporal variation basically as depicted in fig 21 while the error in simulated hs was also larger than that of other heat fluxes the error in simulated hs was big during the period with low canopy coverage condition and shallow flooding water maintained in addition the measured g0 was overestimated greatly as a result underestimation of hs occurred during the vigorous growth stage of rice 4 3 3 soil and canopy temperature thermal gradients affect water vapor redistribution which is the key factor affecting hydrothermal conversion the model outputs temperatures of ts 0 ts 10 and tc since ts 0 was not measured directly in current research and it was calculated from ts 10 simulated ts 10 was investigated to show the performance of the model the results of model simulated vs the observed data were presented in figs 22 24 for temperatures ts 10 and tc on different observation layers fig 22 showed the simulated ts 10 and tc with those measured values the r2 rmse and ioa were 0 865 and 0 843 1 697 and 2 773 c and 0 958 and 0 948 respectively it performed slightly better in simulating ts 10 than tc t c is the last variable deduced in the couple model according to the flowchart fig 8 of model error were accumulated in the calculation as a result data points deviated slightly from 1 1 line in the linear regression especially during period with high temperatures in typical days the diurnal variation of ts 10 showed a cosine fluctuation pattern the daily temperature range is greater on sunny days than that on cloudy days see fig 23a and b and the degree to match a cosine line in daily variation became less obvious with the decrease of daily temperature range in cloudy days overall the simulated ts 10 agreed well with observed values however the overestimation or underestimation of the simulated values were not consistent in different weather conditions during the same growth period which was closely related to the soil moisture content the simulated values were generally greater than measured values on both sunny and cloudy days especially during the days july 11th 23th august 21th october 24th and 27th with shallow flooding water maintained a possible explanation might be the flooding water consumes a part of energy for water heating and evaporation and the corresponding energy reaching the soil surface decreases however the thermal storage in surface water was not considered in the simulation so the simulated ts 10 was higher than the actual value it was also found that when θ was lower than θf august 3th and september 1th the simulated ts 10 was smaller than the measured value and for θf θ θs the model showed a good performance on ts 10 simulation generally diurnal variation of simulated tc varied in the consistent pattern with measured tc on typical sunny and cloudy days but the former fluctuated more sharply see fig 23c and d the fluctuation magnitude of tc was larger than that of ts 10 means it is more sensitive to the change of air temperature the error of simulated tc was due to the fact that the result of tc estimation was based on estimation of hs and ts 10 and the result reflected the cumulative error of hs and ts 10 to a certain extent in addition the gap between the simulated and measured data were more obvious in the early growth stage due to the low canopy coverage tc measured by infrared thermometer suffered from lack of representative for a sparse canopy which partially accounted for the error between the measured and the simulated temperature the temporal variation of daily ts 10 and tc were depicted in fig 24 the simulated daily tc agreed well in temporal variation with the measured tc while the consistency between the simulated ts 10 and observed ones was relatively low mainly influenced by the flooding water in rice growth stage ts 10 and tc were both largely affected by rn and the curves of their seasonal variation were basically the same as rn too on daily scale r2 and rmse were 0 867 and 1 679 c for ts 10 and 0 971 and 0 929 c for tc respectively and ioa values were close to 1 with values of 0 959 and 0 989 respectively it indicated that the novel coupled model performed very well at daily step in calculating tc possible because that the underestimate and overestimate of tc occurred in the same day offset each other when tc was calculated at daily step 5 conclusions hydrological cycle components as well as energy cycle components at hourly and daily scales in the wsi rice field were simulated and analyzed by using a holistic recursive model of water heat coupling which was proposed in the current study and the goodness of fit parameters were presented for wsi rice fields in general less easy available input variables were needed in the coupled model one major advantage for the water heat coupling model in wsi rice field was that takes the specific wetting drying cycle condition into consideration in the calculation of the rc and the recursive process of the model variations in lai hc and meteorology were considered but the complex process of crop growth was not additionally temperatures ts 0 ts 10 and tc in the spac system were modeled with five steps proposed by this study which was linked to the aerodynamic transport theory and the calculation of soil heat storage based on soil temperature and moisture data notably the model was established and calibrated based on the measured values there are few empirical parameters thus the novel model developed with the estimated parameters from this study consisted of a framework for water heat status simulations performed in the spac system at hourly and daily steps in view of its accuracy and applicability the model will capable in predicting results beyond the current literature data so long as inputs are available and can be a reference for model development for other crops in future acknowledgements this

10920,it is necessary to quantify the hydrothermal processes by develop a water heat coupling model in rice fields where the transfer between water and energy is dramatically violent under the circumstance that water saving irrigation wsi was widely used in rice paddy due to the increasing water scarcity based on the theory of energy and water balance considering the interaction of impedance near the ground a simplified holistic recursive model of water heat coupling was proposed in the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac system at hourly and daily scales and the parameters were fitted based on water and energy balance components measured in wsi rice fields the model takes various soil moisture conditions into consideration integrates all the terms in the surface energy balance and the water balance with conventional meteorological data as inputs additionally the model accounts for the specific drying wetting cycles condition for wsi rice field in the calculation of the canopy resistance rc and the recursive process variations in crop growth and meteorology were also considered the results showed that the model performed well in simulating the water and heat fluxes and temperature profiles during the growth of the rice this is encouraging for modelling the response of hydrothermal process to drying wetting cycles or irrigation regimes which is help for improving the water use efficiency in rice field meanwhile this study indicates that the systemic model is efficient and useful for a better understanding the interaction between hydrological and

such information is of great significance in guiding the agricultural irrigation practice and understanding the interaction between water status and energy fluxes zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 2017 many researchers described energy and water transport between the land surface and the adjacent atmosphere baldocchi 1992 steduto and hsiao 1998 wilson et al 2000 baldocchi et al 2001 lee et al 2002 shrestha et al 2014 efforts were done to improve the performance in simulating the hydrothermal coupling processes to quantify the utilization of water and the distribution of energy recently researchers are interested in modeling water status and heat fluxes components at various temporal and spatial scales generally there are several kind of models that were used to describe the relationship between water and heat the single layer big leaf model based on penman monteith formula monteith 1965 noilhan and planton 1989 the double layer model proposed by shuttleworth and wallace shuttleworth and wallace 1985 sellers 1986 ács et al 1991 and the multi layer model optimized by kustas et al 1996 kim and entekhabi 1998 oltchev et al 1996 and others based on the coupling mechanism of water and energy a number of hydrothermal processes have been coupled and tested in hydrological models such as the water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm the arctic hydrological and thermal process model arhythm the simultaneous heat and water model shaw the cold region hydrological model crhm the distributed water heat coupled model dwhc the geotop distributed hydrological model the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model svat and so on rigon et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2007 chen et al 2008 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2000 guo et al 2011 ridler et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 müller et al 2014 shrestha et al 2014 however some of these water heat coupling models were proposed and optimized at a single layer soil plant canopy or atmosphere for instance in an early attempt to link hydrology to the energy balance swift et al 1975 used a model to examine the effects of modifications to the vegetation regime on soil and vegetation water balance they used the penman monteith equation as the basis for evapotranspiration from a single canopy layer soil water thermodynamics is connected with soil water dynamics and combined with crop growth kinetic to form a new soil water kinetic model and to realize the coupling simulation of water and heat at the soil interface wang et al 1994 fischer et al 2008 presented an approach to describe the water and energy coupling mechanism by upgrading the hirvac high resolution vegetation atmosphere coupler model in the vegetation boundary layer though considering the stomata reaction to a change in soil water content with the submodel psn6 expectedly the importance of the interactions between the atmosphere and the soil or crop surface is now well recognized for their impact on hydrological and atmospheric processes spac as a holistic system has been considered in the hydrothermal researches some water heat coupling models were developed for this system which usually focused on river basins zhang et al 2000 zhou et al 2006 pomeroy et al 2007 chen et al 2008 nasonova and gusev 2008 jia et al 2009 in addition these coupling models were composed of some independent sub module rather than consider them as a whole some researches involving plants varied from grassland larsen et al 2016 forests lafleur 1992 and to crop such as maize mcginn and king 1990 li et al 2013 vineyard marras et al 2014 lettuce luo et al 1992 and wheat alves et al 1998 usually focused on the energy partition and evapotranspiration in the system for instance li et al 2013 described the integration of shaw a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model with a stomatal photosynthesis model and wofost a crop growth model to simulate the water and energy budgets during maize growth aimed at optimized water use another model consists of a canopy evapotranspiration module a canopy photosynthesis module and a soil water and heat transfer module which can be used to simulate water heat and co2 flux in the north china plain wang et al 2006 on crop land surface the energy and water processes are closely linked with each other and are controlled by and give feedbacks to the lower atmosphere conditions kim et al 1989 ridler et al 2012 specifically the water transport process in the spac system determines the soil moisture and leaf water status and soil and plant canopy temperature through affecting the energy partitioning between latent heat and sensible heat of the canopy as well as soil heat flux which are the key variables in determining land surface energy balance however the temporal and spatial continuity of hydrothermal conversion cannot be well reflected by the model which consisits of different sub models and mostly with complex calculation process and many parameters a holistic recursive model based on water heat coupling could profoundly depict every component of water and energy cycle process and their inter relationship in a holistic manner which deliberately avoids the complex process of crop growth different from previous models a simplified simulation model will be very useful for improving the understanding in water resources evolution trend in environmental changes impacts on hydrothermal cycle from soil moisture variation and agricultural irrigation prediction in ungauged field meanwhile to cope with the increasing water scarcity several water saving irrigation wsi techniques have been recently applied to rice paddies kato et al 2011 rothenberg et al 2011 cui and huang 2012 when the field water condition is disturbed in the spac system water and energy balance will be changed greatly the drying wetting cycle in soil moisture condition not only modulates thermal gradients and hydraulic properties in the soil layer but also affects rice growth canopy resistance and water vapor transmission near the surface and in turn influences energy transfer and hydrologic cycle in a complex manner gao et al 2003 castellvi et al 2006 linquist et al 2015 xu et al 2017 although alteration of the water balance through reduced irrigation water usage by the crop is fairly well understood the effects of the soil moisture content changes on surface water balance and surface aerodynamics which drives the water and heat cycle are subtler therefore a novel water heat coupling model that considers the variation of soil moisture condition is necessary so as to further promote the application of wsi technology and the development of research on water and heat in farmland and to provide a reference for optimizing the irrigation management in paddy field in the present study fundamental theory of water and energy balance was described the simulation of variables along with the results were deduced orderly both in time and space the overall performance of the novel model with the validation dataset of 2016 rice season were validated and presented the key objective is to provides a new idea and an overall framework of water heat coupling model to simulate the flux transport and water and heat status orderly in the spac rice system under wsi conditions which will be greatly useful for irrigation strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and measurements 2 1 1 site description in situ measurements were conducted in 2014 2016 rice seasons at the kunshan irrigation and drainage experiment station 31 15 15 n 120 57 43 e the study area located in the taihu lake region of china has a subtropical monsoon climate annual average rainfall and annual pan evaporation was estimated as 1097 1 mm and 1365 9 mm for the past 50 years respectively average daily temperature and relative humidity during rice season 2014 2016 were 24 8 c and 79 2 during the rice season from 2014 to 2016 the rainfall was 478 325 and 564 9 mm and the irrigation was 410 9 394 8 and 418 3 mm respectively under similar conditions the soil is hydragric anthrosol with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 the soil volumetric saturated moisture θs field capacity θf measured by cutting ring method and wilting point θw are 0 502 0 392 and 0 179 m3 m 3 at the soil depth of 10 cm respectively seedlings were transplanted on june 26 2014 june 27 2015 and july 2 2016 followed by a 124 d 121 d and 125 d period of rice growth respectively planting at inter and intra row spacing of 0 23 and 0 16 m respectively rice was irrigated according to a local water saving irrigation wsi practice for three years xu et al 2012 if the heavy rain results in flooding water higher than 5 cm in the farmland the surface drainage tap was opened in time to let excessive water drained out and the surface water level before and after the drainage as well as the amount of drainage was recorded fertilizer and pesticides were applied according to local practice in three years 2 1 2 field measurements an ec system open path eddy covariance campbell scientific inc united states was installed in the site to measure the water and heat fluxes within the rice fields with a fetch of about 200 m in all directions around the ec system was aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction south east direction it was composed of a csat3a sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc usa and an ec150 open path infrared gas analyzer campbell scientific inc usa operating at a frequency of 10 hz both at 2 5 m above the soil surface the soil heat flux gs was measured at the depth of 0 08 m using hfp01sc heat flux plates campbell scientific inc usa volumetric soil moisture content θ and soil temperature ts were measured at 0 10 m 0 20 m and 0 30 m depths by cs616 soil moisture reflectometers campbell scientific inc usa and 109 tcav soil thermocouple probes campbell scientific inc usa respectively all observed variables were recorded every 30 min detailed information about field measurement as well as the data quality control of ec system has been presented by xu et al 2017 meteorological data were recorded within the wsi rice field at half hour intervals by sensors incorporated in an ec system and simultaneously by an automatic meteorological station ws std1 delta t uk over a well maintained meadow within the experiment station net radiation rn air relative humidity rh air temperature ta wind speed u atmospheric pressure pa and precipitation p were measured using both instruments rn rh ta and u were measured at 1 5 m 2 0 m and 2 5 m above ground surface respectively three automatic weighed micro lysimeters diameter of 30 cm without plants were used to measure soil evaporation e based on the hourly mass change which installed in the wsi rice field and aligned with the ec system in a northwest direction the configuration location and measurement of the micro lysimeters were described in liu et al 2018 in more detail the soil moisture condition in the micro lysimeters was managed to match the soil moisture condition in surrounding farmland deep seepage measured by drainage lysimeter which had an area of 2 5 m 2 m and a depth of 1 3 m drained through a water permeable tube 40 mm in inner diameter installed 1 2 m below the soil surface into the gallery deep seepage volumes were measured by using an automatic tipping bucket gauge placed at the end of the system the volumetric soil moisture content was also routinely monitored daily 08 00 lt by time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corporation united states at 0 0 2 m 0 1 0 3 m and 0 2 0 4 m depths the soil surface temperature ts 0 was calculated using a harmonic method horton et al 1983 horton and wierenga 1983 based on ts measured at a depth of 0 10 m ts 10 at 5 day intervals over the growing season canopy height hc and leaf area index lai were measured for five fixed plants and averaged for intervening days hc and lai was determined by linear interpolation 2 2 theory and formula 2 2 1 water balance equation in general et could be calculated directly from water balance equation applied over a given period evett et al 2012 1 δ m p i w d w s e t where δm is the sum of change during the period in soil water stored in the control volume mm p and i are precipitation and irrigation mm respectively wd and ws are drainage correspond to the surface runoff and deep seepage mm respectively and et is the field evapotranspiration mm side leakage of paddy field is not considered for the eq 1 p and i can be considered as known variables drainage is triggered by field water level after rainfall and wd is determined accordingly ws of paddy field is calculated according to an equation eq 6 proposed by shi et al 2013 for flooded and non flooded conditions respectively another unknown variable et in eq 1 can be calculated by p m formula based on the energy balance and aerodynamics theory so far δm can be calculated according to the water balance equation and then the soil moisture content at the next time step can also be inferred which implements a recurrence in time 2 2 2 energy balance equation assuming that the energy converted into chemical energy by green plants and the horizontal flow of energy caused by advection between the soil surface and the level of the eddy covariance instrumentation were negligible then the energy balance equation of a terrestrial surface is simplified as 2 l e h s r n g 0 s where le is the latent heat flux w m 2 hs is the sensible heat flux w m 2 rn is the net radiation w m 2 g0 is the surface soil heat flux w m 2 g0 gs q8 with gs being the soil heat flux measured at 8 cm beneath soil surface by heat flux plates and q8 being the change in soil heat storage in 0 8 cm surface soil s is the canopy heat storage in biomass and water content w m 2 detailed methods of the correction of energy imbalance and the enforcing closure have been presented by xu et al 2017 it is worth noting that q8 were not measured directly it can be determined approximately based on the change in soil temperature of 10 cm depth meyers and hollinger 2004 heitman et al 2010 following the equation of eq 25 for the eq 2 le in the energy balance equation is equivalent to et and can be calculated by multiplying with λ rn is the input which was measured directly g0 is calculated based on its correlation with net radiation which was calibrated using the measured dataset s is neglected since it accounted for less than 2 of the available energy during the rice cultivation season deduced from a concentration profile method inside the canopy leuning et al 2012 and then hs was calculated by energy balance equation eq 2 2 2 3 variables for water heat coupling the et water in millimeter equivalent to le and θ were considered as the key variables in the water heat coupling process of paddy field water balances are linked to energy balances because the latent energy evapotranspiration appears as a key element in both balances thus et le is the main way of water consumption and energy output in rice field ecosystem and is also a vital link between water and heat transformation fig 1 meanwhile θ as the main variable reflecting the particularity of the wsi environment is not only an important factor affecting the ws and et in the water balance equation but also affecting the energy flux g0 and q as well as the soil heat state ts 0 and ts 10 in the energy balance therefore the two variables are links to reflect the close relationship between water cycle and energy conversion for the simulation of hydrothermal state in the spac system and then the water heat coupling relationship can be constructed in the wsi rice field 2 3 statistical analysis performance of the model was verified using four indicators the linear regression slope coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement ioa these indicators were used to evaluate the correlation between the measured and simulated variables 3 model description and development 3 1 system schematization allocation and conversion of the water and energy in spac system of rice field can be described by a schematic diagram fig 1 which is divided into three layers an atmosphere layer at reference height a canopy layer at the height of momentum transfer confluence based on the p m big leaf model and a soil surface layer with the shallow flooding water occasionally the model emphasizes the state of hydrothermal equilibrium rather than the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic transport processes several assumptions are made on the canopy layer at this study the canopy layer between soil surface and crop height is considered as a big leaf when calculating energy and water balance and the canopy resistance is used to represent the critical controls on heat and vapor flux transfer through the spac system within the canopy monteith 1965 katerji et al 2011 the transfer amount from molecular diffusion is negligible comparing with that from turbulent diffusion due to the wind speed the net radiation is essentially balanced by the sum of soil heat sensible heat and latent heat flux 3 2 model development data in 2014 and 2015 n 5086 rice season were used as training datasets for calibration of the water heat coupling model the input meteorological variables of the model are rn ta d and v all of them are routine meteorological data the other inputs for soil crop and others are field specific values and model parameters should be calibrated values which are introduced in the following words in details given the initial values of soil moisture content θ10 0 and soil surface temperature ts 10 0 at a depth of 0 10 m the water and heat fluxes can be calculated according to the process of energy balance and water balance the main outputs of the model include g0 le hs et θ10 ts 0 ts 10 tc lai and hc the coupled model can not only simulate the variation of lai and hc but also reflect the processes of evapotranspiration as well as the energy balance conversion according to the surface water balance relationship evapotranspiration et can be expressed as 3 e t 3600 l e ρ λ p i w d w s δ m 4 δ m 1000 δ z θ 10 i θ 10 i 1 where ρ is the density of dry air kg m 3 λ is the latent flux of heat mj kg 1 λ 2 501 2 361 10 3 ta with ta being the average temperature c δz is the change in soil depth m which is equal to 0 1 m in this study the same as the depth of heat flux calculation θ10 is the average volumetric soil water content in the 0 1 m soil layer m3 m 3 δm is the sum of change during the time period in soil water stored in the control volume mm if shallow flooding water was maintained then δm is equal the change of the water layer δhw mm note that the number 3600 is a time conversion from s to h and the superscript i is time index variables for time steps indicating the time of calculation the meaning of other symbols is the same as before theoretically the water balance equation is applicable to any temporal scale but in practice soil moisture is considered to vary relatively slowly in diurnal variation althought the irrigation and rainfall is with strong real time feature and so the water balance equation was considered on a daily time step for computational efficiency and accuracy and the variation of θ10 was deduced recursively the θ10 value of the next prediction time was determined by water balance equation after the initial value of the soil moisture content θ10 0 was given at the initial time of the simulation when the real time information of the surface water layer followed a rainfall or irrigation was obtained the time was taken as a new initial state and the calculation recycle again notably the difference in time steps between model components does mean that diurnal variability of soil moisture is not simulated and its influence on the surface energy balance is therefore overlooked however it wass not considered as a very significant factor for long term water balance studies silberstein et al 1999 thus according to the water balance theory the recurrence equation of soil moisture content can be expressed as 5 θ 10 i θ 10 i 1 e t i 1 p i 1 i i 1 w d i 1 w s i 1 δ z 1000 where pi 1 ii 1 are known as inputs wd i 1 is judged by rainfall and soil moisture at the previous moment ws i 1 and eti 1 are variables that need to be further determined the seepage volume of paddy field was calculated according to the following linear and non linear model based on the flooded and non flooded paddy soil respectively shi et al 2013 6 w s i a h w i b flooded 1000 k 0 1 k 0 ε t i δ z non flooded where hw is the depth of water above the soil surface mm a and b are parameters which should be determined in the model calibration k0 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m d 1 generally taken 0 1 1 0 m d 1 mainly related to the soil texture and the greater the soil viscosity the smaller the value ε is the empirical constant generally from 50 to 250 and the greater the soil viscosity the greater the value ti is the number of days that soil moisture content from a resent saturation state to i days in this study the seepage rate in paddy field was measured by drainage lysimeter according to the measured results the deep seepage of paddy field mainly occurred with shallow flooding water maintained in the field as well as in the middle and later tiller jointing and booting and heading to flowering stages without flooding the seepage during the period without flooding layer after the milk ripening was not considered in the calculation thus coefficients a and b in eq 6 were determined to be 0 125 and 0 262 based on the calibration dataset with flooding layer respectively coefficient of determination r2 0 789 and k0 0 3 and ε 140 based on the calibration dataset without flooding r2 0 602 assuming the seepage rate is the same at each time of the day and then the seepage rate of rice fields on a daily and hourly scale can be calculated another unknown variable et in eq 5 can be calculated by p m formula based on the energy balance and aerodynamics theory 7 λ e t 3600 δ r n g 0 ρ c p d r a δ γ 1 r c r a where λ is the latent flux of heat mj kg 1 λ 2 501 2 361 10 3 ta with ta being the average temperature c δ is the slope of the saturation to

resistance rc affected by numerous environmental variables simultaneously was calculated through an empirical multi factorial approach by the following equations jarvis 1976 ershadi et al 2015 xu et al 2017 the determination of canopy resistance is the key to calculating the evapotranspiration of the pm model to improve the performance of canopy resistance model under wsi condition a term of effective leaf area index laia was used to reflect the influence of canopy coverage condition and coefficients a4 was added in soil water response functions of jarvis type rc model as well as θf mostly used for upland crops was replace by θs due to the specific soil moisture condition in wsi rice fields 9 r c r s l a i a r min f 1 r n f 2 d f 3 t a f 4 θ 10 l a i a 10 f 1 r n 1 exp r n a 1 11

are weighing functions representing the effects of solar radiation humidity air temperature and soil moisture on plant stress θs 50 2 and θw 17 9 are saturated soil moisture and wilting point m3 m 3 respectively a1 a2 a3 and a4 are coefficients which should be determined in the model calibration laia is the effective leaf area index which considers that only the upper leaves in the canopy are active in heat and vapor transfer alves et al 1998 laia is equal to actual laifor lai 2 equal to lai 2 for lai 4 and equal 2 for intermediate values of lai gardiol et al 2003 notably in the present study laia in eq 9 was used to reflect the influence of canopy lai θs instead of field capacity θf was used as a key parameter in the soil water response functions of eq 13 a coefficient a4 was introduced to reflect the specific wetting drying cycle condition of soil moisture the three distinguishing features were the specific of the rc model responded to the special wsi condition then coefficients a1 a2 a3 and a4 in eqs 10 13 were determined to be 45 8 0 006 0 005 and 6 0 based on the 2014 and 2015 calibration dataset respectively additionally hc and lai are unknown variables in eqs 8 and 9 that need to be solved to calculate ra and rc respectively a good agreement was found between measured and fitted hc and lai values fig 2 with high r2 of 0 976 and 0 952 respectively but some discrepancies were found between measured and fitted lai values during re greening period doy 10 d doy days after transplanting so the simulated lai value was set to a fixed value of 0 3 when doy 10 d the relationships between hc and lai with days after transplanting were established respectively according to the calibration samples as follow and it is believed that the hourly values equal to the daily mean 14 h c 0 007 d o y 2 1 495 d o y 14 753 100 15 l a i 0 001 d o y 2 0 168 d o y 1 605 d o y 10 the energy component g0 an unknown variable in the process of the model derivation was described in more detail in the same wsi region in our previous research liu et al 2017 which reported the diurnal variations of g0 varied in the same pattern as rn a unimodal shape with negative values at night but at a 0 5 1 5 h lag behind rn in the present study drawing on data on the diurnal pattern of the ratio of g0 to rn in the daytime the quadratic function over time was used to describe the variation of ratio g0 to rn during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime the ratio of g0 to rn changed drastically due to the smaller g0 and rn values therefore the monthly average of g0 rn in 8 00 17 00 period is used to establish the quadratic function the relationship between the ratio of g0 to rn and time was shown in fig 3 the regressions were significant at α 0 001 confidence level with a high r2 of 0 868 the relationship between the two components at other times can be better characterized by a linear relationship r2 0 534 α 0 001 thus the relation of eq 16 served in calculating the variation of surface soil heat flux g0 at hourly scale and the daily value was calculated by the average of hourly values 16 g 0 r n 0 0045 t 2 0 133 t 0 799 8 00 t 17 00 0 236 r n 8 427 other time by substituting eqs 6 16 into eq 5 θi value in the next day can be obtained which is in preparation for the calculation of et at the next moment according to this recursive relation five variables of lai daily scale hc daily scale θ daily scale g0 hourly and daily scale and et hourly and daily scale can be calculated and then hs can be obtained according to the energy balance equation eq 17 so far the main components of water balance and energy balance in paddy fields can be output recursively 17 h s r n g 0 l e notably changes in soil moisture of rice field lead to dramatic changes in the soil moisture cycle and an obvious one is manifested as changes in soil evaporation e which in turn exert a profound influence on the water heat transfer of ecosystem the daily variation during the whole growth period for evaporation e was analyzed and the ratio of e to et was also discussed from earlier studies in the current experiment station under same condition liu et al 2016 the variation of e et in the whole growth period can be described by a quadric curve with days after transplanting as independent variable the comparison between the fitted curve and the observed data is shown in fig 4 and the curvilinear equation can be expressed as 18 e et 9e 05 doy 2 0 016 doy 0 928 in addition to water and energy balance components the model also predicts the temperature variation in the spac system water vapor and heat are carried away from the immediate vicinity of the soil or the canopy surface by turbulent bulk flow of parcels of air containing quantities of heat and vapor this turbulent flux is proportional to the vapor concentration or temperature difference between z1 and z2 thus the turbulent flux of sensible heat away from the surface is written as 19 h s η ρ c p t 1 ρ c p t 2 η ρ c p t 1 t 2 where t1 and t2 are the temperatures at heights z1 the soil or the canopy surface and z2 an arbitrary elevation c and η is the turbulent transfer coefficient for heat between z1 and z2 according to the aerodynamic transport equation eq 19 hs monitored by the ec system can be decomposed into two parts the soil surface to the canopy surface and the canopy surface to the height of 2 5 m the net flux is a transport of heat and water vapor in two consecutive spatial extents the η within and above the canopy is affected by the aerodynamic resistance from the soil surface to in canopy flow and that from the canopy surface to the reference height thus eq 19 may be rewritten in terms of the aerodynamic resistance 20 h s c ρ c p t s 0 t c 1 r a s d ρ c p t c t a 1 r a a where ts 0 tc and ta are the temperature of soil surface canopy surface and reference height c respectively r a a is the aerodynamic resistance of the mean canopy flow s m 1 calculated by eq 8 the same as the calculation formula of r a r a s is the aerodynamic resistance of the soil surface to in canopy flow s m 1 which is calculated from the vertical wind profile at the field and the eddy diffusion coefficient by eq 21 katerji and rana 2006 c and d are coefficients which should be determined in the model calibration for the calibration phase the coefficients c and d were determined to be 2 054 and 0 408 respectively the highly significant α 0 001 was confirmed by a r2 of 0 766 rmse of 11 435 w m 2 21 r a s ln z m d z o m k 2 u h c exp ζ ζ h c d exp ζ z o h h c exp ζ d z o m h c where ξ is the extinction coefficient of the eddy diffusion chosen as a typical value for crops wheat rice clover and corn with a value of 2 5 monteith 1973 and other variable symbols are the same as before certainly ts 0 and tc in eq 20 are not input variables ts 0 is the key variable of water heat exchange between soil and atmosphere but only the measured values of soil temperature ts 10 ts 20 and ts 30 at 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m below the surface of the earth are available no measured value of ts 0 therefore based on the soil texture and soil moisture conditions in the experimental area the study results of jury and horton 2004 on the correlation between ts 0 and ts 10 ts 20 and ts 30 of heavy loam were analyzed it was found that the ratio of ts 0 to ts 10 had a sinusoidal variation relationship and the correlation of ts 0 ts 10 with time can be expressed as 22 t s 0 t s 10 a b sin π t c 12 where a b and c are model parameters t is time hourly time steps been chosen to calculate temperature and heat storage a 1 001 b 0 059 and c 15 504 were fitted with origin 85 good performance of the fitted model with a r2 0 979 fig 5 thus ts 0 can be expressed as 23 t s 0 t s 10 1 001 0 059 sin π t 15 504 12 in the above expression ts 10 can be calculated according to the change in soil heat storage in 0 10 cm surface soil q10 ochsner et al 2007

calculated by the training dataset fig 6 the variation trends of g10 and g0 are similar but the phase of the g10 wave is retarded with respect to the surface soil heat flux by a time lag of 1 h same as the time interval of the study period it can be assumed that q10 i is the response to g0 i 1 in the previous hour so that the correlation between q10 i and g0 i 1 was established based on training data samples fig 7 r2 0 814 α 0 001 27 q 10 i 0 513 g 0 i 1 3 115 as listed in the above derivation process five steps must be taken to determine three temperature variables ts 0 ts 10 and tc in the spac system first g0 must be determined second the correlation between q10 i and g0 i 1 must be established using some approximation of eq 26 third the change of heat storage above the reference depth is estimated based on the soil volumetric heat capacity and temperature and the formal relationship must be established fourth the sinusoidal variation relationship of ts 0 ts 10 with time should be calibrated fifth tc in eq 20 must be calculated using some specific calibration variables of eqs 21 27 so far all the non input variables in the above model can be recursively solved the model reflects the water heat relationship in the spac system and should be capable in coupling simulation of water heat in the water saving irrigated paddy field 3 3 model operation a simplified sequence flow diagram was used to illustrate the operation of water heat coupling model fig 8 the model was run in the rice growth stage at hourly time step initially the model driving variables included conventional meteorological data rn ta d and v which were obtained from the ec system and the automatic meteorological station measurements the model initial conditions of soil temperature at 0 1 m depths ts 10 0 and water content θ 0 were given based on the measurements by 109 tcav soil thermocouple probes and cs616 soil moisture reflectometers respectively the functions of crop growth lai and hc were fitted according to the training samples with the days after transplanting as independent variable laii and hc i were considered to be the same values at each hour of the day that is the daily average was equal to the hourly value then water and heat variables were calculated in turn all input variables for the model are hourly time steps and the output variables may be hourly or daily time steps the soil moisture condition needs to be re entered as initial condition when rainfall or irrigation results in the shallow flooding water to satisfy the calculation condition of seepage model and reduce the cumulative error in soil moisture calculation the input and output variables of the model were enumerated in tables 1 and 2 and the simulation results were presented in the following section 4 4 model verification and analysis verification of the proposed coupling model was done by comparing the recursive estimated with experimental data the model validation period was the rice season of year 2016 based on calibrated model profiles of crop growth characteristics water and heat balance components and soil and canopy temperatures could be simulated the feasibility and accuracy of the model were analyzed at hourly and daily time step 4 1 crop parameters lai and hc based on eq 15 the dynamic variation of lai along with days after rice transplantation was shown in fig 9 a lai increased gradually with the growth of rice reached its maximum at 80 90 days after transplanting and then decreased slightly the simulated values were slightly deviated at the early and the vigorous growth stage of rice closely matching the measured values in other periods fig 9b the highly significant α 0 001 linear regression was confirmed by r2 of 0 974 rmse of 0 293 and the index of agreement ioa of 0 994 the dynamic change of hc was also described along with the days after transplanting as the figure explained that the simulated value of hc was in good agreement with the measured value α 0 001 with a slight underestimation at peak period fig 10 with the increase of rice growth hc increased first and then tended to be flat after 100 days since transplantation r2 rmse and ioa were 0 948 3 742 cm and 0 987 respectively good performance of the crop lai and hc simulation provides reliable basic crop data for the accurate simulation of water and heat fluxes in wsi rice field 4 2 model response to water status of paddy field 4 2 1 soil moisture content one of the key points in verifying soil moisture variation process was ensuring that the soil moisture condition was re entered as initial condition when rainfall or irrigation resulted in the shallow flooding water fig 11 displayed the daily variation of soil water status in water saving irrigated paddy field the model captured the seasonal variation pattern of soil water content and surface water layer although some discrepancies occurred between the simulated and observed values it was slightly overestimated when a deeper flooding water was maintained possible as results that there were side seepage and other water consumption in the actual paddy field during flooded period and the actual water consumption was larger than the simulated condition by and large the model shows very good performance on θ and hw deduced by daily time step three indicators r2 rmse and ioa were 0 876 1 520 cm 3 cm 3 and 0 966 for θ and 0 991 1 362 mm and 0 997 for hw respectively fig 12 4 2 2 evapotranspiration and evaporation the most important process which determines the coupling between water and heat is the transport of latent heat by vapor flux within the soil and at the interface between the soil and the atmosphere in order to quantify the simulation performance of et an important component in water balance water in millimeter equivalent to le in energy balance when optimal parameterizations were adopted the modeled et were plotted against the observed ones as depicted in fig 13 a the scatter plots fig 13a confirmed that all the data were moderately little dispersed around the 1 1 line showing no significant biases in the modeled et α 0 001 the regression slopes were 1 023 rmse 0 047 mm h 1 with r2 of 0 964 and ioa of 0 991 both close to 1 0 the modeled e were also plotted against the observed ones showing a quite good agreement fig 13a although the distribution of discrete degree was slightly larger than et the regression slope r2 rmse and ioa were 0 978 0 770 0 061 mm h 1 and 0 932 respectively the latent heat le appears as evapotranspiration in the spac system which is a crucial component of its energy cycle in this study seven days in different growth periods were selected out in 2016 rice season either with sunny fig 14 a or cloudy days fig 14b respectively to analyze the performance of the simulated et and e variation of soil moisture condition θ and hw in the seven sunny days corresponded to days 16 22 35 62 74 101 and 115 after transplanting and corresponded to days 10 33 51 71 94 and 118 in the six cloudy days respectively in general the et calculated by the model were in a good agreement with the measured value ioa 0 993 and 0 973 for sunny and cloudy days the diurnal variation curves of e were basically the same as et although the simulation results were not as good as that of et due to the results containing the errors caused by the simulation of et in addition there were no significant difference in the simulation of et with or without flooding water from figs 11 and 14 however the model overestimated hourly e at noon time both in sunny i e july 23th and cloudy days i e july 11th and august 21th when flooding water was maintained or soil was saturated thus the agreement between hourly simulated and measured e values was good other than during the period with flooding or soil moisture saturation by substituting the daily scale data into water balance formula and pm model daily et can be also simulated drawing on data on the relationship between e and et proposed in previous studies the daily e was calculated and plotted in fig 13b the regressions between simulated and measured values were significant at α 0 001 confidence level the slope of the ols regression was 0 909 for et and 0 976 for e both close to 1 0 r2 and rmse were 0 977 and 0 218 mm d 1 for et and 0 896 and 0 402 mm d 1 for e respectively and ioa values were close to 1 with values of 0 990 and 0 970 respectively it indicated that the modeled et and e values were more consistent with measured values at daily scale than at hourly scale possible as results of the simulation errors of hourly et noon and during transition period from daytime to nighttime offset each other when et was calculated at daily scale same as the hourly scale calculation the performance of modeled e was not as good as that of et model performance in daily et and e calculation were assessed in wsi paddy fields fig 15 by and large the simulated and measured values of seasonally et and e varied in a similar trend while the simulated value tended to underestimate the measured value in varied degrees in re greening stage performed getting better along with the crop growth in late season the good performance of the proposed model at high lai may be linked to the assumption of the pm equation a single source big leaf model 4 3 model response to heat status of paddy field 4 3 1 soil heat flux surface soil heat flux g0 is an important heat flux for model output compared with the measured g0 which was derived from the soil heat flux measured at 8 cm beneath soil surface by heat flux plates gs and the change in soil heat storage in 0 8 cm surface soil q8 the coupled model resulted in acceptable accuracy fig 16 a the linear regression between the measured and simulated g0 was significant at α 0 001 confidence level r2 rmse and ioa were 0 789 17 500 w m 2 and 0 942 respectively the results also indicated that simulated hourly g0 was less accurate when g0 was higher than 40 w m 2 the simulated daily g0 accumulated as the sum of hourly data was compared with the measured values and the ols regression between them were plotted in fig 16b r2 rmse and ioa were 0 561 4 394 w m 2 and 0 899 respectively the confidential level of is high with α 0 001 also typical diurnal g0 variations in sunny fig 17 a and cloudy days fig 17b were selected out to evaluate the performance of the water heat coupling model in hourly g0 calculation at different rice growth stages simulated g0 varied in the same pattern as measured values in sunny days in all the growth stages while tending to overestimate or underestimate the measured values in various degrees at noontime or during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime especially in early growth stage considering with the soil moisture content simulated hourly g0 did not always predict the actual values when the soil was flooded either in sunny i e july 23th and october 24th or cloudy days i e july 11th august 21th and october 27th especially during noon with higher available energy it showed that the distribution of energy was changed when flooding water was maintained which had a certain influence on the simulation of g0 notably using ts 10 instead of soil temperature at depths of 8 cm to calculate q8 then the q8 at daytime will be lower this might be the reason why simulated g0 was greater in sunny days in fig 17 a in addition the measured g0 decreased suddenly and abruptly during the transition periods from daytime to nighttime resulting in fairly large simulation error which was subject to the measurement error due to the phase lag of the measured value some time being necessary for the heat flux plate to response to the energy change poblete echeverría et al 2014 fig 18 shows the daily variation of measured and simulated g0 corresponding variation of rn generally the g0 varied with rn showed a tendency of gradually decreasing during the whole growth period the correlation between simulated and measured values was better at the regreening and early tillering stages because of the canopy coverage was low the conversion of rn to g0 was less affected by the underlying surface and canopy heat storage during the vigorous period of rice growth middle or later tillering and jointing to booting stages the simulated g0 differed greatly from the measured value with a certain degree of overestimation the reasons might be that some energy losses such as canopy or water heat storage energy advection losses etc was neglected in simulating g0 and the measured values greatly affected by various energy transfer resistance so the calculated results were larger in addition the accumulation of errors in the calculation from hourly scale to daily scale also led to the difference between the simulated and measured values after heading to flowering the model performed better for g0 simulation due to the flat and uniform underlying surface which is close to the ideal condition for ec measurement and also conforms to the assumption of the single source big leaf model xu et al 2017 4 3 2 sensible heat flux in the water heat coupling model the residual term of the energy balance equation was deemed to represent the sensible heat flux hs regardless of the hourly or daily scale therefore the error in hs simulation reflect the cumulative error of the model to a certain extent regression analysis of the simulation results of hourly and daily scale hs was shown in fig 19 the regressions were significant at α 0 001 confidence level and the regression slopes of hourly and daily data were 0 913 and 0 941 respectively which were slightly underestimated r2 rmse and ioa were 0 595 and 0 562 20 915 and 5 697 w m 2 0 871 and 0 841 respectively the performance in hs simulation was slightly lower than that of g0 and le the diurnal variation of simulated and measured hs values in typical sunny and cloudy days in light of subplots in fig 20 was roughly the same but the simulation error was larger than that of other heat fluxes the big gap between the two hs data sets at noon time or during the transition period from day to night was ascribed to the accumulative error in simulation of et and g0 especially obvious in cloudy days the simulation of hs was also directly affected by soil moisture content the water heat coupling model substantially overestimated hourly hs at noon time in cloudy days i e july 11th august 21th and october 27th under waterlogged condition reason might be that change in energy storage in the flooding water was not considered in the calculation of energy balance thus hs as the residual of the energy balance equation was overestimated especially in the period with larger water consumption at noon for daily flux of hs the simulated value and measured value were consistent in temporal variation basically as depicted in fig 21 while the error in simulated hs was also larger than that of other heat fluxes the error in simulated hs was big during the period with low canopy coverage condition and shallow flooding water maintained in addition the measured g0 was overestimated greatly as a result underestimation of hs occurred during the vigorous growth stage of rice 4 3 3 soil and canopy temperature thermal gradients affect water vapor redistribution which is the key factor affecting hydrothermal conversion the model outputs temperatures of ts 0 ts 10 and tc since ts 0 was not measured directly in current research and it was calculated from ts 10 simulated ts 10 was investigated to show the performance of the model the results of model simulated vs the observed data were presented in figs 22 24 for temperatures ts 10 and tc on different observation layers fig 22 showed the simulated ts 10 and tc with those measured values the r2 rmse and ioa were 0 865 and 0 843 1 697 and 2 773 c and 0 958 and 0 948 respectively it performed slightly better in simulating ts 10 than tc t c is the last variable deduced in the couple model according to the flowchart fig 8 of model error were accumulated in the calculation as a result data points deviated slightly from 1 1 line in the linear regression especially during period with high temperatures in typical days the diurnal variation of ts 10 showed a cosine fluctuation pattern the daily temperature range is greater on sunny days than that on cloudy days see fig 23a and b and the degree to match a cosine line in daily variation became less obvious with the decrease of daily temperature range in cloudy days overall the simulated ts 10 agreed well with observed values however the overestimation or underestimation of the simulated values were not consistent in different weather conditions during the same growth period which was closely related to the soil moisture content the simulated values were generally greater than measured values on both sunny and cloudy days especially during the days july 11th 23th august 21th october 24th and 27th with shallow flooding water maintained a possible explanation might be the flooding water consumes a part of energy for water heating and evaporation and the corresponding energy reaching the soil surface decreases however the thermal storage in surface water was not considered in the simulation so the simulated ts 10 was higher than the actual value it was also found that when θ was lower than θf august 3th and september 1th the simulated ts 10 was smaller than the measured value and for θf θ θs the model showed a good performance on ts 10 simulation generally diurnal variation of simulated tc varied in the consistent pattern with measured tc on typical sunny and cloudy days but the former fluctuated more sharply see fig 23c and d the fluctuation magnitude of tc was larger than that of ts 10 means it is more sensitive to the change of air temperature the error of simulated tc was due to the fact that the result of tc estimation was based on estimation of hs and ts 10 and the result reflected the cumulative error of hs and ts 10 to a certain extent in addition the gap between the simulated and measured data were more obvious in the early growth stage due to the low canopy coverage tc measured by infrared thermometer suffered from lack of representative for a sparse canopy which partially accounted for the error between the measured and the simulated temperature the temporal variation of daily ts 10 and tc were depicted in fig 24 the simulated daily tc agreed well in temporal variation with the measured tc while the consistency between the simulated ts 10 and observed ones was relatively low mainly influenced by the flooding water in rice growth stage ts 10 and tc were both largely affected by rn and the curves of their seasonal variation were basically the same as rn too on daily scale r2 and rmse were 0 867 and 1 679 c for ts 10 and 0 971 and 0 929 c for tc respectively and ioa values were close to 1 with values of 0 959 and 0 989 respectively it indicated that the novel coupled model performed very well at daily step in calculating tc possible because that the underestimate and overestimate of tc occurred in the same day offset each other when tc was calculated at daily step 5 conclusions hydrological cycle components as well as energy cycle components at hourly and daily scales in the wsi rice field were simulated and analyzed by using a holistic recursive model of water heat coupling which was proposed in the current study and the goodness of fit parameters were presented for wsi rice fields in general less easy available input variables were needed in the coupled model one major advantage for the water heat coupling model in wsi rice field was that takes the specific wetting drying cycle condition into consideration in the calculation of the rc and the recursive process of the model variations in lai hc and meteorology were considered but the complex process of crop growth was not additionally temperatures ts 0 ts 10 and tc in the spac system were modeled with five steps proposed by this study which was linked to the aerodynamic transport theory and the calculation of soil heat storage based on soil temperature and moisture data notably the model was established and calibrated based on the measured values there are few empirical parameters thus the novel model developed with the estimated parameters from this study consisted of a framework for water heat status simulations performed in the spac system at hourly and daily steps in view of its accuracy and applicability the model will capable in predicting results beyond the current literature data so long as inputs are available and can be a reference for model development for other crops in future acknowledgements this

10921,rice is threatened by the inefficient use of water and fertilizer however understanding the effects of water regimes and soil clay contents on morphology and physiology of plant roots and their relations to yield and nutrient use efficiency is essential to improve rice productivity in this regard three experimental soils were conducted with three soil clay content levels namely light clay s lc medium clay s mc and heavy clay s hc and three irrigation regimes namely alternate wetting and 0 soil drying awsd0 alternate wetting and 10 soil drying awsd10 alternate wetting and 30 soil drying awsd30 over july october in 2018 the experiment was a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement with three replications the results showed that responses of roots and shoots and the nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake of rice were significantly affected by the water regimes and soil clay contents under the same water regime root morphology and physiology biomass production and npk utilization of rice were higher in high clay soil than light clay soil under the same soil clay content awsd0 regime was the optimal water management practice for growing rice providing the highest grain yield whereas awsd30 regime was improper water management option for rice offering the lowest grain yield the combination awsd0 s hc resulted in the greatest values of the apparent recovery efficiency are of npk applied at aren 43 4 arep 20 4 and arek 67 2 as well as the highest values of partial factor productivity pfp of npk applied at pfpn 19 7 g g 1 pfpp 31 9 g g 1 and pfpk 41 1 g g 1 respectively conversely the treatment awsd30 s lc resulted in the lowest values of are of npk applied at aren 8 3 arep 3 0 and arek 6 7 as well as the lowest values of pfp of npk applied at pfpn 7 0 g g 1 pfpp 11 9 g g 1 and pfpk 12 2 g g 1 respectively root length density root weight density root active absorption area root oxidation ability and root surface phosphatase were higher in awsd0 s hc than that in awsd70 s lc while the former combination increased npk contents in the rhizosphere the latter their reduced availability due to the increment in ph and redox potential of the soil the results are important for rice water management option in the paddy clay soil the results also suggest that the adoption of alternate wetting and soil drying regimes should guarantee morphological and physiological improvements in root traits by which contributes to greater biomass production larger npk acquisition and thus better npk utilization of rice keywords root morphology root physiology water regime soil texture nutrient utilization oryza sativa l 1 introduction agriculture is now facing the challenge of providing sufficient food for the rapidly growing population under increasing water shortage rice is one of the most vital staple food crops feeding over 60 of the chinese population xiong et al 2013 and 40 of the global population datta et al 2017 freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce and rice farming ingests nearly 65 of the chinese freshwater resources cheng 2007 mainly irrigated rice peng et al 2009 to cope with water depletion several water saving technologies have been introduced such as aerobic rice and wetting and alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation zhang et al 2011 lampayan et al 2015a in awd practice the field is bunded to keep the soil flooded to a depth of 5 cm whenever the ponded water level has dropped to 15 cm below the soil surface linquist et al 2015 lampayan et al 2015b soil affects crop root growth the main organ in water and nutrient uptake and paddy soils are now under flooding or water saving irrigation the integration of water regime and soil texture produces an interactive effect on the growing environment of rice alhaj hamoud et al 2019a in paddy soil continuously flooding cf irrigation adjusts soil properties permitting easier root penetration cf irrigation also leads to higher soluble nutrient but lesser nutrient losses than awd irrigation gordon et al 2008 prasad et al 2017 in awd irrigation the soil is undergoing key changes shifting from flooded to non flooded conditions linquist et al 2015 lampayan et al 2015b such alternative shifts result in a relatively dramatic change in the soil physio chemical environment this environment regulates root and shoot growth of rice hamoud et al 2018 it also alters several soil chemical properties that determine nutrient availability including soil ph and redox potential wissuwa et al 2006 huguenin elie et al 2003 sahrawat 2012 in addition the nutrients uptake of rice in awd differs from that of cf due to the physiological response of rice to water stress and nutrients availability in the method of awd yang et al 2004a belder et al 2005 under the awd system rice roots absorb water inefficiently since plant essential elements are less available in the rhizosphere in addition low mineral nutrition affects the overall development of the plant bunnag and pongthai 2013 therefore soil moisture regime influences the process of root and shoot development in clay soils bandyopadhyay et al 2003 hamoud et al 2018 as well as nutrients availability in the root zone it also affects nutrients uptake and nutrient use efficiency of rice sander and gerke 2007 the consequences of all these variations necessitate addressing the interactive impact of water regimes and soil clay content on root zone chemistry to cope with nutrient inefficiency and improve root and shoot growth thus grain yield and nutrient use efficiency of rice globally rice yield has improved due to the enhancement in fertilizer inputs fageria 2007 peng et al 2009 faostat 2013 most of the focus on nutrient use efﬁciency is on n yet efﬁciency of n of rice is only 20 30 and a large amount of n is lost to the environment peng et al 2010 the use efﬁciency of p is also of interest the efﬁciency of p is 10 30 and the remaining amount of p is either lost by runoff and leakage or fixed by other soil minerals prasad et al 2017 ghosh et al 2015 there is a little known about the use efﬁciency of k the efﬁciency of k is 20 60 while the remained amount is fixed or leaked ghosh et al 2015 it is evident that nutrients application is inefficiently used by the crop such that further increases in n p and k fertilizer are unlikely to be effective in increasing cereal yield ghosh et al 2015 chinese agriculture is now facing many demanding challenges for ensuring environmental sustainability china has become the largest fertilizer user worldwide and farmers have resorted to the use of excessive fertilization to maintain yield levels li et al 2015 inefficient input of fertilizers have contributed to low nutrient use efﬁciency which subsequently caused serious soil degradation eutrophication groundwater pollution and emission of ammonia and greenhouse gases peng et al 2010 by surface runoff losses leaching into groundwater and volatilization into the atmosphere spiertz 2010 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2016 therefore to reduce negative environmental impacts the development of water saving and fertilizer efﬁcient technologies should be sought to consistently match high grain production and large nutrient utilization of rice as rice plants are sensitive to soil moisture variations rice roots response to different soil moisture regimes in addition rice root production differs with soil texture differences dou et al 2016 therefore plant root morphology is regulated by the availability of water and nutrients petricka et al 2012 and rice root morphology plays an essential role in water and nutrient absorption from soil wang and smith 2004 yang et al 2004b for instance large roots can improve overall plant growth and high root activity coordinates strong nutrient uptake which supports great biomass production and high nutrient utilization of rice chu et al 2015 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a therefore the impact of soil clay content on different systems of irrigated rice needs more investigation henceforward rice root responses to irrigation regimes and soil clay content and their relations to yield and nutrient use efficiency are of increasing interest in the southern part of china rice occupies over 70 of the cultivated area producing 88 of national rice ma et al 2013 a remarkable amount of freshwater is diverted for rice cultivation under cf irrigation threatening rice production lin et al 2014 instead awd irrigation is recommended to overcome the consequences of water depletion given the increasing necessity to the introduction of rice agricultural water management the adoption of water saving techniques is required in addition the water efficient irrigation regime should basically provide optimum soil moisture conditions thereby providing a favorable growth medium for absorption of water and nutrients thus desirable crop growth and marketable yield therefore the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different water regimes on the rice root morphology and physiology and their relations to dry matter production and nutrient utilization in south china counties clay soils offer the highest nutrients supplying potential xie et al 1990 and most irrigated paddy soils are categorized into clay cabangon et al 2011 silt clay lampayan et al 2015b and clay loam cabangon et al 2004 mainly soil clay content can influence rice root morphology and physiology concomitantly shoot growth hence biomass production nutrient acquisition and utilization in addition understanding the impact of soil moisture regime on release and ﬁxation of nutrients in the soil as well as soil ability to supply nutrients are very important factors to increase grain yield and fertilizer productivity of rice therefore this study focused on the effect of soil clay content on the nutrient acquisition and utilization of rice 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and

complete block design composed of two factors the water regime and soil clay content with three replications the first factor was irrigation regime with three different water management options

during awsd30 awsd10 and awsd0 respectively under the same water regime ñcg and ñcs of rice plant followed the same trend of increased when the clay content increased where the highest n p and k

lowest soil clay content s lc as shown in table 6 4 discussion the soil eh identifies the presence of nutrients that are important for plant growth tokarz and urban 2015 cf irrigation depletes the rhizosphere o2 leading to a reduction in soil eh sahrawat 2000 while increasing the availability of iron and manganese forms in the rhizosphere delaune et al 1998 tokarz and urban 2015 awsd0 decreased the soil eh while increased the n and k contents in the rhizosphere as a result of an exchange reaction due to the increase of iron and manganese forms also reducing conditions in flooded soil decrease the rhizosphere ph gao et al 2006 causing npk nutrients to be more available to the plant pii et al 2015 sahrawat 2015 therefore roots under awsd0 could lower the rhizosphere ph by generating h in the oxidation of ferrous iron and by releasing h to balance the excess intake of cations over anions kirk et al 1993 consequently the role of soil eh and ph in modifying the dynamics of n p and k nutrients in the rhizosphere can be potentially used for optimizing rice production the greatest n p and k contents under awsd0 s hc was due to the ability of s hc to release high amounts of n and k and high soluble p caused by acidification of rhizosphere the acidiﬁcation increases in the rice root zone under cf conditions kirk et al 1993 pii et al 2015 rising the solubilization of n p and k in the rhizosphere on the contrary water stress in awsd30 s lc resulted in less available n p and k nutrients in the soil it has been reported that the increased soil ph decreases p solubility and stimulates the adsorption of n and k onto soil clay minerals which are linked to a significant decline in n and k concentrations in the soil also changing from soil flooded to more soil aeration can affect the biogeochemical processes influencing nutrient supply to crops huguenin elie et al 2008 buresh and haefele 2010 kirk 2004 sahrawat 2012 therefore alternative wetting and soil drying regime is highly dynamic in rice system and it inﬂuences availability of n p and k in the paddy soil fig 2 root morphology enhanced under awsd0 and awsd0 s hc by generating large tsa in contact with the soil via large aaa indicating abundant npk nutrients available to vigorous roots rice root morphology depends on the changes in the soil with water regime and changes in npk availability with water regime huguenin elie et al 2008 alhaj hamoud et al 2019b in addition the large rooting system is vital to npk plants uptake lynch 2013 chu et al 2015 in our study awsd0 and awsd0 s hc treatments improved root uptake of npk producing large shoot biomass of rice prevoiusly alternate wetting and low soil drying regime increased improve rice morphology xu et al 2018 and a positive relationship between root growth and biomass yield of rice were revealed sharma et al 1995 bandyopadhyay et al 2003 the shortage in npk nutrients under awsd30 and awsd30 s lc could restrict the growth of roots and thus tsa and aaa in this case the morphology of the root was damaged which aﬀ ected the physiology of root yang et al 2012 in soils which are water stressed there was reduced adaptation of roots to the aerobic condition that limits the exploitation of deeper soil layers hence reducing rice root growth kondhia et al 2015 further rice root morphology under awd was reduced compared to cf conditions kato and okami 2011 therefore in our study root traits inﬂuencing the intake of n p and k include rl tsa and aaa in the soil layer all of which increase the volume of soil explored by the root system and the aaa for the uptake of nutrients hence superior rice root morphology can coordinate higher biomass production as well as larger n p and k utilization increasing clay content strengthen soil s ability to capture nutrients and allow rice plants to develop a stronger rooting system furthermore larger tsa and aaa enhanced better npk uptake enhancing overall plant growth thus improving rice productivity morphologically growth and dry mass of rice root in clay loam soil were better than in sandy loam soil kibria 2008 further nutrients application into paddy soil evidently increased root morphological traits of rice plants xu et al 2018 in response to cf rice roots form gas spaces aerenchyma colmer and pedersen 2008 permitting the transport of o2 from shoots to roots and the ventilation of gases from roots to shoots colmer 2003 evans 2004 in rice aerenchyma is constitutively formed under aerobic conditions and further enhanced during soil flooding shiono et al 2010 therefore under awsd0 and awsd0 s hc conditions rice was capable of generating large growth roots transporting from shoots great amount of o2 to roots through aerenchyma conversely under awsd30 s lc conditions rice was incapable of generating large growth roots transferring a little amount of o2 through air space tissue therefore the roa was directly proportional to the growth of the root system thus a direct relationship was realized between rice root morphological growth and roa correspondingly root branching affects o2 distribution in the rhizosphere kirk 2003 mishra and salokhe 2010 also rice root morphology and the roa were significantly affected by the availability of soil nutrients under different water regimes mishra and uphoff 2013 xu et al 2018 therefore a higher roa is required for achieving higher biomass yield ju et al 2015 yang et al 2012 which support the results of the current study the difference in the roa under different soils indicated that roots developed in s hc received more o2 from the shoot than that roots developed in s mc and s lc therefore high roa appeared to be due to large roots with great tsa and aaa generated in s h transporting a high amount of o2 from shoots morphological traits of rice roots were greatly affected by the availability of soil nutrients under different water regimes mishra and uphoff 2013 a higher rsp refers to sufficient p root tissue concntrations compared lower to rsp mclachlan 1980 helal 1990 tadano et al 1993 high p root tissue content is explained by high available p in the root environment associated with high plant p uptake under low ph in the rhizosphere therefore high rsp under awsd0 s hc and awsd0 s hc referred to i increasing p availability to root ii high p supply from vigorous roots to shoots conversely the low rsp indicated impaired p availability as well as reduced roots and shoots under awsd30 s lc and awsd30 s lc correspondingly physiological responses of rice were greatly affected by the availability of soil nutrients under different irrigation regimes mishra and uphoff 2013 xu et al 2018 the increase in the biomass yield of rice was due to the availability of water to roots under awsd0 as well as the ability of s hc to hold more nutrients providing typical demands of soluble npk for rice under the combination awsd0 s hc such conditions encouraged overall plant growth hamoud et al 2018 and higher rice panicles were achieved in cf than awd irrigation bunnag and pongthai 2013 dou et al 2016 as cf increased the availability of npk nutrients while awd reduced their accessibility carmeis filho et al 2017 in addition the length of the panicle decides the number of grains it can hold kobayasi et al 2002 cheng et al 2007 and thus rice yield xing and zhang 2010 in our research panicle length and grain yield under awsd0 was higher than that under awsd10 and awsd30 which related to n p and k availability in the rhizosphere the s hc could provide favorable conditions to the roots promoting the growth of rice tillers therefore the total biomass compared to s mc and s lc consequently increasing soil clay contents created differences on soil fertility which affected the yield of rice consistently the differences in soil texture affected nutrient supply of rice further impacted shoot growth tsubo et al 2007 dou et al 2016 in addition higher grain yield of rice in high clay soils than those in low clay soils dou et al 2016 rao et al 2013 the decline in the vegetative growth and yield of rice under awsd30 s lc was attributed to the limited supply of npk nutrients within the rhizosphere equally the unfavorable nutrient regime for plant nutrients was created under aerobic conditions sahrawat 2012 while the grain yield of rice is highly depending on the number of tillers huang et al 2011 and rice yield reduced in the order of cf and awd regimes belder et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 moreover the timing of irrigation may interrupt the soil hydrological conditions causing low yield of rice grown in the awsd30 s lc since the awd can reduce grain yield of rice in clayey soil bouman and tuong 2001 carrijo et al 2017 our results suggest that the large vegetative growth under awsd0 conditions plays a key role in high grain yield of rice through efficient transport of water and npk nutrients from the roots to the shoots under different water regimes increases root shoot ratio were associated with high grain yield yang et al 2004a ju et al 2015 in addition the root shoot ratio was larger in the flooded than the moist soil since the nutrients availability decline sharply when a flooded soil drains huguenin elie et al 2008 in this study root to shoot ratios indicated that the enhancement in under ground biomass was proportional to the improvement above ground biomass of rice where the highest dry weights of root and shoot were associated with the highest root shoot ratios as in awsd0 s hc and awsd0 s hc while the lowest dry weights of root and shoot was associated with the lowest root shoot ratio as in awsd0 awsd30 s lc and s lc the efficient uptake of n p and k elements raise the production of the dry matter of rice siavoshi and laware 2011 xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a in contrast changing from flooded soil to greater soil aeration can significantly affect the nutrient cycling and supply to crops root growth and rice productivity buresh and haefele 2010 our study support the belief that large root biomass is required to support a large biomass production yang et al 2012 chu et al 2015 in addition the rice growth ratio can be strongly controlled by water and nutrient supply which represents the importance of growth in the rate of nutrient accumulation moreover the difference in rice growth rates was attributed to varietal differences in nutrient uptake xiang et al 2013 chu et al 2015 consequently the higher the growth rate the higher rice plant n p and k uptake greater responsiveness to nutrients under awsd0 was due to high npk contents in the rhizosphere as well as the high activity of rice root the high nutrients content in the rhizosphere can increase root growth and improve crop yield jing et al 2012 according to ding et al 2014 a linear increase in rice tillering and panicle and spikelet numbers were observed with increasing n uptake chen et al 1997 revealed that increasing k availability promoted overall growth of rice contributing to greater k uptake by the roots morais guimarães et al 2011 carmeis filho et al 2017 the n p and k response under awsd30 was reduced due to the reduction in the soil water content resulting in the reduction in n p and k availability moreover the disturbance in root and overall plant growth our results specify that alternative wetting and soil drying reduced the availability of npk nutrients making them unavailable to roots while alternative wetting and saturating resulted in more soluble npk in which bigger rooting system was developed transforming more nutrients to the shoot parts better response to n p and k in s hc was due to the great amount of n and k ions were adsorbed to clay particles and move gradually through the soil to the big roots however the clay content and root growth in s lc were lower than that of s hc the capability of a plant to absorb nutrients from the soil rely on soil texture hodge et al 2000 according to carmeis filho et al 2017 the greater response of rice root to k application was attributed to the greater availability of k in the soil increasing the contact between k and the rice roots moreover plants with bigger rooting systems have the ability to exploit a greater soil volume increasing the contact between roots and npk nutrients carmeis filho et al 2017 furthermore the mobility of the n fertilizer was faster in sandy soils than in clay soils van beek et al 2009 consequently in the term of our experiment the higher of clay content the higher root growth as well as higher n p and k acquisition of rice plants higher nutrients uptake was due to greater responsiveness to n p and k as well as a greater biomass production of rice in awsd0 than in awsd30 the high absorption rate of n plays a key role in improving the rice yield xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 and the biomass of rice varied with k availability babu et al 2006 carmeis filho et al 2017 that the greater availability of k in the soil enhanced the k uptake rate by rice plants morais guimarães et al 2011 since n p and k exist in so many essential compounds even slight deficiencies can reduce plant growth and limit n p and k uptake in rice mutters et al 2006 cai et al 2012 therefore the sharp reduction in n p and k uptake under the awsd30 regime was interpreted by the disturbance in overall plant growth moreover the lower response to n p and k under the awd conditions o toole and baldia 1982 correspondingly the n p and k uptake of rice in cf differ from that of awd due to the physiological response of rice to decreased nutrients availability in the system of awd belder et al 2005 valizadeh et al 2012 superior n p and k uptake in plants grown in s hc was possibly due to a better response to nutrients as well as greater biomass compared to that in s lc correspondingly increasing the npk availability results in greater dry mass yields xiang et al 2013 and npk uptake rate by plants carmeis filho et al 2017 sinha and biswas 2003 and alhaj hamoud et al 2019a stated that plant available n p and k showed a positive and significant correlation with clay content for soils accordingly the higher the availability of n p and k in the soil the greater the npk uptake by rice plant the treatment awsd0 s hc resulted in greater biomass as well as greater n p and k uptake of rice the efficient absorption of n p and k elements raises the production of the biomass of rice siavoshi and laware 2011 xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 in contrast water stress under the awsd30 s lc treatment decreased the root and overall plant activity regarding n p and k uptake by the plant consequently the rice growth can be strongly controlled by n p and k supply which represents the importance of growth in the rate of n p and k uptake in addition the difference in rice growth rates was attributed to varietal differences in n p and k uptake therefore the higher the growth rate the higher the n p and k uptake xiang et al 2013 carmeis filho et al 2017 the awsd0 increased rice activities regarding n p and k uptake by plants and thus resulted in the highest are and pfp of n p and k applied in contrast the awsd30 regime sharply decreased n p and k availability through the awd cycles and their impacts on rice growth as well as the root zone physiochemical properties therefore the lowest n p and k uptake and thus the lowest are and pfp of n p and k applied the npk supply in cf was better than those in awd conditions that awd reduced the utilization of npk applied valizadeh et al 2012 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a b the kue in rice was great under a large growth rate as well as a high k uptake and efficient biomass production yang et al 2004c morais guimarães et al 2011 carmeis filho et al 2017 the low nue in rice was due to n loss prasad et al 2017 pathak 2013 demonstrated that n recovery averaged 30 for irrigated rice however in china nue has been as low as 15 20 lower than in other major rice growing countries cao et al 2013 among soils s hc has a high amount of clay particles leading to efficient use of npk applied the increase in the clay content increased the k availability in the soil sinha and biswas 2003 subsequently increased the k uptake carmeis filho et al 2017 which thus increased the kue of rice moreover s hc resulted in further vegetative growth so the total biomass is associated with higher npk uptake s lc resulted in fewer ions fixation thus fewer nutrients were available for roots hence less utilization of npk the same observation was noted in china when varieties were evaluated in soils with a different texture awan et al 2011 alhaj hamoud et al 2019b a the he greatest are and pfp of n p and k applied of the awsd0 s hc treatment were attributed to a greater npk accumulation in a larger biomass consistently the higher availability of nutrients in the soil the greater nutrients utilization by the rice plant carmeis filho et al 2017 on the opposition the awsd30 s lc treatment reduced the are and pfp of n p and k applied n p and k limitation under awd cycles which might contribute to a lower n p and k supply a lower supply of npk could limit root growth and therefore access to n p and k peng et al 2011 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a resulting in the lowest n p and k uptake by the plant therefore the lowest are and pfp of n p and k applied equally the pue and kue in rice were reduced due to the decrease in the plant growth and uptake of p and k in the dry matter yang et al 2004a valizadeh et al 2012 alhaj hamoud et al 2019b the nue was reduced under awd compared to cf because awd regime caused higher n loss as well as lower biomass of rice than did cf regime tan et al 2013 in addition the n supply in cf with drainage up to saturation is better than the n supply in cf with less than saturation so the latter reduced the utilization efficiency and uptake of n applied alhaj hamoud et al 2019a 5 conclusions the alternative wetting and soil saturating is preferred over the alternative wetting and soil drying for obtaining vigorous growth roots of rice the increase in the soil clay content improves the rice root morphology and physiology and nutrient use efficiency alternative wetting and 0 soil drying could be the optimal management practice for rice cultivation in the paddy soil as it could alert the root zone environment by decreasing soil eh and ph thereby increasing nutrients availability in the rhizosphere such that improved root physiology root morphology biomass yield and nutrients use efficiency of rice alternative wetting and 30 soil drying is improper for the water management of rice cultivated in the clay soil as it alerts the root zone environment by increasing ph and eh of the soil so decreasing nutrients availability in the rhizosphere such that reduces root activity which can captivate a low amount of npk nutrients therefore it results in a sharp decline in the overall plant growth thus in biomass yield and nutrients use efficiency of rice the current study suggests that the adoption alternative wetting and soil drying regimes should promote rice root morphology and encourage the root physiology to guarantee vigorous overall plant growth with optimal grain yield and sufﬁcient npk nutrients supply as well as an efficient nutrients acquisition for potential yield

10921,rice is threatened by the inefficient use of water and fertilizer however understanding the effects of water regimes and soil clay contents on morphology and physiology of plant roots and their relations to yield and nutrient use efficiency is essential to improve rice productivity in this regard three experimental soils were conducted with three soil clay content levels namely light clay s lc medium clay s mc and heavy clay s hc and three irrigation regimes namely alternate wetting and 0 soil drying awsd0 alternate wetting and 10 soil drying awsd10 alternate wetting and 30 soil drying awsd30 over july october in 2018 the experiment was a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement with three replications the results showed that responses of roots and shoots and the nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k uptake of rice were significantly affected by the water regimes and soil clay contents under the same water regime root morphology and physiology biomass production and npk utilization of rice were higher in high clay soil than light clay soil under the same soil clay content awsd0 regime was the optimal water management practice for growing rice providing the highest grain yield whereas awsd30 regime was improper water management option for rice offering the lowest grain yield the combination awsd0 s hc resulted in the greatest values of the apparent recovery efficiency are of npk applied at aren 43 4 arep 20 4 and arek 67 2 as well as the highest values of partial factor productivity pfp of npk applied at pfpn 19 7 g g 1 pfpp 31 9 g g 1 and pfpk 41 1 g g 1 respectively conversely the treatment awsd30 s lc resulted in the lowest values of are of npk applied at aren 8 3 arep 3 0 and arek 6 7 as well as the lowest values of pfp of npk applied at pfpn 7 0 g g 1 pfpp 11 9 g g 1 and pfpk 12 2 g g 1 respectively root length density root weight density root active absorption area root oxidation ability and root surface phosphatase were higher in awsd0 s hc than that in awsd70 s lc while the former combination increased npk contents in the rhizosphere the latter their reduced availability due to the increment in ph and redox potential of the soil the results are important for rice water management option in the paddy clay soil the results also suggest that the adoption of alternate wetting and soil drying regimes should guarantee morphological and physiological improvements in root traits by which contributes to greater biomass production larger npk acquisition and thus better npk utilization of rice keywords root morphology root physiology water regime soil texture nutrient utilization oryza sativa l 1 introduction agriculture is now facing the challenge of providing sufficient food for the rapidly growing population under increasing water shortage rice is one of the most vital staple food crops feeding over 60 of the chinese population xiong et al 2013 and 40 of the global population datta et al 2017 freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce and rice farming ingests nearly 65 of the chinese freshwater resources cheng 2007 mainly irrigated rice peng et al 2009 to cope with water depletion several water saving technologies have been introduced such as aerobic rice and wetting and alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation zhang et al 2011 lampayan et al 2015a in awd practice the field is bunded to keep the soil flooded to a depth of 5 cm whenever the ponded water level has dropped to 15 cm below the soil surface linquist et al 2015 lampayan et al 2015b soil affects crop root growth the main organ in water and nutrient uptake and paddy soils are now under flooding or water saving irrigation the integration of water regime and soil texture produces an interactive effect on the growing environment of rice alhaj hamoud et al 2019a in paddy soil continuously flooding cf irrigation adjusts soil properties permitting easier root penetration cf irrigation also leads to higher soluble nutrient but lesser nutrient losses than awd irrigation gordon et al 2008 prasad et al 2017 in awd irrigation the soil is undergoing key changes shifting from flooded to non flooded conditions linquist et al 2015 lampayan et al 2015b such alternative shifts result in a relatively dramatic change in the soil physio chemical environment this environment regulates root and shoot growth of rice hamoud et al 2018 it also alters several soil chemical properties that determine nutrient availability including soil ph and redox potential wissuwa et al 2006 huguenin elie et al 2003 sahrawat 2012 in addition the nutrients uptake of rice in awd differs from that of cf due to the physiological response of rice to water stress and nutrients availability in the method of awd yang et al 2004a belder et al 2005 under the awd system rice roots absorb water inefficiently since plant essential elements are less available in the rhizosphere in addition low mineral nutrition affects the overall development of the plant bunnag and pongthai 2013 therefore soil moisture regime influences the process of root and shoot development in clay soils bandyopadhyay et al 2003 hamoud et al 2018 as well as nutrients availability in the root zone it also affects nutrients uptake and nutrient use efficiency of rice sander and gerke 2007 the consequences of all these variations necessitate addressing the interactive impact of water regimes and soil clay content on root zone chemistry to cope with nutrient inefficiency and improve root and shoot growth thus grain yield and nutrient use efficiency of rice globally rice yield has improved due to the enhancement in fertilizer inputs fageria 2007 peng et al 2009 faostat 2013 most of the focus on nutrient use efﬁciency is on n yet efﬁciency of n of rice is only 20 30 and a large amount of n is lost to the environment peng et al 2010 the use efﬁciency of p is also of interest the efﬁciency of p is 10 30 and the remaining amount of p is either lost by runoff and leakage or fixed by other soil minerals prasad et al 2017 ghosh et al 2015 there is a little known about the use efﬁciency of k the efﬁciency of k is 20 60 while the remained amount is fixed or leaked ghosh et al 2015 it is evident that nutrients application is inefficiently used by the crop such that further increases in n p and k fertilizer are unlikely to be effective in increasing cereal yield ghosh et al 2015 chinese agriculture is now facing many demanding challenges for ensuring environmental sustainability china has become the largest fertilizer user worldwide and farmers have resorted to the use of excessive fertilization to maintain yield levels li et al 2015 inefficient input of fertilizers have contributed to low nutrient use efﬁciency which subsequently caused serious soil degradation eutrophication groundwater pollution and emission of ammonia and greenhouse gases peng et al 2010 by surface runoff losses leaching into groundwater and volatilization into the atmosphere spiertz 2010 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2016 therefore to reduce negative environmental impacts the development of water saving and fertilizer efﬁcient technologies should be sought to consistently match high grain production and large nutrient utilization of rice as rice plants are sensitive to soil moisture variations rice roots response to different soil moisture regimes in addition rice root production differs with soil texture differences dou et al 2016 therefore plant root morphology is regulated by the availability of water and nutrients petricka et al 2012 and rice root morphology plays an essential role in water and nutrient absorption from soil wang and smith 2004 yang et al 2004b for instance large roots can improve overall plant growth and high root activity coordinates strong nutrient uptake which supports great biomass production and high nutrient utilization of rice chu et al 2015 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a therefore the impact of soil clay content on different systems of irrigated rice needs more investigation henceforward rice root responses to irrigation regimes and soil clay content and their relations to yield and nutrient use efficiency are of increasing interest in the southern part of china rice occupies over 70 of the cultivated area producing 88 of national rice ma et al 2013 a remarkable amount of freshwater is diverted for rice cultivation under cf irrigation threatening rice production lin et al 2014 instead awd irrigation is recommended to overcome the consequences of water depletion given the increasing necessity to the introduction of rice agricultural water management the adoption of water saving techniques is required in addition the water efficient irrigation regime should basically provide optimum soil moisture conditions thereby providing a favorable growth medium for absorption of water and nutrients thus desirable crop growth and marketable yield therefore the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different water regimes on the rice root morphology and physiology and their relations to dry matter production and nutrient utilization in south china counties clay soils offer the highest nutrients supplying potential xie et al 1990 and most irrigated paddy soils are categorized into clay cabangon et al 2011 silt clay lampayan et al 2015b and clay loam cabangon et al 2004 mainly soil clay content can influence rice root morphology and physiology concomitantly shoot growth hence biomass production nutrient acquisition and utilization in addition understanding the impact of soil moisture regime on release and ﬁxation of nutrients in the soil as well as soil ability to supply nutrients are very important factors to increase grain yield and fertilizer productivity of rice therefore this study focused on the effect of soil clay content on the nutrient acquisition and utilization of rice 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and

lowest soil clay content s lc as shown in table 6 4 discussion the soil eh identifies the presence of nutrients that are important for plant growth tokarz and urban 2015 cf irrigation depletes the rhizosphere o2 leading to a reduction in soil eh sahrawat 2000 while increasing the availability of iron and manganese forms in the rhizosphere delaune et al 1998 tokarz and urban 2015 awsd0 decreased the soil eh while increased the n and k contents in the rhizosphere as a result of an exchange reaction due to the increase of iron and manganese forms also reducing conditions in flooded soil decrease the rhizosphere ph gao et al 2006 causing npk nutrients to be more available to the plant pii et al 2015 sahrawat 2015 therefore roots under awsd0 could lower the rhizosphere ph by generating h in the oxidation of ferrous iron and by releasing h to balance the excess intake of cations over anions kirk et al 1993 consequently the role of soil eh and ph in modifying the dynamics of n p and k nutrients in the rhizosphere can be potentially used for optimizing rice production the greatest n p and k contents under awsd0 s hc was due to the ability of s hc to release high amounts of n and k and high soluble p caused by acidification of rhizosphere the acidiﬁcation increases in the rice root zone under cf conditions kirk et al 1993 pii et al 2015 rising the solubilization of n p and k in the rhizosphere on the contrary water stress in awsd30 s lc resulted in less available n p and k nutrients in the soil it has been reported that the increased soil ph decreases p solubility and stimulates the adsorption of n and k onto soil clay minerals which are linked to a significant decline in n and k concentrations in the soil also changing from soil flooded to more soil aeration can affect the biogeochemical processes influencing nutrient supply to crops huguenin elie et al 2008 buresh and haefele 2010 kirk 2004 sahrawat 2012 therefore alternative wetting and soil drying regime is highly dynamic in rice system and it inﬂuences availability of n p and k in the paddy soil fig 2 root morphology enhanced under awsd0 and awsd0 s hc by generating large tsa in contact with the soil via large aaa indicating abundant npk nutrients available to vigorous roots rice root morphology depends on the changes in the soil with water regime and changes in npk availability with water regime huguenin elie et al 2008 alhaj hamoud et al 2019b in addition the large rooting system is vital to npk plants uptake lynch 2013 chu et al 2015 in our study awsd0 and awsd0 s hc treatments improved root uptake of npk producing large shoot biomass of rice prevoiusly alternate wetting and low soil drying regime increased improve rice morphology xu et al 2018 and a positive relationship between root growth and biomass yield of rice were revealed sharma et al 1995 bandyopadhyay et al 2003 the shortage in npk nutrients under awsd30 and awsd30 s lc could restrict the growth of roots and thus tsa and aaa in this case the morphology of the root was damaged which aﬀ ected the physiology of root yang et al 2012 in soils which are water stressed there was reduced adaptation of roots to the aerobic condition that limits the exploitation of deeper soil layers hence reducing rice root growth kondhia et al 2015 further rice root morphology under awd was reduced compared to cf conditions kato and okami 2011 therefore in our study root traits inﬂuencing the intake of n p and k include rl tsa and aaa in the soil layer all of which increase the volume of soil explored by the root system and the aaa for the uptake of nutrients hence superior rice root morphology can coordinate higher biomass production as well as larger n p and k utilization increasing clay content strengthen soil s ability to capture nutrients and allow rice plants to develop a stronger rooting system furthermore larger tsa and aaa enhanced better npk uptake enhancing overall plant growth thus improving rice productivity morphologically growth and dry mass of rice root in clay loam soil were better than in sandy loam soil kibria 2008 further nutrients application into paddy soil evidently increased root morphological traits of rice plants xu et al 2018 in response to cf rice roots form gas spaces aerenchyma colmer and pedersen 2008 permitting the transport of o2 from shoots to roots and the ventilation of gases from roots to shoots colmer 2003 evans 2004 in rice aerenchyma is constitutively formed under aerobic conditions and further enhanced during soil flooding shiono et al 2010 therefore under awsd0 and awsd0 s hc conditions rice was capable of generating large growth roots transporting from shoots great amount of o2 to roots through aerenchyma conversely under awsd30 s lc conditions rice was incapable of generating large growth roots transferring a little amount of o2 through air space tissue therefore the roa was directly proportional to the growth of the root system thus a direct relationship was realized between rice root morphological growth and roa correspondingly root branching affects o2 distribution in the rhizosphere kirk 2003 mishra and salokhe 2010 also rice root morphology and the roa were significantly affected by the availability of soil nutrients under different water regimes mishra and uphoff 2013 xu et al 2018 therefore a higher roa is required for achieving higher biomass yield ju et al 2015 yang et al 2012 which support the results of the current study the difference in the roa under different soils indicated that roots developed in s hc received more o2 from the shoot than that roots developed in s mc and s lc therefore high roa appeared to be due to large roots with great tsa and aaa generated in s h transporting a high amount of o2 from shoots morphological traits of rice roots were greatly affected by the availability of soil nutrients under different water regimes mishra and uphoff 2013 a higher rsp refers to sufficient p root tissue concntrations compared lower to rsp mclachlan 1980 helal 1990 tadano et al 1993 high p root tissue content is explained by high available p in the root environment associated with high plant p uptake under low ph in the rhizosphere therefore high rsp under awsd0 s hc and awsd0 s hc referred to i increasing p availability to root ii high p supply from vigorous roots to shoots conversely the low rsp indicated impaired p availability as well as reduced roots and shoots under awsd30 s lc and awsd30 s lc correspondingly physiological responses of rice were greatly affected by the availability of soil nutrients under different irrigation regimes mishra and uphoff 2013 xu et al 2018 the increase in the biomass yield of rice was due to the availability of water to roots under awsd0 as well as the ability of s hc to hold more nutrients providing typical demands of soluble npk for rice under the combination awsd0 s hc such conditions encouraged overall plant growth hamoud et al 2018 and higher rice panicles were achieved in cf than awd irrigation bunnag and pongthai 2013 dou et al 2016 as cf increased the availability of npk nutrients while awd reduced their accessibility carmeis filho et al 2017 in addition the length of the panicle decides the number of grains it can hold kobayasi et al 2002 cheng et al 2007 and thus rice yield xing and zhang 2010 in our research panicle length and grain yield under awsd0 was higher than that under awsd10 and awsd30 which related to n p and k availability in the rhizosphere the s hc could provide favorable conditions to the roots promoting the growth of rice tillers therefore the total biomass compared to s mc and s lc consequently increasing soil clay contents created differences on soil fertility which affected the yield of rice consistently the differences in soil texture affected nutrient supply of rice further impacted shoot growth tsubo et al 2007 dou et al 2016 in addition higher grain yield of rice in high clay soils than those in low clay soils dou et al 2016 rao et al 2013 the decline in the vegetative growth and yield of rice under awsd30 s lc was attributed to the limited supply of npk nutrients within the rhizosphere equally the unfavorable nutrient regime for plant nutrients was created under aerobic conditions sahrawat 2012 while the grain yield of rice is highly depending on the number of tillers huang et al 2011 and rice yield reduced in the order of cf and awd regimes belder et al 2004 carrijo et al 2017 moreover the timing of irrigation may interrupt the soil hydrological conditions causing low yield of rice grown in the awsd30 s lc since the awd can reduce grain yield of rice in clayey soil bouman and tuong 2001 carrijo et al 2017 our results suggest that the large vegetative growth under awsd0 conditions plays a key role in high grain yield of rice through efficient transport of water and npk nutrients from the roots to the shoots under different water regimes increases root shoot ratio were associated with high grain yield yang et al 2004a ju et al 2015 in addition the root shoot ratio was larger in the flooded than the moist soil since the nutrients availability decline sharply when a flooded soil drains huguenin elie et al 2008 in this study root to shoot ratios indicated that the enhancement in under ground biomass was proportional to the improvement above ground biomass of rice where the highest dry weights of root and shoot were associated with the highest root shoot ratios as in awsd0 s hc and awsd0 s hc while the lowest dry weights of root and shoot was associated with the lowest root shoot ratio as in awsd0 awsd30 s lc and s lc the efficient uptake of n p and k elements raise the production of the dry matter of rice siavoshi and laware 2011 xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a in contrast changing from flooded soil to greater soil aeration can significantly affect the nutrient cycling and supply to crops root growth and rice productivity buresh and haefele 2010 our study support the belief that large root biomass is required to support a large biomass production yang et al 2012 chu et al 2015 in addition the rice growth ratio can be strongly controlled by water and nutrient supply which represents the importance of growth in the rate of nutrient accumulation moreover the difference in rice growth rates was attributed to varietal differences in nutrient uptake xiang et al 2013 chu et al 2015 consequently the higher the growth rate the higher rice plant n p and k uptake greater responsiveness to nutrients under awsd0 was due to high npk contents in the rhizosphere as well as the high activity of rice root the high nutrients content in the rhizosphere can increase root growth and improve crop yield jing et al 2012 according to ding et al 2014 a linear increase in rice tillering and panicle and spikelet numbers were observed with increasing n uptake chen et al 1997 revealed that increasing k availability promoted overall growth of rice contributing to greater k uptake by the roots morais guimarães et al 2011 carmeis filho et al 2017 the n p and k response under awsd30 was reduced due to the reduction in the soil water content resulting in the reduction in n p and k availability moreover the disturbance in root and overall plant growth our results specify that alternative wetting and soil drying reduced the availability of npk nutrients making them unavailable to roots while alternative wetting and saturating resulted in more soluble npk in which bigger rooting system was developed transforming more nutrients to the shoot parts better response to n p and k in s hc was due to the great amount of n and k ions were adsorbed to clay particles and move gradually through the soil to the big roots however the clay content and root growth in s lc were lower than that of s hc the capability of a plant to absorb nutrients from the soil rely on soil texture hodge et al 2000 according to carmeis filho et al 2017 the greater response of rice root to k application was attributed to the greater availability of k in the soil increasing the contact between k and the rice roots moreover plants with bigger rooting systems have the ability to exploit a greater soil volume increasing the contact between roots and npk nutrients carmeis filho et al 2017 furthermore the mobility of the n fertilizer was faster in sandy soils than in clay soils van beek et al 2009 consequently in the term of our experiment the higher of clay content the higher root growth as well as higher n p and k acquisition of rice plants higher nutrients uptake was due to greater responsiveness to n p and k as well as a greater biomass production of rice in awsd0 than in awsd30 the high absorption rate of n plays a key role in improving the rice yield xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 and the biomass of rice varied with k availability babu et al 2006 carmeis filho et al 2017 that the greater availability of k in the soil enhanced the k uptake rate by rice plants morais guimarães et al 2011 since n p and k exist in so many essential compounds even slight deficiencies can reduce plant growth and limit n p and k uptake in rice mutters et al 2006 cai et al 2012 therefore the sharp reduction in n p and k uptake under the awsd30 regime was interpreted by the disturbance in overall plant growth moreover the lower response to n p and k under the awd conditions o toole and baldia 1982 correspondingly the n p and k uptake of rice in cf differ from that of awd due to the physiological response of rice to decreased nutrients availability in the system of awd belder et al 2005 valizadeh et al 2012 superior n p and k uptake in plants grown in s hc was possibly due to a better response to nutrients as well as greater biomass compared to that in s lc correspondingly increasing the npk availability results in greater dry mass yields xiang et al 2013 and npk uptake rate by plants carmeis filho et al 2017 sinha and biswas 2003 and alhaj hamoud et al 2019a stated that plant available n p and k showed a positive and significant correlation with clay content for soils accordingly the higher the availability of n p and k in the soil the greater the npk uptake by rice plant the treatment awsd0 s hc resulted in greater biomass as well as greater n p and k uptake of rice the efficient absorption of n p and k elements raises the production of the biomass of rice siavoshi and laware 2011 xiang et al 2013 ding et al 2014 in contrast water stress under the awsd30 s lc treatment decreased the root and overall plant activity regarding n p and k uptake by the plant consequently the rice growth can be strongly controlled by n p and k supply which represents the importance of growth in the rate of n p and k uptake in addition the difference in rice growth rates was attributed to varietal differences in n p and k uptake therefore the higher the growth rate the higher the n p and k uptake xiang et al 2013 carmeis filho et al 2017 the awsd0 increased rice activities regarding n p and k uptake by plants and thus resulted in the highest are and pfp of n p and k applied in contrast the awsd30 regime sharply decreased n p and k availability through the awd cycles and their impacts on rice growth as well as the root zone physiochemical properties therefore the lowest n p and k uptake and thus the lowest are and pfp of n p and k applied the npk supply in cf was better than those in awd conditions that awd reduced the utilization of npk applied valizadeh et al 2012 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a b the kue in rice was great under a large growth rate as well as a high k uptake and efficient biomass production yang et al 2004c morais guimarães et al 2011 carmeis filho et al 2017 the low nue in rice was due to n loss prasad et al 2017 pathak 2013 demonstrated that n recovery averaged 30 for irrigated rice however in china nue has been as low as 15 20 lower than in other major rice growing countries cao et al 2013 among soils s hc has a high amount of clay particles leading to efficient use of npk applied the increase in the clay content increased the k availability in the soil sinha and biswas 2003 subsequently increased the k uptake carmeis filho et al 2017 which thus increased the kue of rice moreover s hc resulted in further vegetative growth so the total biomass is associated with higher npk uptake s lc resulted in fewer ions fixation thus fewer nutrients were available for roots hence less utilization of npk the same observation was noted in china when varieties were evaluated in soils with a different texture awan et al 2011 alhaj hamoud et al 2019b a the he greatest are and pfp of n p and k applied of the awsd0 s hc treatment were attributed to a greater npk accumulation in a larger biomass consistently the higher availability of nutrients in the soil the greater nutrients utilization by the rice plant carmeis filho et al 2017 on the opposition the awsd30 s lc treatment reduced the are and pfp of n p and k applied n p and k limitation under awd cycles which might contribute to a lower n p and k supply a lower supply of npk could limit root growth and therefore access to n p and k peng et al 2011 alhaj hamoud et al 2019a resulting in the lowest n p and k uptake by the plant therefore the lowest are and pfp of n p and k applied equally the pue and kue in rice were reduced due to the decrease in the plant growth and uptake of p and k in the dry matter yang et al 2004a valizadeh et al 2012 alhaj hamoud et al 2019b the nue was reduced under awd compared to cf because awd regime caused higher n loss as well as lower biomass of rice than did cf regime tan et al 2013 in addition the n supply in cf with drainage up to saturation is better than the n supply in cf with less than saturation so the latter reduced the utilization efficiency and uptake of n applied alhaj hamoud et al 2019a 5 conclusions the alternative wetting and soil saturating is preferred over the alternative wetting and soil drying for obtaining vigorous growth roots of rice the increase in the soil clay content improves the rice root morphology and physiology and nutrient use efficiency alternative wetting and 0 soil drying could be the optimal management practice for rice cultivation in the paddy soil as it could alert the root zone environment by decreasing soil eh and ph thereby increasing nutrients availability in the rhizosphere such that improved root physiology root morphology biomass yield and nutrients use efficiency of rice alternative wetting and 30 soil drying is improper for the water management of rice cultivated in the clay soil as it alerts the root zone environment by increasing ph and eh of the soil so decreasing nutrients availability in the rhizosphere such that reduces root activity which can captivate a low amount of npk nutrients therefore it results in a sharp decline in the overall plant growth thus in biomass yield and nutrients use efficiency of rice the current study suggests that the adoption alternative wetting and soil drying regimes should promote rice root morphology and encourage the root physiology to guarantee vigorous overall plant growth with optimal grain yield and sufﬁcient npk nutrients supply as well as an efficient nutrients acquisition for potential yield

10922,the production of dates in the hyper arid deserts of the united arab emirates uae is economically and culturally important all of the commercial date palms need to be irrigated and the prime source of this water is groundwater however the quantity and quality of the groundwater resources in the uae are being compromised by groundwater extraction at 25 times the rate of recharge and a rise in salinity as the reserves dwindle rates of groundwater use on commercial farms need to be the minimum required for date production and the leaching of salts from the rootzone we have shown that tree water use etc can be predicted from 0 95 li x eto where li is the fraction of incoming visible light intercepted by the canopy and eto is the reference evapotranspiration we now surveyed 10 commercial date farms in abu dhabi and determined the li of date canopies by proximal sensing with a light stick across a range of tree densities tree ages and groundwater salinities we were able to link li to the fractional ground cover fgc obtained by analysis of satellite images thus it was possible to determine etc of date palms across all of these commercial farms and potentially all the uae the median etc of the 10 farms was 70 kl y 1 which was about twice that observed in our experiments at a research station near dubai some 10 of the trees on these commercial farms were predicted to use over 100 kl y 1 it is suggested that irrigation should be at 1 5 x etc to account for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction reductions in irrigation would be achieved by more aggressive pruning of the fronds to reduce li and hence etc without compromising date yield keywords date palm water use commercial date production canopy characteristics proximal sensing remote sensing 1 introduction the date palm phoenix dactylifera l is one of the most important plants of the desert zohary and hopf 2000 not only does it underpin the stability of desert oasis ecosystems dates also have significant nutritional economic social and heritage values aly and al hewiety 2011 zekri et al 2010 rashoud 2016 noted that the relationship between the people of the united arab emirates uae and the date palm is deeply rooted in the past yet the strength of the peoples bond to this blessed tree remains today the founding president of the uae the late sheikh zayed bin sultan al nayhan made the date palm the central foundation of his agricultural and environmental projects for greening the desert rashoud 2016 in the uae today there are over 40 million date palms of 70 or so varieties in the emirate of abu dhabi alone there are 33 million date palms and these are primarily concentrated in the region surrounding al ain in the east and along the liwa oases in the west in 2015 the food and agriculture organisation fao of the united nations recognised the al ain and liwa oases as globally important agricultural heritage systems for dates because of their importance as repositories of genetic resources biodiversity and cultural heritage gulf news 2015 all these date palms require irrigation tripler et al 2011 sperling et al 2014 the rainfall in this hyper arid region is generally less than 100 mm y 1 whereas the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 exceeds 2500 mm y 1 groundwater is the prime source of this irrigation water and about one third of all groundwater extracted in abu dhabi is used to irrigate date palms moew 2015 however groundwater is being used at over 25 times the rate at which it is being recharged such that the groundwater table is dropping at between 1 and 5 m per year ead 2019a the salinity of the groundwater is also increasing such that only 20 of groundwater usable for agriculture is without desalination environment agency abu dhabi ead 2019b ead 2019a estimate that at the current rate of extraction usable groundwater will be exhausted within the next two generation environment agency abu dhabi ead 2019b have quoted h h general sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nayhan the crown prince of abu dhabi as saying water is more important than oil for the uae we are preoccupied by this major issue we have to come up with ways to meet future demand and preserve natural resources for the coming generations ead report that there are 118 183 identified groundwater wells in abu dhabi with some 73 184 in the date growing region of al ain and another 38 507 in al dhafrah in the west which includes the date growing area of the liwa oases unfortunately ead estimates there are around another 56 000 wells that have not been formally identified and logged law 6 of the abu dhabi government prohibits the drilling of any more wells in the so called red zones where the water table is dropping at high rates between 2013 and the first half of 2014 there were 35 successful prosecutions under law no 6 in november 2016 the executive council of the abu dhabi government passed law no 5 which states that the withdrawal and use of groundwater will be governed by rules and limits established by ead our water use experiments on date palms at the international center for biosaline agriculture icba suggested for law 5 that the sustainable rate of irrigation for date palms should be 1 5 etc where etc l d 1 is a daily rate of water transpiration by the date palm al muaini et al 2019a this multiplier of 1 5 includes a 25 factor of safety plus a 25 salt leaching fraction al muaini et al 2019a showed that this would mean application of 66 kl y 1 with irrigation groundwater at 5 ds m 1 and 43 kl y 1 for water at 15 ds m 1 this is 25 50 less than the 275 l d 1 that was previously be applied by icba every day of the year except on fridays friday is an official holiday further work has revealed the blue and grey water footprints l kg 1 of date production al muaini et al 2019c the challenge however is to implement these findings on commercial date farms ead 2019b reported that the abu dhabi farmers service center adfsc had set up an efficient irrigation fund whereas some date farmers were using 1500 l d 1 470 kl y 1 they have now manged to reduce this to 300 l d 1 a saving of 80 but there is clearly still more to be done to reduce further groundwater use for irrigation on commercial date farms as the crown prince of the uae has said we need to be preoccupied by this major issue this preoccupation is the goal of the research described in this paper the first challenge is to translate the scientific findings from the controlled experimental trial at icba there the date palms were planted on an 8 8 grid and pruned regularly such that the light interception fraction li by the palm tree canopy ranged from 0 20 0 35 as measured using proximal sensing of light interception measured by a light stick al muaini et al 2019b measured the volumetric sap flow in the trunk to determine the palm tree water use etc expressed in l d 1 and then divided this by the ground area per plant of 64 m2 to derive the crop coefficient kc etc eto of allen et al 1998 they found that kc 0 95 li across three different date varieties irrigated at two different salinities in this way they could predict date palm water use from proximal sensing of li to infer kc and then use the meteorological records of eto to find etc as 0 95 li x eto unlike the experimental plots at icba commercial date farms can have plantings as close as 3 x 3 m spacings between the palms and li values can be very high as sometimes there are also low rates of pruning activity to realise our goal of providing information that can be used to manage better groundwater irrigation on commercial date farms our objectives were to assess whether the light interception fraction li on commercial farms can be predicted from information of tree spacing tree age or groundwater salinity to determine whether remote sensing via satellite imagery can be used to calculate the fractional ground cover fgc of date canopies on commercial farms and whether fgc can be linked to li to use measured values of fgc from remote sensing of commercial farms to predict the probability distribution function of etc for date palms growing on commercial farms and compare these with the etc values measured for date palms in the experimental plot at icba to suggest ways by which canopy management can be used to reduce etc and lower the need for the extraction of groundwater for irrigation 2 materials and methods the sap flow techniques used for the measurement of tree water use etc and the details of the use of the light stick fig 1 left to monitor li have been given by al muaini et al 2019a b so no further descriptions are provided here ten commercial date farms were selected for proximal sensing of li and remote assessment of fgc five farms were in the western region of al dhafrah and the five other farms were near al ain table 1 this selection covered a range of cultivars tree ages tree densities and groundwater salinities on each farm some six to eight transects were made with the light stick fig 1 right along a well defined path to encompass the full shadow pattern of the selected line of four or five trees observations were made at three times of the day 1000 1200 and 1400 h to cover a range of sun angles this was repeated across three locations on each farm a total of 30 values of li were generated from the use of the light stick on 10 commercial farms a comparison is carried out here between the etc and li results we had collected at icba al muaini et al 2019b and those found on the commercial farms the remote sensing fgc of date palms at icba and on the commercial farms used a simple approach based on easily available high resolution images from google earth pro a distance scale marker and the images were transferred to microsoft powerpoint then ellipses drawn around a selection of trees to enable calculation of the ground project area gpa of each tree a ground based assessment was made of light transmission through the foliage by analysing specific parts the traces from the light stick when it was directly under the leaf canopy the light transmission through the foliage was about 10 15 across the farms combining these with the values of gpa enabled the fgc to be calculated this simple procedure provided good estimates of fgc for our purposes here and shows how remote sensing of plant canopies can be made using easily available data albeit that in our case this assessment was made easier because of the contrast between the palm trees canopies and the golden sand of the desert underneath in the future we could consider using multi spectral remote sensing and use the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to infer fgc and maybe even li directly carlson and ripley 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 light interception and farm characteristics the general characteristics of the surveyed farms are presented in table 1 our initial thoughts were that the light interception fraction li might show a general relationship with tree age tree density or the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation fig 2 shows the relationship between li and palm tree density for the commercial farms black markers also shown as the red squares are the results from our work at icba not surprisingly as the spatial density of stems increases there is greater light interception by the trees however for the purposes of using li to predict etc the relationship with plant density is not strong enough to provide robust predictions of tree water use obviously tree management through different pruning practices provides a source of the variation the link between tree age and li shown in fig 3 also only reveals a weak trend with increasing age but again the relationship is inadequate for predicting etc from li by using tree age alone as the independent variable fig 4 shows the decline in li with the increase in salinity of the water used for irrigation for date palms of a similar age and management the leaf area declines with increasing water salinity al muaini et al 2019a b and fig 4 confirms this behaviour for commercial farms again however the relationship is insufficiently strong to enable useful predictions of etc from li predicting solely using the electrical conductivity ec ds m 1 of the water used for irrigation 3 2 light interception and fractional ground cover given the inability of the general characteristics of the date farms to predict li we sought an alternative approach using remote sensing of fgc in fig 5 we show an example of how ellipses were drawn onto images of the palm trees canopies obtained from google earth pro on the left of fig 5 are the ellipses around the five shahlah trees of treatment s1 ec 5 ds m 1 and on the right of fig 5 are shown the five ellipses circumscribing the five shahlah palm trees of treatment s3 15 ds m 1 the yellow line is the scale measure of 28 m the fgc of shahlah s1 was calculated to be 63 using this method the fgc of shahlah s3 was calculated to be 32 similar analyses were carried out on the other two varieties of lulu and khalas that we studied at icba under the two salinity treatments al muaini et al 2019b the relationship found between li and fgc is presented in fig 6 the data used to establish this relationship were taken from our earlier studies at icba and included an analysis of fgc from four of the farms in the survey namely farms 1 and 2 from al dhafrah and farms 5 and 8 from the al ain region the li and fgc data cover a wide range of canopy conditions with fgcs as low as about 0 3 right up to overlapping canopies where fgc exceeds unity at 1 04 thus we conclude that remotely sensed fgc using a simple approach based on google earth pro enables prediction of li with sufficient accuracy to enable its use in assessing tree water use we are in the process of automating the procedure of gpa and fgc determination and also using high resolution imagery from drones to determine in greater detail the foliage density 3 3 tree water use on commercial farms in our previous work we showed that etc could be predicted using kc x eto where kc was on average found to be 0 95 li for the varieties of differing salt tolerances of lulu khalas and shahlah al muaini et al 2019b so from the li values found from the three or four path lengths of the transects made by the light stick on the 10 commercial date farms it is possible to find the probability distribution function pdf of the annual values of etc in kl y 1 using 0 95 li x eto and knowledge of the tree spacing this ratio of kc li 1 0 95 that we have found for dates is lower than that found by goodwin et al 2015 for temperate fruit crops al muaini et al 2019c the pdf of the etc for the trees on the 10 commercial date farms are shown in fig 7 along with the annual etc values of the lulu khalas and shahlah palms at icba for both treatments s1 and s3 the comparison highlights the challenge in estimating the water use of crops on commercial farms based on data from experiments carried out under controlled conditions on research farms the average water use of the larger s1 trees at icba was 50 1 kl y 1 and that for the smaller s3 trees was 27 6 kl y 1 the lowest 25 of trees on commercial farms had annual etc values of less than 50 kl y 1 the median value of water use from trees on commercial farms was nearly 50 more at 75 kl y 1 some 10 of trees on the commercial farms had etc exceeding 100 kl y 1 proximal sensing of li and remote sensing of fgc has enabled us to place in context the results gathered from controlled experimental conditions at icba our earlier work has suggested that under law 5 irrigation should be applied at 1 5 etc to account for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction the data presented in fig 7 can be used on these farms for scheduling irrigation at 1 5 etc furthermore additional work on using automated remote sensing to find fgc say by drones would enable this procedure to be extended easily to farms across the main date growing regions of the uae this would aid the abu dhabi farmers service center adfsc to implement efficient irrigation schedules that would reduce the amount of groundwater being used for irrigation we found a wide variation in the etc by palm trees across the sampled farms and this reflects the wide variation in pruning practices between farmers for growers one of the most important pruning practices is to control the number of fruiting female spathes generally the number of spathes is reduced to eight so that the dates will be of a marketable size less attention seems to be directed towards balancing the leaf area to fruit mass ratio in terms of setting the number vegetative branches or fronds relative to the number of spathes left some farms have very dense canopies such that the fgc is upwards of 0 7 and li is greater than 0 5 we consider that more aggressive pruning of the fronds could reduce the li and fgc and thereby reduce etc without compromising date yields our work at icba showed that very good date yields of about 80 100 kg tree 1 can be achieved with an li of just 0 3 0 35 the trade offs between light interception photosynthetic capacity and tree water use would seem a profitable avenue of future research 4 conclusions previously we had found that tree water use etc could be related to the light interception fraction li by the canopies of the date palms al muaini et al 2019b we have now found that on commercial farms the light interception li by date palms is not singularly related to such general factors as tree density tree age or the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation rather tree and canopy management by the growers overrides these general characteristics in determining li so there is a need to be able to estimate li easily so that etc can be predicted on commercial date farms we have carried out a survey of li using proximal sensing with a light stick on 10 commercial date farms across the two major date growing regions of abu dhabi by remote sensing we were able to link the fractional ground cover fgc determined from high resolution satellite images to our values of li across the 10 commercial farms we surveyed we were able to predict their trees annual transpiration etc the median water use by trees on the commercial farms of 70 kl y 1 was nearly twice what was observed in an experimental trial at icba some 10 of trees on commercial farms used more than 100 kl y 1 this etc can be linked to the consumption of irrigation water since it is recommended that irrigation be at the rate of 1 5 etc to allow for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction the number of fruiting female spathes on each date palms is managed to be about 8 and strands within each spathe are thinned as well so as to provide fruit of a marketable size so there would be appear to a canopy leaf area per tree in excess of what is needed for economic date production therefore it is suggested that more aggressive pruning of fronds would enable the rates of tree water use to be lowered without compromising date yield this will be a topic for future investigation 
10922,the production of dates in the hyper arid deserts of the united arab emirates uae is economically and culturally important all of the commercial date palms need to be irrigated and the prime source of this water is groundwater however the quantity and quality of the groundwater resources in the uae are being compromised by groundwater extraction at 25 times the rate of recharge and a rise in salinity as the reserves dwindle rates of groundwater use on commercial farms need to be the minimum required for date production and the leaching of salts from the rootzone we have shown that tree water use etc can be predicted from 0 95 li x eto where li is the fraction of incoming visible light intercepted by the canopy and eto is the reference evapotranspiration we now surveyed 10 commercial date farms in abu dhabi and determined the li of date canopies by proximal sensing with a light stick across a range of tree densities tree ages and groundwater salinities we were able to link li to the fractional ground cover fgc obtained by analysis of satellite images thus it was possible to determine etc of date palms across all of these commercial farms and potentially all the uae the median etc of the 10 farms was 70 kl y 1 which was about twice that observed in our experiments at a research station near dubai some 10 of the trees on these commercial farms were predicted to use over 100 kl y 1 it is suggested that irrigation should be at 1 5 x etc to account for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction reductions in irrigation would be achieved by more aggressive pruning of the fronds to reduce li and hence etc without compromising date yield keywords date palm water use commercial date production canopy characteristics proximal sensing remote sensing 1 introduction the date palm phoenix dactylifera l is one of the most important plants of the desert zohary and hopf 2000 not only does it underpin the stability of desert oasis ecosystems dates also have significant nutritional economic social and heritage values aly and al hewiety 2011 zekri et al 2010 rashoud 2016 noted that the relationship between the people of the united arab emirates uae and the date palm is deeply rooted in the past yet the strength of the peoples bond to this blessed tree remains today the founding president of the uae the late sheikh zayed bin sultan al nayhan made the date palm the central foundation of his agricultural and environmental projects for greening the desert rashoud 2016 in the uae today there are over 40 million date palms of 70 or so varieties in the emirate of abu dhabi alone there are 33 million date palms and these are primarily concentrated in the region surrounding al ain in the east and along the liwa oases in the west in 2015 the food and agriculture organisation fao of the united nations recognised the al ain and liwa oases as globally important agricultural heritage systems for dates because of their importance as repositories of genetic resources biodiversity and cultural heritage gulf news 2015 all these date palms require irrigation tripler et al 2011 sperling et al 2014 the rainfall in this hyper arid region is generally less than 100 mm y 1 whereas the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 exceeds 2500 mm y 1 groundwater is the prime source of this irrigation water and about one third of all groundwater extracted in abu dhabi is used to irrigate date palms moew 2015 however groundwater is being used at over 25 times the rate at which it is being recharged such that the groundwater table is dropping at between 1 and 5 m per year ead 2019a the salinity of the groundwater is also increasing such that only 20 of groundwater usable for agriculture is without desalination environment agency abu dhabi ead 2019b ead 2019a estimate that at the current rate of extraction usable groundwater will be exhausted within the next two generation environment agency abu dhabi ead 2019b have quoted h h general sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nayhan the crown prince of abu dhabi as saying water is more important than oil for the uae we are preoccupied by this major issue we have to come up with ways to meet future demand and preserve natural resources for the coming generations ead report that there are 118 183 identified groundwater wells in abu dhabi with some 73 184 in the date growing region of al ain and another 38 507 in al dhafrah in the west which includes the date growing area of the liwa oases unfortunately ead estimates there are around another 56 000 wells that have not been formally identified and logged law 6 of the abu dhabi government prohibits the drilling of any more wells in the so called red zones where the water table is dropping at high rates between 2013 and the first half of 2014 there were 35 successful prosecutions under law no 6 in november 2016 the executive council of the abu dhabi government passed law no 5 which states that the withdrawal and use of groundwater will be governed by rules and limits established by ead our water use experiments on date palms at the international center for biosaline agriculture icba suggested for law 5 that the sustainable rate of irrigation for date palms should be 1 5 etc where etc l d 1 is a daily rate of water transpiration by the date palm al muaini et al 2019a this multiplier of 1 5 includes a 25 factor of safety plus a 25 salt leaching fraction al muaini et al 2019a showed that this would mean application of 66 kl y 1 with irrigation groundwater at 5 ds m 1 and 43 kl y 1 for water at 15 ds m 1 this is 25 50 less than the 275 l d 1 that was previously be applied by icba every day of the year except on fridays friday is an official holiday further work has revealed the blue and grey water footprints l kg 1 of date production al muaini et al 2019c the challenge however is to implement these findings on commercial date farms ead 2019b reported that the abu dhabi farmers service center adfsc had set up an efficient irrigation fund whereas some date farmers were using 1500 l d 1 470 kl y 1 they have now manged to reduce this to 300 l d 1 a saving of 80 but there is clearly still more to be done to reduce further groundwater use for irrigation on commercial date farms as the crown prince of the uae has said we need to be preoccupied by this major issue this preoccupation is the goal of the research described in this paper the first challenge is to translate the scientific findings from the controlled experimental trial at icba there the date palms were planted on an 8 8 grid and pruned regularly such that the light interception fraction li by the palm tree canopy ranged from 0 20 0 35 as measured using proximal sensing of light interception measured by a light stick al muaini et al 2019b measured the volumetric sap flow in the trunk to determine the palm tree water use etc expressed in l d 1 and then divided this by the ground area per plant of 64 m2 to derive the crop coefficient kc etc eto of allen et al 1998 they found that kc 0 95 li across three different date varieties irrigated at two different salinities in this way they could predict date palm water use from proximal sensing of li to infer kc and then use the meteorological records of eto to find etc as 0 95 li x eto unlike the experimental plots at icba commercial date farms can have plantings as close as 3 x 3 m spacings between the palms and li values can be very high as sometimes there are also low rates of pruning activity to realise our goal of providing information that can be used to manage better groundwater irrigation on commercial date farms our objectives were to assess whether the light interception fraction li on commercial farms can be predicted from information of tree spacing tree age or groundwater salinity to determine whether remote sensing via satellite imagery can be used to calculate the fractional ground cover fgc of date canopies on commercial farms and whether fgc can be linked to li to use measured values of fgc from remote sensing of commercial farms to predict the probability distribution function of etc for date palms growing on commercial farms and compare these with the etc values measured for date palms in the experimental plot at icba to suggest ways by which canopy management can be used to reduce etc and lower the need for the extraction of groundwater for irrigation 2 materials and methods the sap flow techniques used for the measurement of tree water use etc and the details of the use of the light stick fig 1 left to monitor li have been given by al muaini et al 2019a b so no further descriptions are provided here ten commercial date farms were selected for proximal sensing of li and remote assessment of fgc five farms were in the western region of al dhafrah and the five other farms were near al ain table 1 this selection covered a range of cultivars tree ages tree densities and groundwater salinities on each farm some six to eight transects were made with the light stick fig 1 right along a well defined path to encompass the full shadow pattern of the selected line of four or five trees observations were made at three times of the day 1000 1200 and 1400 h to cover a range of sun angles this was repeated across three locations on each farm a total of 30 values of li were generated from the use of the light stick on 10 commercial farms a comparison is carried out here between the etc and li results we had collected at icba al muaini et al 2019b and those found on the commercial farms the remote sensing fgc of date palms at icba and on the commercial farms used a simple approach based on easily available high resolution images from google earth pro a distance scale marker and the images were transferred to microsoft powerpoint then ellipses drawn around a selection of trees to enable calculation of the ground project area gpa of each tree a ground based assessment was made of light transmission through the foliage by analysing specific parts the traces from the light stick when it was directly under the leaf canopy the light transmission through the foliage was about 10 15 across the farms combining these with the values of gpa enabled the fgc to be calculated this simple procedure provided good estimates of fgc for our purposes here and shows how remote sensing of plant canopies can be made using easily available data albeit that in our case this assessment was made easier because of the contrast between the palm trees canopies and the golden sand of the desert underneath in the future we could consider using multi spectral remote sensing and use the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to infer fgc and maybe even li directly carlson and ripley 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 light interception and farm characteristics the general characteristics of the surveyed farms are presented in table 1 our initial thoughts were that the light interception fraction li might show a general relationship with tree age tree density or the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation fig 2 shows the relationship between li and palm tree density for the commercial farms black markers also shown as the red squares are the results from our work at icba not surprisingly as the spatial density of stems increases there is greater light interception by the trees however for the purposes of using li to predict etc the relationship with plant density is not strong enough to provide robust predictions of tree water use obviously tree management through different pruning practices provides a source of the variation the link between tree age and li shown in fig 3 also only reveals a weak trend with increasing age but again the relationship is inadequate for predicting etc from li by using tree age alone as the independent variable fig 4 shows the decline in li with the increase in salinity of the water used for irrigation for date palms of a similar age and management the leaf area declines with increasing water salinity al muaini et al 2019a b and fig 4 confirms this behaviour for commercial farms again however the relationship is insufficiently strong to enable useful predictions of etc from li predicting solely using the electrical conductivity ec ds m 1 of the water used for irrigation 3 2 light interception and fractional ground cover given the inability of the general characteristics of the date farms to predict li we sought an alternative approach using remote sensing of fgc in fig 5 we show an example of how ellipses were drawn onto images of the palm trees canopies obtained from google earth pro on the left of fig 5 are the ellipses around the five shahlah trees of treatment s1 ec 5 ds m 1 and on the right of fig 5 are shown the five ellipses circumscribing the five shahlah palm trees of treatment s3 15 ds m 1 the yellow line is the scale measure of 28 m the fgc of shahlah s1 was calculated to be 63 using this method the fgc of shahlah s3 was calculated to be 32 similar analyses were carried out on the other two varieties of lulu and khalas that we studied at icba under the two salinity treatments al muaini et al 2019b the relationship found between li and fgc is presented in fig 6 the data used to establish this relationship were taken from our earlier studies at icba and included an analysis of fgc from four of the farms in the survey namely farms 1 and 2 from al dhafrah and farms 5 and 8 from the al ain region the li and fgc data cover a wide range of canopy conditions with fgcs as low as about 0 3 right up to overlapping canopies where fgc exceeds unity at 1 04 thus we conclude that remotely sensed fgc using a simple approach based on google earth pro enables prediction of li with sufficient accuracy to enable its use in assessing tree water use we are in the process of automating the procedure of gpa and fgc determination and also using high resolution imagery from drones to determine in greater detail the foliage density 3 3 tree water use on commercial farms in our previous work we showed that etc could be predicted using kc x eto where kc was on average found to be 0 95 li for the varieties of differing salt tolerances of lulu khalas and shahlah al muaini et al 2019b so from the li values found from the three or four path lengths of the transects made by the light stick on the 10 commercial date farms it is possible to find the probability distribution function pdf of the annual values of etc in kl y 1 using 0 95 li x eto and knowledge of the tree spacing this ratio of kc li 1 0 95 that we have found for dates is lower than that found by goodwin et al 2015 for temperate fruit crops al muaini et al 2019c the pdf of the etc for the trees on the 10 commercial date farms are shown in fig 7 along with the annual etc values of the lulu khalas and shahlah palms at icba for both treatments s1 and s3 the comparison highlights the challenge in estimating the water use of crops on commercial farms based on data from experiments carried out under controlled conditions on research farms the average water use of the larger s1 trees at icba was 50 1 kl y 1 and that for the smaller s3 trees was 27 6 kl y 1 the lowest 25 of trees on commercial farms had annual etc values of less than 50 kl y 1 the median value of water use from trees on commercial farms was nearly 50 more at 75 kl y 1 some 10 of trees on the commercial farms had etc exceeding 100 kl y 1 proximal sensing of li and remote sensing of fgc has enabled us to place in context the results gathered from controlled experimental conditions at icba our earlier work has suggested that under law 5 irrigation should be applied at 1 5 etc to account for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction the data presented in fig 7 can be used on these farms for scheduling irrigation at 1 5 etc furthermore additional work on using automated remote sensing to find fgc say by drones would enable this procedure to be extended easily to farms across the main date growing regions of the uae this would aid the abu dhabi farmers service center adfsc to implement efficient irrigation schedules that would reduce the amount of groundwater being used for irrigation we found a wide variation in the etc by palm trees across the sampled farms and this reflects the wide variation in pruning practices between farmers for growers one of the most important pruning practices is to control the number of fruiting female spathes generally the number of spathes is reduced to eight so that the dates will be of a marketable size less attention seems to be directed towards balancing the leaf area to fruit mass ratio in terms of setting the number vegetative branches or fronds relative to the number of spathes left some farms have very dense canopies such that the fgc is upwards of 0 7 and li is greater than 0 5 we consider that more aggressive pruning of the fronds could reduce the li and fgc and thereby reduce etc without compromising date yields our work at icba showed that very good date yields of about 80 100 kg tree 1 can be achieved with an li of just 0 3 0 35 the trade offs between light interception photosynthetic capacity and tree water use would seem a profitable avenue of future research 4 conclusions previously we had found that tree water use etc could be related to the light interception fraction li by the canopies of the date palms al muaini et al 2019b we have now found that on commercial farms the light interception li by date palms is not singularly related to such general factors as tree density tree age or the salinity of the groundwater used for irrigation rather tree and canopy management by the growers overrides these general characteristics in determining li so there is a need to be able to estimate li easily so that etc can be predicted on commercial date farms we have carried out a survey of li using proximal sensing with a light stick on 10 commercial date farms across the two major date growing regions of abu dhabi by remote sensing we were able to link the fractional ground cover fgc determined from high resolution satellite images to our values of li across the 10 commercial farms we surveyed we were able to predict their trees annual transpiration etc the median water use by trees on the commercial farms of 70 kl y 1 was nearly twice what was observed in an experimental trial at icba some 10 of trees on commercial farms used more than 100 kl y 1 this etc can be linked to the consumption of irrigation water since it is recommended that irrigation be at the rate of 1 5 etc to allow for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction the number of fruiting female

introduction wheat being a primary staple food of india is cultivated in 30 m ha area goi 2017 sharma et al 2015a as 80 of the annual rainfall is received during southwest monsoon months july to september wheat is predominantly cultivated under irrigated conditions wheat depends extensively on groundwater for irrigation recent decades have experienced a steady increase in the depth of the groundwater table in wheat growing regions of indo gangetic plains hira 2009 rodell et al 2009 the rate of fall in the water table has increased from 0 2 m yr 1 between 1973 and 2001 to about 1 0 m yr 1 during the last decade in wheat growing regions in haryana and punjab states of india humphreys et al 2010 yadvinder et al 2014 during the last three decades underground water levels in study region have fallen from 8 to 16 m below ground level and in rest of india it has declined from 1 to 8 m below ground level sekhri 2013 this might be the cause for india becoming home for one fourth of the

unsustainability of the traditional wheat cultivation humphreys et al 2010 meena et al 2019 food security in regions with water scarcity can be improved by enhancing the overall water use efficiency which helps to produce more crop per drop of water brauman et al 2013 water productivity can be enhanced mainly by two approaches viz agronomic interventions and selection of genotypes with high water use efficiency of them agronomic interventions include proper levelling of field seed rate and time of irrigation water application using tensiometers gupta et al 2016 meena et al 2018 adopting efficient irrigation systems like sprinkler jha et al 2019 sub surface drip fertigation system combined with conservation agriculture approaches sidhu et al 2019 mulching and maintaining proper crop geometry with precision seed drills yadvinder et al 2014 regulated deficit irrigation meena et al 2019 would help in saving precious water the present situation therefore calls for development of improved agronomic management options as well as identification of water use efficient genotypes with better yield alternatively successful improvement in water productivity can be achieved by cultivation of high yielding varieties requiring less water has been demonstrated in maize sharma et al 2015b in wheat there are few reports of germplasm screening ahmadi et al 2018 screened wild wheat accessions for drought adaptation where they identified high wue wild accessions which are not directly usable for cultivation or for hybridization as these do not have agronomically adaptable genetic backgrounds and often have crossability barriers although other researchers like fletcher et al 2018 and nakhforoosh et al 2016 screened wheat genotypes for drought adaptation based on physiological traits these past studies are limited to screening few genotypes and were mainly conducted under pot culture conditions looking at the necessity for wheat genotypes with high water productivity which can be readily adoptable at farmer s field the present study has been undertaken aiming at identifying high wue wheat genotypes under limited moisture conditions 2 material and

yields precipitation received during the experimental period was compared with the long period average lpa rainfall values on an average the wheat season in karnal receives about 120 mm of precipitation every year as per the long term average rainfall data fig 3 among all the three experimental years the maximum precipitation of 97 mm was received in 2016 17 wheat season which was deficit by 21 compared to lpa the next highest rainfall was in 2017 18 85 mm which was only 71 of lpa the least precipitation among the three years was 2015 16 55 7 mm which was a 54 deficit compared to lpa rainfall the trends indicate that the amount of precipitation received in present times is less compared to earlier decades leading to reduced water availability diurnal temperatures recorded during experimental years were comparable to lpa and it is observed that there was a 1 20 c rise in minimum and maximum temperatures during february to april months when compared to lpa fig 3 3 2 pre screening of genotypes under limited water supply at 60 of cpe a diverse set of 71 wheat germplasm lines which contained 39 advanced breeding material and 32 released varieties were pre screened select superior lines for yield under limited water supply at 60 of cpe during 2015 16 under field conditions the gy of these lines varied from 1 4 kharchia 65 to 5 4 t ha 1 wh 1105 while the agbm accumulated ranged from 11 6 to 14 2 t ha 1 in the same genotypes respectively fig 4 genotypes given in table 1 were selected based on yield for detailed study for next two years under two irrigation levels 3 3 correlation analysis pearson s correlation was computed to find out which associated trait is significantly contributing towards high wue of tested genotypes correlation analysis was carried out using the average values from both the treatments fig 5 panel a and separately for 60 and 80 cpe treatments fig 5 panel b when analyzed across treatments the hi r 0 53 agbm r 0 50 tgw r 0 42 had a strong positive effect on wue while gy r 0 31 and scmr taken at pre anthesis stage had a moderate positive influence on wue rwc at both pre r 0 14 and post anthesis r 0 25 had a negative correlation with wue under treatment with limited water supply 60 of cpe gy r 0 99 hi r 0 86 tgw r 0 52 and scmr post anthesis r 0 46 had a strong positive correlation on wue and additionally scmr pre anthesis was having a moderate positive effect on wue r 0 32 rwc at post anthesis had a negative correlation r 0 32 with wue at 80 of cpe parameters like gy r 0 99 agbm r 0 46 and hi r 0 83 showed a strong positive correlation with wue scmr pre anthesis had a weak positive correlation r 0 35 while tpm r 0 36 had only a slight negative effect on wue gy agbm hi and scmr ii which were showing high positive correlation with wue were chosen for further analysis of variance and ranking based comparison of means 3 4 analysis of variance wue the main effects of year genotype and irrigation level were found to be significant p 0 01 table 2 two and three way interactions were found significant p 0 01 except for year x irrigation level effect comparing the two irrigation levels 60 of cpe

hi table 2 two and three way interactions were found either significant p 0 001 or marginally significant for all traits except for tpm p 0 398 affected by year x irrigation levels and year x irrigation x genotype interaction p 0 218 averaged across genotypes significantly higher gy 4488 kg ha 1 was recorded during 2017 18 than 2016 17 4383 kg ha 1 comparing the two irrigation levels irrigation at 60 of cpe significantly p 0 001 reduced the gy by 321 kg ha 1 6 9 and bm by 0 84 t ha 1 6 1 there was no significant difference between the treatments when mean values were compared across years and genotypes for hi 3 6 ranking of genotypes wue when means were ranked using tukey s test of significance under 60 of cpe the genotype dbw 243 was the top ranked for wue 2 40 kg m 3 gy 4974 kg ha 1 bm 13 3 t ha 1 and hi 0 37 due to its highest yield the least ranked genotype was pbw550 for wue 1 73 kg m 3 gy 3599 kg ha 1 and hi 0 27 however the genotypes dbw140 487 and wh1105 373 ranked first and last when tpm were compared table 3 irrigation at 80 of cpe again ranked dbw 243 at top with wue 1 94 kg m 3 along with dbw 110 dbw 222 and dbw 166 in the first non significant group while pbw 550 1 46 kg m 3 ranked lowest table 4 there was a significant p 0 001 yield difference of 1250 kg ha 1 between the top and bottom yielding genotypes top yielding genotype dbw 243 accumulated a statistically at par bm of 14 5 t ha 1 along with twelve other genotypes the genotypes dbw 110 and pbw 550 recorded the highest and the lowest hi respectively similar to the trend in 60 of cpe treatment 3 7 gge biplot analysis for wue the gge biplot comprised two vectors i e environments representing the two irrigation levels 80 and 60 of cpe the biplot indicated a variability of 99 34 fig 6 60 of cpe was the most discriminating treatment for both wue and 60 of cpe was least distinctive treatment 60 of cpe was relatively ideal and average treatment compared to 80 of cpe positive correlation was observed between the two treatments by having an acute angle a summary of environments and their relationships are presented in table 5 the polygon view of the gge biplot showing which won where pattern of genotype by environment dataset of the two environments are given in fig 7 the radial lines originating from the centre of the biplot divided the polygon into five sectors both the environments fell into one sector forming a single mega environment the winning genotypes under both the environments were dbw 243 47ibwsn 938 dbw 166 and dbw 222 the other four sectors did not contain any of the environments and the genotypes which fell into these sectors included most of the low wue genotypes which are not good performing under both environments and hence not adaptable for reduced irrigation conditions fig 7 in the fig 8 showing mean vs stability plot a straight line was drawn with an arrow passing through the origin of the biplot the direction of the arrow showed the highest wue with wheat genotypes being ranked along the line best and the poor genotypes with respect to the average value of the experiment and their consistency in stability is represented in the table 6 3 8 quantification of water savings the genotypes identified in this study viz dbw 243 4974 kg ha 1 47ibwsn 938 4914 kg ha 1 dbw 166 4634 kg ha 1 and dbw 222 4541 kg ha 1 produced higher yield compared to the local check hd 2967 4183 kg ha 1 with a maximum wue 2 40 to 2 14 kg m 3 the saving of 20 and 40 water under 80 and 60 of cpe treatments respectively saves 20 of water cost spent by the farmer in irrigating the wheat crop gets reflected as additional remuneration in the farm registering the higher yield in monetary terms usd 213 ha 1 is incurred by a farmer in haryana as the cost of water in irrigating wheat meena et al 2019 therefore a minimum of usd 42 6 ha 1 20 of usd 213 maybe directly saved by adopting wheat cultivars with high wue 4 discussion identification of genotypes with high wue could be achieved by ranking of genotypic performance using analysis of variance anova test of significance and by quantifying the g x e interaction by assuming treatments as environments a number of techniques commonly used for quantifying the g x e component for selection of treatment specific genotypes such as analysis of variance anova principal component analysis pca and linear regression equations zobel et al 1988 in this study anova followed by tuckey s test of significance and gge biplot analysis was used to identify high wue wheat genotypes the present study is novel in terms of screening 71 diverse germplasm lines under micro irrigation drip conditions precisely delivering 40 less water in open field during 2015 16 and with two treatments during 2016 17 and 2017 18 using 16 genotypes is a first of its kind of study in india and south asia additionally the identified lines are ready to be directly cultivated adapted by farmers in regions of water scarcity as they are in advance level of yield testing under all india coordinated project on wheat and barley at icar iiwbr karnal the nodal agency delivering superior wheat cultivars in india icar iiwbr 2018 the superior wue lines identified are also available in the form of agronomically superior genetic backgrounds and hence are readily utilizable by hybridization to incorporate high wue into breeding programmes several other previous reports ahmadi et al 2018 fletcher et al 2018 nakhforoosh et al 2016 which screened wheat genotypes for water limited conditions were either limited by few initial genotypes taken for study or were conducted under pot culture conditions and the results from such pot studies are often not transferable to field conditions 4 1 correlation wue was found to be strongly influenced by gy r 0 99 hi r 0 86 tgw r 0 52 and scmr post anthesis r 0 46 under limited irrigation at 60 of cpe by having positive pearson s correlation coefficient corroborating the findings from previous reports getnet et al 2015 xu et al 2008 in this experiment hi had a strong positive correlation with wue and gy irrespective of level of irrigation applied kang et al 2002 reynolds and tuberosa 2008 also found that hi had a strong positive influence on wue and gy contrasting observations where hi decreased with increase in irrigation water was also reported zhang et al 2008 as reported earlier by varga et al 2015 the marginal negative correlation was observed between wue and ph the findings are comparable to earlier reports where a positive correlation of bm with gy and wue was found muñoz et al 1998 however higher bm production under water stress condition leading to relatively lower wue was also reported by blum 2005 scmr recorded post anthesis r 0 46 was positively correlated with wue when irrigation was applied at 60 of cpe higher scmr values having a positive influence on higher wue reported earlier also del pozo et al 2016 positive correlation of r 0 52 between tgw and wue was observed in 60 of cpe treatment which is also supported by earlier reports of varga et al 2015 where higher tgw had contributed to higher wue under water limitation tpm was showing slight negative correlation r 0 36 with wue in our study however if we observe table 2 there not much variation in tpm values and formed only 3 non significant groups and in case of 80 of cpe only two groups were formed a literature search revealed that fleury et al 2010 reported that plants with a limited number of tillers produced higher wue values which supports our observations in this study 4 2 water use efficiency wue was found to be higher by 19 7 under deficit irrigation at 60 of cpe compared to 80 of cpe this was due to a less proportionate reduction in yield under water stress at 60 cpe and the observation can be justified from the fact that excess irrigation water hampers plant growth and eventually decreases gy meng et al 2017 wue at 60 of cpe was the highest 2 04 kg m 3 among treatments while irrigation at 80 of cpe had lower values 1 72 kg m 3 a significant p 0 001 difference in wue was observed between the irrigation levels earlier research reports also suggested that wue increases as scarcity of irrigation become more severe or otherwise water limitation lead to higher wue values meena et al 2019 the genotypes dbw 243 recorded maximum yield per unit of water applied thereby leading to maximum water productivity of 2 40 kg m 3 the possible reason is that these genotypes could accumulate better agbm with a minimum availability of water therefore higher is the hi 0 37 at 60 cpe and 0 36 at 80 of cpe in both the years dbw 243 has shown consistency in achieving the best wue values and across the treatments dbw 243 and 47ibwsn 938 dbw 166 and dbw 222 were the best genotypes having highest wue in both the treatments most of these genotypes have a common feature as they are selected from the cimmyts elite lines distributed to breeders across the globe through the international wheat improvement network iwin http www cimmyt org international wheat improvement network iwin the better performance of dbw 243 and 47ibwsn 938 dbw 166 and dbw 222 under limited irrigation treatments can be attributed to targeted breeding efforts made by cimmyt in developing genotypes tolerant to abiotic stresses during the last decade jonathan 2008 lage and trethowan 2008 tadesse et al 2010 trethowan et al 2001 trethowan and reynolds 2007 here they have deliberately selected popular parents such as weebil 1 kiritati which were adapted to abiotic stresses like drought heat and salinity while kauz altar 84 milan and kachu for higher yield and wider adaptability jonathan 2008 lage and trethowan 2008 tadesse et al 2010 trethowan et al 2001 trethowan and reynolds 2007 several researchers highlighted the targeted breeding efforts at cimmyt mexico leading to fruitful results by way of release of a large number of germaplasm lines by countries with abiotic stresses such as water scarcity high temperature stress etc crespo herrera et al 2018 lantican et al 2016 4 3 associated traits the average gy of all genotypes separately compared year wise indicated that 2016 17 4383 t ha 1 recorded less yield compared to 2017 18 4488 t ha 1 and these results were generally within the range of previous studies in india salunkhe et al 2015 the lower yield in 2016 17 was due to lesser agbm accumulation as compared to 2017 18 the lesser gy and agbm during 2016 17 may be due to heavy rainfall of 54 mm within a span of a single day during january which might have affected the growth and establishment of crop due to waterlogging waterlogging affecting yield component traits and ultimately leading to a significant yield reduction was reported celedonio et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 whereas in 2017 18 a similar rainfall of 63 mm was evenly distributed into two spells in the month of january and february which might have contributed to marginally better yield gy was reduced by 10 in 2016 17 and 3 9 in 2017 18 under reduced irrigation 60 of cpe as compared to irrigation at 80 of cpe the agbm of years was observed to be reduced by around 4 to 8 when irrigation was supplied at 60 of cpe compared to irrigation at 80 of the cpe this might be attributed to water stress imposed by 60 of cpe treatment dorostkar et al 2014 also reported that water stress in treatment involving no irrigation led to yield reduction hi ranged from 0 28 to 0 36 in 60 of cpe and 0 29 to 0 37 in 80 of cpe treatments were found to be not affecting the hi in this study while farré and faci 2009 reported that water stress linearly affected hi 4 4 gge biplot in this experiment pc1 and pc2 components together accounted for 99 34 total variability for wue this validated the relevance of biplot for explaining genotype and genotype environment interaction effect to identify the mega environments yang et al 2009 who gave the concept of gge biplot reported that more than 60 total variation pc1 pc2 is a necessary prerequisite for its suitability to characterize the environments pc1 represented by horizontal axis explains the main effect of genotype while pc2 represented by vertical axis explains the interaction of genotypes with the environment yan 2002 in the experiment 60 of cpe treatment was relatively more discriminating treatment for wue because its vector had the longest length yan et al 2007 explained that presence of long vector and small angles with the aec abscissa are most discriminating and are most suited environments for selection of adapted genotypes while shortest vectors with larger angles are least discriminating and hence are not suitable for selecting the genotypes identification and characterizing similar and dissimilar environments help in deploying resources judiciously and this is achieved by knowing the degree of correlation between the environments yan and rajcan 2002 the polygon view of the gge biplot revealed presence of five genotypes on the vertices of the polygon the genotype situated on the vertex in each sector was the highest wue genotype in the given environments that were also situated in that sector yan et al 2000 the genotype located on the vertex dbw 110 dbw235 dbw 140 pbw 550 without any environment in its sector was the poorest with respect to wue yan 2001 the advantage of polygon view of a gge biplot is it explains the presence or absence of crossover genotype environment interactions involving the most responsive genotypes and is suggestive of the existence or absence of different mega environments among the tested environments yan and rajcan 2002 the mean vis à vis stability plot shows the performance and stability of genotypes fig 8 in this plot stability is explained by average environment coordination aec method yan 2002 in fig 8 the aec axis with an arrow passes through the origin of biplot and grows towards genotypic higher means the average environment contains mean pc1 and pc2 values of environments yan 2001 the lines perpendicular to the aec and their absolute length indicates the stability of the genotype the stable genotype was said to be the one having shortest length of line yan and kang 2003 4 5 quantification of water savings the cost of irrigation water in haryana is approximately usd 213 ha 1 meena et al 2019 by adoption of identified wheat genotypes with high wue can save on an average usd 42 6 ha 1 if 20 water saved in the form of 80 of cpe treatment is accounted for monetary terms simply by the adaption of these cultivars over the whole of north western plains zone of india a region experiencing the over exploitation of groundwater with intense cropping comprising 12 m ha wheat area could save millions of dollars the conventional practice of irrigating wheat at 60 mm water per irrigation accounts for consumption of 38 340 million m3 of water every year in the north western plains zone of india alone and by cultivation of high wue genotypes under micro irrigation an estimated amount of 7728 million m3 of water can be conserved every year 5 conclusion in order to find genotypes with higher wue 71 diverse wheat germplasm lines comprising released as well as advanced breeding lines were pre screened at water limited conditions at 60 cpe imposed by drip irrigation under field conditions during 2015 16 the selected 16 wheat genotypes were investigated in detail for wue and other associated traits under two limited water regimes 60 and 80 of cpe for two consecutive years during 2016 17 and 2017 18 pearson correlation analysis revealed that gy r 0 99 hi r 0 86 tgw r 0 52 and scmr post anthesis r 0 46 had a strong positive correlation while scmr pre anthesis had a moderate positive effect r 0 32 on wue ranking of genotype means for wue using tukey s test of significance and mean vs stability plot of gge biplot analysis identified dbw 243 2 40 kg m 3 47ibwsn 938 2 17 kg m 3 dbw 166 2 19 kg m 3 and dbw 222 2 14 kg m 3 as the best water use efficient genotypes which produced higher or at par yield consuming less water the identified high wue genotype could be a useful resource to researchers globally to develop water use efficient cultivars with high yield additionally the associated traits on wue could be used as selection criteria in breeding wheat for limited water availability conditions superior wue genotypes provide opportunities for saving at least 20 of depleting water resources thereby directly contributing to the reduced cost of cultivation which gets reflected in farm profit of usd 42 6 ha 1 cultivation of improved water use efficient genotypes which could produce at par yield with 20 less water over 12 m ha wheat area of north western plains zone may conserve around 7728 million m3 of water every year the identification of these superior wue genotypes will be useful to researchers globally especially from regions with limited water

10923,intensive cultivation of irrigated wheat in 30 m ha area is mainly causing the depletion of groundwater resources in india this calls for urgent technological interventions to improve the water productivity of wheat for sustaining the profitability of farmers seventy one genetically diverse wheat genotypes were screened for high water use efficiency wue under limited soil moisture level at

directly reduce water consumption by 20 further contributing to the reduced cost of cultivation usd 42 6 ha 1 to farmers cultivation of identified genotypes in over 12 m ha wheat area of north western plains zone of india could produce similar yields and can conserve 7728 million m3 of water year 1 keywords wheat yield water use efficiency wue germplasm genetic diversity profitability 1 introduction wheat being a primary staple food of india is cultivated in 30 m ha area goi 2017 sharma et al 2015a as 80 of the annual rainfall is received during southwest monsoon months july to september wheat is predominantly cultivated under irrigated conditions wheat depends extensively on groundwater for irrigation recent decades have experienced a steady increase in the depth of the groundwater table in wheat growing regions of indo gangetic plains hira 2009 rodell et al 2009 the rate of fall in the water table has increased from 0 2 m yr 1 between 1973 and 2001 to about 1 0 m yr 1 during the last decade in wheat growing regions in haryana and punjab states of india humphreys et al 2010 yadvinder et al 2014 during the last three decades underground water levels in study region have fallen from 8 to 16 m below ground level and in rest of india it has declined from 1 to 8 m below ground level sekhri 2013 this might be the cause for india becoming home for one fourth of the global population living with water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 wateraid 2019 the world is now consuming six times the water consumed 100 years ago at an annual rate of 1 irrigation water requirement of agriculture due to increasing population and dietary changes may increase by around 60 by 2025 from the current levels un water 2018 the current water productivity of wheat is estimated to be about 0 8 1 06 kg m 3 in india meena et al 2015 zwart et al 2010 uncontrolled irrigation supported by subsidized free electricity clubbed with low water productivity is leading to unsustainability of the traditional wheat cultivation humphreys et al 2010 meena et al 2019 food security in regions with water scarcity can be improved by enhancing the overall water use efficiency which helps to produce more crop per drop of water brauman et al 2013 water productivity can be enhanced mainly by two approaches viz agronomic interventions and selection of genotypes with high water use efficiency of them agronomic interventions include proper levelling of field seed rate and time of irrigation water application using tensiometers gupta et al 2016 meena et al 2018 adopting efficient irrigation systems like sprinkler jha et al 2019 sub surface drip fertigation system combined with conservation agriculture approaches sidhu et al 2019 mulching and maintaining proper crop geometry with precision seed drills yadvinder et al 2014 regulated deficit irrigation meena et al 2019 would help in saving precious water the present situation therefore calls for development of improved agronomic management options as well as identification of water use efficient genotypes with better yield alternatively successful improvement in water productivity can be achieved by cultivation of high yielding varieties requiring less water has been demonstrated in maize sharma et al 2015b in wheat there are few reports of germplasm screening ahmadi et al 2018 screened wild wheat accessions for drought adaptation where they identified high wue wild accessions which are not directly usable for cultivation or for hybridization as these do not have agronomically adaptable genetic backgrounds and often have crossability barriers although other researchers like fletcher et al 2018 and nakhforoosh et al 2016 screened wheat genotypes for drought adaptation based on physiological traits these past studies are limited to screening few genotypes and were mainly conducted under pot culture conditions looking at the necessity for wheat genotypes with high water productivity which can be readily adoptable at farmer s field the present study has been undertaken aiming at identifying high wue wheat genotypes under limited moisture conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 wheat genotypes a total of 71 wheat germplasm lines comprising 39 advanced breeding material and 32 released varieties were pre screened under limited soil moisture level of 60 of cpe during the year 2015 16 sixteen genotypes selected from this pre screening based on yield and seed availability were further evaluated to find out high wue genotypes during 2016 17 and 2017 18 the details regarding the year of release testing and pedigree of genotypes are given in table 1 2 2 experimental site micro irrigation experiment facility at the research farm of icar indian institute of

irrigated by micro irrigation i e drip irrigation the drip lines laid were 80 cm apart with drippers spaced at 30 cm with a discharge rate of 2 4 litres hour 1 dripper 1 genotypes were sown in 8 2 m2 plots with rows at 20 cm apart fig 1 all recommended agronomic practices for the region except irrigation application were carried out at the proper time pau 2014 the experiment was sown on 18th 22nd and 30th of november during 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively seeding density of approximately 250 plants m 2 was maintained using a calibrated precision seed drill for sowing a uniform fertilizer rate of 150 kg n ha 1 60 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 30 kg k2o ha 1 was applied to avoid any nutrient stress as per the local recommended package of practices pau 2014 the whole quantity of phosphorus and potassium was applied as a basal dose through 12 32 16 npk complex fertilizer at the time of sowing remaining nitrogen was applied as fertigation through micro irrigation system in three equal splits at crown root initiation maximum tillering and jointing stage weeds disease and insect control were uniformly managed during the crop growing seasons 2 4 weather parameters the diurnal variation in temperature and other climatic parameters were recorded during wheat growing season for the experimental years 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 these weather data were used for calculation of daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 which was used to estimation of crop water requirement the long term data of weather parameters for the period between 1972 and 2017 were obtained from the data repository maintained by icar central soil salinity research institute karnal the long term diurnal temperature and precipitation data were used to calculate the long term average values 2 5 treatments two limited irrigation treatments were imposed by drip system to compensate the i 80 of cumulative pan evaporation cpe ii 60 of the cpe requirement of the crop sixteen wheat genotypes were evaluated at these two soil moisture levels the cpe water requirement of the crop was calculated using a computer based programme cropwat 8 0 a decision support tool developed by the land and water development division of fao fao 1992 the amount of applied water was measured by the inbuilt water meter in the pipe line of the drip system a filter was installed in the main line to prevent sediment from blocking the emitters plots in each replication were separated by a buffer zone of one meter wide strip the crop was irrigated once the cpe of 20 mm is reached after each irrigation during the season and amount of irrigation water applied was 80 and 60 of the total cpe value in mm the daily et0 and cumulative evapotranspiration values and their corresponding values of 80 and 60 during 2015 16 2016

after discarding the border rows in second week april respectively for determining grain yield gy and grain and above ground biomass agbm yield gys were recorded at 14 moisture and agbm yields were determined after oven drying the straw samples at 70 c to a constant weight and expressed on an oven dry weight basis hi was calculated as the ratio of the gy to the total agbm random grain samples from the harvested grains were collected for thousand grain weight tgw and counted by using contador seed counter and weighed to record tgw tillers per square meter tpm were counted at physiological maturity from each plot plant height ph was measured by picking the plants randomly and carefully from middle three rows by avoiding one meter length of either of the corners of the middle rows water use efficiency was calculated as 1 wue output q where wue is the productivity of water in kg m 3 output is the productivity of wheat in kg ha 1 q is the amount of water applied to the experimental field in m3 ha 1 using cropwat 8 0 software 2 7 physiological traits spad chlorophyll meter reading scmr and rwc relative water content were measured at two crop growth stages viz boot stage before anthesis and at anthesis scmr was measured between 09 00 11 00 h of the day from fully expanded intact flag leaf a minolta spad 502 m was used in recording scmr from five randomly selected plants from each plot and the data were averaged as a single value for each plot rwc was measured from the flag leaf sampled between 10 00 h to 12 00 h after recording the fresh weight turgid leaf weight was measured by placing the leaf in water for 8 h blotting dry and weighing leaf dry weight was measured after oven drying at 80 c for 48 h rwc was computed by the following formula developed by barrs and weatherley 1962 2 rwc fw dw fw tw 100 where rwc is the relative water content fw is the leaf fresh weight dw is the leaf dry weight and tw is the turgid leaf weight 2 8 statistical analysis pearson s

analysis was carried out using two irrigation treatments considering average wue values of two years 2016 17 and 2017 18 as two environments scatter plot ranking plot polygon view for genotypes and environments were drawn for wue and gy to study the g e interaction among genotypes and irrigation treatments gea r ver 4 was used to determine the genotypic main effect plus genotype by environment interaction pacheco et al 2017 3 results 3 1 weather conditions during the experimental years the rainfall and its distribution during the wheat growing season are very important for achieving high yields precipitation received during the experimental period was compared with the long period average lpa rainfall values on an average the wheat season in karnal receives about 120 mm of precipitation every year as per the long term average rainfall data fig 3 among all the three experimental years the maximum precipitation of 97 mm was received in 2016 17 wheat season which was deficit by 21 compared to lpa the next highest rainfall was in 2017 18 85 mm which was only 71 of lpa the least precipitation among the three years was 2015 16 55 7 mm which was a 54 deficit compared to lpa rainfall the trends indicate that the amount of precipitation received in present times is less compared to earlier decades leading to reduced water availability diurnal temperatures recorded during experimental years were comparable to lpa and it is observed that there was a 1 20 c rise in minimum and maximum temperatures during february to april months when compared to lpa fig 3 3 2 pre screening of genotypes under limited water supply at 60 of cpe a diverse set of 71 wheat germplasm lines which contained 39 advanced breeding material and 32 released varieties were pre screened select superior lines for yield under limited water supply at 60 of cpe during 2015 16 under field conditions the gy of these lines varied from 1 4 kharchia 65 to 5 4 t ha 1 wh 1105 while the agbm accumulated ranged from 11 6 to 14 2 t ha 1 in the same genotypes respectively fig 4 genotypes given in table 1 were selected based on yield for detailed study for next two years under two irrigation levels 3 3 correlation analysis pearson s correlation was computed to find out which associated trait is significantly contributing towards high wue of tested genotypes correlation analysis was carried out using the average values from both the treatments fig 5 panel a and separately for 60 and 80 cpe treatments fig 5 panel b when analyzed across treatments the hi r 0 53 agbm r 0 50 tgw r 0 42 had a strong positive effect on wue while gy r 0 31 and scmr taken at pre anthesis stage had a moderate positive influence on wue rwc at both pre r 0 14 and post anthesis r 0 25 had a negative correlation with wue under treatment with limited water supply 60 of cpe gy r 0 99 hi r 0 86 tgw r 0 52 and scmr post anthesis r 0 46 had a strong positive correlation on wue and additionally scmr pre anthesis was having a moderate positive effect on wue r 0 32 rwc at post anthesis had a negative correlation r 0 32 with wue at 80 of cpe parameters like gy r 0 99 agbm r 0 46 and hi r 0 83 showed a strong positive correlation with wue scmr pre anthesis had a weak positive correlation r 0 35 while tpm r 0 36 had only a slight negative effect on wue gy agbm hi and scmr ii which were showing high positive correlation with wue were chosen for further analysis of variance and ranking based comparison of means 3 4 analysis of variance wue the main effects of year genotype and irrigation level were found to be significant p 0 01 table 2 two and three way interactions were found significant p 0 01 except for year x irrigation level effect comparing the two irrigation levels 60 of cpe

hi table 2 two and three way interactions were found either significant p 0 001 or marginally significant for all traits except for tpm p 0 398 affected by year x irrigation levels and year x irrigation x genotype interaction p 0 218 averaged across genotypes significantly higher gy 4488 kg ha 1 was recorded during 2017 18 than 2016 17 4383 kg ha 1 comparing the two irrigation levels irrigation at 60 of cpe significantly p 0 001 reduced the gy by 321 kg ha 1 6 9 and bm by 0 84 t ha 1 6 1 there was no significant difference between the treatments when mean values were compared across years and genotypes for hi 3 6 ranking of genotypes wue when means were ranked using tukey s test of significance under 60 of cpe the genotype dbw 243 was the top ranked for wue 2 40 kg m 3 gy 4974 kg ha 1 bm 13 3 t ha 1 and hi 0 37 due to its highest yield the least ranked genotype was pbw550 for wue 1 73 kg m 3 gy 3599 kg ha 1 and hi 0 27 however the genotypes dbw140 487 and wh1105 373 ranked first and last when tpm were compared table 3 irrigation at 80 of cpe again ranked dbw 243 at top with wue 1 94 kg m 3 along with dbw 110 dbw 222 and dbw 166 in the first non significant group while pbw 550 1 46 kg m 3 ranked lowest table 4 there was a significant p 0 001 yield difference of 1250 kg ha 1 between the top and bottom yielding genotypes top yielding genotype dbw 243 accumulated a statistically at par bm of 14 5 t ha 1 along with twelve other genotypes the genotypes dbw 110 and pbw 550 recorded the highest and the lowest hi respectively similar to the trend in 60 of cpe treatment 3 7 gge biplot analysis for wue the gge biplot comprised two vectors i e environments representing the two irrigation levels 80 and 60 of cpe the biplot indicated a variability of 99 34 fig 6 60 of cpe was the most discriminating treatment for both wue and 60 of cpe was least distinctive treatment 60 of cpe was relatively ideal and average treatment compared to 80 of cpe positive correlation was observed between the two treatments by having an acute angle a summary of environments and their relationships are presented in table 5 the polygon view of the gge biplot showing which won where pattern of genotype by environment dataset of the two environments are given in fig 7 the radial lines originating from the centre of the biplot divided the polygon into five sectors both the environments fell into one sector forming a single mega environment the winning genotypes under both the environments were dbw 243 47ibwsn 938 dbw 166 and dbw 222 the other four sectors did not contain any of the environments and the genotypes which fell into these sectors included most of the low wue genotypes which are not good performing under both environments and hence not adaptable for reduced irrigation conditions fig 7 in the fig 8 showing mean vs stability plot a straight line was drawn with an arrow passing through the origin of the biplot the direction of the arrow showed the highest wue with wheat genotypes being ranked along the line best and the poor genotypes with respect to the average value of the experiment and their consistency in stability is represented in the table 6 3 8 quantification of water savings the genotypes identified in this study viz dbw 243 4974 kg ha 1 47ibwsn 938 4914 kg ha 1 dbw 166 4634 kg ha 1 and dbw 222 4541 kg ha 1 produced higher yield compared to the local check hd 2967 4183 kg ha 1 with a maximum wue 2 40 to 2 14 kg m 3 the saving of 20 and 40 water under 80 and 60 of cpe treatments respectively saves 20 of water cost spent by the farmer in irrigating the wheat crop gets reflected as additional remuneration in the farm registering the higher yield in monetary terms usd 213 ha 1 is incurred by a farmer in haryana as the cost of water in irrigating wheat meena et al 2019 therefore a minimum of usd 42 6 ha 1 20 of usd 213 maybe directly saved by adopting wheat cultivars with high wue 4 discussion identification of genotypes with high wue could be achieved by ranking of genotypic performance using analysis of variance anova test of significance and by quantifying the g x e interaction by assuming treatments as environments a number of techniques commonly used for quantifying the g x e component for selection of treatment specific genotypes such as analysis of variance anova principal component analysis pca and linear regression equations zobel et al 1988 in this study anova followed by tuckey s test of significance and gge biplot analysis was used to identify high wue wheat genotypes the present study is novel in terms of screening 71 diverse germplasm lines under micro irrigation drip conditions precisely delivering 40 less water in open field during 2015 16 and with two treatments during 2016 17 and 2017 18 using 16 genotypes is a first of its kind of study in india and south asia additionally the identified lines are ready to be directly cultivated adapted by farmers in regions of water scarcity as they are in advance level of yield testing under all india coordinated project on wheat and barley at icar iiwbr karnal the nodal agency delivering superior wheat cultivars in india icar iiwbr 2018 the superior wue lines identified are also available in the form of agronomically superior genetic backgrounds and hence are readily utilizable by hybridization to incorporate high wue into breeding programmes several other previous reports ahmadi et al 2018 fletcher et al 2018 nakhforoosh et al 2016 which screened wheat genotypes for water limited conditions were either limited by few initial genotypes taken for study or were conducted under pot culture conditions and the results from such pot studies are often not transferable to field conditions 4 1 correlation wue was found to be strongly influenced by gy r 0 99 hi r 0 86 tgw r 0 52 and scmr post anthesis r 0 46 under limited irrigation at 60 of cpe by having positive pearson s correlation coefficient corroborating the findings from previous reports getnet et al 2015 xu et al 2008 in this experiment hi had a strong positive correlation with wue and gy irrespective of level of irrigation applied kang et al 2002 reynolds and tuberosa 2008 also found that hi had a strong positive influence on wue and gy contrasting observations where hi decreased with increase in irrigation water was also reported zhang et al 2008 as reported earlier by varga et al 2015 the marginal negative correlation was observed between wue and ph the findings are comparable to earlier reports where a positive correlation of bm with gy and wue was found muñoz et al 1998 however higher bm production under water stress condition leading to relatively lower wue was also reported by blum 2005 scmr recorded post anthesis r 0 46 was positively correlated with wue when irrigation was applied at 60 of cpe higher scmr values having a positive influence on higher wue reported earlier also del pozo et al 2016 positive correlation of r 0 52 between tgw and wue was observed in 60 of cpe treatment which is also supported by earlier reports of varga et al 2015 where higher tgw had contributed to higher wue under water limitation tpm was showing slight negative correlation r 0 36 with wue in our study however if we observe table 2 there not much variation in tpm values and formed only 3 non significant groups and in case of 80 of cpe only two groups were formed a literature search revealed that fleury et al 2010 reported that plants with a limited number of tillers produced higher wue values which supports our observations in this study 4 2 water use efficiency wue was found to be higher by 19 7 under deficit irrigation at 60 of cpe compared to 80 of cpe this was due to a less proportionate reduction in yield under water stress at 60 cpe and the observation can be justified from the fact that excess irrigation water hampers plant growth and eventually decreases gy meng et al 2017 wue at 60 of cpe was the highest 2 04 kg m 3 among treatments while irrigation at 80 of cpe had lower values 1 72 kg m 3 a significant p 0 001 difference in wue was observed between the irrigation levels earlier research reports also suggested that wue increases as scarcity of irrigation become more severe or otherwise water limitation lead to higher wue values meena et al 2019 the genotypes dbw 243 recorded maximum yield per unit of water applied thereby leading to maximum water productivity of 2 40 kg m 3 the possible reason is that these genotypes could accumulate better agbm with a minimum availability of water therefore higher is the hi 0 37 at 60 cpe and 0 36 at 80 of cpe in both the years dbw 243 has shown consistency in achieving the best wue values and across the treatments dbw 243 and 47ibwsn 938 dbw 166 and dbw 222 were the best genotypes having highest wue in both the treatments most of these genotypes have a common feature as they are selected from the cimmyts elite lines distributed to breeders across the globe through the international wheat improvement network iwin http www cimmyt org international wheat improvement network iwin the better performance of dbw 243 and 47ibwsn 938 dbw 166 and dbw 222 under limited irrigation treatments can be attributed to targeted breeding efforts made by cimmyt in developing genotypes tolerant to abiotic stresses during the last decade jonathan 2008 lage and trethowan 2008 tadesse et al 2010 trethowan et al 2001 trethowan and reynolds 2007 here they have deliberately selected popular parents such as weebil 1 kiritati which were adapted to abiotic stresses like drought heat and salinity while kauz altar 84 milan and kachu for higher yield and wider adaptability jonathan 2008 lage and trethowan 2008 tadesse et al 2010 trethowan et al 2001 trethowan and reynolds 2007 several researchers highlighted the targeted breeding efforts at cimmyt mexico leading to fruitful results by way of release of a large number of germaplasm lines by countries with abiotic stresses such as water scarcity high temperature stress etc crespo herrera et al 2018 lantican et al 2016 4 3 associated traits the average gy of all genotypes separately compared year wise indicated that 2016 17 4383 t ha 1 recorded less yield compared to 2017 18 4488 t ha 1 and these results were generally within the range of previous studies in india salunkhe et al 2015 the lower yield in 2016 17 was due to lesser agbm accumulation as compared to 2017 18 the lesser gy and agbm during 2016 17 may be due to heavy rainfall of 54 mm within a span of a single day during january which might have affected the growth and establishment of crop due to waterlogging waterlogging affecting yield component traits and ultimately leading to a significant yield reduction was reported celedonio et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 whereas in 2017 18 a similar rainfall of 63 mm was evenly distributed into two spells in the month of january and february which might have contributed to marginally better yield gy was reduced by 10 in 2016 17 and 3 9 in 2017 18 under reduced irrigation 60 of cpe as compared to irrigation at 80 of cpe the agbm of years was observed to be reduced by around 4 to 8 when irrigation was supplied at 60 of cpe compared to irrigation at 80 of the cpe this might be attributed to water stress imposed by 60 of cpe treatment dorostkar et al 2014 also reported that water stress in treatment involving no irrigation led to yield reduction hi ranged from 0 28 to 0 36 in 60 of cpe and 0 29 to 0 37 in 80 of cpe treatments were found to be not affecting the hi in this study while farré and faci 2009 reported that water stress linearly affected hi 4 4 gge biplot in this experiment pc1 and pc2 components together accounted for 99 34 total variability for wue this validated the relevance of biplot for explaining genotype and genotype environment interaction effect to identify the mega environments yang et al 2009 who gave the concept of gge biplot reported that more than 60 total variation pc1 pc2 is a necessary prerequisite for its suitability to characterize the environments pc1 represented by horizontal axis explains the main effect of genotype while pc2 represented by vertical axis explains the interaction of genotypes with the environment yan 2002 in the experiment 60 of cpe treatment was relatively more discriminating treatment for wue because its vector had the longest length yan et al 2007 explained that presence of long vector and small angles with the aec abscissa are most discriminating and are most suited environments for selection of adapted genotypes while shortest vectors with larger angles are least discriminating and hence are not suitable for selecting the genotypes identification and characterizing similar and dissimilar environments help in deploying resources judiciously and this is achieved by knowing the degree of correlation between the environments yan and rajcan 2002 the polygon view of the gge biplot revealed presence of five genotypes on the vertices of the polygon the genotype situated on the vertex in each sector was the highest wue genotype in the given environments that were also situated in that sector yan et al 2000 the genotype located on the vertex dbw 110 dbw235 dbw 140 pbw 550 without any environment in its sector was the poorest with respect to wue yan 2001 the advantage of polygon view of a gge biplot is it explains the presence or absence of crossover genotype environment interactions involving the most responsive genotypes and is suggestive of the existence or absence of different mega environments among the tested environments yan and rajcan 2002 the mean vis à vis stability plot shows the performance and stability of genotypes fig 8 in this plot stability is explained by average environment coordination aec method yan 2002 in fig 8 the aec axis with an arrow passes through the origin of biplot and grows towards genotypic higher means the average environment contains mean pc1 and pc2 values of environments yan 2001 the lines perpendicular to the aec and their absolute length indicates the stability of the genotype the stable genotype was said to be the one having shortest length of line yan and kang 2003 4 5 quantification of water savings the cost of irrigation water in haryana is approximately usd 213 ha 1 meena et al 2019 by adoption of identified wheat genotypes with high wue can save on an average usd 42 6 ha 1 if 20 water saved in the form of 80 of cpe treatment is accounted for monetary terms simply by the adaption of these cultivars over the whole of north western plains zone of india a region experiencing the over exploitation of groundwater with intense cropping comprising 12 m ha wheat area could save millions of dollars the conventional practice of irrigating wheat at 60 mm water per irrigation accounts for consumption of 38 340 million m3 of water every year in the north western plains zone of india alone and by cultivation of high wue genotypes under micro irrigation an estimated amount of 7728 million m3 of water can be conserved every year 5 conclusion in order to find genotypes with higher wue 71 diverse wheat germplasm lines comprising released as well as advanced breeding lines were pre screened at water limited conditions at 60 cpe imposed by drip irrigation under field conditions during 2015 16 the selected 16 wheat genotypes were investigated in detail for wue and other associated traits under two limited water regimes 60 and 80 of cpe for two consecutive years during 2016 17 and 2017 18 pearson correlation analysis revealed that gy r 0 99 hi r 0 86 tgw r 0 52 and scmr post anthesis r 0 46 had a strong positive correlation while scmr pre anthesis had a moderate positive effect r 0 32 on wue ranking of genotype means for wue using tukey s test of significance and mean vs stability plot of gge biplot analysis identified dbw 243 2 40 kg m 3 47ibwsn 938 2 17 kg m 3 dbw 166 2 19 kg m 3 and dbw 222 2 14 kg m 3 as the best water use efficient genotypes which produced higher or at par yield consuming less water the identified high wue genotype could be a useful resource to researchers globally to develop water use efficient cultivars with high yield additionally the associated traits on wue could be used as selection criteria in breeding wheat for limited water availability conditions superior wue genotypes provide opportunities for saving at least 20 of depleting water resources thereby directly contributing to the reduced cost of cultivation which gets reflected in farm profit of usd 42 6 ha 1 cultivation of improved water use efficient genotypes which could produce at par yield with 20 less water over 12 m ha wheat area of north western plains zone may conserve around 7728 million m3 of water every year the identification of these superior wue genotypes will be useful to researchers globally especially from regions with limited water

10924,poor fertilizer nitrogen recovery due to excessive n leaching in sandy soils often results in low cotton yield the objective of the present study was to compare nitrate n accumulation in the rootzone leaching to plant uptake and cotton yield under different urea application methods in a desert sandy soil the study was conducted on southern oasis of the taklamakan desert china during cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 treatments included a control no n fertilization c conventional top dressing of urea before flood irrigation ctd fertigation of soluble urea by drip irrigation fd and urea side drilled in mud after flood irrigation sdm results revealed that sdm and fd methods retained 4 fold and 3 fold respectively higher nitrate n in 0 60 cm layer of the soil profile than ctd the later had the most accumulation in 60 120 cm zone of the soil profile however greater nitrate n accumulation in cotton root zone 0 60 cm with sdm corresponded to aboveground cotton n uptake 6 and 41 higher than with fd and ctd respectively the highest n leaching of 165 kg n ha 1 occurred with ctd being 61 and 70 higher than fd and sdm respectively improved n uptake under sdm corresponded to higher cotton biomass boll density boll weight seed cotton and lint yield and agronomic physiological and recovery n use efficiencies than fd and ctd methods together the results indicate that flood irrigation followed by side drilling of urea in mud is effective to improve yield nitrogen recovery and use efficiency of cotton on sandy soils where the drip irrigation is not locally preferred keywords top dressing nitrate n concentration rhizosphere fertigation growth cotton yield 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the major and essential plant nutrient which is excessively used for healthy crop growth and profitable yield formation below 2002 ju et al 2004 but its leaching losses in sandy soils are inevitable duynisveld et al 1988 lewan 1994 nitrogen is broadly applied in the form of urea while plants preferably uptake as nitrate n maathuis 2009 the applied urea initially converts into ammonia in the soil and then nitrifies into n o 3 n ghaly and ramakrishnan 2015 which is highly prone to leaching in coarse soils köhler et al 2006 paramasivam et al 2002 zotarelli et al 2007 comparatively the nitrification process in well drained and aerated soils occurs much quicker than the silt or clay soils ghaly and ramakrishnan 2015 consequently in sandy soils nitrate n leaching occurs at significantly higher pace boumans et al 2005 vinten et al 1994 and it can drain out of the root zone in the matter of days while this leached nitrate n can even reach the aquifer within months which can be seriously detrimental to ground water quality gaines and gaines 1994 shrestha et al 2010 about 90 million metric tons of nitrogen are globally used every year for crop nutrition good et al 2004 and around 50 70 of that is lost through different means with the highest in leaching hodge et al 2000 boumans et al 2005 recorded 16 leaching loss of total applied n in the arable sand lands which was quantified as 210 kg ha 1 y 1 moreover zotarelli et al 2007 and hu et al 2008 reported 32 64 and 32 61 leaching loss of applied n from sandy soils respectively while libutti and monteleone 2017 quantified 156 kg ha 1 leaching loss of total applied n from the sandy soils every year therefore this momentous and continuous leaching of nitrogen from the cultivated sandy soils is demanding to improve n fertilization techniques not only for healthy crop growth but also for healthy environment cotton gossypium hirsutum l is an important oilseed and fiber crop which has a pronounced economic significance worldwide cetin and bilgel 2002 its plant has a tapering root system and about 83 95 of its feedings roots resides in the top 0 60 cm soil profile min et al 2014 usually the loam and well drained soils are best suited for cotton cultivation but such soils facilitate n leaching due to low water holding capacity in addition the conventional flood irrigation and n application practices further aggravate n leaching losses lewan 1994 rong and xuefeng 2011 resulting in low n recovery crop growth and productivity however in order to improve nitrogen uptake and use efficiency of cotton in sandy soils it is must needed to develop an efficient nitrogen fertilization technique that may ensure the maximum retention of nitrate n in the feeding zone top 0 60 cm of cotton roots in xinjiang province of china cotton is widespread cultivated due to promising climate shareef et al 2018a while most of its cotton comes from oasis lands around the taklamakan desert feng et al 2017 peng et al 2014 the soils on these oasis are usually coarse textured aeolian sandy soils with high water infiltration potential gui et al 2010 shareef et al 2018b the mulched drip irrigation technique is widely used in the region for cotton cultivation due to hyperarid conditions zhou et al 2012 but still a significant cotton area comes under conventional flood furrow irrigation method peng et al 2014 in drip irrigated cotton urea fertilizer is fertigated with drip irrigation while in conventional flood irrigation method it is top dressed or broadcasted along cotton rows before applying irrigation since urea is highly soluble in water and sandy soils can quickly infiltrate irrigation water therefore a heavy leaching loss and low recovery of applied nitrogen under conventional irrigation practices are inevitable however this unavoidable waste of applied n under flood irrigated conditions can potentially be alleviated by side drilling of urea alongside cotton rows in the mud when all gravitational water had drained out and the soil appears like a sludge or moisture saturated paste this method of urea side drilling in mud sdm is a simple modification of the conventional top dressing ctd technique in which urea is side drilled in a sludge of sand soon after the infiltration of applied water rather than applying prior irrigation because in muddy condition still an ample quantity of water remains available to dissolve the applied urea the literature reporting such kind of amendment in ctd from the nutritional perspective of crops in coarse textured soils is lacking thus it was hypothesized that sdm can enhance nitrate n availability in cotton rootzone by reducing leaching loss and maximizes uptake and nitrogen use efficiency in sandy soils particular objectives of this field study were 1 to compare the amount of nitrate n accumulation in top 0 120 cm soil layers and nitrogen leaching losses versus uptake under different nitrogen fertilization methods including conventional top dressing of urea ctd the fertigation of water soluble urea with drip irrigation fd and urea side drilling in mud sdm alongside cotton rows 2 to sort out the best possible nitrogen application method for cotton that would reduce leaching and improve nitrogen recovery efficiency in sandy soils under flood furrow irrigated conditions through evaluating the growth and yield attributes of cotton on sandy soil of the taklamakan desert in northwest of china this study could be an important contribution in the science of nitrogen leaching losses management in cotton and other crops grown on sandy soils under conventional flood or furrow irrigated conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of study area field experiment was carried out at cele national station for desert ecosystem research xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences during two consecutive cotton seasons of years 2015 and 2016 geographically the study area is located on the southern boundary of taklimakan desert 36 51 30 n 80 44 28 e xinjiang northwest china its summer is warmest up to 41 c mainly in july while the mean annual temperature precipitation and evaporation reach 11 9 c 35 1 mm and 2595 mm respectively zeng et al 2013 the weather changes recorded for both cropping seasons of the study years are shown in fig 1 water table of the study site is about 14 0 m deep and the chemical analysis of groundwater showed ph 7 7 dissolved salts almost 1 8 g l 1 and nitrate n concentration 0 42 mg n l 1 the soil type of study site is primarily categorized as loamy sand aeolian sandy soil gui et al 2010 shareef et al 2018b pre sowing soil 0 20 cm chemical analysis showed available n 15 3 mg kg 1 available p 1 87 mg kg 1 available k 182 5 mg kg 1 na ions 16 83 g kg 1 and ec 146 3 μs cm 1 however the detailed information on physical and chemical properties of top 120 cm soil profile on layers 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm basis are provided in table 1 2 2 field layout and agronomic management the treatments included conventional top dressing of urea followed by flood irrigation ctd fertigation of water solubilized urea with drip irrigation fd and side drilling of urea in the mud along the cotton rows soon after flood irrigation sdm when the applied water has completely infiltrated and the soil surface appears like a moisture saturated paste fig 2 besides a control c treatment with no urea input was also arranged for the comparison of observations the upper 1 20 m soil profile was monitored periodically for nitrate n accumulation in 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil depths each time after nitrogen urea application pre sowing and postharvest soil samples were collected from these soil layers for the analysis of residual total npk concentrations table 1 cotton was planted on 20th april during both trial years under high density plantation technique shareef et al 2018a each experimental unit had an area of 60 m2 in which three beds of 1 2 10 m dimensions were raised and mulched with a plastic film to conserve the moisture and facilitate seed germination cotton seeds were sown on mulched beds at 30 cm and 60 cm alternate narrow and wider rows with 10 cm planting distance shareef et al 2018c in drip irrigated plots the drip lines were placed under the plastic film between the narrow rows 30 cm while all other plots were irrigated by flood irrigation the plastic mulch was maintained only up to squaring stage and removed from all plots prior to nitrogen fertilizer urea application the quantities of npk fertilizers used in this trial were 240 120 and 60 kg ha 1 respectively all phosphorus and potassium were applied at the time of plantation while urea as nitrogen source was applied in four splits ¼ at sowing ¼ at first irrigation ¼ at peak bloom and ¼ at boll formation 2 3 measurement of nitrate n leaching versus uptake and its dynamics in different soil layers normally the maximum uptake and leaching of applied n in sand soils occurs during the initial 3 5 days after irrigation due to high relative soil moisture content therefore soil core sampling was carried out with the help of soil auger on day 0 before n application day 2 1 day after n application dana day 4 3 dana and day 6 5 dana from 0 to 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil depths for the quantification of n o 3 n content at the same time cotton leaf samples leaf petiole were also collected form each plot as a homogenous mixture of young and old leaves to quantify total nitrogen uptake for the quantification of n recovery cotton leaves were particularly preferred for sampling because cotton plant stores the major fraction of its all absorbed nitrogen in leaves as amino acids soon after uptake hake et al 1991 the same sampling pattern was repeated on each n application interval which were 12 june 4 july and 6 august of the experimental years moisture content in fresh soil samples of each soil layer was also recorded that was determined by gravimetric method 24 h 105 c table 2 afterwards all soil and plant samples were air dried and grounded separately for chemical analysis the amount of total n in plant material was determined using kjeldahl method horneck and miller 1998 the nitrate n content in soil was quantified by extracting soil samples in kcl solution using potassium chloride extraction spectrophotometry technique narayana and sunil 2009 in field crop studies the term leaching basically means the loss of water solubilized nitrate n from rootzone through percolation of irrigation or rain water along the soil profile and reaching the groundwater lin et al 2001 in addition leaching also refers to a difference between the amount of total residual and applied nitrogen and recovered by plants along with some loss in denitrification therefore in the present experiment for an exact estimation of n leaching beyond 120 cm soil profile pre sowing and postharvest residual content of total nitrogen the quantity of n applied ha 1 and recovered by cotton plants were used in the equation of cui et al 2010 1 l i r n 0 120 c m a n p r n 0 120 c m n r where l is the amount of n leached kg ha 1 irn and prn are the initial and postharvest total

statistical analysis the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates all data were statistically analyzed using fischer s anova technique and the least significance difference lsd test was applied at 5 probability for the ranking and appraisal of treatment means a computer program statistix v 8 1 was used for all statistical calculations 3 results 3 1 n o 3 n concentration in different soil layers the dynamics of n o 3 n concentration in 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil layers over the period of time under different n application methods are shown in fig 3 a b to h for the year 2015 and 2016 statistical analysis indicated that concentration of n o 3 n at different soil depths was significantly p 0 05 affected by n application methods in 0 90 cm soil layer the overall concentration of n o 3 n was the maximum on day 4 while in 90 120 cm zone it reached the maximum on day 6 of urea treatment as for as the n o 3 n concentration at different soil layers is concerned the highest 45 00 and 49 25 mg kg 1 at 0 30 cm and 17 10 and 17 91 mg kg 1 at 30 60 cm depths were recorded under sdm method during 1st and 2nd year respectively however at 60 90 and 90 120 cm depths the maximum nitrate n was 12 16 and 10 41 mg kg 1 and 14 28 and 13 28 mg kg 1 under ctd in 2015 and 2016 respectively from another aspect the accumulation of n o 3 n in top 0 60 cm layer was 33 and 60 higher under sdm than that of fd and ctd respectively on the other hand in 60 90 cm soil layer the maximum n o 3 n was recorded 12 16 mg kg 1 2015 and 10 41 mg kg 1 2016 under ctd that was about 38 and 51 higher than fd and sdm respectively a significant proportion of applied n drained out of cotton rootzone under ctd which is obvious from fig 3g and 3 h which show an enhanced accumulation of n o 3 n in 90 120 cm zone under ctd that was about 2 and 4 fold higher than those of recorded under fd and sdm methods respectively 3 2 n o 3 n leaching and plant uptake fig 4 a and b depict significant p 0 05 effect of nitrogen urea application methods on n o 3 n leaching losses and recovery in cotton plants during both years of study 2015 and 2016 the highest n leaching of 166 25 and 165 06 kg ha 1 was recorded under ctd in 2015 and 2016 respectively that was about 61 and 70 higher than recorded under fd and sdm methods respectively unlike leaching nitrogen recovery was the maximum 200 07 kg ha 1 in 2015 and 194 35 kg ha 1 in 2016 under sdm method that was followed by fd with 192 05 and 184 25 kg ha 1 during the 1st and 2nd year respectively overall n recovery under fd and sdm methods was statistically similar while on an average it was 35 and 41 respectively higher than observed under ctd however the plants in non treated plots could uptake only 29 97 and 35 81 kg ha 1 of available nitrogen during the both study years respectively 3 3 crop growth response to nitrogen application techniques data recorded for growth attributes indicated significant p 0 05 effect of nitrogen application methods on leaf area index lai and above ground total dry matter tdm of cotton the periodic data of year 2015 and 2016 shown in fig 5 a and b revealed that except on fewer instances the lai under sdm was significantly higher than c ctd and fd treatments at climax on 212 and 210 days of years lai reached 4 88 and 4 81 m2 m 2 which were statistically at par with 4 49 and 4 65 m2 m 2 of fd while significantly apart from 4 18 and 4 30 m2 m 2 of ctd in the first and second year respectively quite similar trend was recorded for cotton biomass tdm accumulation during both trial years fig 6 a and b the maximum tdm on days 212 and 210 of year 2015 and 2016 was recorded 1 17 and 1 13 kg m 2 under sdm that was followed by fd 1 11 and 1 05 kg m 2 and ctd 0 93 and 0 87 kg m 2 respectively the growth response of control plots c was the lowest and it was recorded just for the comparison of treatments on the other hand lai and tdm depicted a significant linear relationship with the amount of nitrogen uptake fig 7 a and b with biennial mean r2 values of 0 95 and 0 98 respectively 3 4 yield attributes and nitrogen use efficiencies cotton yield contributing factors and final seed cotton and lint yield response to nitrogen fertilizer application methods has been presented in table 3 plant population m 2 was not affected by application methods during both study years while the other agronomic parameters including number of bolls m 2 boll weight g boll 1 and seed cotton and lint yields were significantly p 0 05 affected the maximum number of bolls in the first and second season were recorded 151 25 and 149 50 m 2 under sdm method while the lowest after control were recorded 112 00 and 109 75 m 2 for ctd respectively similar response was recorded for boll weight with the maximum 7 58 and 7 73 g under sdm for the trial years respectively seed cotton and lint yields were also the highest under sdm producing 3870 and 1783 kg ha 1 in the first and 3828 and 1764 kg ha 1 in the second year respectively however the lowermost seed cotton and lint yields were recorded from control while amongst nitrogen treated plots the lowest were recorded 2845 and 1138 kg ha 1 in 2015 and 2744 and 1097 kg ha 1 in 2016 under ctd respectively similarly nitrogen application methods also affected the agronomic physiological and recovery nitrogen use efficiencies of cotton during the both years of study table 4 sdm resulted in the maximum anue pnue and rnue of 5 93 7 58 and 0 71 kg kg 1 n in 2015 and 5 74 7 91 and 0 66 kg kg 1 n in 2016 respectively however the lowest anue pnue and rnue from n treated plots were recorded under ctd which were 3 42 6 90 and 0 39 kg kg 1 n in 2015 and 2 95 6 15 and 0 34 kg kg 1 n in 2016 4 discussion concentration of nitrate n in 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil layers varied over time after urea input under various application techniques fig 3a h since the day 0 represented the day before urea treatment therefore at each sampling depth it depicted relatively lower nitrate n content than those on subsequent sampling days while the increased concentration of nitrate n in soil layers on day 2 4 and 6 would have been due to nitrification of applied urea because ghaly and ramakrishnan 2015 reported that urea undergoes nitrate n formation in aerated soils after going through ammonification process making n available for plant uptake usually the concentration of nitrate n in a particular soil layer mainly depends on the amount of available nitrogen source added urea or organic matter and soil moisture content verstraete and focht 1977 in this study sdm method resulted in an enhanced accumulation of nitrate n in top 0 60 cm soil layer that can be attributed to the maximum retention of applied urea n source in that zone of soil profile and comparatively lesser moisture than deeper soil layers table 2 that might have facilitated nitrification in accordance with that hu et al 2008 also reported enhanced accumulation 20 85 mg kg 1 of nitrate n in the rootzone of maize under improved n application techniques on the other hand nitrate n concentration in all observed layers was comparatively lower on day 2 than the subsequent days which can be attributed to comparatively higher soil water content than following days table 2 because soil moisture has an inverse relation with the rate of nitrification sahrawat 2008 strong et al 1999 although under fd and sdm methods some downward flow of applied n with the soil solution was also observed but this movement under ctd was more vigorous that resulted in substantially higher nitrate n accumulation in 60 120 cm zone fig 3e h and even a significant fraction leached beyond this observed 0 120 cm profile this massive shift of nitrogen to deeper soil layers under ctd can be attributed to heavy irrigation leaching agent along with urea input because of poor water holding capacity of soil in the line of that rong and xuefeng 2011 and sharma et al 2012 concluded that higher irrigation volumes facilitate more nitrate n movement towards the deeper layers of coarse soil a significant variation occurred in the total quantity of leached and plant recovered nitrogen under different n application methods the fd and sdm methods proved to be efficient in retaining the maximum nitrate n in the feeding zone of cotton roots which eventually resulted in higher plant s uptake fig 4a besides these methods also showed some leaching of a minor fraction of total applied n while this loss under ctd was massive nearly 60 of the total applied n fig 4b these results are consistent with hu et al 2008 who reported the maximum 61 leaching of nitrate n from a conventionally irrigated maize field in sandy soil of the desert moreover zotarelli et al 2007 recorded 32 64 n leaching from vegetable fields fertilized by furrow fertigation method likewise sharma et al 2012 also calculated the highest 92 kg ha 1 leaching loss of applied n beyond rootzone of conventionally furrow irrigated cotton in sandy soil however this mighty loss under ctd would have been due to bulk flow of soil matrix through soil profile because of flood irrigation consistent with that lin et al 2001 and gabriel et al 2012 also reported that amount of irrigation water is a key factor that could be mainly responsible for leaching of nitrate n in the loose soils though the quantity of water applied by drip irrigation was not too much in fd method but its discharge from emitters continued for hours and meanwhile water would have traveled a significant vertical distance in the soil that could be quite enough to transport dissolved n towards the deeper soil layers the same might have happened in drip fertigation method of the present study which also depicted some leaching loss of the applied n as well fig 4b on the other hand n leaching observed under sdm technique could have been due to downward drift of residual unused nitrate n left in soil from previous urea treatment and drained with the subsequent flood irrigation consistent with that gabriel et al 2012 also reported similar pattern of the leaching of residual nitrogen from an irrigated fallow field contrarily the highest accumulation of n in cotton leaves under sdm and fd was the consequence of their enhanced nitrate n retention in the zone of the maximum feeding roots of cotton resulting in the higher uptake quite similar to these observations hu et al 2008 reported 190 kg ha 1 nitrogen uptake by maize under improved application techniques in the sandy soil of desert due to greater nitrate n accumulation around the feeding roots moreover it is also obvious from results that n recovery under fd was statistically similar with sdm which is consistent with stamatiadis et al 2016 who found that nitrogen fertigation with drip irrigation made more n available in rhizosphere that resulted in the highest uptake 192 261 kg ha 1 these illustrations highlight the significance of improved n application methods for better n management in well drained coarse soils to reduce its leaching losses and enhanced recovery in plants since the vegetative growth is a key function of nitrogen therefore higher dry matter accumulation and leaf area index of cotton under sdm and fd methods can be attributed to greater nitrogen uptake than ctd which is also evident in a correlation between n uptake and growth response fig 7a and b these findings are in accordance with chen et al 2010 who reported the direct impact of improved nitrogen uptake on above ground total dry matter tdm and other vegetative characteristics of cotton likewise luo et al 2015 also reported 20 6 and 25 5 higher tdm and leaf area of cotton under improved n fertilization methods respectively due to higher nitrogen recovery compared with conventional methods however better uptake under fd and sdm can be attributed to higher nitrate n retention in crop s rootzone under these techniques than that in ctd in accordance with that gadagi et al 2004 also found that field practices which ensure the maximum retention of nitrate n around feeding roots of plants necessarily result in better uptake and eventually the better dry biomass and leaf area development cotton yield is actually an outcome of the performance of its yield contributing factors including plant population bolls density and boll weight mccarty et al 2008 in the present investigation urea side drilling in mud resulted in significantly high number of bolls with higher boll weight than fd and ctd that eventually resulted in the maximum seed cotton and lint yields in the line of these results zhi et al 2016 also reported linear relationship between boll density and seed cotton yield but for boll weight their illustrations were contradictory however the increased boll density and boll weight under sdm can be attributed to enhanced n recovery that might have led to an increased carbon and nitrogen metabolism in leaves resulting in an increased rate of photosynthesis and more assimilates translocation to bolls these interpretations are consistent with hong biao et al 2008 who found a steady decline in c n ratio in cotton leaves with increasing boll age due to enhanced assimilates shift to growing bolls therefore in the long run this healthy development of cotton yield components under sdm and fd methods resulted in higher cotton yield these yield results of the present study are consistent with wanjura et al 2002 in addition zhang et al 2012 also found that improved nitrogen management in cotton resulted in approximately 33 higher lint production than the conventional practices the agronomic nue refers to an increase in lint yield kg ha 1 per unit of nitrogen applied novoa and loomis 1981 in sand soils anue increases with increasing nitrogen input while its losses in to the environment also increase linearly under conventional practices ye et al 2007 though the quantity of n applied to cotton in the present study was same under all application techniques but the highest anue and pnue under sdm and fd could be due to the maximum availability of n o 3 n in the top soil layers fig 3a d that led to a higher uptake than ctd fig 4a and b in accordance with the present results stamatiadis et al 2016 also concluded that nue of cotton is indeed the declaratory of its n recovery efficiency and it indicates a relationship between the both similarly du et al 2016 also reported similar results of pnue of cotton as recorded under sdm and fd methods of the present study on the other hand recovery nue exhibits the potential of a particular technique that how much can it facilitate the absorption of n by crop plants fang et al 2006 in the present study sdm facilitated higher n uptake followed by fd method by retaining the maximum nitrate n in feeding zone of cotton roots that resulted in the highest n recovery consistent with these results yang et al 2017 also reported the recovery efficiency of about 70 and 30 for the improved and conventional n fertilization practices respectively 5 conclusions the concentration of nitrate n in cotton root zone its leaching losses and uptake and the final yield and nitrogen use efficiencies in sandy soil of the taklamakan desert were significantly affected by nitrogen application methods urea sdm and fd methods resulted in greater nitrate n accumulation in top 0 60 cm soil layer while in ctd the highest accumulation was in 60 120 cm zone ctd technique resulted in almost 60 leaching of the total applied nitrogen while in contrast sdm and fd methods resulted in higher n recovery due to higher availability of nitrate n in the feeding zone 0 60 cm of cotton roots consequently the healthier crop growth the maximum seed cotton and lint yields and improved nitrogen use efficiencies anue pnue rnue were observed under sdm followed by fd method however in the light of these results urea side drilling in mud soon after the flood irrigation is recommended for conventionally flood irrigated sandy areas as it improves nitrogen recovery and use efficiency of cotton with the minimum leaching losses while fd could be the best alternative more specifically in water limited environments in addition considering the supremacy of sdm method further studies on n application rates under this technique are inevitable which may further help out in reducing its recommended rates in sandy soils and eventually the n fertilization cost acknowledgements

10924,poor fertilizer nitrogen recovery due to excessive n leaching in sandy soils often results in low cotton yield the objective of the present study was to compare nitrate n accumulation in the rootzone leaching to plant uptake and cotton yield under different urea application methods in a desert sandy soil the study was conducted on southern oasis of the taklamakan desert china during cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 treatments included a control no n fertilization c conventional top dressing of urea before flood irrigation ctd fertigation of soluble urea by drip irrigation fd and urea side drilled in mud after flood irrigation sdm results revealed that sdm and fd methods retained 4 fold and 3 fold respectively higher nitrate n in 0 60 cm layer of the soil profile than ctd the later had the most accumulation in 60 120 cm zone of the soil profile however greater nitrate n accumulation in cotton root zone 0 60 cm with sdm corresponded to aboveground cotton n uptake 6 and 41 higher than with fd and ctd respectively the highest n leaching of 165 kg n ha 1 occurred with ctd being 61 and 70 higher than fd and sdm respectively improved n uptake under sdm corresponded to higher cotton biomass boll density boll weight seed cotton and lint yield and agronomic physiological and recovery n use efficiencies than fd and ctd methods together the results indicate that flood irrigation followed by side drilling of urea in mud is effective to improve yield nitrogen recovery and use efficiency of cotton on sandy soils where the drip irrigation is not locally preferred keywords top dressing nitrate n concentration rhizosphere fertigation growth cotton yield 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the major and essential plant nutrient which is excessively used for healthy crop growth and profitable yield formation below 2002 ju et al 2004 but its leaching losses in sandy soils are inevitable duynisveld et al 1988 lewan 1994 nitrogen is broadly applied in the form of urea while plants preferably uptake as nitrate n maathuis 2009 the applied urea initially converts into ammonia in the soil and then nitrifies into n o 3 n ghaly and ramakrishnan 2015 which is highly prone to leaching in coarse soils köhler et al 2006 paramasivam et al 2002 zotarelli et al 2007 comparatively the nitrification process in well drained and aerated soils occurs much quicker than the silt or clay soils ghaly and ramakrishnan 2015 consequently in sandy soils nitrate n leaching occurs at significantly higher pace boumans et al 2005 vinten et al 1994 and it can drain out of the root zone in the matter of days while this leached nitrate n can even reach the aquifer within months which can be seriously detrimental to ground water quality gaines and gaines 1994 shrestha et al 2010 about 90 million metric tons of nitrogen are globally used every year for crop nutrition good et al 2004 and around 50 70 of that is lost through different means with the highest in leaching hodge et al 2000 boumans et al 2005 recorded 16 leaching loss of total applied n in the arable sand lands which was quantified as 210 kg ha 1 y 1 moreover zotarelli et al 2007 and hu et al 2008 reported 32 64 and 32 61 leaching loss of applied n from sandy soils respectively while libutti and monteleone 2017 quantified 156 kg ha 1 leaching loss of total applied n from the sandy soils every year therefore this momentous and continuous leaching of nitrogen from the cultivated sandy soils is demanding to improve n fertilization techniques not only for healthy crop growth but also for healthy environment cotton gossypium hirsutum l is an important oilseed and fiber crop which has a pronounced economic significance worldwide cetin and bilgel 2002 its plant has a tapering root system and about 83 95 of its feedings roots resides in the top 0 60 cm soil profile min et al 2014 usually the loam and well drained soils are best suited for cotton cultivation but such soils facilitate n leaching due to low water holding capacity in addition the conventional flood irrigation and n application practices further aggravate n leaching losses lewan 1994 rong and xuefeng 2011 resulting in low n recovery crop growth and productivity however in order to improve nitrogen uptake and use efficiency of cotton in sandy soils it is must needed to develop an efficient nitrogen fertilization technique that may ensure the maximum retention of nitrate n in the feeding zone top 0 60 cm of cotton roots in xinjiang province of china cotton is widespread cultivated due to promising climate shareef et al 2018a while most of its cotton comes from oasis lands around the taklamakan desert feng et al 2017 peng et al 2014 the soils on these oasis are usually coarse textured aeolian sandy soils with high water infiltration potential gui et al 2010 shareef et al 2018b the mulched drip irrigation technique is widely used in the region for cotton cultivation due to hyperarid conditions zhou et al 2012 but still a significant cotton area comes under conventional flood furrow irrigation method peng et al 2014 in drip irrigated cotton urea fertilizer is fertigated with drip irrigation while in conventional flood irrigation method it is top dressed or broadcasted along cotton rows before applying irrigation since urea is highly soluble in water and sandy soils can quickly infiltrate irrigation water therefore a heavy leaching loss and low recovery of applied nitrogen under conventional irrigation practices are inevitable however this unavoidable waste of applied n under flood irrigated conditions can potentially be alleviated by side drilling of urea alongside cotton rows in the mud when all gravitational water had drained out and the soil appears like a sludge or moisture saturated paste this method of urea side drilling in mud sdm is a simple modification of the conventional top dressing ctd technique in which urea is side drilled in a sludge of sand soon after the infiltration of applied water rather than applying prior irrigation because in muddy condition still an ample quantity of water remains available to dissolve the applied urea the literature reporting such kind of amendment in ctd from the nutritional perspective of crops in coarse textured soils is lacking thus it was hypothesized that sdm can enhance nitrate n availability in cotton rootzone by reducing leaching loss and maximizes uptake and nitrogen use efficiency in sandy soils particular objectives of this field study were 1 to compare the amount of nitrate n accumulation in top 0 120 cm soil layers and nitrogen leaching losses versus uptake under different nitrogen fertilization methods including conventional top dressing of urea ctd the fertigation of water soluble urea with drip irrigation fd and urea side drilling in mud sdm alongside cotton rows 2 to sort out the best possible nitrogen application method for cotton that would reduce leaching and improve nitrogen recovery efficiency in sandy soils under flood furrow irrigated conditions through evaluating the growth and yield attributes of cotton on sandy soil of the taklamakan desert in northwest of china this study could be an important contribution in the science of nitrogen leaching losses management in cotton and other crops grown on sandy soils under conventional flood or furrow irrigated conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of study area field experiment was carried out at cele national station for desert ecosystem research xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences during two consecutive cotton seasons of years 2015 and 2016 geographically the study area is located on the southern boundary of taklimakan desert 36 51 30 n 80 44 28 e xinjiang northwest china its summer is warmest up to 41 c mainly in july while the mean annual temperature precipitation and evaporation reach 11 9 c 35 1 mm and 2595 mm respectively zeng et al 2013 the weather changes recorded for both cropping seasons of the study years are shown in fig 1 water table of the study site is about 14 0 m deep and the chemical analysis of groundwater showed ph 7 7 dissolved salts almost 1 8 g l 1 and nitrate n concentration 0 42 mg n l 1 the soil type of study site is primarily categorized as loamy sand aeolian sandy soil gui et al 2010 shareef et al 2018b pre sowing soil 0 20 cm chemical analysis showed available n 15 3 mg kg 1 available p 1 87 mg kg 1 available k 182 5 mg kg 1 na ions 16 83 g kg 1 and ec 146 3 μs cm 1 however the detailed information on physical and chemical properties of top 120 cm soil profile on layers 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm basis are provided in table 1 2 2 field layout and agronomic management the treatments included conventional top dressing of urea followed by flood irrigation ctd fertigation of water solubilized urea with drip irrigation fd and side drilling of urea in the mud along the cotton rows soon after flood irrigation sdm when the applied water has completely infiltrated and the soil surface appears like a moisture saturated paste fig 2 besides a control c treatment with no urea input was also arranged for the comparison of observations the upper 1 20 m soil profile was monitored periodically for nitrate n accumulation in 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil depths each time after nitrogen urea application pre sowing and postharvest soil samples were collected from these soil layers for the analysis of residual total npk concentrations table 1 cotton was planted on 20th april during both trial years under high density plantation technique shareef et al 2018a each experimental unit had an area of 60 m2 in which three beds of 1 2 10 m dimensions were raised and mulched with a plastic film to conserve the moisture and facilitate seed germination cotton seeds were sown on mulched beds at 30 cm and 60 cm alternate narrow and wider rows with 10 cm planting distance shareef et al 2018c in drip irrigated plots the drip lines were placed under the plastic film between the narrow rows 30 cm while all other plots were irrigated by flood irrigation the plastic mulch was maintained only up to squaring stage and removed from all plots prior to nitrogen fertilizer urea application the quantities of npk fertilizers used in this trial were 240 120 and 60 kg ha 1 respectively all phosphorus and potassium were applied at the time of plantation while urea as nitrogen source was applied in four splits ¼ at sowing ¼ at first irrigation ¼ at peak bloom and ¼ at boll formation 2 3 measurement of nitrate n leaching versus uptake and its dynamics in different soil layers normally the maximum uptake and leaching of applied n in sand soils occurs during the initial 3 5 days after irrigation due to high relative soil moisture content therefore soil core sampling was carried out with the help of soil auger on day 0 before n application day 2 1 day after n application dana day 4 3 dana and day 6 5 dana from 0 to 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil depths for the quantification of n o 3 n content at the same time cotton leaf samples leaf petiole were also collected form each plot as a homogenous mixture of young and old leaves to quantify total nitrogen uptake for the quantification of n recovery cotton leaves were particularly preferred for sampling because cotton plant stores the major fraction of its all absorbed nitrogen in leaves as amino acids soon after uptake hake et al 1991 the same sampling pattern was repeated on each n application interval which were 12 june 4 july and 6 august of the experimental years moisture content in fresh soil samples of each soil layer was also recorded that was determined by gravimetric method 24 h 105 c table 2 afterwards all soil and plant samples were air dried and grounded separately for chemical analysis the amount of total n in plant material was determined using kjeldahl method horneck and miller 1998 the nitrate n content in soil was quantified by extracting soil samples in kcl solution using potassium chloride extraction spectrophotometry technique narayana and sunil 2009 in field crop studies the term leaching basically means the loss of water solubilized nitrate n from rootzone through percolation of irrigation or rain water along the soil profile and reaching the groundwater lin et al 2001 in addition leaching also refers to a difference between the amount of total residual and applied nitrogen and recovered by plants along with some loss in denitrification therefore in the present experiment for an exact estimation of n leaching beyond 120 cm soil profile pre sowing and postharvest residual content of total nitrogen the quantity of n applied ha 1 and recovered by cotton plants were used in the equation of cui et al 2010 1 l i r n 0 120 c m a n p r n 0 120 c m n r where l is the amount of n leached kg ha 1 irn and prn are the initial and postharvest total residual n g kg 1 soil respectively in 0 120 cm soil profile an is the amount of added n kg ha 1 and nr is the seasonal amount of n recovered by cotton plants however nr was calculated as below 2 n r t n d 2 t n d 0 t n d 4 t n d 2 t n d 6 t n d 4 l t d m where tnd0 d2 d4 and d6 is the total amount of nitrogen accumulated in cotton leaves g kg 1 on day 0 2 4 and 6 of nitrogen application and ltdm is the total dry matter of leaves kg ha 1 2 4 measurement of crop growth yield attributes and nitrogen use efficiencies starting from early squaring stage half meter cotton rows were harvested randomly on fortnightly basis for growth analysis the leaves were isolated from stems and swiped through li cor leaf area meter for measurement of leaf area index lai afterwards the leaves and stems

statistical analysis the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates all data were statistically analyzed using fischer s anova technique and the least significance difference lsd test was applied at 5 probability for the ranking and appraisal of treatment means a computer program statistix v 8 1 was used for all statistical calculations 3 results 3 1 n o 3 n concentration in different soil layers the dynamics of n o 3 n concentration in 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil layers over the period of time under different n application methods are shown in fig 3 a b to h for the year 2015 and 2016 statistical analysis indicated that concentration of n o 3 n at different soil depths was significantly p 0 05 affected by n application methods in 0 90 cm soil layer the overall concentration of n o 3 n was the maximum on day 4 while in 90 120 cm zone it reached the maximum on day 6 of urea treatment as for as the n o 3 n concentration at different soil layers is concerned the highest 45 00 and 49 25 mg kg 1 at 0 30 cm and 17 10 and 17 91 mg kg 1 at 30 60 cm depths were recorded under sdm method during 1st and 2nd year respectively however at 60 90 and 90 120 cm depths the maximum nitrate n was 12 16 and 10 41 mg kg 1 and 14 28 and 13 28 mg kg 1 under ctd in 2015 and 2016 respectively from another aspect the accumulation of n o 3 n in top 0 60 cm layer was 33 and 60 higher under sdm than that of fd and ctd respectively on the other hand in 60 90 cm soil layer the maximum n o 3 n was recorded 12 16 mg kg 1 2015 and 10 41 mg kg 1 2016 under ctd that was about 38 and 51 higher than fd and sdm respectively a significant proportion of applied n drained out of cotton rootzone under ctd which is obvious from fig 3g and 3 h which show an enhanced accumulation of n o 3 n in 90 120 cm zone under ctd that was about 2 and 4 fold higher than those of recorded under fd and sdm methods respectively 3 2 n o 3 n leaching and plant uptake fig 4 a and b depict significant p 0 05 effect of nitrogen urea application methods on n o 3 n leaching losses and recovery in cotton plants during both years of study 2015 and 2016 the highest n leaching of 166 25 and 165 06 kg ha 1 was recorded under ctd in 2015 and 2016 respectively that was about 61 and 70 higher than recorded under fd and sdm methods respectively unlike leaching nitrogen recovery was the maximum 200 07 kg ha 1 in 2015 and 194 35 kg ha 1 in 2016 under sdm method that was followed by fd with 192 05 and 184 25 kg ha 1 during the 1st and 2nd year respectively overall n recovery under fd and sdm methods was statistically similar while on an average it was 35 and 41 respectively higher than observed under ctd however the plants in non treated plots could uptake only 29 97 and 35 81 kg ha 1 of available nitrogen during the both study years respectively 3 3 crop growth response to nitrogen application techniques data recorded for growth attributes indicated significant p 0 05 effect of nitrogen application methods on leaf area index lai and above ground total dry matter tdm of cotton the periodic data of year 2015 and 2016 shown in fig 5 a and b revealed that except on fewer instances the lai under sdm was significantly higher than c ctd and fd treatments at climax on 212 and 210 days of years lai reached 4 88 and 4 81 m2 m 2 which were statistically at par with 4 49 and 4 65 m2 m 2 of fd while significantly apart from 4 18 and 4 30 m2 m 2 of ctd in the first and second year respectively quite similar trend was recorded for cotton biomass tdm accumulation during both trial years fig 6 a and b the maximum tdm on days 212 and 210 of year 2015 and 2016 was recorded 1 17 and 1 13 kg m 2 under sdm that was followed by fd 1 11 and 1 05 kg m 2 and ctd 0 93 and 0 87 kg m 2 respectively the growth response of control plots c was the lowest and it was recorded just for the comparison of treatments on the other hand lai and tdm depicted a significant linear relationship with the amount of nitrogen uptake fig 7 a and b with biennial mean r2 values of 0 95 and 0 98 respectively 3 4 yield attributes and nitrogen use efficiencies cotton yield contributing factors and final seed cotton and lint yield response to nitrogen fertilizer application methods has been presented in table 3 plant population m 2 was not affected by application methods during both study years while the other agronomic parameters including number of bolls m 2 boll weight g boll 1 and seed cotton and lint yields were significantly p 0 05 affected the maximum number of bolls in the first and second season were recorded 151 25 and 149 50 m 2 under sdm method while the lowest after control were recorded 112 00 and 109 75 m 2 for ctd respectively similar response was recorded for boll weight with the maximum 7 58 and 7 73 g under sdm for the trial years respectively seed cotton and lint yields were also the highest under sdm producing 3870 and 1783 kg ha 1 in the first and 3828 and 1764 kg ha 1 in the second year respectively however the lowermost seed cotton and lint yields were recorded from control while amongst nitrogen treated plots the lowest were recorded 2845 and 1138 kg ha 1 in 2015 and 2744 and 1097 kg ha 1 in 2016 under ctd respectively similarly nitrogen application methods also affected the agronomic physiological and recovery nitrogen use efficiencies of cotton during the both years of study table 4 sdm resulted in the maximum anue pnue and rnue of 5 93 7 58 and 0 71 kg kg 1 n in 2015 and 5 74 7 91 and 0 66 kg kg 1 n in 2016 respectively however the lowest anue pnue and rnue from n treated plots were recorded under ctd which were 3 42 6 90 and 0 39 kg kg 1 n in 2015 and 2 95 6 15 and 0 34 kg kg 1 n in 2016 4 discussion concentration of nitrate n in 0 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil layers varied over time after urea input under various application techniques fig 3a h since the day 0 represented the day before urea treatment therefore at each sampling depth it depicted relatively lower nitrate n content than those on subsequent sampling days while the increased concentration of nitrate n in soil layers on day 2 4 and 6 would have been due to nitrification of applied urea because ghaly and ramakrishnan 2015 reported that urea undergoes nitrate n formation in aerated soils after going through ammonification process making n available for plant uptake usually the concentration of nitrate n in a particular soil layer mainly depends on the amount of available nitrogen source added urea or organic matter and soil moisture content verstraete and focht 1977 in this study sdm method resulted in an enhanced accumulation of nitrate n in top 0 60 cm soil layer that can be attributed to the maximum retention of applied urea n source in that zone of soil profile and comparatively lesser moisture than deeper soil layers table 2 that might have facilitated nitrification in accordance with that hu et al 2008 also reported enhanced accumulation 20 85 mg kg 1 of nitrate n in the rootzone of maize under improved n application techniques on the other hand nitrate n concentration in all observed layers was comparatively lower on day 2 than the subsequent days which can be attributed to comparatively higher soil water content than following days table 2 because soil moisture has an inverse relation with the rate of nitrification sahrawat 2008 strong et al 1999 although under fd and sdm methods some downward flow of applied n with the soil solution was also observed but this movement under ctd was more vigorous that resulted in substantially higher nitrate n accumulation in 60 120 cm zone fig 3e h and even a significant fraction leached beyond this observed 0 120 cm profile this massive shift of nitrogen to deeper soil layers under ctd can be attributed to heavy irrigation leaching agent along with urea input because of poor water holding capacity of soil in the line of that rong and xuefeng 2011 and sharma et al 2012 concluded that higher irrigation volumes facilitate more nitrate n movement towards the deeper layers of coarse soil a significant variation occurred in the total quantity of leached and plant recovered nitrogen under different n application methods the fd and sdm methods proved to be efficient in retaining the maximum nitrate n in the feeding zone of cotton roots which eventually resulted in higher plant s uptake fig 4a besides these methods also showed some leaching of a minor fraction of total applied n while this loss under ctd was massive nearly 60 of the total applied n fig 4b these results are consistent with hu et al 2008 who reported the maximum 61 leaching of nitrate n from a conventionally irrigated maize field in sandy soil of the desert moreover zotarelli et al 2007 recorded 32 64 n leaching from vegetable fields fertilized by furrow fertigation method likewise sharma et al 2012 also calculated the highest 92 kg ha 1 leaching loss of applied n beyond rootzone of conventionally furrow irrigated cotton in sandy soil however this mighty loss under ctd would have been due to bulk flow of soil matrix through soil profile because of flood irrigation consistent with that lin et al 2001 and gabriel et al 2012 also reported that amount of irrigation water is a key factor that could be mainly responsible for leaching of nitrate n in the loose soils though the quantity of water applied by drip irrigation was not too much in fd method but its discharge from emitters continued for hours and meanwhile water would have traveled a significant vertical distance in the soil that could be quite enough to transport dissolved n towards the deeper soil layers the same might have happened in drip fertigation method of the present study which also depicted some leaching loss of the applied n as well fig 4b on the other hand n leaching observed under sdm technique could have been due to downward drift of residual unused nitrate n left in soil from previous urea treatment and drained with the subsequent flood irrigation consistent with that gabriel et al 2012 also reported similar pattern of the leaching of residual nitrogen from an irrigated fallow field contrarily the highest accumulation of n in cotton leaves under sdm and fd was the consequence of their enhanced nitrate n retention in the zone of the maximum feeding roots of cotton resulting in the higher uptake quite similar to these observations hu et al 2008 reported 190 kg ha 1 nitrogen uptake by maize under improved application techniques in the sandy soil of desert due to greater nitrate n accumulation around the feeding roots moreover it is also obvious from results that n recovery under fd was statistically similar with sdm which is consistent with stamatiadis et al 2016 who found that nitrogen fertigation with drip irrigation made more n available in rhizosphere that resulted in the highest uptake 192 261 kg ha 1 these illustrations highlight the significance of improved n application methods for better n management in well drained coarse soils to reduce its leaching losses and enhanced recovery in plants since the vegetative growth is a key function of nitrogen therefore higher dry matter accumulation and leaf area index of cotton under sdm and fd methods can be attributed to greater nitrogen uptake than ctd which is also evident in a correlation between n uptake and growth response fig 7a and b these findings are in accordance with chen et al 2010 who reported the direct impact of improved nitrogen uptake on above ground total dry matter tdm and other vegetative characteristics of cotton likewise luo et al 2015 also reported 20 6 and 25 5 higher tdm and leaf area of cotton under improved n fertilization methods respectively due to higher nitrogen recovery compared with conventional methods however better uptake under fd and sdm can be attributed to higher nitrate n retention in crop s rootzone under these techniques than that in ctd in accordance with that gadagi et al 2004 also found that field practices which ensure the maximum retention of nitrate n around feeding roots of plants necessarily result in better uptake and eventually the better dry biomass and leaf area development cotton yield is actually an outcome of the performance of its yield contributing factors including plant population bolls density and boll weight mccarty et al 2008 in the present investigation urea side drilling in mud resulted in significantly high number of bolls with higher boll weight than fd and ctd that eventually resulted in the maximum seed cotton and lint yields in the line of these results zhi et al 2016 also reported linear relationship between boll density and seed cotton yield but for boll weight their illustrations were contradictory however the increased boll density and boll weight under sdm can be attributed to enhanced n recovery that might have led to an increased carbon and nitrogen metabolism in leaves resulting in an increased rate of photosynthesis and more assimilates translocation to bolls these interpretations are consistent with hong biao et al 2008 who found a steady decline in c n ratio in cotton leaves with increasing boll age due to enhanced assimilates shift to growing bolls therefore in the long run this healthy development of cotton yield components under sdm and fd methods resulted in higher cotton yield these yield results of the present study are consistent with wanjura et al 2002 in addition zhang et al 2012 also found that improved nitrogen management in cotton resulted in approximately 33 higher lint production than the conventional practices the agronomic nue refers to an increase in lint yield kg ha 1 per unit of nitrogen applied novoa and loomis 1981 in sand soils anue increases with increasing nitrogen input while its losses in to the environment also increase linearly under conventional practices ye et al 2007 though the quantity of n applied to cotton in the present study was same under all application techniques but the highest anue and pnue under sdm and fd could be due to the maximum availability of n o 3 n in the top soil layers fig 3a d that led to a higher uptake than ctd fig 4a and b in accordance with the present results stamatiadis et al 2016 also concluded that nue of cotton is indeed the declaratory of its n recovery efficiency and it indicates a relationship between the both similarly du et al 2016 also reported similar results of pnue of cotton as recorded under sdm and fd methods of the present study on the other hand recovery nue exhibits the potential of a particular technique that how much can it facilitate the absorption of n by crop plants fang et al 2006 in the present study sdm facilitated higher n uptake followed by fd method by retaining the maximum nitrate n in feeding zone of cotton roots that resulted in the highest n recovery consistent with these results yang et al 2017 also reported the recovery efficiency of about 70 and 30 for the improved and conventional n fertilization practices respectively 5 conclusions the concentration of nitrate n in cotton root zone its leaching losses and uptake and the final yield and nitrogen use efficiencies in sandy soil of the taklamakan desert were significantly affected by nitrogen application methods urea sdm and fd methods resulted in greater nitrate n accumulation in top 0 60 cm soil layer while in ctd the highest accumulation was in 60 120 cm zone ctd technique resulted in almost 60 leaching of the total applied nitrogen while in contrast sdm and fd methods resulted in higher n recovery due to higher availability of nitrate n in the feeding zone 0 60 cm of cotton roots consequently the healthier crop growth the maximum seed cotton and lint yields and improved nitrogen use efficiencies anue pnue rnue were observed under sdm followed by fd method however in the light of these results urea side drilling in mud soon after the flood irrigation is recommended for conventionally flood irrigated sandy areas as it improves nitrogen recovery and use efficiency of cotton with the minimum leaching losses while fd could be the best alternative more specifically in water limited environments in addition considering the supremacy of sdm method further studies on n application rates under this technique are inevitable which may further help out in reducing its recommended rates in sandy soils and eventually the n fertilization cost acknowledgements
