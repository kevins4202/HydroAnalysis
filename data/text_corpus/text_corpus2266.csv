increased significantly in 100wf b and 80wf b p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of biochar addition in general there are three methods of p loss from soil to water leaching surface erosion and runoff sims et al 1998 here we concentrated on p leaching in a mollisol vegetable field soil has a strong ability of p retention it was once believed that p was unlikely to leach downward along the soil profile vertically or that leaching was not considerable russell 1957 however the continuous and excessive application of fertilizers caused p accumulation in the top layer which can cause p leaching with rainfall or irrigation sims et al 1998 under the same irrigation and fertilization level biochar addition significantly increased both tp and ap in the 0 20 cm layer p 0 05 biochar can act as a source of p thus increasing tp in surface soil gul et al 2015 in our study biochar addition significantly increased ap content in the 0 20 cm layer p 0 05 which was consistent with previous studies lehmann et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2011 however the effects of biochar addition on soil p availability are debated it has been reported that biochar addition may decrease p availability in soil due to the strong adsorption of biochar xu et al 2014 the discrimination was mainly caused by different soil types and various biochar types especially the raw material for biochar and the temperature used in production bornø et al 2018 ngatia et al 2017 hence more studies are needed to investigate the effects of biochar addition on p availability in mollisol vegetable fields in the present study biochar addition significantly reduced p leaching amounts p 0 05 biochar can directly or indirectly effect p leaching in soil due to its unique physical and chemical properties first biochar has a high absorption ability owing to its high porosity and large surface area which could adsorb soluble substances such as phosphate and dop in the soil thus enhancing p retention in soil and preventing p from moving downward in the soil profile benaddi et al 2000 second there are a large number of positive charges on the surface of biochar which can bind ions with negative charges in soil such as po4 3 hpo4 2 and h2po4 chintala et al 2014 thus reducing p leaching in our study p uptake amounts increased with biochar addition biochar addition can inhibit the combination of soluble p and other ions in soil improving the utilization rate of phosphate fertilizer and thus promoting the absorption of p by plants atkinson et al 2010 gundale and deluca 2007 hidetoshi et al 2009 it has been reported that disparate biochar application amounts can lead to disparate effects on yield including increases in yield no effect on yield and even reductions in yield backer et al 2016 hidetoshi et al 2009 peng et al 2011 in this study biochar addition increased yield by 5 49 when comparing 100wf b to ck this result could be due to the ability of biochar to increase nutrient availability and the physical and biochemical properties of soil chan et al 2007 li et al 2014 owing to its unique physical and chemical properties biochar can improve soil bulk density porosity water retention and hydraulic conductivity hence reducing et abel et al 2013 hidetoshi et al 2009 karhu et al 2011 laird et al 2014 under the same irrigation and fertilization conditions biochar increased yield but reduced et thus resulting in a higher wue in 100wf b 4 2 the effects of fertilization and irrigation reduction comparing 80wf b to 100wf b the effects of fertilization and irrigation reduction shows with the reduction of chemical fertilizers and irrigation water higher wue and lower p leaching amounts were achieved a previous study had suggested that the wue of eggplant increased under deficit irrigation kirnak et al 2002 as p and water are two main factors controlling p leaching sims et al 1998 the reduction of chemical fertilizers and water could directly lead to the decrease of p leaching amounts compared to 100wf b 80wf b had lower yield and p uptake amounts this result could be caused by the lower fertilization and irrigation which affected the growth of eggplant 4 3 the effects of biochar combined with fertilization and irrigation reduction comparing 80wf b to ck biochar combined with fertilization and irrigation reduction promoted p uptake increased wue and decreased p leaching without affecting yield as mentioned above both fertilization and irrigation reduction and biochar decreased p leaching biochar influences the physiological response of plants to drought such as enhancing leaf photosynthesis or increasing leaf stomatal conductance akhtar et al 2014 karhu et al 2011 meanwhile biochar enhances water retention and nutrient supply capacity bayabil et al 2015 jien et al 2017 which helps offset some disadvantages brought by reducing chemical fertilizers and irrigation amount these results provided 80wf b with the highest wue 5 conclusion biochar significantly increased tp and ap contents in the surface layer as well as p uptake amounts wue and yield and decreased p leaching when comparing 100wf b to ck fertilization and irrigation reduction decreased p leaching and significantly increased wue but yield was affected when comparing 80wf b to 100wf b biochar combined with fertilization and irrigation reduction significantly increased wue and decreased p leaching without affecting yield when comparing 80wf b to ck future studies are needed to explore the optimal amount and type of biochar as well as the optimization in irrigation and

b fig 1 to gain further understanding of p fractions in leachate tp was divided into drp pp and dop fig 2 fig s2 biochar addition increased the proportions of drp which were 22 32 higher in 100wf b and 9 higher in 80wf b when compared to that in ck pp concentrations ranged from 0 12 to 0 24 mg l and pp accounted for more than 50 of tp in all treatments biochar addition combined with reducing chemical fertilizers and irrigation significantly decreased pp concentrations in leachate but increased the proportions in tp dop concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 0 13 mg l and the proportions ranged from 4 84 to 28 33 both the highest dop concentration and the highest dop proportion were present in ck 3 2 p in the soil profile both tp and ap decreased with the increasing soil depth in all

increased significantly in 100wf b and 80wf b p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of biochar addition in general there are three methods of p loss from soil to water leaching surface erosion and runoff sims et al 1998 here we concentrated on p leaching in a mollisol vegetable field soil has a strong ability of p retention it was once believed that p was unlikely to leach downward along the soil profile vertically or that leaching was not considerable russell 1957 however the continuous and excessive application of fertilizers caused p accumulation in the top layer which can cause p leaching with rainfall or irrigation sims et al 1998 under the same irrigation and fertilization level biochar addition significantly increased both tp and ap in the 0 20 cm layer p 0 05 biochar can act as a source of p thus increasing tp in surface soil gul et al 2015 in our study biochar addition significantly increased ap content in the 0 20 cm layer p 0 05 which was consistent with previous studies lehmann et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2011 however the effects of biochar addition on soil p availability are debated it has been reported that biochar addition may decrease p availability in soil due to the strong adsorption of biochar xu et al 2014 the discrimination was mainly caused by different soil types and various biochar types especially the raw material for biochar and the temperature used in production bornø et al 2018 ngatia et al 2017 hence more studies are needed to investigate the effects of biochar addition on p availability in mollisol vegetable fields in the present study biochar addition significantly reduced p leaching amounts p 0 05 biochar can directly or indirectly effect p leaching in soil due to its unique physical and chemical properties first biochar has a high absorption ability owing to its high porosity and large surface area which could adsorb soluble substances such as phosphate and dop in the soil thus enhancing p retention in soil and preventing p from moving downward in the soil profile benaddi et al 2000 second there are a large number of positive charges on the surface of biochar which can bind ions with negative charges in soil such as po4 3 hpo4 2 and h2po4 chintala et al 2014 thus reducing p leaching in our study p uptake amounts increased with biochar addition biochar addition can inhibit the combination of soluble p and other ions in soil improving the utilization rate of phosphate fertilizer and thus promoting the absorption of p by plants atkinson et al 2010 gundale and deluca 2007 hidetoshi et al 2009 it has been reported that disparate biochar application amounts can lead to disparate effects on yield including increases in yield no effect on yield and even reductions in yield backer et al 2016 hidetoshi et al 2009 peng et al 2011 in this study biochar addition increased yield by 5 49 when comparing 100wf b to ck this result could be due to the ability of biochar to increase nutrient availability and the physical and biochemical properties of soil chan et al 2007 li et al 2014 owing to its unique physical and chemical properties biochar can improve soil bulk density porosity water retention and hydraulic conductivity hence reducing et abel et al 2013 hidetoshi et al 2009 karhu et al 2011 laird et al 2014 under the same irrigation and fertilization conditions biochar increased yield but reduced et thus resulting in a higher wue in 100wf b 4 2 the effects of fertilization and irrigation reduction comparing 80wf b to 100wf b the effects of fertilization and irrigation reduction shows with the reduction of chemical fertilizers and irrigation water higher wue and lower p leaching amounts were achieved a previous study had suggested that the wue of eggplant increased under deficit irrigation kirnak et al 2002 as p and water are two main factors controlling p leaching sims et al 1998 the reduction of chemical fertilizers and water could directly lead to the decrease of p leaching amounts compared to 100wf b 80wf b had lower yield and p uptake amounts this result could be caused by the lower fertilization and irrigation which affected the growth of eggplant 4 3 the effects of biochar combined with fertilization and irrigation reduction comparing 80wf b to ck biochar combined with fertilization and irrigation reduction promoted p uptake increased wue and decreased p leaching without affecting yield as mentioned above both fertilization and irrigation reduction and biochar decreased p leaching biochar influences the physiological response of plants to drought such as enhancing leaf photosynthesis or increasing leaf stomatal conductance akhtar et al 2014 karhu et al 2011 meanwhile biochar enhances water retention and nutrient supply capacity bayabil et al 2015 jien et al 2017 which helps offset some disadvantages brought by reducing chemical fertilizers and irrigation amount these results provided 80wf b with the highest wue 5 conclusion biochar significantly increased tp and ap contents in the surface layer as well as p uptake amounts wue and yield and decreased p leaching when comparing 100wf b to ck fertilization and irrigation reduction decreased p leaching and significantly increased wue but yield was affected when comparing 80wf b to 100wf b biochar combined with fertilization and irrigation reduction significantly increased wue and decreased p leaching without affecting yield when comparing 80wf b to ck future studies are needed to explore the optimal amount and type of biochar as well as the optimization in irrigation and

11331,deficit irrigation to winter wheat is gradually adopted in the north china plain ncp for conservation of groundwater resources n application to winter wheat should be decided based on the irrigation water availability under deficit irrigation yield of winter wheat was also related to the water use characters of its previous crops field studies were conducted from 2013 to 2016 at luancheng station in the ncp to evaluate the addition of soybean to the conventional annual double cropping system winter wheat summer maize and reducing n input on the performance of winter wheat under deficit irrigation summer maize was either replaced by soybean or inter planted with soybean the subsequent winter wheat was applied with six nitrogen rates 0 135 216 270 324 and 405 kg ha with one irrigation or two irrigation applications the results showed that the average seasonal water use of single soybean ss intercropping of maize and soybean ims and single maize sm was 359 1 mm 336 3 mm and 309 6 mm from 2013 to 2016 respectively the inclusion of soybean as single or inter planted crop increased the water use during the summer rainy season which was related to the increase in leaf area index as compared with the sm the soil water stored in the 2 m soil profile at the summer crops harvesting was reduced by 24 7 mm and 94 7 mm in 2014 15 9 mm and 95 6 mm in 2015 respectively for the ims and ss respectively due to the dependent of winter wheat on the stored soil water before sowing the reduction in pre season soil water content significantly decreased the yield by 1005 4 1878 0 kg ha yield of winter wheat didn t respond to the increase in n application when n rate was over 135 kg ha the local n application rate at 270 kg ha could be reduced up to 50 without apparent effects on crop productivity under deficit irrigation scheduling the results indicated that for diminishing the reduction in yield of winter wheat under limited water supply its previous crop with less water use in summer season should be selected yield of winter wheat could be maintained with half of its normal n application under limited water supply keywords deficit irrigation n application rate soil water depletion water use efficiency n use efficiency 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the most important grain production bases in china where the prevailing winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system produced about 60 of the wheat and 45 of the maize nationally national bureau of statistics 2015 high inputs in nitrogen and irrigation have played key roles in the high yielding of this double cropping system zhang et al 2017 however excessive nitrogen application and over irrigation have been endangering ecological environment which impeded the sustainable development of cereal production in ncp huang et al 2018 li et al 2017 rattan et al 2017 sánchez martín et al 2017 shibata et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 due to the exhausted groundwater resources and lowered aquifer deficit irrigation is now widely applied to winter wheat which grows during the dry season and depends greatly on the stored soil water before planting zhang et al 2013 due to the importance of winter wheat for the national food security it is important to maintain the production of winter wheat therefore the summer crop before winter wheat season could be changed to conserve soil water for winter wheat use nielsen et al 2011 the soil water status determines the nitrogen availability to crops crop responses to nitrogen fertilizer were generally reduced with the reduction in irrigation cosentino et al 2014 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 saeed et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to decide the n application based on the water availability to crops for improving the nitrogen use efficiency nue methods of improving nue included adopting the high n use efficiency cultivar choosing the right fertilizer type and the proper fertilization method and so on cui et al 2008 di gioia et al 2017 fox et al 2017 mcallister et al 2016 nelson et al 2014 rajala et al 2016 combining legume by intercropping or rotation in cereal production was taken as one of environment friendly methods amossé et al 2014 manevski et al 2015 oberson et al 2013 peoples et al 2017 plaza bonilla et al 2017 as the main protein and oil crop soybean is usually planted as mono crop or intercropped crop with others the addition of soybean into the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp may reduce the nitrogen fertilizer input another aspect is that due to the water shortage problems in the ncp winter wheat is now applied with deficit irrigation practices the addition of soybean might interfere with the annual water balance how the inclusion of soybean into the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and maize affecting the performance of its following crop winter wheat needs further elaborating deficit irrigation which was defined as the supplied water use below the crop s evapotranspiration et expósito and berbel 2017 gheysari et al 2017 munitz et al 2017 was widely applied to winter wheat in the ncp deng et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation scheduling has been developed to winter wheat that could decrease irrigation water use by around 40 and increase water use efficiency wue by 10 with small yield penalty sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 2008 under deficit irrigation the increase in the contribution of soil water depletion to the total et of wheat could diminish the yield reduction fang et al 2017 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 2013 therefore the distribution of the root system in the soil profile will affect the soil water availability to the crop dodd et al 2011 draye et al 2010 hodgkinson et al 2017 pinto and reynolds 2015 maximizing the rooting depth would improve the crop performance under water stress condition zhang et al 2004 selecting crops with aggressive root system as the previous crop can improve the yield of the following crop because that the bio drilling of the previous crop s root system can help the roots of the following crop to grow in deeper soil profile to extract more soil water and the deceased roots in the soil of former crop can supply channels and nutrients for the root growth of subsequent crop calonego and rosolem 2010 han et al 2016 perkons et al 2014 the water use of previous crop could also affect the soil water availability to its following crops after analyzing the six year water dynamics of the inclusion of fall winter cover crop into a maize soybean rotation in the argentine pampas restovich et al 2012 concluded that the yield of main crop would be affected by its previous cover crop in exceptionally dry seasons due to the soil water extraction nevertheless the effects on soil water equilibrium by preceding crops were not all adverse for the following crops which were related to the soil water consumption by the previous crops badaruddin and meyer 1989 anderson 2005 nielsen and vigil 2005 nitrogen and water usually have interactive effects on crop growth the increase in nitrogen concentration in leaf can improve the photosynthesis rate by accelerating the rubisco activity and electron transport activity at a low stomatal conductance of crop with a water scarcity field et al 1983 higher soil no3 content can regulate the aquaporin to improve the hydraulic conductivity of root system to relieve the water stress of crop aroca et al 2012 nitrogen can also stimulate the distribution of root along the deeper profile to extract more soil water for crop use pala et al 2007 shen et al 2013 the application of nitrogen fertilizer has the potential to improve crop production under water stress condition however the benefit of n application will change with the soil water conditions thus it is important to have the optimized n rate corresponding with the limited water supply condition for the purposes of improving both nue and wue therefore the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the changes in the water use by summer crops with introducing legume soybean to replace maize or intercropped with maize and their effects on the performances of the following winter wheat under deficit irrigation ii evaluate the effects of n application on the yield nue and wue of winter wheat under deficit irrigation iii optimize n application to winter wheat under deficit irrigation based on the yield response of winter wheat to different n rates as well as the economic output 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted from 2013 to 2016 three continuous annual rotation cycles of summer maize and winter wheat at luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences which is located in the northern part of the ncp at the base of mt taihang 37 53 n 114 41 e 50 m above sea level the soil at the station belongs to gleysol is a moderately well drained loamy soil with a deep profile that is considered highly suitable for grain production the average water holding capacity and the wilting point of 0 200 cm soil profile are 36 v v and 13 v v respectively and soil nutrient contents for the top 0 20 cm tillage soil layer were 2 1 g kg for organic matter 0 11 g kg for total n 92 mg kg for available n 21 mg kg for available p and 80 mg kg for available k the main cropping system for the region is the annual double crop rotation of winter wheat and summer maize rainfall mostly falls in the summer season the maize growing season with amount around 350 mm from middle of june to end of sep during winter wheat growing season from october to early june next year rainfall is around 120 mm far less than the water requirements of this crop around 450 mm irrigation is important for high yielding of this crop 2 2 experimental design the study was carried out using a factorial field experiment in a split plot randomized complete block design with four replicates a field with area of 15 m 180 m divided into three parts were used for the three planting patterns in summer season which were single maize sm single soybean ss intercropping of maize and soybean ims respectively after harvesting winter wheat maize and soybean were planted the varieties of maize soybean and wheat were zhendan958 lindou10 and shixin828 respectively the row spacing and the plant spacing of single maize were 60 cm 28 57 cm respectively and that of single soybean were 40 cm 16 cm respectively the summer maize in intercropping pattern was planted with wide row of 160 cm and narrow row of 40 cm and plant space of 19 35 cm 3 lines soybeans were inter cropped in the wide row of summer maize with a 40 cm row spacing and a 16 cm plant spacing a 40 cm space row was between plants of maize and soybean after planting maize and soybean were immediately irrigated with 80 mm water to ensure emergence due to the top 50 cm soil profile was very dry after harvesting of winter wheat the irrigation was conducted by connecting a plastic tube with the low pressure water transportation pipelines and a flow meter was connected with the outlet from the pipelines to record the water used for each plot a top application of 375 kg ha urea n content at 46 was broadcasted during the early growth period of summer crops with a rainfall event at the end of september the maize cobs and the soybean of above ground part were harvested manually the straw of maize were chopped and incorporated into the top soil layer the three blocks each with area of 15 m 60 m were used for the six nitrogen gradient treatments to winter wheat with zero n 0 n the normal n rate 100 n as the local practice 270 kg n ha increase of 20 120 n and 50 150 n over the normal rate and reduction of 20 80 n and 50 50 n over the normal rate the six n treatments were randomly arranged in the blocks in winter wheat season each treatment was replicated four times and each replication having area of 30 m2 5 m 6 m the detailed n applications of different treatments were described in table 1 once the plots were decided for different treatments they were treated the same during the three years without location changes before winter wheat sowing one half of the designed n application rate and 190 kg ha for p2o5 the zero n treatment using calcium superphosphate and other treatments using diammonium phosphate and 90 kg ha for k2o using potassium chloride were applied as the basal fertilizer to be incorporated into the soil with cultivation other n were applied as topdressing at jointing stage with the irrigation winter wheat sowing was occurred in the middle of october with a row spacing of 15 cm and a density of 300 seeds m2 the limited irrigation scheduling for winter wheat was decided based on the recommended regulated deficit irrigation regime for winter wheat in the ncp zhang et al 2013 which was to meet the water requirement of winter wheat by 80 to achieve stable yield and higher wue irrigation amount timing of irrigation and the rainfall during the three years were listed in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 weather data an automatic weather station about 100 m away from the experimental site provided the daily temperature humidity wind speed rainfall and radiation 2 3 2 leaf area index lai biomass yield and n contents in plants five plants of maize at grain fill stage and five plants of soybean at podding stage were randomly selected for each plot to determine the leaf area crop density was monitored to calculate the lai at harvesting five plants in each plot were selected randomly and cut at the base to be brought to the laboratory for measuring the seed numbers per ear seed weight and harvest index hi after dried grains and straw were measured for the n contents using the conventional analysis method kjedahl method all the plots were harvested manually and grain weight was recorded after air dried to a constant weight nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp was calculated by crop yield divided by nitrogen rate at harvesting winter wheat density was monitored by selecting four 0 6 m2 areas in each plot and 80 shoots were sampled to measure seed numbers per spike seed weight and hi plots were harvested manually and threshed by a stationary thresher to get the grains after air dried to a constant weight 13 water contents the yield was obtained by weighting the grains and straw were all measured for n contents 2 3 3 soil water content evapotranspiration et soil water depletion swd the soil volumetric water contents were monitored every 7 10 days at a depth interval of 20 cm down to 2 m using the neutron meter 503 dr cpn international inc usa with access tubes installed in the center of the plots corresponding to the following subplots of winter wheat with treatments of 0 n 50 n 100 n and 150 n respectively the seasonal et was calculated by the following formula 1 et p i swd r d cr where et p i swd r d and cr were the abbreviations of evapotranspiration precipitation irrigation soil water depletion runoff drainage capillary rise in a crop season mm runoff was not observed cr was zero due to the groundwater table was below 40 m d from the 2 m soil profile was taken as zero due to the limited irrigation therefore et p i swd swd was calculated from the water storage at sowing minus the water storage at harvesting for the top 2 m soil profile wue was calculated by yield divided by et 2 3 4 root sampling root sampling was conducted in 2014 2015 season using soil auger of 10 cm in diameter at 10 cm increments down to 1 2 m for single maize and single soybean 2 0 m for winter wheat according to the method of böhm 1979 the sampling places of soybean and winter wheat were on the row and between the rows respectively and that of maize were on the plant 15 cm and 30 cm away from the plant the two soil cores of soybean and winter wheat three soil cores of maize were mixed as one replicate four replicates were all taken in the plots with the normal n application rate to winter wheat all the soil cores were taken to laboratory to be washed to get the roots the roots were separated manually from other organic debris root length was determined by the line intersect method tennant 1975 after root length measuring all the samples were oven dried at 80 c to determine root dry weight 2 3 5 changes in soil nutrient contents soil organic matter and total n contents for different treatments were monitored at the beginning of the experiment and at each harvesting of the crops for the three years for each measurement soil samples for 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers from five sites for each plot were mixed together and brought back to the laboratory for analyzing after air dried the mixed soil sample was ground manually and passed through a 2 mm sieve for analysis of the soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen using chromic acid titration and kjedahl methods respectively 2 3 6 calculation of net income the net income for each planting system was calculated based on the difference between output and input the output was the total value of the grains produced by each system using the local market price the input included the cost in fertilizers cultivation irrigation seeds and harvesting the other labor input for managing the crops was not included 2 4 statistical analysis the mean of each treatment were compared by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 a two way analysis of variance anova was performed using the general linear model procedure to assess the effects of the previous crop and n supply on the related parameters for wheat under deficit irrigation the data were analyzed using the sas statistical package and excel software 3 results 3 1 growing conditions the average temperatures of summer seasons in 2013 2014 and 2015 were 24 9 24 3 and 24 5 c respectively the average temperatures of winter wheat seasons in 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were 8 85 8 89 and 8 67 c the temperature conditions for the three years were similar large variations in seasonal rainfall existed table 2 shows the summer rainfall in the three seasons was 385 1 199 0 and 329 8 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively with 2014 season being a very dry summer the rainfall during winter wheat growing season was 43 6 mm in 2013 2014 70 8 mm in 2014 2015 and 104 2 mm in 2015 2016 with 2013 2014 being a very dry season the difference in seasonal rainfall affected the soil water conditions for the crops fig 1 shows the rainfall irrigation and average soil water contents during the three seasons soil water was generally in an increase trend during the summer and a declining trend during the winter wheat growing season especially during the late growth period of winter wheat soil water contents were in a rapid declining trend for the top middle and deep soil layers the rapid decrease in soil water for the deep soil layer indicated that winter wheat could efficiently uptake the stored soil water in the deep soil under limited water supply 3 2 root distribution of different crops fig 2 shows the distribution of root length density for maize soybean and winter wheat under normal n application rate soybean had smaller root length density than that of maize winter wheat had a relative deep and prolific root system the results indicated that the summer crops such as maize and soybean would uptake more soil water in the top soil layers while winter wheat had the capacity to utilize the soil water stored in the deep soil layers the relative abundant summer rainfall fig 1 provided opportunity for the good growth of the shallow root crops summer rainfall would also replenish soil water for the use of winter wheat which grows during the dry season therefore the crop water use and rainfall condition during the summer season would significantly affect the soil water availability to winter wheat and subsequently affected its production 3 3 crop water use and yield during the summer season the yields of the three cropping systems for the three seasons were listed in table 3 the results indicated that there was large seasonal yield variation for maize while the yield of soybean was less affected by the weather fluctuations the higher yield for maize in 2014 was related to the longer sunshine duration during that season and in contrast the lower yield in 2015 was related to the reduced radiation table 3 showed that the intercropping of maize with soybean reduced the production of both crops compared with the single cropping system yield of the intercropped maize was reduced by 34 and soybean was reduced by 44 averagely for the three seasons the reduction for soybean was greater than that for maize due to the shade effects of maize on soybean when planting the two crops together fig 3 indicates that ss had the highest lai than that of sm and ims the lai of ims was greater than that of sm ben asher et al 2006 pointed out that crop water use is proportional to lai under certain conditions so a higher lai could resulted in a higher water use fig 4 shows the seasonal et of the three planting patterns the lower et in 2014 was related to the lower seasonal rainfall in that season during the three growing seasons et of the ss was always the highest one while the sm was the lowest one among the three planting patterns the average et for sm ims and ss was 309 6 mm 336 3 mm and 359 1 mm respectively which showed that the different planting patterns had different seasonal et due to their different lai there were significant differences p 0 01 among the three planting patterns in their maximum lai corresponding to the lai the ss had the highest et while the sm had the smallest one the more used rainfall the less the rainfall to replenish the dried soil layers in the deep soil profile the discrepancies in the et and root distribution of the three planting patterns caused the different soil water distribution along the 2 m soil profile at harvesting fig 5 in 2013 the differences in the soil water contents for the 0 200 cm soil profile among the treatments were small as a result of the higher summer rainfall which replenished the soil moisture the soil water contents in 0 200 cm profile at harvesting for the ss in 2014 and 2015 were becoming lower than that of the sm especially below 120 cm soil layer indicating the higher water use by soybean therefore less summer rainfall was left to replenish the dry soil after winter wheat season the water stored in the top 2 m soil profile at sowing winter wheat was different among the three planting patterns with sm being the highest and ss the lowest fig 6 the difference was gradually becoming larger with the growth duration of different crops 3 4 crop water use and yield for winter wheat due to the deeper and large root system of winter wheat soil water use by winter wheat could reach 2 m soil depth under limited water supply swd contributed around 50 of the seasonal et therefore the different soil water storage related to the different soil water use before winter wheat season significantly affected the swd seasonal et and crop production table 4 the reduced soil water contents before sowing winter wheat significantly reduced the production of winter wheat fig 5 table 4 fig 7 with the increase in the growing duration of soybean the yield reduction of winter wheat was increased wue was also reduced table 4 the results indicated that the performance of winter wheat was significantly related to the soil water availability at sowing under limited water supply condition 3 5 nitrogen application on winter wheat under limited water supply fig 8 shows the yield of winter wheat under the six nitrogen application rate following different crops no significant effect on yield was observed among different treatments for the first season of the experiment from the second season significant yield decrease under 0 n occurred for winter wheat following sm ss and ims yield of winter wheat was not affected when n application rate being greater than 50 n indicating that nitrogen application could be reduced by 50 without significantly affecting the production of winter wheat under limited water supply fig 8 also indicates that the responses of winter wheat to n application followed the similar pattern with the three previous cropping systems the inclusion of soybean into the summer crops didn t affect the responses of winter wheat to n application no significant effect on wue was found among the six nitrogen application rate to winter wheat for the first two seasons there was significant decrease in wue for the treatment without n application as compared with other treatments fig 9 nitrogen deficiency reduced both yield and wue for winter wheat however more n than necessary would not positively improve the performance of the crop in terms of productivity and wue fig 9 also indicates that there was difference in wue among the seasons which was related to the growth conditions of the crop 3 6 annual nitrogen of input and uptake under normal n application rate for winter wheat annual n uptake was smaller than the n input and positive n deposit in the soils might exist table 5 the surplus in n for maize and winter wheat cropping system was greater than that the introducing the soybean crop due to the high n uptake in soybean grains table 5 fig 10 indicates that the reduction in n application to winter wheat didn t affect the soil organic matter contents and the total n contents for the soil layer of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm the normal n application for the summer season could maintain n balance for winter wheat for the top 20 cm soil layer and the reduction in n application during winter wheat season slightly reduced the n contents in the 20 40 cm layer fig 11 shows npfp for winter wheat under different treatments npfp was reduced with the increase in n application and the reduction in 50 n application maintained the highest npfp with the introducing of soybean either as single crop or as intercropping crop npfp was decreased as compared with single maize for subsequent winter wheat under the five n application rates the results indicated that the addition of soybean was not beneficial for increasing nue for winter wheat possibly related to the reduced yield of winter wheat following soybean 3 7 annual net income the average net income labor input was excluded for the three summer seasons was 8612 yuan ha under ims 8038 yuan ha under ss and 8005 yuan ha under sm 1 usd 6 6 yuan rmb the income for the ims was slightly greater than that of the sm or the ss there was no apparent difference in net income between the two single cropping systems in summer season the average net income for the three winter wheat seasons was 8009 5 8701 1 8553 0 8220 4 7954 2 and 7596 9 yuan ha under 0 50 80 100 120 and 150 n application treatments respectively the results indicated that 50 n application produced the highest net income for winter wheat season annual average net income was 17 906 16 921 and 15 932 yuan ha under winter wheat summer maize winter wheat intercropping maize and soybean and winter wheat soybean systems respectively with winter wheat being fertilized with half of the normal n application rate the results indicated the traditional maize and winter wheat cropping system has the advantage in producing the higher economic returns in this region reducing the normal n application rate by half to winter wheat would improve the economic returns 4 discussions the rapid declining in groundwater level in the ncp has threatened the sustainable irrigation agricultural development the irrigation management or the cultivation practices should be changed to reduce the irrigation water use for groundwater conservation zhang et al 2003 but due to the importance of ncp in supplying the national grain production in china reducing the planting area especially winter wheat may not be feasible besides the widely used double cropping system of winter wheat and maize is suitable for ncp due to maize can use the rainfall in the summer season and the subsequent winter wheat can use the water stored in the soil profile depending on its large and deep root system fig 2 previous results in ncp indicated that applying one or two irrigations to winter wheat could maintain a stable yield of this crop with irrigation application being reduced by half of its normal amount zhang et al 2008 2013 water stored in soil before sowing winter wheat plays a key role in maintaining the production of winter wheat under limited water supply condition therefore water use of the previous crop before winter wheat season would affect the performance of winter wheat under limited water supply reducing water consumption of previous crop to increase the water storage in the root zone soil profile and improving root growth in deeper soil profile are two effective methods to improve the grain yield and wue of winter wheat under deficit irrigation planting different pre crops would have diverse effects on the yield of the following crop in dryland based on the residual water left in the root zone soil profile latta and o leary 2003 nielsen et al 2011 pala et al 2007 restovich et al 2012 the results of this study showed that when soybean replaced the summer maize the water storage in soil profile before sowing wheat decreased apparently with the increase in the planting duration due to the greater water use by soybean figs 4 and 6 so the ss as the previous crop of winter wheat would reduce the residual water in soil as compared with the single maize the larger lai of soybean resulted in the higher et and reduced the rainfall in wet season to replenish the depleted soil water kang et al 2003 liu et al 2002 another aspect for the grain production in the ncp was the high n input cui et al 2014 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 therefore under limited water supply to winter wheat the n application should be decided based on the water availability to the crop the results from this study showed that reducing n input by 50 during the winter wheat season would not affect the yield of winter wheat under deficit irrigation the normal n application to the summer season crop and the reduced n input to winter wheat could maintain crop productivity generally the inclusion of legume into the cereal cropping system could reduce the chemical nitrogen inputs due to the n2 fixation from atmosphere by root nodule bacteria of the legume crops to increase the soil nitrogen contents to reduce n input amossé et al 2014 park et al 2010 but for growing legume crops with grain harvesting the high n contents in grains also implied that legume crops might need more n than other cereal crops table 5 therefore the introducing legume may not necessary reduce the n input depending on the purposes of legume growing net income will also be an important factor to consider the feasibility of a cropping system comparing the cropping systems in summer season inter cropping maize with soybean produced the highest income among the three systems sm and ss had the similar income if their after effects on the following crop were considered the traditional double cropping of winter wheat and summer maize produced the highest annual net income due to winter wheat yield being the highest following maize the yield reduction in winter wheat related to the introducing soybean for summer season crop reduced the annual output therefore for better annual income and higher yield of winter wheat the traditional double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize should be maintained in the ncp 5 conclusions for the conventional annual double cropping system of winter wheat and maize in the ncp maintaining the productivity of winter wheat under deficit irrigation is important for the national food security the water use of the previous crop has a critical effect on the soil water availability to winter wheat which played an important role in maintaining the yield of this crop under deficit irrigation scheduling introducing new crops to replace maize must consider the water use characters of the crops the introducing of soybean as single crop increased the et during summer season which negatively affected the yield of winter wheat the annual net income was the lowest for soybean and wheat rotation however the intercropping of maize and soybean in summer season was beneficial to increase the economic returns in summer the conventional winter wheat and maize system produced higher yield of winter wheat and also maintained good economic returns the maintaining of this system has its advantage in the ncp reducing n input by half amount to winter wheat not only increased the npfp but also improved the net outcome of winter wheat season by reducing the input cost acknowledgement this research was supportedby national s t special fund for agricultural research 2017yfd0300904 and 2016yfd0300401 2 
11331,deficit irrigation to winter wheat is gradually adopted in the north china plain ncp for conservation of groundwater resources n application to winter wheat should be decided based on the irrigation water availability under deficit irrigation yield of winter wheat was also related to the water use characters of its previous crops field studies were conducted from 2013 to 2016 at luancheng station in the ncp to evaluate the addition of soybean to the conventional annual double cropping system winter wheat summer maize and reducing n input on the performance of winter wheat under deficit irrigation summer maize was either replaced by soybean or inter planted with soybean the subsequent winter wheat was applied with six nitrogen rates 0 135 216 270 324 and 405 kg ha with one irrigation or two irrigation applications the results showed that the average seasonal water use of single soybean ss intercropping of maize and soybean ims and single maize sm was 359 1 mm 336 3 mm and 309 6 mm from 2013 to 2016 respectively the inclusion of soybean as single or inter planted crop increased the water use during the summer rainy season which was related to the increase in leaf area index as compared with the sm the soil water stored in the 2 m soil profile at the summer crops harvesting was reduced by 24 7 mm and 94 7 mm in 2014 15 9 mm and 95 6 mm in 2015 respectively for the ims and ss respectively due to the dependent of winter wheat on the stored soil water before sowing the reduction in pre season soil water content significantly decreased the yield by 1005 4 1878 0 kg ha yield of winter wheat didn t respond to the increase in n application when n rate was over 135 kg ha the local n application rate at 270 kg ha could be reduced up to 50 without apparent effects on crop productivity under deficit irrigation scheduling the results indicated that for diminishing the reduction in yield of winter wheat under limited water supply its previous crop with less water use in summer season should be selected yield of winter wheat could be maintained with half of its normal n application under limited water supply keywords deficit irrigation n application rate soil water depletion water use efficiency n use efficiency 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the most important grain production bases in china where the prevailing winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system produced about 60 of the wheat and 45 of the maize nationally national bureau of statistics 2015 high inputs in nitrogen and irrigation have played key roles in the high yielding of this double cropping system zhang et al 2017 however excessive nitrogen application and over irrigation have been endangering ecological environment which impeded the sustainable development of cereal production in ncp huang et al 2018 li et al 2017 rattan et al 2017 sánchez martín et al 2017 shibata et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 due to the exhausted groundwater resources and lowered aquifer deficit irrigation is now widely applied to winter wheat which grows during the dry season and depends greatly on the stored soil water before planting zhang et al 2013 due to the importance of winter wheat for the national food security it is important to maintain the production of winter wheat therefore the summer crop before winter wheat season could be changed to conserve soil water for winter wheat use nielsen et al 2011 the soil water status determines the nitrogen availability to crops crop responses to nitrogen fertilizer were generally reduced with the reduction in irrigation cosentino et al 2014 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 saeed et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to decide the n application based on the water availability to crops for improving the nitrogen use efficiency nue methods of improving nue included adopting the high n use efficiency cultivar choosing the right fertilizer type and the proper fertilization method and so on cui et al 2008 di gioia et al 2017 fox et al 2017 mcallister et al 2016 nelson et al 2014 rajala et al 2016 combining legume by intercropping or rotation in cereal production was taken as one of environment friendly methods amossé et al 2014 manevski et al 2015 oberson et al 2013 peoples et al 2017 plaza bonilla et al 2017 as the main protein and oil crop soybean is usually planted as mono crop or intercropped crop with others the addition of soybean into the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp may reduce the nitrogen fertilizer input another aspect is that due to the water shortage problems in the ncp winter wheat is now applied with deficit irrigation practices the addition of soybean might interfere with the annual water balance how the inclusion of soybean into the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and maize affecting the performance of its following crop winter wheat needs further elaborating deficit irrigation which was defined as the supplied water use below the crop s evapotranspiration et expósito and berbel 2017 gheysari et al 2017 munitz et al 2017 was widely applied to winter wheat in the ncp deng et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 deficit irrigation scheduling has been developed to winter wheat that could decrease irrigation water use by around 40 and increase water use efficiency wue by 10 with small yield penalty sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 2008 under deficit irrigation the increase in the contribution of soil water depletion to the total et of wheat could diminish the yield reduction fang et al 2017 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2006 2013 therefore the distribution of the root system in the soil profile will affect the soil water availability to the crop dodd et al 2011 draye et al 2010 hodgkinson et al 2017 pinto and reynolds 2015 maximizing the rooting depth would improve the crop performance under water stress condition zhang et al 2004 selecting crops with aggressive root system as the previous crop can improve the yield of the following crop because that the bio drilling of the previous crop s root system can help the roots of the following crop to grow in deeper soil profile to extract more soil water and the deceased roots in the soil of former crop can supply channels and nutrients for the root growth of subsequent crop calonego and rosolem 2010 han et al 2016 perkons et al 2014 the water use of previous crop could also affect the soil water availability to its following crops after analyzing the six year water dynamics of the inclusion of fall winter cover crop into a maize soybean rotation in the argentine pampas restovich et al 2012 concluded that the yield of main crop would be affected by its previous cover crop in exceptionally dry seasons due to the soil water extraction nevertheless the effects on soil water equilibrium by preceding crops were not all adverse for the following crops which were related to the soil water consumption by the previous crops badaruddin and meyer 1989 anderson 2005 nielsen and vigil 2005 nitrogen and water usually have interactive effects on crop growth the increase in nitrogen concentration in leaf can improve the photosynthesis rate by accelerating the rubisco activity and electron transport activity at a low stomatal conductance of crop with a water scarcity field et al 1983 higher soil no3 content can regulate the aquaporin to improve the hydraulic conductivity of root system to relieve the water stress of crop aroca et al 2012 nitrogen can also stimulate the distribution of root along the deeper profile to extract more soil water for crop use pala et al 2007 shen et al 2013 the application of nitrogen fertilizer has the potential to improve crop production under water stress condition however the benefit of n application will change with the soil water conditions thus it is important to have the optimized n rate corresponding with the limited water supply condition for the purposes of improving both nue and wue therefore the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the changes in the water use by summer crops with introducing legume soybean to replace maize or intercropped with maize and their effects on the performances of the following winter wheat under deficit irrigation ii evaluate the effects of n application on the yield nue and wue of winter wheat under deficit irrigation iii optimize n application to winter wheat under deficit irrigation based on the yield response of winter wheat to different n rates as well as the economic output 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted from 2013 to 2016 three continuous annual rotation cycles of summer maize and winter wheat at luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences which is located in the northern part of the ncp at the base of mt taihang 37 53 n 114 41 e 50 m above sea level the soil at the station belongs to gleysol is a moderately well drained loamy soil with a deep profile that is considered highly suitable for grain production the average water holding capacity and the wilting point of 0 200 cm soil profile are 36 v v and 13 v v respectively and soil nutrient contents for the top 0 20 cm tillage soil layer were 2 1 g kg for organic matter 0 11 g kg for total n 92 mg kg for available n 21 mg kg for available p and 80 mg kg for available k the main cropping system for the region is the annual double crop rotation of winter wheat and summer maize rainfall mostly falls in the summer season the maize growing season with amount around 350 mm from middle of june to end of sep during winter wheat growing season from october to early june next year rainfall is around 120 mm far less than the water requirements of this crop around 450 mm irrigation is important for high yielding of this crop 2 2 experimental design the study was carried out using a factorial field experiment in a split plot randomized complete block design with four replicates a field with area of 15 m 180 m divided into three parts were used for the three planting patterns in summer season which were single maize sm single soybean ss intercropping of maize and soybean ims respectively after harvesting winter wheat maize and soybean were planted the varieties of maize soybean and wheat were zhendan958 lindou10 and shixin828 respectively the row spacing and the plant spacing of single maize were 60 cm 28 57 cm respectively and that of single soybean were 40 cm 16 cm respectively the summer maize in intercropping pattern was planted with wide row of 160 cm and narrow row of 40 cm and plant space of 19 35 cm 3 lines soybeans were inter cropped in the wide row of summer maize with a 40 cm row spacing and a 16 cm plant spacing a 40 cm space row was between plants of maize and soybean after planting maize and soybean were immediately irrigated with 80 mm water to ensure emergence due to the top 50 cm soil profile was very dry after harvesting of winter wheat the irrigation was conducted by connecting a plastic tube with the low pressure water transportation pipelines and a flow meter was connected with the outlet from the pipelines to record the water used for each plot a top application of 375 kg ha urea n content at 46 was broadcasted during the early growth period of summer crops with a rainfall event at the end of september the maize cobs and the soybean of above ground part were harvested manually the straw of maize were chopped and incorporated into the top soil layer the three blocks each with area of 15 m 60 m were used for the six nitrogen gradient treatments to winter wheat with zero n 0 n the normal n rate 100 n as the local practice 270 kg n ha increase of 20 120 n and 50 150 n over the normal rate and reduction of 20 80 n and 50 50 n over the normal rate the six n treatments were randomly arranged in the blocks in winter wheat season each treatment was replicated four times and each replication having area of 30 m2 5 m 6 m the detailed n applications of different treatments were described in table 1 once the plots were decided for different treatments they were treated the same during the three years without location changes before winter wheat sowing one half of the designed n application rate and 190 kg ha for p2o5 the zero n treatment using calcium superphosphate and other treatments using diammonium phosphate and 90 kg ha for k2o using potassium chloride were applied as the basal fertilizer to be incorporated into the soil with cultivation other n were applied as topdressing at jointing stage with the irrigation winter wheat sowing was occurred in the middle of october with a row spacing of 15 cm and a density of 300 seeds m2 the limited irrigation scheduling for winter wheat was decided based on the recommended regulated deficit irrigation regime for winter wheat in the ncp zhang et al 2013 which was to meet the water requirement of winter wheat by 80 to achieve stable yield and higher wue irrigation amount timing of irrigation and the rainfall during the three years were listed in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 weather data an automatic weather station about 100 m away from the experimental site provided the daily temperature humidity wind speed rainfall and radiation 2 3 2 leaf area index lai biomass yield and n contents in plants five plants of maize at grain fill stage and five plants of soybean at podding stage were randomly selected for each plot to determine the leaf area crop density was monitored to calculate the lai at harvesting five plants in each plot were selected randomly and cut at the base to be brought to the laboratory for measuring the seed numbers per ear seed weight and harvest index hi after dried grains and straw were measured for the n contents using the conventional analysis method kjedahl method all the plots were harvested manually and grain weight was recorded after air dried to a constant weight nitrogen partial factor productivity npfp was calculated by crop yield divided by nitrogen rate at harvesting winter wheat density was monitored by selecting four 0 6 m2 areas in each plot and 80 shoots were sampled to measure seed numbers per spike seed weight and hi plots were harvested manually and threshed by a stationary thresher to get the grains after air dried to a constant weight 13 water contents the yield was obtained by weighting the grains and straw were all measured for n contents 2 3 3 soil water content evapotranspiration et soil water depletion swd the soil volumetric water contents were monitored every 7 10 days at a depth interval of 20 cm down to 2 m using the neutron meter 503 dr cpn international inc usa with access tubes installed in the center of the plots corresponding to the following subplots of winter wheat with treatments of 0 n 50 n 100 n and 150 n respectively the seasonal et was calculated by the following formula 1 et p i swd r d cr where et p i swd r d and cr were the abbreviations of evapotranspiration precipitation irrigation soil water depletion runoff drainage capillary rise in a crop season mm runoff was not observed cr was zero due to the groundwater table was below 40 m d from the 2 m soil profile was taken as zero due to the limited irrigation therefore et p i swd swd was calculated from the water storage at sowing minus the water storage at harvesting for the top 2 m soil profile wue was calculated by yield divided by et 2 3 4 root sampling root sampling was conducted in 2014 2015 season using soil auger of 10 cm in diameter at 10 cm increments down to 1 2 m for single maize and single soybean 2 0 m for winter wheat according to the method of böhm 1979 the sampling places of soybean and winter wheat were on the row and between the rows respectively and that of maize were on the plant 15 cm and 30 cm away from the plant the two soil cores of soybean and winter wheat three soil cores of maize were mixed as one replicate four replicates were all taken in the plots with the normal n application rate to winter wheat all the soil cores were taken to laboratory to be washed to get the roots the roots were separated manually from other organic debris root length was determined by the line intersect method tennant 1975 after root length measuring all the samples were oven dried at 80 c to determine root dry weight 2 3 5 changes in soil nutrient contents soil organic matter and total n contents for different treatments were monitored at the beginning of the experiment and at each harvesting of the crops for the three years for each measurement soil samples for 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers from five sites for each plot were mixed together and brought back to the laboratory for analyzing after air dried the mixed soil sample was ground manually and passed through a 2 mm sieve for analysis of the soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen using chromic acid titration and kjedahl methods respectively 2 3 6 calculation of net income the net income for each planting system was calculated based on the difference between output and input the output was the total value of the grains produced by each system using the local market price the input included the cost in fertilizers cultivation irrigation seeds and harvesting the other labor input for managing the crops was not included 2 4 statistical analysis the mean of each treatment were compared by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 a two way analysis of variance anova was performed using the general linear model procedure to assess the effects of the previous crop and n supply on the related parameters for wheat under deficit irrigation the data were analyzed using the sas statistical package and excel software 3 results 3 1 growing conditions the average temperatures of summer seasons in 2013 2014 and 2015 were 24 9 24 3 and 24 5 c respectively the average temperatures of winter wheat seasons in 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were 8 85 8 89 and 8 67 c the temperature conditions for the three years were similar large variations in seasonal rainfall existed table 2 shows the summer rainfall in the three seasons was 385 1 199 0 and 329 8 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively with 2014 season being a very dry summer the rainfall during winter wheat growing season was 43 6 mm in 2013 2014 70 8 mm in 2014 2015 and 104 2 mm in 2015 2016 with 2013 2014 being a very dry season the difference in seasonal rainfall affected the soil water conditions for the crops fig 1 shows the rainfall irrigation and average soil water contents during the three seasons soil water was generally in an increase trend during the summer and a declining trend during the winter wheat growing season especially during the late growth period of winter wheat soil water contents were in a rapid declining trend for the top middle and deep soil layers the rapid decrease in soil water for the deep soil layer indicated that winter wheat could efficiently uptake the stored soil water in the deep soil under limited water supply 3 2 root distribution of different crops fig 2 shows the distribution of root length density for maize soybean and winter wheat under normal n application rate soybean had smaller root length density than that of maize winter wheat had a relative deep and prolific root system the results indicated that the summer crops such as maize and soybean would uptake more soil water in the top soil layers while winter wheat had the capacity to utilize the soil water stored in the deep soil layers the relative abundant summer rainfall fig 1 provided opportunity for the good growth of the shallow root crops summer rainfall would also replenish soil water for the use of winter wheat which grows during the dry season therefore the crop water use and rainfall condition during the summer season would significantly affect the soil water availability to winter wheat and subsequently affected its production 3 3 crop water use and yield during the summer season the yields of the three cropping systems for the three seasons were listed in table 3 the results indicated that there was large seasonal yield variation for maize while the yield of soybean was less affected by the weather fluctuations the higher yield for maize in 2014 was related to the longer sunshine duration during that season and in contrast the lower yield in 2015 was related to the reduced radiation table 3 showed that the intercropping of maize with soybean reduced the production of both crops compared with the single cropping system yield of the intercropped maize was reduced by 34 and soybean was reduced by 44 averagely for the three seasons the reduction for soybean was greater than that for maize due to the shade effects of maize on soybean when planting the two crops together fig 3 indicates that ss had the highest lai than that of sm and ims the lai of ims was greater than that of sm ben asher et al 2006 pointed out that crop water use is proportional to lai under certain conditions so a higher lai could resulted in a higher water use fig 4 shows the seasonal et of the three planting patterns the lower et in 2014 was related to the lower seasonal rainfall in that season during the three growing seasons et of the ss was always the highest one while the sm was the lowest one among the three planting patterns the average et for sm ims and ss was 309 6 mm 336 3 mm and 359 1 mm respectively which showed that the different planting patterns had different seasonal et due to their different lai there were significant differences p 0 01 among the three planting patterns in their maximum lai corresponding to the lai the ss had the highest et while the sm had the smallest one the more used rainfall the less the rainfall to replenish the dried soil layers in the deep soil profile the discrepancies in the et and root distribution of the three planting patterns caused the different soil water distribution along the 2 m soil profile at harvesting fig 5 in 2013 the differences in the soil water contents for the 0 200 cm soil profile among the treatments were small as a result of the higher summer rainfall which replenished the soil moisture the soil water contents in 0 200 cm profile at harvesting for the ss in 2014 and 2015 were becoming lower than that of the sm especially below 120 cm soil layer indicating the higher water use by soybean therefore less summer rainfall was left to replenish the dry soil after winter wheat season the water stored in the top 2 m soil profile at sowing winter wheat was different among the three planting patterns with sm being the highest and ss the lowest fig 6 the difference was gradually becoming larger with the growth duration of different crops 3 4 crop water use and yield for winter wheat due to the deeper and large root system of winter wheat soil water use by winter wheat could reach 2 m soil depth under limited water supply swd contributed around 50 of the seasonal et therefore the different soil water storage related to the different soil water use before winter wheat season significantly affected the swd seasonal et and crop production table 4 the reduced soil water contents before sowing winter wheat significantly reduced the production of winter wheat fig 5 table 4 fig 7 with the increase in the growing duration of soybean the yield reduction of winter wheat was increased wue was also reduced table 4 the results indicated that the performance of winter wheat was significantly related to the soil water availability at sowing under limited water supply condition 3 5 nitrogen application on winter wheat under limited water supply fig 8 shows the yield of winter wheat under the six nitrogen application rate following different crops no significant effect on yield was observed among different treatments for the first season of the experiment from the second season significant yield decrease under 0 n occurred for winter wheat following sm ss and ims yield of winter wheat was not affected when n application rate being greater than 50 n indicating that nitrogen application could be reduced by 50 without significantly affecting the production of winter wheat under limited water supply fig 8 also indicates that the responses of winter wheat to n application followed the similar pattern with the three previous cropping systems the inclusion of soybean into the summer crops didn t affect the responses of winter wheat to n application no significant effect on wue was found among the six nitrogen application rate to winter wheat for the first two seasons there was significant decrease in wue for the treatment without n application as compared with other treatments fig 9 nitrogen deficiency reduced both yield and wue for winter wheat however more n than necessary would not positively improve the performance of the crop in terms of productivity and wue fig 9 also indicates that there was difference in wue among the seasons which was related to the growth conditions of the crop 3 6 annual nitrogen of input and uptake under normal n application rate for winter wheat annual n uptake was smaller than the n input and positive n deposit in the soils might exist table 5 the surplus in n for maize and winter wheat cropping system was greater than that the introducing the soybean crop due to the high n uptake in soybean grains table 5 fig 10 indicates that the reduction in n application to winter wheat didn t affect the soil organic matter contents and the total n contents for the soil layer of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm the normal n application for the summer season could maintain n balance for winter wheat for the top 20 cm soil layer and the reduction in n application during winter wheat season slightly reduced the n contents in the 20 40 cm layer fig 11 shows npfp for winter wheat under different treatments npfp was reduced with the increase in n application and the reduction in 50 n application maintained the highest npfp with the introducing of soybean either as single crop or as intercropping crop npfp was decreased as compared with single maize for subsequent winter wheat under the five n application rates the results indicated that the addition of soybean was not beneficial for increasing nue for winter wheat possibly related to the reduced yield of winter wheat following soybean 3 7 annual net income the average net income labor input was excluded for the three summer seasons was 8612 yuan ha under ims 8038 yuan ha under ss and 8005 yuan ha under sm 1 usd 6 6 yuan rmb the income for the ims was slightly greater than that of the sm or the ss there was no apparent difference in net income between the two single cropping systems in summer season the average net income for the three winter wheat seasons was 8009 5 8701 1 8553 0 8220 4 7954 2 and 7596 9 yuan ha under 0 50 80 100 120 and 150 n application treatments respectively the results indicated that 50 n application produced the highest net income for winter wheat season annual average net income was 17 906 16 921 and 15 932 yuan ha under winter wheat summer maize winter wheat intercropping maize and soybean and winter wheat soybean systems respectively with winter wheat being fertilized with half of the normal n application rate the results indicated the traditional maize and winter wheat cropping system has the advantage in producing the higher economic returns in this region reducing the normal n application rate by half to winter wheat would improve the economic returns 4 discussions the rapid declining in groundwater level in the ncp has threatened the sustainable irrigation agricultural development the irrigation management or the cultivation practices should be changed to reduce the irrigation water use for groundwater conservation zhang et al 2003 but due to the importance of ncp in supplying the national grain production in china reducing the planting area especially winter wheat may not be feasible besides the widely used double cropping system of winter wheat and maize is suitable for ncp due to maize can use the rainfall in the summer season and the subsequent winter wheat can use the water stored in the soil profile depending on its large and deep root system fig 2 previous results in ncp indicated that applying one or two irrigations to winter wheat could maintain a stable yield of this crop with irrigation application being reduced by half of its normal amount zhang et al 2008 2013 water stored in soil before sowing winter wheat plays a key role in maintaining the production of winter wheat under limited water supply condition therefore water use of the previous crop before winter wheat season would affect the performance of winter wheat under limited water supply reducing water consumption of previous crop to increase the water storage in the root zone soil profile and improving root growth in deeper soil profile are two effective methods to improve the grain yield and wue of winter wheat under deficit irrigation planting different pre crops would have diverse effects on the yield of the following crop in dryland based on the residual water left in the root zone soil profile latta and o leary 2003 nielsen et al 2011 pala et al 2007 restovich et al 2012 the results of this study showed that when soybean replaced the summer maize the water storage in soil profile before sowing wheat decreased apparently with the increase in the planting duration due to the greater water use by soybean figs 4 and 6 so the ss as the previous crop of winter wheat would reduce the residual water in soil as compared with the single maize the larger lai of soybean resulted in the higher et and reduced the rainfall in wet season to replenish the depleted soil water kang et al 2003 liu et al 2002 another aspect for the grain production in the ncp was the high n input cui et al 2014 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017 therefore under limited water supply to winter wheat the n application should be decided based on the water availability to the crop the results from this study showed that reducing n input by 50 during the winter wheat season would not affect the yield of winter wheat under deficit irrigation the normal n application to the summer season crop and the reduced n input to winter wheat could maintain crop productivity generally the inclusion of legume into the cereal cropping system could reduce the chemical nitrogen inputs due to the n2 fixation from atmosphere by root nodule bacteria of the legume crops to increase the soil nitrogen contents to reduce n input amossé et al 2014 park et al 2010 but for growing legume crops with grain harvesting the high n contents in grains also implied that legume crops might need more n than other cereal crops table 5 therefore the introducing legume may not necessary reduce the n input depending on the purposes of legume growing net income will also be an important factor to consider the feasibility of a cropping system comparing the cropping systems in summer season inter cropping maize with soybean produced the highest income among the three systems sm and ss had the similar income if their after effects on the following crop were considered the traditional double cropping of winter wheat and summer maize produced the highest annual net income due to winter wheat yield being the highest following maize the yield reduction in winter wheat related to the introducing soybean for summer season crop reduced the annual output therefore for better annual income and higher yield of winter wheat the traditional double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize should be maintained in the ncp 5 conclusions for the conventional annual double cropping system of winter wheat and maize in the ncp maintaining the productivity of winter wheat under deficit irrigation is important for the national food security the water use of the previous crop has a critical effect on the soil water availability to winter wheat which played an important role in maintaining the yield of this crop under deficit irrigation scheduling introducing new crops to replace maize must consider the water use characters of the crops the introducing of soybean as single crop increased the et during summer season which negatively affected the yield of winter wheat the annual net income was the lowest for soybean and wheat rotation however the intercropping of maize and soybean in summer season was beneficial to increase the economic returns in summer the conventional winter wheat and maize system produced higher yield of winter wheat and also maintained good economic returns the maintaining of this system has its advantage in the ncp reducing n input by half amount to winter wheat not only increased the npfp but also improved the net outcome of winter wheat season by reducing the input cost acknowledgement this research was supportedby national s t special fund for agricultural research 2017yfd0300904 and 2016yfd0300401 2 
11332,this study aims at assessing the accuracy of estimating daily grass reference evapotranspiration pm eto computed with era interim reanalysis products as well as to assess the quality of reanalysis products as predictors of daily maximum and minimum temperature net radiation dew point temperature and wind speed which are used to compute pm eto with this propose eto computed from local observations of weather variables in 24 weather stations distributed across continental portugal were compared with reanalysis based values of eto eto rean three different versions of these reanalysis based eto were computed i an uncorrected eto based on the individual weather variables for the nearest grid point to the weather station ii the previously calculated eto corrected for bias with a simple bias correction rule based only on the nearest grid point and iii the eto corrected for bias with a more complex rule involving all grid points in a 100 km radius of the weather station both bias correction approaches were tested aggregating data on a monthly quarterly and a single overall basis cross validation was used to allow evaluating the uncertainties that are modelled independently of any forcing with this purpose data sets were divided into two groups results show that eto rean without bias correction is strongly correlated with pm eto r2 0 80 but tends to over estimate pm eto with the slope of the regression forced to the origin b0 1 05 a mean rmse of 0 79 mm day 1 and with ef generally above 0 70 cross validation results showed that using both bias correction methods improved the accuracy of estimations in particular when a monthly aggregation was used in addition results showed that using the multiple regression correction method outperforms the additive bias correction leading to lower rmse with mean rmse of 0 57 and 0 64 mm day 1 respectively the selection of the bias correction approach to be adopted should balance the ease of use the quality of results and the ability to capture the intra annual seasonality of eto thus for irrigation scheduling operational purposes we propose the use of the additive bias correction with a quarterly aggregation keywords meteorological variables fao penman monteith eto accuracy indicators raw reanalysis data cross validation bias correction methods 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key variable in the hydrological cycle and to quantify the water balance from the field to the hydrological basin scales knowledge of et is essential in water resource planning and management namely for multipurpose projects in irrigation hydropower water transportation flood control and municipal and industrial water uses and in understanding the hydrological behavior of natural and man made landscapes jensen and allen 2016 as competition for water increases and water resources are gradually depleted the need to cope with water scarcity makes knowledge of increasingly accurate values of et more relevant allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2009 pereira 2017 agricultural water management practices require that crop water and irrigation requirements be accurately estimated which in turn demands accurate knowledge of crop evapotranspiration etc there are various approaches for measuring and estimating et at the various scales depending upon the available data and the goals of each study farahani et al 2007 allen et al 2011 jensen and allen 2016 a commonly used etc estimation method at the field scale consists of using the kc eto approach combining the grass reference evapotranspiration eto with a crop coefficient kc as proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 eto represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and is thus driven by the climate the coefficient kc is the ratio between crop et and eto kc etc eto thus represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the grass reference crop height the crop soil surface resistance and the albedo of the crop soil surface the theoretical bases of the kc eto approach are well founded despite the required empiricism in obtaining kc pereira et al 1999 and applications worldwide are successful as recently overviewed pereira et al 2015a b jensen and allen 2016 eto is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height h 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance rs 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water allen et al 1998 this definition corresponds to the application of the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 to a grass crop cultivated in standard optimal conditions with eto mm day 1 described by the daily pm eto eq allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 tmean is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c computed from maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es ea is vapour pressure deficit kpa computed from the saturation vapour pressure es kpa and the actual vapour pressure ea kpa δ is the slope of vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the pm eto eq 1 is not an empirical equation but a mechanistic combination equation resulting from the parameterization of the penman monteith equation to a grass crop as per its definition allen et al 1994 pereira et al 1999 eto is often called potential et pet but this concept is different as discussed among others by pereira et al 1999 and jensen and allen 2016 moreover pet is computed by a variety of equations and when the pm eto equation is used the concepts above referred are rarely assumed for this reason there are numerous empirical studies comparing dozens of equations or using heuristic mathematical approaches to compute et results are very often compared with eto computed with full data sets or are compared with lysimeter data which is an approach in contrast with the mechanistic approach used to derive the pm eto equation allen et al 1994 the computation of the pm eto eq 1 requires data on tmax and tmin solar radiation humidity and u2 allen et al 1998 however in many regions and locations these variables are not observed are not freely available from the relevant meteorological services or are of poor quality due to insufficient quality control the unavailability of such data is often overcome by using alternative et equations or heuristic approaches that use reduced weather data sets however these solutions mainly the heuristic ones do not use the basic physics underlying the pm eto equation pereira et al 2015a b also adopting temperature based methods may lead to biased results due to the effects of global warming as reported by ren et al 2016b to overcome the lack of complete weather data allen et al 1998 proposed estimators of the parameters of the pm eto equation using tmax and tmin data only as recently revised by paredes et al 2018a this pm eto temperature approach pmt has proved accurate for both monthly and daily eto estimation for diverse climates and regions pereira et al 2003 popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 and is gradually being improved todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a almorox et al 2018 paredes et al 2018b recent approaches to estimating eto combine the use of remotely sensed radiation with reanalysis data de bruin et al 2010 2016 proposed a methodology to estimate eto from daily values of downward solar radiation obtained with radiometers onboard the geostationary satellite meteosat second generation msg and air temperature at 2 m provided by operational weather forecasts from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf a similar approach was used by cammalleri and ciraolo 2013 but using radiation from msg and observed air temperature the accuracy of msg estimates of solar radiation has been evaluated bojanowski et al 2014 interpolation of observed weather data from nearby stations was assessed by tomas burguera et al 2017 for the iberian peninsula they concluded that the best solution was to first interpolate weather data and then compute monthly eto this conclusion was also reported by raziei and pereira 2013a b when comparing monthly pm eto computed from observations and gridded data for iran and by mcvicar et al 2007 in an application to the loess plateau of china in addition raziei and pereira 2013a b assessed the grid network by comparing the gridded weather variables with those observed by the network of weather stations the evaluation of gridded gdas eto against observed cimis eto for california was reported by senay et al 2008 and an assessment of the gridded nldas comparing with ground based weather data measurements is reported by lewis et al 2014 good examples of interpolation and mapping of air moisture variables using the gridded database prism are provided by daly et al 2015 and concerning eto by strong et al 2017 the main advantages of the reanalysis products are their spatial and temporal consistency over three or more decades and free access sheffield et al 2006 in contrast limitations of reanalysis products include their coarse spatial resolution typically 80 250 km and insufficient reliability which seems to vary with the climatic variable analysed location period of study and season boulard et al 2016 despite research showing the improvement of the new generation of reanalysis products there is the need to evaluate these products directly using near surface observations over different locations and different climates global atmospheric reanalysis datasets provide the weather variables required for eto estimation with high temporal resolution there are several available sources of global reanalysis data available for pm eto estimation namely the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf providing for the era interim reanalysis products dee et al 2011 the japanese meteorological agency jra onogi et al 2007 the nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar kanamitsu et al 2002 and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa smith et al 2008 as analyzed by sheffield et al 2006 the reanalysis products are constructed from numerical weather prediction and data assimilation systems using a variety of atmospheric and sea surface observations to provide for long term continuous fields in time and space of atmospheric and land surface variables despite observed biases in some reanalysis products berg et al 2003 sheffield et al 2004 they have already been successfully used by many authors in representing the spatio temporal variability of surface climate variables over the globe sheffield et al 2004 mo et al 2011 hwang et al 2014 few studies focused on eto computation using reanalysis data particularly when a daily time step is considered when a fine space and time scale is needed such as in the study of a small catchment then appropriate downscale models are required ishak et al 2010 jaksa et al 2013 srivastava et al 2013a otherwise gridded reanalysis weather data may be used directly to compute eto even though requiring the interpolation of weather variables to the target locations before performing the computation martins et al 2017 reported on the good accuracy of monthly eto estimation using a blended reanalysis product consisting of the combination of the ncep ncar reanalysis with observation based datasets sheffield et al 2006 martins et al also conducted a brief comparison of the performance of eto computation with ncep ncar and era interim reanalysis data which confirmed the superiority of era interim as previously reported by srivastava et al 2013 boulard et al 2016 used era interim reanalysis data for a regional analysis of eto at different times scales from daily to interannual showing good accuracy of variables namely for eto computation and for water balance computations the ecmwf era interim reanalysis products dee et al 2011 were selected in the present study because of its good previous performance srivastava et al 2013 boulard et al 2016 martins et al 2017 however due to bias reported for era interim products the use of these data requires assessing the impact of bias correction berg et al 2003 zhao et al 2008 hwang et al 2014 srivastava et al 2015 on the performance of estimations of reanalysis based eto when compared with eto computed with observation data an additional benefit from using those reanalysis products is that the analysis uses ecmwf short and medium term weather forecasts for supporting irrigation management with short term referring to real time irrigation scheduling and medium term to planning irrigation early in the season in fact the main goal of this research is to enable the application of eto computed with reanalysis data as input to a soil water balance and irrigation scheduling and management model for use in locations where weather data are not available paredes et al 2014 2017 pereira et al 2015a b as well as its use with ecmwf short and medium term weather forecasts paredes et al 2015 using daily meteorological observations from 24 weather stations in continental portugal and era interim reanalysis products the objectives of the current study consist of 1 assessing the performance of the era interim weather variables when compared to local observations 2 evaluating the performance of computing daily eto with reanalysis weather data relative to the pm eto computed with full observed data sets 3 assessing the quality of pm eto computed with raw reanalysis weather data compared with bias corrected eto and 4 assessing the efficiency of alternative bias correction procedures using cross validation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reference evapotranspiration the computation of the reference evapotranspiration pm eto eq 1 was performed using the procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 the daily mean saturation vapour pressure es kpa was computed from the mean of the saturation vapour pressures at the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures e o t m a x and e o t m i n as 2 e s e o t m a x e o t m i n 2 where e o t m a x and e o t m i n were computed as 3 e o t 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t t 237 3 when the dewpoint temperature tdew oc was available as was the case when using reanalysis products the actual vapour pressure ea kpa was computed as 4 e a e o t d e w 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t d e w t d e w 237 3 differently when observations of maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax and rhmin were available ea was computed as 5 e a e o t m i n r h m a x 100 e o t m a x r h m i n 100 2 when only the mean daily rh rhmean was available ea was computed as 6 e a r h m e a n 100 e o t m a x e o t m i n 2 to allow assessing the quality of tdew estimates by era interim tdew for all weather stations data was computed from ea i e solving eq 4 in order to tdew 7 t d e w 116 91 237 3 l n e a 16 78 l n e a the daily soil heat flux g mj m 2 day 1 beneath a dense grass canopy is very small and it is assumed g 0 allen et al 1998 therefore the energy available at the grass canopy reduces to the net radiation rn which represents the net balance of the short and longwave solar radiation 8 r n r n s r n l where rns is the net shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 and rnl is the net balance of the outgoing and incoming longwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 rns is computed as the difference between the incoming and the reflected shortwave solar radiation thus 9 rns rs 1 α where rs is the incoming solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and α is the albedo of the surface with α 0 23 for the grass surface as assumed in the definition of eto allen et al 1998 when not observed rs is computed from the sunshine duration n h using the angström radiation equation 10 r s a s b s n n r a where n is the actual sunshine duration h n is maximum possible sunshine duration h n n is the relative sunshine duration dimensionless ra is extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 as is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on overcast days and as bs is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on clear sky days the adopted default values as 0 25 and bs 0 50 are those recommended by allen et al 1998 and for the iberian peninsula by azorin molina et al 2015 the net long wave radiation rnl mj m 2 day 1 results from the balance between the outgoing and incoming longwave radiation 11 r n l σ t m a x k t m i n k 4 4 2 0 34 0 14 e a 1 35 r s r s o

the parameters used in eq 11 are those proposed by allen et al 1998 all wind speed data was adjusted to the standard height of 2 m using the logarithmic wind speed profile proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 thus 12 u 2 u z 4 87 l n 67 8 z 5 42 where u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 uz is the measured wind speed at z m height m s 1 and z is height of measurement above ground surface m 2 2 data daily weather data sets were collected across continental portugal in 24 weather stations 21 from the instituto português do mar e da atmosfera ipma and 3 from the centro operativo e de tecnologia de regadio cotr they are listed in table 1 and their locations are presented in fig 1 the weather stations were selected so as to ensure regular distribution throughout the country with each station having a record of at least 4 years for comparing with reanalysis data daily weather data refers to maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin oc measured at 2 m height relative humidity rh wind speed u2 m s 1 and solar radiation rs mj m 2 day 1 or sunshine duration n h the quality of observed data was previously assessed using the techniques described in fao56 allen et al 1998 the era interim reanalysis products selected for the current study cover the period from 1979 to present on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0 75 0 75 latitude longitude corresponding to an approximately uniform spacing of 79 km dee et al 2011 data referred to eight 3 h forecasts for every day all grid points located in continental portugal fig 1 were considered for retrieving daily weather products on maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin k dew point temperature tdew k wind speed at 10 m height u10 m s 1 and solar radiation rs w m 2 to obtain the daily reanalysis variables for eq 1 identified with the subscript rean the following procedures were used a the daily tmax rean and tmin rean were selected respectively as the maximum and minimum values among the eight daily available 3 h values of tmax and tmin series b the daily tdew rean were obtained by computing the 24 h average of the eight 3 h values of tdew c the daily rs rean values were obtained by computing the 24 h cumulative value of the 12 h rs values and d the wind speed u2 rean were computed first as the 24 h average of the eight 3 h values of u10 and then these values were converted to 2 m height using eq 12 in what follows all units of variables were converted into the units used in eq 1 that is k were converted into c and w m 2 into mj m 2 day 1 in addition all temperature data were corrected for the elevation of the considered target location following soares et al 2012 a fixed lapse rate of 6 5 c km 1 was adopted berg et al 2003 zhao et al 2008 grouillet et al 2016 which is an intermediate value between the dry and wet adiabatic lapse rate this simplified approach has highly improved the relationships between reanalysis and local tmax tmin and tdew the use of the era interim reanalysis products may be carried out with or without bias correction of the calculated eto rean fig 2 the simplest bias correction approach consists of using the data from the nearest grid point of the target location while a possibly more precise approach considers multiple nearby grid points usable grid points are selected a at a distance 100 km of the target location that concerns limited changes of the weather variables and b when the forced to the origin fto regression coefficient b0 and the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary regression between tmax rean and tmax obs as well as between tmin rean and tmin obs simultaneously satisfy respectively the conditions 0 70 b0 1 30 and r2 0 70 for all locations the reanalysis nearest grid point overcome these conditions 2 3 reanalysis eto bias correction eto may be computed with the referred reanalysis data eto rean with or without bias correction of the computed eto rean bias correction seeks to reduce the differences between eto computed with reanalysis data and with observation data since reanalysis products are often biased due to errors in the host weather forecast models as discussed by berg et al 2003 for a hydrologic application of ecmwf reanalysis products hwang et al 2014 reported on bias correction of reanalysis precipitation and temperature data used in hydrologic simulations various bias correction methods have been used and assessed in several studies maraun 2013 fang et al 2015 with a view to finding an accurate but simple bias correction procedure it was applied to the computed eto rean and not to the individual reanalysis variables used to compute it bias correction applied to reanalysis computed eto is yet rarely reported in literature srivastava et al 2015 since very few applications are reported although bias correction of individual weather variables used in model computations has been reported baigorria et al 2007 maurer et al 2013 two bias corrections schemes were applied fig 2 a a simple correction which adds a constant c t to the uncorrected eto rean unc computed for the nearest grid point where t denotes a time period and 13 c t e t o r e a n u n c t e t o o b s t thus c t is the difference between the mean daily values of the uncorrected eto rean unc and of the eto obs computed with the observed variables at the target location these mean values were computed grouping the available daily data for all the years used to estimate the bias for different periods of time t 1 twelve monthly averages january to december 2 four quarterly averages jfm amj jas and ond and 3 a single overall average a similar approach was used in various studies terink et al 2010 hofer et al 2012 hempel et al 2013 a combined approach also for the same time periods t which uses the multiple regression relating eto obs computed with observed data at the target location with the nearby eto rean unc computed at n nearby grid points that satisfy the conditions on b0 and r2 that were mentioned above the multiple linear regression equation may be expressed as 14 e t o o b s t β 0 t i 1 i n β i t e t o r e a n i t ε t where the multiple regression coefficients β0 β1 β2 βn are estimated by least squares from the eto obs and the eto rean i computed for each of n reanalysis grid points i using the estimated multiple regression coefficients β j ˆ it is possible to obtain new values for eto rean 15 e t o r e a n t ˆ β ˆ 0 t i 1 i n β ˆ i t e t o r e a n i t as with the bias correction scheme a eqs 14 and 15 were fitted for monthly quarterly and overall aggregated data a major uncertainty of bias correction refers to how well it performs for conditions different from those used at calibration thus a cross validation procedure was applied e g arlot and celisse 2010 hofer et al 2012 the cross validation procedure consisted in providing a validation of model fit with a set of data that is independent of the model fitting set in the present study the models were fitted individually for each weather station location and validated on independent data sets for the same location the cross validation procedure consisted in dividing each data set into two subsets of the same size separated in time the more recent and the more distant data for each cross validation iteration one group was used for training and the other was reserved for validation fig 2 in a first step the correction parameters were obtained from the first set of data training and the same correction parameters were used with the second set of data validation subsequently the second set of data was used for deriving the correction parameters training and the first one for verification the assessment of the performance of each bias correction procedure was performed on the validation verification sets the performance results of the cross validation were averaged over the two validation sets 2 4 statistical accuracy indicators the accuracy assessment focused on the pairwise comparison between observed values oi and the corresponding reanalysis values pi for each variable used in eto computations and for the eto values whose means are respectively o and p several statistical indicators were used to assess the performance of the reanalysis datasets in representing the amplitude and time variation of the diverse variables to verify the similarity between oi and pi the following set of indicators were used i the regression coefficient b0 of a linear regression forced to the origin fto computed as 16 b 0 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 2 the fto slope b0 being an overall constant of proportionality between the reanalysis and observed values is often interpreted as a measure of bias with b0 1 suggesting underestimation and b0 1 overestimation ii the coefficient of determination r2 of the of the ordinary least squares regression ols used to assess the dispersion of pairs of oi and pi values along the regression line computed as 17 r 2 i 1 n o i ˆ o 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i ˆ is the fitted regression line o i ˆ a b p i large r2 indicate that a large fraction of the variance of observations is explained by the model iii the percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the reanalysis data to be larger or smaller than the corresponding observed data with positive values indicating an over estimation bias and negative values indicate an under estimation bias 18 p b i a s 100 i n p i o i i 1 n o i 100 p o o iv the root mean square error rmse whose units are those of the considered variable is an overall measurement of the differences between observed and the corresponding reanalysis values it was computed as 19 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n v the normalized rmse nrmse defined as the ratio between rmse and the mean of observations o is an adimensional measure of the relative error of estimate and was computed as follows 20 n r m s e 100 r m s e o vi in addition the nash and sutcliffe 1970 model efficiency ef was used ef measures the relative magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance σ legates and mccabe jr 1999 and is computed as 21 e f 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 ef values close to 1 0 indicate excellent accuracy of reanalysis estimates ef 0 indicate very poor estimates with mse σ further descriptions of these indicators and their use are reported in previous applications pereira et al 2015a b martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018a b 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing the accuracy of reanalysis weather variables the accuracy of reanalysis estimated tmax rean and tmin rean when compared to observed tmax obs and tmin obs is summarized in fig 3 where the frequencies of the computed indicators b0 r2 pbias nrmse and ef are presented the coefficients of determination r2 are high mainly for tmax indicating that a large fraction of the variance of observations is explained by the reanalysis estimated variables coherently ef are generally high for tmax but low ef were obtained for tmin consequently errors are relatively small for tmax with more frequent nrmse ranging from 5 to 15 while errors for tmin are larger mainly in the interval 20 to 50 results for b0 and pbias reveal under and over estimation tendencies respectively for tmax and tmin however with larger pbias in case of tmin these results agree with those reported by soares et al 2012 when estimating daily tmax and tmin using era interim reanalysis for portugal and by martins et al 2017 using monthly blended ncep ncar reanalysis for the iberian peninsula the same tendencies were reported for era interim estimates of tmax and tmin across australia fu et al 2016 and canada prairies betts and beljaars 2017 other studies also report a tendency for over estimation of tmin by era interim reanalysis simmons et al 2010 mooney et al 2011 and by ncep ncar products srivastava et al 2015 a study applied to the globe presented a generally good adherence of era 40 reanalysis tmax to observations but a tendency for over estimation of tmin sillmann et al 2014 less good accuracy observed for tmin may be due to the influence of global warming in the models used to produce the reanalysis temperature estimates as analyzed by simmons et al 2010 for era 40 and era interim products these authors hypothesized that reanalysis is capturing warming over land more than over sea which affects night time temperatures more thus making that tmin rean larger than tmin obs data results in fig 4 show that rs rean agrees well with rs obs with b0 ranging 0 95 to 1 05 in 79 of cases and most pbias between 2 5 and 10 thus with a slight tendency for under estimation r2 0 70 for all cases and ranging from 0 80 to 0 90 in 79 of locations thus indicating that the variability of rs rean reflects the time variability of rs obs in the majority of locations despite the reported good agreement the nrmse ranged from 15 to 30 in most cases but with ef 0 80 in 96 of locations these results suggest that rs were well estimated by rs rean comparable results for rs rean were reported in a study applied to europe using era interim reanalysis data which outlined for portuguese stations a nrmse ranging from 15 to 40 bojanowski et al 2014 urraca et al 2017 reported a tendency for era interim reanalysis to slightly over estimate daily rs in spain with an average nrmse of 13 9 these authors hypothesize that this over estimation may be due to lack of accuracy of era interim in estimating aerosols loadings or the effects of water vapour when estimating the atmospheric transmissivity using blended ncep ncar reanalysis products martins et al 2017 reported good results for monthly estimates of rs for the iberian peninsula other studies relative to daily solar radiation reported a general tendency for reanalysis products to over estimate observations ishak et al 2010 vidal et al 2010 decker et al 2010 including when adopting short time steps for the analysis srivastava et al 2015 dee et al 2011 reported that the tendency for reanalysis global solar radiation in era interim to overestimate observations is partly due to programming errors in the calculation of incident solar radiation 2 w m 2 and to considering a constant value of 1370 w m 2 for the solar irradiance without taking into account the solar cycle the tdew rean results fig 4 indicate a tendency for under estimation with b0 0 95 in 75 of locations most cases present high r2 0 70 0 90 with only 4 of cases having r2 0 60 pbias ranged from 10 0 to 10 0 in 25 of cases but in 20 of locations pbias 20 estimation errors were relatively high with nrmse 30 for 46 of locations good ef results ef 0 70 were found in 46 of cases however ef 0 5 were observed in 29 of the locations srivastava et al 2016 reported a general tendency for ncep and era interim reanalysis products to under estimate tdew studies comparing ea derived from reanalysis rh products also reported a tendency for under estimation of ea eq 4 berg et al 2003 simmons et al 2010 differently martins et al 2017 reported for iberia no tendency for over or under estimation of rh when using the blended ncep ncar reanalysis monthly products daily u2 rean have shown a quite low accuracy differently from the previous analyzed variables u2 rean values reveals a very high dispersion along the regression line fig 5 with low r2 0 26 results also show a general tendency for over estimation of u2 b0 1 08 with only 8 of locations with b0 in the range 0 95 1 05 estimation errors were large with nrmse 30 for all cases resulting in mse σ for 75 of cases the low accuracy of wind speed derived from reanalysis was reported in several other studies applied to portugal carvalho et al 2014 and the iberian peninsula lorente plazas et al 2015 martins et al 2017 3 2 assessing the accuracy of eto rean estimates using reanalysis data without bias correction pm eto eq 1 was computed with reanalysis data relative to the nearest grid point fig 2 though most variables have shown various levels of accuracy as described in the previous sections the performance of eto rean estimates when compared with eto obs is generally good as shown in table 2 where the frequencies of various statistical accuracy indicators are presented a strong correlation between eto obs and eto rean was observed for all locations r2 0 80 overall these results show that eto rean explain well the variability of eto obs however a tendency for over estimating eto was observed with b0 1 15 in 21 of locations and pbias 10 in 50 of cases this tendency for over estimation of eto is likely due to the overestimation of rs and wind speed for various stations fig 4 and 5 as analyzed in the previous section it results an acceptable but high rmse larger than 0 75 mm day 1 in 58 of locations and an overall average rmse of 0 79 mm day 1 ef are generally high with ef 0 70 in 84 of locations thus indicating that the mean square errors were generally much smaller than the eto obs variance results for daily uncorrected eto rean are more accurate than those previously obtained also using era interim without bias correction paredes et al 2017b which is likely due to the altitude correction used in this study results in table 2 also agree with those of a previous study assessing the accuracy of monthly eto rean computed with ncep ncar blended reanalysis for portugal martins et al 2017 moreover other studies using era interim reanalysis data with small time steps also reported an overall over estimation bias for eto srivastava et al 2016 thus although computing eto without bias correction leads to acceptable results it is appropriate to assess the accuracy of eto rean computation with bias correction as analyzed in the next section 3 3 statistical evaluation of the bias correction approaches the mean performance indicators rmse and absolute values of pbias relative to the cross validation applied to the bias correction of the daily computation of eto using reanalysis weather data of the nearest grid point are presented in fig 6 a the additive bias correction were computed using the three aggregation periods t previously referred fig 2 monthly quarterly and the entire period as expected results in fig 6a show that computing the bias correction monthly outperforms the other considered periods and that quarterly computations lead to better results than using the entire period it is likely that rmse and pbias result smaller when the additive correction is computed for a shorter period that better considers the seasonality of climate therefore both period lengths and seasonality combine similar cross validation results fig 6b were obtained when the bias correction was performed using the multiple regression relating various grid points with the target location fig 2 i e computations considering the monthly aggregation performed better than quarterly and the entire period these results confirm the assumption that a bias correction produce better effects when the seasonality of climate is considered comparing figs 6a and b show that using the multiple regression to perform bias correction leads to reduced rmse and pbias relative to using an additive bias correction those results are explained by the fact that the former correction refers to various nearby locations while the additive correction bases upon the nearest point only however adopting the multiple regression is much more demanding in terms of computation as it also happens when using computations relative to the monthly aggregation requirements for accuracy have to be carefully considered by the user when selecting the most appropriate bias correction approach the accuracy of computing daily eto rean using both bias correction approaches is summarized in table 3 where mean performance indicators and the respective range of values are presented accordingly see also fig 6 it can be concluded that a bias correction through the multiple regression approach outperforms the use of an additive bias correction computed from the nearest grid point however the accuracy results are not very different all r2 averages are close to 0 90 all absolute pbias average about 3 5 all rmse averages are around 0 60 mm day 1 and all ef averages are close to 0 90 the ranges of these indicators are shorter and closer to the optimal targets in case of the multiple regression when compared to the additive correction also the indicators computed when data are aggregated to the entire period are less good than those using quarterly or monthly aggregations table 3 despite the improvement of results when aggregating data at the monthly time scale the accuracy indicators are not appreciably better than those obtained with a quarterly aggregation thus the quarterly aggregation seems to adequately capture the intra annual seasonality of climate and of eto and consequently may be used for bias correction in applications to portugal moreover bias correction computed from a multiple regression associating various nearby grid points may provide better results however due to its simple usage and since related accuracy indicators compare well with those due to the multiple regression calculation the use of the additive bias correction computed with the quarterly aggregation may also be appropriate a more focused comparison is therefore performed in the next section to do so considering that cross validation produces different bias corrections according to the data set used for training that analysis was performed computing the bias correction for the most recent half set of data because it may provide for climate variability closer to present climate and related climate warming cardoso et al 2018 3 4 operational selection of the bias correction methodology the selection of the bias correction approach and the computation of the related bias correction parameters was based upon the accuracy indicators computed for the validation sets when using the most recent base period sets for calibration training results comparing the accuracy indicators relative to computing eto rean without bias correction and with both the additive correction and multiple regression calculated using the quarterly aggregation are presented in fig 7 results show that both eto bias correction approaches highly improved the eto rean accuracies notably after bias correction most values of b0 are concentrated in the range 0 95 1 05 thus eliminating the over estimation tendency previously observed all other indicators also improved but less evidently errors for both bias corrected computations are relatively small with rmse 0 75 mm day 1 in 88 and 92 of locations when using respectively the additive bias correction and the multiple regression the average values and range of the accuracy indicators are presented in table 4 which clearly shows the advantages of the bias correction in reducing the over estimation bias and reducing rmse and the respective range as previously referred results of both bias correction approaches do not differ much therefore because the additive bias correction is more straightforward in its application to a single location it may be selected for operational irrigation scheduling purposes the spatial variability of the rmse over portugal fig 8 show that higher values of rmse of the eto rean uncorrected for bias are mostly concentrated in the coastal areas these results agree with those reported by martins et al 2017 when using the ncep ncar blended reanalysis data as already pointed out both bias correction methods allowed to improve rmse results for most locations particularly in the northern part of the country and in the coastal areas fig 8 higher estimation errors were found in interior locations influenced by aridity however rmse differences between bias correction methods were revealed small both bias correction approaches improve daily eto estimations thus resulting a mean rmse of 0 63 and 0 57 mm day 1 respectively for the additive bias correction and the multiple regression correction these results are generally better than those reported by martins et al 2017 for several portuguese stations when assessing the accuracy of monthly eto estimations using ncep ncar blended reanalysis data the results in the current study are better or comparable to those of several studies using temperature only for computing eto the pm temperature approach pmt and the hargreaves samani equation hs this is the case of a study by paredes and rodrigues 2010 that assessed the accuracy of pmt for 8 locations in portugal as well as various studies focusing on the use of the hs equation in several mediterranean locations e g gavilán et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 berti et al 2014 the accuracy of the current approaches revealed particularly better when referring to arid semi arid and sub humid climates 4 conclusions the accurate estimation of daily eto is essential but data sets referring to all weather variables required to compute eto are often not available then evaluating the potential of using daily era interim reanalysis data to compute the pm eto in alternative to the use of reduced data sets is needed this evaluation refers to assess the ability of reanalysis products to reproduce the temporal variability of the observed climatic variables used to compute eto as well as the accuracy of daily eto rean in reproducing the pm eto computed with full data sets across continental portugal in addition two approaches for bias correcting eto rean were assessed results show that rs the main driving variable of eto can be accurately estimated from reanalysis with only a slight trend for over estimation of observations high correlations between reanalysis and observed temperature variables tmax tmin and tdew were obtained after their correction for altitude however a tendency for under estimation of both tmax and tdew was observed together with a tendency for over estimation of tmin nevertheless errors were not high differently the reanalysis wind speed estimation has shown to be less accurate as it is often reported in literature relative to this variable despite the limitations in representing those weather variables the resulting errors for computing daily pm eto are quite small when bias corrections were adopted with rmse not exceeding 0 87 mm day 1 when using an additive bias correction computed from the nearest grid point and data aggregated quarterly to consider seasonality effects rmse does not exceed 0 89 mm day 1 when bias correction adopted a multiple regression with nearby grid points and data were also aggregated quarterly when data are aggregated monthly errors are reduced but computation requirements highly increase however cross validation results did not show noticeable accuracy differences between using quarterly or monthly aggregation periods selection between approaches was based upon easiness of use accuracy of eto rean estimates and ability of capturing the intra annual seasonality of eto thus aiming at local irrigation scheduling operational purposes adopting an additive bias correction based upon reanalysis data relative to the nearest grid point and using a quarterly aggregation may be an adequate

11332,this study aims at assessing the accuracy of estimating daily grass reference evapotranspiration pm eto computed with era interim reanalysis products as well as to assess the quality of reanalysis products as predictors of daily maximum and minimum temperature net radiation dew point temperature and wind speed which are used to compute pm eto with this propose eto computed from local observations of weather variables in 24 weather stations distributed across continental portugal were compared with reanalysis based values of eto eto rean three different versions of these reanalysis based eto were computed i an uncorrected eto based on the individual weather variables for the nearest grid point to the weather station ii the previously calculated eto corrected for bias with a simple bias correction rule based only on the nearest grid point and iii the eto corrected for bias with a more complex rule involving all grid points in a 100 km radius of the weather station both bias correction approaches were tested aggregating data on a monthly quarterly and a single overall basis cross validation was used to allow evaluating the uncertainties that are modelled independently of any forcing with this purpose data sets were divided into two groups results show that eto rean without bias correction is strongly correlated with pm eto r2 0 80 but tends to over estimate pm eto with the slope of the regression forced to the origin b0 1 05 a mean rmse of 0 79 mm day 1 and with ef generally above 0 70 cross validation results showed that using both bias correction methods improved the accuracy of estimations in particular when a monthly aggregation was used in addition results showed that using the multiple regression correction method outperforms the additive bias correction leading to lower rmse with mean rmse of 0 57 and 0 64 mm day 1 respectively the selection of the bias correction approach to be adopted should balance the ease of use the quality of results and the ability to capture the intra annual seasonality of eto thus for irrigation scheduling operational purposes we propose the use of the additive bias correction with a quarterly aggregation keywords meteorological variables fao penman monteith eto accuracy indicators raw reanalysis data cross validation bias correction methods 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key variable in the hydrological cycle and to quantify the water balance from the field to the hydrological basin scales knowledge of et is essential in water resource planning and management namely for multipurpose projects in irrigation hydropower water transportation flood control and municipal and industrial water uses and in understanding the hydrological behavior of natural and man made landscapes jensen and allen 2016 as competition for water increases and water resources are gradually depleted the need to cope with water scarcity makes knowledge of increasingly accurate values of et more relevant allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2009 pereira 2017 agricultural water management practices require that crop water and irrigation requirements be accurately estimated which in turn demands accurate knowledge of crop evapotranspiration etc there are various approaches for measuring and estimating et at the various scales depending upon the available data and the goals of each study farahani et al 2007 allen et al 2011 jensen and allen 2016 a commonly used etc estimation method at the field scale consists of using the kc eto approach combining the grass reference evapotranspiration eto with a crop coefficient kc as proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 eto represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and is thus driven by the climate the coefficient kc is the ratio between crop et and eto kc etc eto thus represents an integration of the effects of three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the grass reference crop height the crop soil surface resistance and the albedo of the crop soil surface the theoretical bases of the kc eto approach are well founded despite the required empiricism in obtaining kc pereira et al 1999 and applications worldwide are successful as recently overviewed pereira et al 2015a b jensen and allen 2016 eto is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height h 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance rs 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water allen et al 1998 this definition corresponds to the application of the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 to a grass crop cultivated in standard optimal conditions with eto mm day 1 described by the daily pm eto eq allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 tmean is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c computed from maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es ea is vapour pressure deficit kpa computed from the saturation vapour pressure es kpa and the actual vapour pressure ea kpa δ is the slope of vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the pm eto eq 1 is not an empirical equation but a mechanistic combination equation resulting from the parameterization of the penman monteith equation to a grass crop as per its definition allen et al 1994 pereira et al 1999 eto is often called potential et pet but this concept is different as discussed among others by pereira et al 1999 and jensen and allen 2016 moreover pet is computed by a variety of equations and when the pm eto equation is used the concepts above referred are rarely assumed for this reason there are numerous empirical studies comparing dozens of equations or using heuristic mathematical approaches to compute et results are very often compared with eto computed with full data sets or are compared with lysimeter data which is an approach in contrast with the mechanistic approach used to derive the pm eto equation allen et al 1994 the computation of the pm eto eq 1 requires data on tmax and tmin solar radiation humidity and u2 allen et al 1998 however in many regions and locations these variables are not observed are not freely available from the relevant meteorological services or are of poor quality due to insufficient quality control the unavailability of such data is often overcome by using alternative et equations or heuristic approaches that use reduced weather data sets however these solutions mainly the heuristic ones do not use the basic physics underlying the pm eto equation pereira et al 2015a b also adopting temperature based methods may lead to biased results due to the effects of global warming as reported by ren et al 2016b to overcome the lack of complete weather data allen et al 1998 proposed estimators of the parameters of the pm eto equation using tmax and tmin data only as recently revised by paredes et al 2018a this pm eto temperature approach pmt has proved accurate for both monthly and daily eto estimation for diverse climates and regions pereira et al 2003 popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 and is gradually being improved todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a almorox et al 2018 paredes et al 2018b recent approaches to estimating eto combine the use of remotely sensed radiation with reanalysis data de bruin et al 2010 2016 proposed a methodology to estimate eto from daily values of downward solar radiation obtained with radiometers onboard the geostationary satellite meteosat second generation msg and air temperature at 2 m provided by operational weather forecasts from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf a similar approach was used by cammalleri and ciraolo 2013 but using radiation from msg and observed air temperature the accuracy of msg estimates of solar radiation has been evaluated bojanowski et al 2014 interpolation of observed weather data from nearby stations was assessed by tomas burguera et al 2017 for the iberian peninsula they concluded that the best solution was to first interpolate weather data and then compute monthly eto this conclusion was also reported by raziei and pereira 2013a b when comparing monthly pm eto computed from observations and gridded data for iran and by mcvicar et al 2007 in an application to the loess plateau of china in addition raziei and pereira 2013a b assessed the grid network by comparing the gridded weather variables with those observed by the network of weather stations the evaluation of gridded gdas eto against observed cimis eto for california was reported by senay et al 2008 and an assessment of the gridded nldas comparing with ground based weather data measurements is reported by lewis et al 2014 good examples of interpolation and mapping of air moisture variables using the gridded database prism are provided by daly et al 2015 and concerning eto by strong et al 2017 the main advantages of the reanalysis products are their spatial and temporal consistency over three or more decades and free access sheffield et al 2006 in contrast limitations of reanalysis products include their coarse spatial resolution typically 80 250 km and insufficient reliability which seems to vary with the climatic variable analysed location period of study and season boulard et al 2016 despite research showing the improvement of the new generation of reanalysis products there is the need to evaluate these products directly using near surface observations over different locations and different climates global atmospheric reanalysis datasets provide the weather variables required for eto estimation with high temporal resolution there are several available sources of global reanalysis data available for pm eto estimation namely the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf providing for the era interim reanalysis products dee et al 2011 the japanese meteorological agency jra onogi et al 2007 the nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar kanamitsu et al 2002 and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa smith et al 2008 as analyzed by sheffield et al 2006 the reanalysis products are constructed from numerical weather prediction and data assimilation systems using a variety of atmospheric and sea surface observations to provide for long term continuous fields in time and space of atmospheric and land surface variables despite observed biases in some reanalysis products berg et al 2003 sheffield et al 2004 they have already been successfully used by many authors in representing the spatio temporal variability of surface climate variables over the globe sheffield et al 2004 mo et al 2011 hwang et al 2014 few studies focused on eto computation using reanalysis data particularly when a daily time step is considered when a fine space and time scale is needed such as in the study of a small catchment then appropriate downscale models are required ishak et al 2010 jaksa et al 2013 srivastava et al 2013a otherwise gridded reanalysis weather data may be used directly to compute eto even though requiring the interpolation of weather variables to the target locations before performing the computation martins et al 2017 reported on the good accuracy of monthly eto estimation using a blended reanalysis product consisting of the combination of the ncep ncar reanalysis with observation based datasets sheffield et al 2006 martins et al also conducted a brief comparison of the performance of eto computation with ncep ncar and era interim reanalysis data which confirmed the superiority of era interim as previously reported by srivastava et al 2013 boulard et al 2016 used era interim reanalysis data for a regional analysis of eto at different times scales from daily to interannual showing good accuracy of variables namely for eto computation and for water balance computations the ecmwf era interim reanalysis products dee et al 2011 were selected in the present study because of its good previous performance srivastava et al 2013 boulard et al 2016 martins et al 2017 however due to bias reported for era interim products the use of these data requires assessing the impact of bias correction berg et al 2003 zhao et al 2008 hwang et al 2014 srivastava et al 2015 on the performance of estimations of reanalysis based eto when compared with eto computed with observation data an additional benefit from using those reanalysis products is that the analysis uses ecmwf short and medium term weather forecasts for supporting irrigation management with short term referring to real time irrigation scheduling and medium term to planning irrigation early in the season in fact the main goal of this research is to enable the application of eto computed with reanalysis data as input to a soil water balance and irrigation scheduling and management model for use in locations where weather data are not available paredes et al 2014 2017 pereira et al 2015a b as well as its use with ecmwf short and medium term weather forecasts paredes et al 2015 using daily meteorological observations from 24 weather stations in continental portugal and era interim reanalysis products the objectives of the current study consist of 1 assessing the performance of the era interim weather variables when compared to local observations 2 evaluating the performance of computing daily eto with reanalysis weather data relative to the pm eto computed with full observed data sets 3 assessing the quality of pm eto computed with raw reanalysis weather data compared with bias corrected eto and 4 assessing the efficiency of alternative bias correction procedures using cross validation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reference evapotranspiration the computation of the reference evapotranspiration pm eto eq 1 was performed using the procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 the daily mean saturation vapour pressure es kpa was computed from the mean of the saturation vapour pressures at the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures e o t m a x and e o t m i n as 2 e s e o t m a x e o t m i n 2 where e o t m a x and e o t m i n were computed as 3 e o t 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t t 237 3 when the dewpoint temperature tdew oc was available as was the case when using reanalysis products the actual vapour pressure ea kpa was computed as 4 e a e o t d e w 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t d e w t d e w 237 3 differently when observations of maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax and rhmin were available ea was computed as 5 e a e o t m i n r h m a x 100 e o t m a x r h m i n 100 2 when only the mean daily rh rhmean was available ea was computed as 6 e a r h m e a n 100 e o t m a x e o t m i n 2 to allow assessing the quality of tdew estimates by era interim tdew for all weather stations data was computed from ea i e solving eq 4 in order to tdew 7 t d e w 116 91 237 3 l n e a 16 78 l n e a the daily soil heat flux g mj m 2 day 1 beneath a dense grass canopy is very small and it is assumed g 0 allen et al 1998 therefore the energy available at the grass canopy reduces to the net radiation rn which represents the net balance of the short and longwave solar radiation 8 r n r n s r n l where rns is the net shortwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 and rnl is the net balance of the outgoing and incoming longwave radiation mj m 2 day 1 rns is computed as the difference between the incoming and the reflected shortwave solar radiation thus 9 rns rs 1 α where rs is the incoming solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and α is the albedo of the surface with α 0 23 for the grass surface as assumed in the definition of eto allen et al 1998 when not observed rs is computed from the sunshine duration n h using the angström radiation equation 10 r s a s b s n n r a where n is the actual sunshine duration h n is maximum possible sunshine duration h n n is the relative sunshine duration dimensionless ra is extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 as is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on overcast days and as bs is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on clear sky days the adopted default values as 0 25 and bs 0 50 are those recommended by allen et al 1998 and for the iberian peninsula by azorin molina et al 2015 the net long wave radiation rnl mj m 2 day 1 results from the balance between the outgoing and incoming longwave radiation 11 r n l σ t m a x k t m i n k 4 4 2 0 34 0 14 e a 1 35 r s r s o

the parameters used in eq 11 are those proposed by allen et al 1998 all wind speed data was adjusted to the standard height of 2 m using the logarithmic wind speed profile proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 thus 12 u 2 u z 4 87 l n 67 8 z 5 42 where u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 uz is the measured wind speed at z m height m s 1 and z is height of measurement above ground surface m 2 2 data daily weather data sets were collected across continental portugal in 24 weather stations 21 from the instituto português do mar e da atmosfera ipma and 3 from the centro operativo e de tecnologia de regadio cotr they are listed in table 1 and their locations are presented in fig 1 the weather stations were selected so as to ensure regular distribution throughout the country with each station having a record of at least 4 years for comparing with reanalysis data daily weather data refers to maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin oc measured at 2 m height relative humidity rh wind speed u2 m s 1 and solar radiation rs mj m 2 day 1 or sunshine duration n h the quality of observed data was previously assessed using the techniques described in fao56 allen et al 1998 the era interim reanalysis products selected for the current study cover the period from 1979 to present on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0 75 0 75 latitude longitude corresponding to an approximately uniform spacing of 79 km dee et al 2011 data referred to eight 3 h forecasts for every day all grid points located in continental portugal fig 1 were considered for retrieving daily weather products on maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin k dew point temperature tdew k wind speed at 10 m height u10 m s 1 and solar radiation rs w m 2 to obtain the daily reanalysis variables for eq 1 identified with the subscript rean the following procedures were used a the daily tmax rean and tmin rean were selected respectively as the maximum and minimum values among the eight daily available 3 h values of tmax and tmin series b the daily tdew rean were obtained by computing the 24 h average of the eight 3 h values of tdew c the daily rs rean values were obtained by computing the 24 h cumulative value of the 12 h rs values and d the wind speed u2 rean were computed first as the 24 h average of the eight 3 h values of u10 and then these values were converted to 2 m height using eq 12 in what follows all units of variables were converted into the units used in eq 1 that is k were converted into c and w m 2 into mj m 2 day 1 in addition all temperature data were corrected for the elevation of the considered target location following soares et al 2012 a fixed lapse rate of 6 5 c km 1 was adopted berg et al 2003 zhao et al 2008 grouillet et al 2016 which is an intermediate value between the dry and wet adiabatic lapse rate this simplified approach has highly improved the relationships between reanalysis and local tmax tmin and tdew the use of the era interim reanalysis products may be carried out with or without bias correction of the calculated eto rean fig 2 the simplest bias correction approach consists of using the data from the nearest grid point of the target location while a possibly more precise approach considers multiple nearby grid points usable grid points are selected a at a distance 100 km of the target location that concerns limited changes of the weather variables and b when the forced to the origin fto regression coefficient b0 and the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary regression between tmax rean and tmax obs as well as between tmin rean and tmin obs simultaneously satisfy respectively the conditions 0 70 b0 1 30 and r2 0 70 for all locations the reanalysis nearest grid point overcome these conditions 2 3 reanalysis eto bias correction eto may be computed with the referred reanalysis data eto rean with or without bias correction of the computed eto rean bias correction seeks to reduce the differences between eto computed with reanalysis data and with observation data since reanalysis products are often biased due to errors in the host weather forecast models as discussed by berg et al 2003 for a hydrologic application of ecmwf reanalysis products hwang et al 2014 reported on bias correction of reanalysis precipitation and temperature data used in hydrologic simulations various bias correction methods have been used and assessed in several studies maraun 2013 fang et al 2015 with a view to finding an accurate but simple bias correction procedure it was applied to the computed eto rean and not to the individual reanalysis variables used to compute it bias correction applied to reanalysis computed eto is yet rarely reported in literature srivastava et al 2015 since very few applications are reported although bias correction of individual weather variables used in model computations has been reported baigorria et al 2007 maurer et al 2013 two bias corrections schemes were applied fig 2 a a simple correction which adds a constant c t to the uncorrected eto rean unc computed for the nearest grid point where t denotes a time period and 13 c t e t o r e a n u n c t e t o o b s t thus c t is the difference between the mean daily values of the uncorrected eto rean unc and of the eto obs computed with the observed variables at the target location these mean values were computed grouping the available daily data for all the years used to estimate the bias for different periods of time t 1 twelve monthly averages january to december 2 four quarterly averages jfm amj jas and ond and 3 a single overall average a similar approach was used in various studies terink et al 2010 hofer et al 2012 hempel et al 2013 a combined approach also for the same time periods t which uses the multiple regression relating eto obs computed with observed data at the target location with the nearby eto rean unc computed at n nearby grid points that satisfy the conditions on b0 and r2 that were mentioned above the multiple linear regression equation may be expressed as 14 e t o o b s t β 0 t i 1 i n β i t e t o r e a n i t ε t where the multiple regression coefficients β0 β1 β2 βn are estimated by least squares from the eto obs and the eto rean i computed for each of n reanalysis grid points i using the estimated multiple regression coefficients β j ˆ it is possible to obtain new values for eto rean 15 e t o r e a n t ˆ β ˆ 0 t i 1 i n β ˆ i t e t o r e a n i t as with the bias correction scheme a eqs 14 and 15 were fitted for monthly quarterly and overall aggregated data a major uncertainty of bias correction refers to how well it performs for conditions different from those used at calibration thus a cross validation procedure was applied e g arlot and celisse 2010 hofer et al 2012 the cross validation procedure consisted in providing a validation of model fit with a set of data that is independent of the model fitting set in the present study the models were fitted individually for each weather station location and validated on independent data sets for the same location the cross validation procedure consisted in dividing each data set into two subsets of the same size separated in time the more recent and the more distant data for each cross validation iteration one group was used for training and the other was reserved for validation fig 2 in a first step the correction parameters were obtained from the first set of data training and the same correction parameters were used with the second set of data validation subsequently the second set of data was used for deriving the correction parameters training and the first one for verification the assessment of the performance of each bias correction procedure was performed on the validation verification sets the performance results of the cross validation were averaged over the two validation sets 2 4 statistical accuracy indicators the accuracy assessment focused on the pairwise comparison between observed values oi and the corresponding reanalysis values pi for each variable used in eto computations and for the eto values whose means are respectively o and p several statistical indicators were used to assess the performance of the reanalysis datasets in representing the amplitude and time variation of the diverse variables to verify the similarity between oi and pi the following set of indicators were used i the regression coefficient b0 of a linear regression forced to the origin fto computed as 16 b 0 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 2 the fto slope b0 being an overall constant of proportionality between the reanalysis and observed values is often interpreted as a measure of bias with b0 1 suggesting underestimation and b0 1 overestimation ii the coefficient of determination r2 of the of the ordinary least squares regression ols used to assess the dispersion of pairs of oi and pi values along the regression line computed as 17 r 2 i 1 n o i ˆ o 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i ˆ is the fitted regression line o i ˆ a b p i large r2 indicate that a large fraction of the variance of observations is explained by the model iii the percent bias pbias measures the average tendency of the reanalysis data to be larger or smaller than the corresponding observed data with positive values indicating an over estimation bias and negative values indicate an under estimation bias 18 p b i a s 100 i n p i o i i 1 n o i 100 p o o iv the root mean square error rmse whose units are those of the considered variable is an overall measurement of the differences between observed and the corresponding reanalysis values it was computed as 19 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n v the normalized rmse nrmse defined as the ratio between rmse and the mean of observations o is an adimensional measure of the relative error of estimate and was computed as follows 20 n r m s e 100 r m s e o vi in addition the nash and sutcliffe 1970 model efficiency ef was used ef measures the relative magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance σ legates and mccabe jr 1999 and is computed as 21 e f 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 ef values close to 1 0 indicate excellent accuracy of reanalysis estimates ef 0 indicate very poor estimates with mse σ further descriptions of these indicators and their use are reported in previous applications pereira et al 2015a b martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018a b 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing the accuracy of reanalysis weather variables the accuracy of reanalysis estimated tmax rean and tmin rean when compared to observed tmax obs and tmin obs is summarized in fig 3 where the frequencies of the computed indicators b0 r2 pbias nrmse and ef are presented the coefficients of determination r2 are high mainly for tmax indicating that a large fraction of the variance of observations is explained by the reanalysis estimated variables coherently ef are generally high for tmax but low ef were obtained for tmin consequently errors are relatively small for tmax with more frequent nrmse ranging from 5 to 15 while errors for tmin are larger mainly in the interval 20 to 50 results for b0 and pbias reveal under and over estimation tendencies respectively for tmax and tmin however with larger pbias in case of tmin these results agree with those reported by soares et al 2012 when estimating daily tmax and tmin using era interim reanalysis for portugal and by martins et al 2017 using monthly blended ncep ncar reanalysis for the iberian peninsula the same tendencies were reported for era interim estimates of tmax and tmin across australia fu et al 2016 and canada prairies betts and beljaars 2017 other studies also report a tendency for over estimation of tmin by era interim reanalysis simmons et al 2010 mooney et al 2011 and by ncep ncar products srivastava et al 2015 a study applied to the globe presented a generally good adherence of era 40 reanalysis tmax to observations but a tendency for over estimation of tmin sillmann et al 2014 less good accuracy observed for tmin may be due to the influence of global warming in the models used to produce the reanalysis temperature estimates as analyzed by simmons et al 2010 for era 40 and era interim products these authors hypothesized that reanalysis is capturing warming over land more than over sea which affects night time temperatures more thus making that tmin rean larger than tmin obs data results in fig 4 show that rs rean agrees well with rs obs with b0 ranging 0 95 to 1 05 in 79 of cases and most pbias between 2 5 and 10 thus with a slight tendency for under estimation r2 0 70 for all cases and ranging from 0 80 to 0 90 in 79 of locations thus indicating that the variability of rs rean reflects the time variability of rs obs in the majority of locations despite the reported good agreement the nrmse ranged from 15 to 30 in most cases but with ef 0 80 in 96 of locations these results suggest that rs were well estimated by rs rean comparable results for rs rean were reported in a study applied to europe using era interim reanalysis data which outlined for portuguese stations a nrmse ranging from 15 to 40 bojanowski et al 2014 urraca et al 2017 reported a tendency for era interim reanalysis to slightly over estimate daily rs in spain with an average nrmse of 13 9 these authors hypothesize that this over estimation may be due to lack of accuracy of era interim in estimating aerosols loadings or the effects of water vapour when estimating the atmospheric transmissivity using blended ncep ncar reanalysis products martins et al 2017 reported good results for monthly estimates of rs for the iberian peninsula other studies relative to daily solar radiation reported a general tendency for reanalysis products to over estimate observations ishak et al 2010 vidal et al 2010 decker et al 2010 including when adopting short time steps for the analysis srivastava et al 2015 dee et al 2011 reported that the tendency for reanalysis global solar radiation in era interim to overestimate observations is partly due to programming errors in the calculation of incident solar radiation 2 w m 2 and to considering a constant value of 1370 w m 2 for the solar irradiance without taking into account the solar cycle the tdew rean results fig 4 indicate a tendency for under estimation with b0 0 95 in 75 of locations most cases present high r2 0 70 0 90 with only 4 of cases having r2 0 60 pbias ranged from 10 0 to 10 0 in 25 of cases but in 20 of locations pbias 20 estimation errors were relatively high with nrmse 30 for 46 of locations good ef results ef 0 70 were found in 46 of cases however ef 0 5 were observed in 29 of the locations srivastava et al 2016 reported a general tendency for ncep and era interim reanalysis products to under estimate tdew studies comparing ea derived from reanalysis rh products also reported a tendency for under estimation of ea eq 4 berg et al 2003 simmons et al 2010 differently martins et al 2017 reported for iberia no tendency for over or under estimation of rh when using the blended ncep ncar reanalysis monthly products daily u2 rean have shown a quite low accuracy differently from the previous analyzed variables u2 rean values reveals a very high dispersion along the regression line fig 5 with low r2 0 26 results also show a general tendency for over estimation of u2 b0 1 08 with only 8 of locations with b0 in the range 0 95 1 05 estimation errors were large with nrmse 30 for all cases resulting in mse σ for 75 of cases the low accuracy of wind speed derived from reanalysis was reported in several other studies applied to portugal carvalho et al 2014 and the iberian peninsula lorente plazas et al 2015 martins et al 2017 3 2 assessing the accuracy of eto rean estimates using reanalysis data without bias correction pm eto eq 1 was computed with reanalysis data relative to the nearest grid point fig 2 though most variables have shown various levels of accuracy as described in the previous sections the performance of eto rean estimates when compared with eto obs is generally good as shown in table 2 where the frequencies of various statistical accuracy indicators are presented a strong correlation between eto obs and eto rean was observed for all locations r2 0 80 overall these results show that eto rean explain well the variability of eto obs however a tendency for over estimating eto was observed with b0 1 15 in 21 of locations and pbias 10 in 50 of cases this tendency for over estimation of eto is likely due to the overestimation of rs and wind speed for various stations fig 4 and 5 as analyzed in the previous section it results an acceptable but high rmse larger than 0 75 mm day 1 in 58 of locations and an overall average rmse of 0 79 mm day 1 ef are generally high with ef 0 70 in 84 of locations thus indicating that the mean square errors were generally much smaller than the eto obs variance results for daily uncorrected eto rean are more accurate than those previously obtained also using era interim without bias correction paredes et al 2017b which is likely due to the altitude correction used in this study results in table 2 also agree with those of a previous study assessing the accuracy of monthly eto rean computed with ncep ncar blended reanalysis for portugal martins et al 2017 moreover other studies using era interim reanalysis data with small time steps also reported an overall over estimation bias for eto srivastava et al 2016 thus although computing eto without bias correction leads to acceptable results it is appropriate to assess the accuracy of eto rean computation with bias correction as analyzed in the next section 3 3 statistical evaluation of the bias correction approaches the mean performance indicators rmse and absolute values of pbias relative to the cross validation applied to the bias correction of the daily computation of eto using reanalysis weather data of the nearest grid point are presented in fig 6 a the additive bias correction were computed using the three aggregation periods t previously referred fig 2 monthly quarterly and the entire period as expected results in fig 6a show that computing the bias correction monthly outperforms the other considered periods and that quarterly computations lead to better results than using the entire period it is likely that rmse and pbias result smaller when the additive correction is computed for a shorter period that better considers the seasonality of climate therefore both period lengths and seasonality combine similar cross validation results fig 6b were obtained when the bias correction was performed using the multiple regression relating various grid points with the target location fig 2 i e computations considering the monthly aggregation performed better than quarterly and the entire period these results confirm the assumption that a bias correction produce better effects when the seasonality of climate is considered comparing figs 6a and b show that using the multiple regression to perform bias correction leads to reduced rmse and pbias relative to using an additive bias correction those results are explained by the fact that the former correction refers to various nearby locations while the additive correction bases upon the nearest point only however adopting the multiple regression is much more demanding in terms of computation as it also happens when using computations relative to the monthly aggregation requirements for accuracy have to be carefully considered by the user when selecting the most appropriate bias correction approach the accuracy of computing daily eto rean using both bias correction approaches is summarized in table 3 where mean performance indicators and the respective range of values are presented accordingly see also fig 6 it can be concluded that a bias correction through the multiple regression approach outperforms the use of an additive bias correction computed from the nearest grid point however the accuracy results are not very different all r2 averages are close to 0 90 all absolute pbias average about 3 5 all rmse averages are around 0 60 mm day 1 and all ef averages are close to 0 90 the ranges of these indicators are shorter and closer to the optimal targets in case of the multiple regression when compared to the additive correction also the indicators computed when data are aggregated to the entire period are less good than those using quarterly or monthly aggregations table 3 despite the improvement of results when aggregating data at the monthly time scale the accuracy indicators are not appreciably better than those obtained with a quarterly aggregation thus the quarterly aggregation seems to adequately capture the intra annual seasonality of climate and of eto and consequently may be used for bias correction in applications to portugal moreover bias correction computed from a multiple regression associating various nearby grid points may provide better results however due to its simple usage and since related accuracy indicators compare well with those due to the multiple regression calculation the use of the additive bias correction computed with the quarterly aggregation may also be appropriate a more focused comparison is therefore performed in the next section to do so considering that cross validation produces different bias corrections according to the data set used for training that analysis was performed computing the bias correction for the most recent half set of data because it may provide for climate variability closer to present climate and related climate warming cardoso et al 2018 3 4 operational selection of the bias correction methodology the selection of the bias correction approach and the computation of the related bias correction parameters was based upon the accuracy indicators computed for the validation sets when using the most recent base period sets for calibration training results comparing the accuracy indicators relative to computing eto rean without bias correction and with both the additive correction and multiple regression calculated using the quarterly aggregation are presented in fig 7 results show that both eto bias correction approaches highly improved the eto rean accuracies notably after bias correction most values of b0 are concentrated in the range 0 95 1 05 thus eliminating the over estimation tendency previously observed all other indicators also improved but less evidently errors for both bias corrected computations are relatively small with rmse 0 75 mm day 1 in 88 and 92 of locations when using respectively the additive bias correction and the multiple regression the average values and range of the accuracy indicators are presented in table 4 which clearly shows the advantages of the bias correction in reducing the over estimation bias and reducing rmse and the respective range as previously referred results of both bias correction approaches do not differ much therefore because the additive bias correction is more straightforward in its application to a single location it may be selected for operational irrigation scheduling purposes the spatial variability of the rmse over portugal fig 8 show that higher values of rmse of the eto rean uncorrected for bias are mostly concentrated in the coastal areas these results agree with those reported by martins et al 2017 when using the ncep ncar blended reanalysis data as already pointed out both bias correction methods allowed to improve rmse results for most locations particularly in the northern part of the country and in the coastal areas fig 8 higher estimation errors were found in interior locations influenced by aridity however rmse differences between bias correction methods were revealed small both bias correction approaches improve daily eto estimations thus resulting a mean rmse of 0 63 and 0 57 mm day 1 respectively for the additive bias correction and the multiple regression correction these results are generally better than those reported by martins et al 2017 for several portuguese stations when assessing the accuracy of monthly eto estimations using ncep ncar blended reanalysis data the results in the current study are better or comparable to those of several studies using temperature only for computing eto the pm temperature approach pmt and the hargreaves samani equation hs this is the case of a study by paredes and rodrigues 2010 that assessed the accuracy of pmt for 8 locations in portugal as well as various studies focusing on the use of the hs equation in several mediterranean locations e g gavilán et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 berti et al 2014 the accuracy of the current approaches revealed particularly better when referring to arid semi arid and sub humid climates 4 conclusions the accurate estimation of daily eto is essential but data sets referring to all weather variables required to compute eto are often not available then evaluating the potential of using daily era interim reanalysis data to compute the pm eto in alternative to the use of reduced data sets is needed this evaluation refers to assess the ability of reanalysis products to reproduce the temporal variability of the observed climatic variables used to compute eto as well as the accuracy of daily eto rean in reproducing the pm eto computed with full data sets across continental portugal in addition two approaches for bias correcting eto rean were assessed results show that rs the main driving variable of eto can be accurately estimated from reanalysis with only a slight trend for over estimation of observations high correlations between reanalysis and observed temperature variables tmax tmin and tdew were obtained after their correction for altitude however a tendency for under estimation of both tmax and tdew was observed together with a tendency for over estimation of tmin nevertheless errors were not high differently the reanalysis wind speed estimation has shown to be less accurate as it is often reported in literature relative to this variable despite the limitations in representing those weather variables the resulting errors for computing daily pm eto are quite small when bias corrections were adopted with rmse not exceeding 0 87 mm day 1 when using an additive bias correction computed from the nearest grid point and data aggregated quarterly to consider seasonality effects rmse does not exceed 0 89 mm day 1 when bias correction adopted a multiple regression with nearby grid points and data were also aggregated quarterly when data are aggregated monthly errors are reduced but computation requirements highly increase however cross validation results did not show noticeable accuracy differences between using quarterly or monthly aggregation periods selection between approaches was based upon easiness of use accuracy of eto rean estimates and ability of capturing the intra annual seasonality of eto thus aiming at local irrigation scheduling operational purposes adopting an additive bias correction based upon reanalysis data relative to the nearest grid point and using a quarterly aggregation may be an adequate

11333,nitrogen n leaching is an important factor that threatens groundwater safety in intensive greenhouse vegetable production regions however managing irrigation and fertilization to reduce nitrate leaching has rarely been carried out in long term experiments in this study n leaching in two typical greenhouse vegetable systems a cucumber cucumber system in shandong and a cucumber tomato system in ningxia from 2008 to 2013 investigated should be studied using a lysimeter monitoring method the total n fertilization rate was 0 to 2508 kg n ha 1 which included three treatments no fertilizer ck 0 kg n ha 1 conventional treatment con shandong 2508 kg n ha 1 and ningxia 2239 kg n ha 1 and reduced fertilizer application rf shandong 2164 kg n ha 1 and ningxia 1716 kg n ha 1 the irrigation amount was 590 2919 mm year 1 according to vegetable water demand the results indicated that the annual total n leaching were 344 8 kg ha 1 192 3 508 3 kg ha 1 in shandong and 170 7 kg ha 1 134 9 203 7 kg ha

factor anlf year by year meanwhile a concomitant annual cost reductions associated with the rf treatment estimated at 187 million usd for shandong and 20 million usd for ningxia anll increased linearly with the n input p 0 05 more than half of anll came from fertilizer n including chemical and manure fertilizer under con treatments while more than half of anll came from soil and water n under rf treatments the results indicated that mitigation measures for n leaching pollution from greenhouse vegetable fields should consider regulations on irrigation and fertilization keywords greenhouse vegetable field irrigation nitrogen rate nitrogen leaching non point source pollution 1 introduction many regions all over the world are entirely dependent on groundwater resources for various uses siyal et al 2012 adviento borbe et al 2018 nitrate contamination of this groundwater largely caused by agricultural nitrate leaching is a growing problem globally due to population growth and increased food demand zhang et al 2017 and can threaten the health of local populations gu et al 2013 huang et al 2017 severe nitrate contamination of groundwater is mainly associated with greenhouse vegetable cultivation due to high rates of fertilization and irrigation shi et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 vegetable production in relatively simple plastic greenhouses is an essential and rapidly growing industry in different parts of the world chang et al 2011 china in particular has rapidly increased greenhouse vegetable cultivation over the last three decades as it is highly profitable yu et al 2010 by 2010 greenhouses covered approximately 4 67 million hectares in china accounting for 65 of the total economic value of vegetable production and comprising 90 of the greenhouse fields in the world chang et al 2013 to achieve a high level of production the annual average n inputs from chemical fertilizers and manures were 1358 and 1881 kg n ha 1 respectively and even beyond 3000 kg n ha 1 in north china ju et al 2009 yu et al 2010 while the average irrigation rate was 1600 2400 mm per annum for the greenhouse vegetable systems sun et al 2012 generally the total n uptake by vegetables is less than 400 kg n ha 1 thus fertilizer n use efficiency calculated using the subtraction method in those vegetable systems could be less than 10 with conventional management practices zhu et al 2005 excess n fertilizer applied with furrow irrigation to greenhouse vegetable fields results in nutrient accumulation in soils and substantial nitrate leaching thompson et al 2007 wang et al 2016 nitrogen leaching losses from intensive vegetable systems have been identified as a major source of non point source pollution shrestha et al 2010 min and shi 2018 mounting public concern about the negative effects of excessive n fertilization and irrigation and increasing risk of groundwater pollution has now made it imperative to accurately quantify n leaching from agriculture xu et al 2013 delin and stenberg 2014 and to develop practical n management strategies to reduce n leaching without reducing yield min et al 2012 barzegari et al 2017 a number of studies have been conducted to investigate n leaching from croplands song et al 2009 yang et al 2017 but most of them focused on cereal crops observations regarding greenhouse vegetable systems are lacking or are based on short term studies min et al 2012 moreover attention was focused on the concentrations of nitrate and the amount of n leaching losses in the leachate from different fertilizer applications and irrigation sharmasarkar et al 2001 chen et al 2014 there was no systematic analysis to build up the relationships between n leaching losses n fertilizer rate and water input in a long term experiment owing to the synthesized influences of vegetable growing conditions soil properties irrigation and n application a considerable variation of annual n leaching losses exists making it hard to characterize n leaching in cultivated lands merely on the basis of short term experiments min et al 2011a the same conclusion was also drawn by li et al 2007 believing that results obtained from short term experiments were insufficient to explain the variations of nitrogen leaching losses from croplands in an arid or semi arid district there is an urgent need to investigate n leaching trends with different n application and irrigation rates in greenhouse vegetable systems and to provide practical measures to reduce n leaching while maintaining yield in those systems here it was hypothesized that n application rate and water input have a stable relationship with n leaching and that optimised n and water application rates could lead to less n leaching and consistent yields in this study we chose two typical greenhouse vegetable planting areas that are experiencing rapid growth and development one located in shandong province in which greenhouse vegetables are maintained with higher n fertilizer application 2508 kg n ha 1 and irrigation rates ranging from 1426 to 2919 mm while the second is located in the ningxia hui autonomous region in which n fertilizer application 2239 kg n ha 1 and irrigation rates ranging from 590 to 846 mm are lower six year 2008 2013 field experiments were conducted under different irrigation and fertilizer regimens to determine n leaching losses using pvc lysimeters the specific objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the leached water and the amount of total n tn nitrate n no 3 n ammonium n nh 4 n and soil organic nitrogen son in the leachate 2 to define the relationships between irrigation i and leachate l and between total n application rate and n leaching losses and 3 to decrease n leaching losses by adjusting the traditional n rates to an optimum level without yield losses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted in two greenhouse vegetable production areas located in northern china the daotian town shouguang city shandong province 36 8 n 118 9 e with a system of cucumber cucumber and the xingqing district yinchuan city ningxia province 38 4 n 106 4 e with a system of tomato cucumber shandong has an average altitude of 23 m and a typical warm temperate monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 593 8 mm and annual temperature of 12 7 the experimental soil was classified as cinnamon soils with sandy loam texture the first quarter of the cucumber growing season was from late january to mid july with variety century star 08 the second quarter of the cucumber growing period was from early august to late december with variety 787 the planting density of cucumber was 48 000 plants per hectare ningxia has an average altitude of 1100 m and a typical continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 233 0 mm and annual temperature of 9 the experimental soil was classified as irrigation silting soils with sandy soil the tomato growing season was from early january to mid june with variety maria while the cucumber growing period was from early august to late december with variety del 99 the planting density of tomato and cucumber was 45 000 and 48 000 plants per hectare respectively the experiments were established in 2008 with the baseline soil physical and chemical properties at the start of the experiment listed in table 1 2 2 experiment design the field experiments with three treatments no fertilizer ck conventional fertilization con and reduced fertilizer application rf were carried out in the two greenhouse vegetable systems from january 2008 to december 2013 fertilizer application rates in the con treatment were established after discussions with local farmers and based on this the total chemical fertilizer n application rate for the rf treatment was reduced from the con rates by 22 in shandong and 28 and in ningxia additionally con and rf treatments were supplemented with an equivalent n application of 44 563 kg ha 1 chicken manure in shandong and 36 200 kg ha 1 chicken manure in ningxia with average total n p2o5 and k2o content of 2 06 2 09 1 99 and 1 00 1 32 1 88 in shandong and ningxia respectively the fertilization rates for treatments are summarized in table 2 the fertilizer ratio for the first and second season was 1 1 in shandong while the fertilizer ratio for the tomato and cucumber season was 6 4 in ningxia phosphate triple superphosphate 46 p2o5 and manure fertilizers were applied as base fertilizers before each greenhouse vegetable season nitrogen urea 46 n and potassium potassium sulfate 50 k2o fertilizers were split into base and top dressing applications with hand broadcasting the nitrogen fertilizer ratio of the base and top dressing was 4 6 while the potassium fertilizer ratio of the base and top dressing was 1 1 the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications and each plot was 21 6 m2 in shandong and 23 4 m2 in ningxia with three seedbeds vegetables were transplanted to seedbeds 600 cm 120 cm in shandong 600 cm 130 cm in ningxia with plastic covering vertical movement of soil water caused by irrigation would be an essential condition and also an immediate trigger for n leaching in order to better reflect n leaching status of cultivated lands in the two intensive greenhouse vegetable systems the application amount and time of irrigation were strictly kept uniform for all the treatments and performed in accordance with the local farmers practices which were all furrow irrigations and were typically determined according to soil moisture weather conditions crop growing status etc moreover the other cropping management measures including weeding and insecticide spraying were also maintained consistent with the local farmers practices 2 3 lysimeter installation and leachate collection trial plots were separated from each other by ridges 0 5 m high to prevent cross movement of water and nutrients during irrigation events soil pits used for leaching disk installation were excavated outside each plot to prevent disturbance inside we assumed that there were little possibilities for no 3 n recycling after it had been leached below 90 cm soil depth and even if this leached no 3 n could be partially reused the quantity would be very low due to the downward movement of no 3 n under continuous irrigation therefore the in situ drainable lysimeters were installed at 90 cm depth in september 2007 as described by yang et al 2015 2 4 sample analysis and data calculations the sum of the weight of each picking record is the total yield of vegetables at maturity above ground biomass was measured in each plot partial factor productivity of applied n pfpn was defined as the ratio of yield and

irrigation event had ceased before no leachate was collected the depth to which the irrigation water had leached in each plot was measured and the volume was calculated as well the volume of all of the leachate collected was measured every time and a 100 ml sample was taken and frozen at 20 for further analyses the excess leachate in the lysimeter was emptied in time to avoid disturbing the next

100 cm depth at 20 cm intervals and placed immediately in sealed marked plastic bags then mixed to homogenize the soil sample bulk density bd of soil was measured after drying in an oven at 105 c for 24 h tn contents of soil were determined using the kjeldahl digestion method kdy 9830 china no 3 n concentration of soil samples was measured using fresh samples extracted with 0 01 mol l 1 cacl2 for 30 min and then determined by continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran luebbe germany after filtration residual no 3 n rn of soil was calculated by using eq 11 11 rn kg n ha 1 cn bd d 0 1 where cn is the soil no 3 n concentration mg kg 1 bd is bulk density g cm 3 and d is soil depth cm 2 5 statistical analysis microsoft excel 2013 was used to process the data and construct the graphs data were presented as means standard errors of the three replicates statistical analyses of the data were performed using spss version 19 0 the significant differences for all the data including vegetable yield n uptake anlls anlfs and rn among the different treatments were determined using one way anova with tukey s test for multiple comparisons at p value 0 05 the relationships between irrigation and leaching water tn leaching losses rn n uptake and the relationship between total n application rate and tn leaching losses were determined by pearson correlation analysis using a multiple curve regression model with spss 3 results 3 1 water leaching monitoring results of irrigation and average leaching water of the ck con and rf treatments from january 2008 to december 2013 are shown in fig 1 the annual irrigation and leaching water varied during the monitoring years in the shandong and ningxia experiment sites fig 1a b in shandong the amount of annual irrigation ranged from 1426 to 2919 mm with an average of 2122 mm and a coefficient of variation cv of 27 6 while the amount of annual leaching water average of ck con rf treatments ranged from 257 to 570 mm with an average of 404 mm and a cv of 30 9 accounting for 124 leaching events in ningxia the amount of annual irrigation ranged from 590 to 846 mm with an average of 700 mm and a cv of 14 5 while the amount of annual leaching water ranged from 165 to 235 mm with an average of 195 mm and a cv of 15 which covered 41 leaching events that occurred during the consecutive 6 year monitoring period ningxia presented higher flow factors compared with shandong because of the higher sand content in the soil fig 1c the flow factor of con and rf was 19 5 and 19 6 in shandong while in ningxia it was 25 2 and 25 1 however the monthly irrigation amount varied more in shandong ranging from 0 to 575 mm compared to ningxia where it ranged from 0 to 230 mm and the percentage of monthly leaching water to irrigation ranged from 0 0 to 76 2 with an average of 21 3 and 0 0 to 70 6 with an average 25 5 in shandong and ningxia respectively the flow factors of ck were significantly higher in shandong and ningxia compared with the similar flow factors between con and rf reaching 20 4 and 31 5 in shandong and ningxia respectively furthermore the amount of annual leaching water and irrigation showed a positive linear correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0 93 fig 1d p 0 001 3 2 tn leaching there were noticeable variations in anlls during the 6 year period in shandong and ningxia fig 2 the cv of the anlls under con were 36 and 14 in shandong and ningxia respectively in shandong the anll ranged from 100 0 to 240 3 kg ha 1 with an average of 163 7 4 3 kg ha 1 mean sd for the ck treatment from 192 3 to 508 3 kg ha 1 with an average of 344 8 6 2 kg ha 1 for the con treatment and from 174 0 to 372 4 kg ha 1 with an average of 278 4 8 1 kg ha 1 for the rf treatment in ningxia the anll ranged from 56 1 to 74 9 kg ha 1 with an average of 69 1 7 1 kg ha 1 for the ck treatment from 134 9 to 203 7 kg ha 1 with an average of 170 7 19 5 kg ha 1 for the con treatment and from 106 4 to 175 8 kg ha 1 with an average of 131 1 4 8 kg ha 1 for the rf treatment compared with the con treatment rf significantly decreased tn leaching losses by 19 and 23 in shandong and ningxia respectively anlf defined as the ratio of tn leached to fertilizer n applied in vegetable systems in a year is a quantitative index that explains by what percentage applied fertilizer n will be lost from the plant soil system via tn leaching the anlfs from 2008 to 2013 are shown in fig 2 for the con treatments these were 5 3 3 3 5 2 10 2 8 6 10 7 in shandong and 5 0 5 8 3 8 3 1 4 8 4 7 in ningxia with an average of 7 2 and 4 5 respectively the anlfs of the rf treatments over this period were 5 5 3 0 4 8 7 7 4 7 6 1 in shandong and 5 3 6 0 3 8 2 7 2 1 1 8 in ningxia with an average of 5 3 and 3 6 respectively the anlfs for the rf and con treatments were not significantly different in the short term 2008 2010 p 0 05 but the anlfs of rf were significantly lower than that of the con treatments over the long term 2011 2013 p 0 05 for both shandong and ningxia demonstrating that the downward trend of anlf in the rf treatment became more pronounced year by year in addition positive linear correlations were observed between average annual tn leaching losses and total n application rate including chemical fertilizer n manure n and irrigation n and the amount of irrigation fig 3 a b with a correlation coefficient of 0 8 p 0 05 and 0 9 p 0 001 respectively this implied that the leaching of tn was influenced by the n application and irrigation rates fig 3c illustrates that although there was no significant correlation between the annual n uptake and irrigation p 0 05 the vegetable n uptake increased with the rate of irrigation reaching a maximum with irrigation rates of 1385 mm per year however any extra irrigation beyond this amount would reduce the vegetable n uptake as shown in fig 3d soil annual rn amount did not show any relationship with the amount of irrigation p 0 05 3 3 composition of leaching n and its source this study found that no 3 n is the main form of n in leachates with son also playing a role fig 4 specifically in shandong the percentage of no 3 n accounting for tdn ranged from 75 5 to 84 7 with an average of 81 2 nh 4 n ranged from 1 7 to 4 8 with an average of 3 0 and son ranged from 12 3 to 21 8 with an average of 15 9 fig 4a in ningxia the percentage of no 3 n accounting for tdn ranged from 74 7 to 89 8 with an average of 83 9 nh 4 n ranged from 0 7 to 2 7 with an average of 1 8 son ranged from 9 6 to 23 2 with an average of 14 4 fig 4c the leaching tn mainly originated from the soil water system including soil and irrigation and fertilizer n chemical fertilizer n and manure n the contribution rate was defined as the ratio of soil water n and fertilizer n to tn leaching losses these results indicated that the average contribution rate of the soil water n and fertilizer n to leaching tn was 47 5 and 52 5 under con and 58 8 and 41 2 under rf in shandong fig 4b while the average contribution rate of soil water n and fertilizer n was 40 5 and 59 5 under con and 52 5 and 47 5 under rf in ningxia fig 4d this implied that leaching tn mainly came from fertilizer n at the higher rate of n fertilizer application while it was mainly from soil water n at the lower rate of fertilizer application moreover more fertilizer n was present in the leachates from ningxia compared to shandong for both the rf and con treatments 3 4 rn in the 0 100 cm soil layer the accumulation and distribution of no 3 n in the 0 100 cm soil layer differed significantly among the treatments fig 5 after 6 years rn in 0 20 cm top soil in the con treatment was signficantly higher than that in the rf and ck treatments p 0 05 both for shandong and ningxia it is notable that with the deeper soil layers rn in con treatments reduced from 186 to 76 kg n ha 1 in shandong and only reduced from 112 to 90 kg n ha 1 in ningxia the yearly average rn in each layer increased with the annual n application rate for rf and con fig 5b d illustrates that a higher rate of n fertilizer input resulted in a higher amount of rn within the 0 100 cm soil profile after vegetable harvest rn ranges in shandong were from 22 9 to 258 0 kg n ha 1 with an average of 144 8 10 3 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment from 396 9 to 957 2 kg n ha 1 with an average of 576 6 10 1 kg n ha 1 for the con treatment and from 198 7 to 815 0 kg n ha 1 with an average of 410 1 26 8 kg n ha 1 for the rf treatment while in ningxia rn ranges were from 105 6 to 346 9 kg n ha 1 with an average of 219 5 4 8 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment from 302 2 to 744 9 kg n ha 1 with an average of 480 3 18 8 kg n ha 1for the con treatment and from 198 5 to 398 7 kg n ha 1 with an average of 303 5 12 0 kg n ha 1 for the rf treatment the ratios of rn to applied fertilizer n rate were 23 and 21 in the con treatment and 19 and 18 in the rf treatments in shandong and ningxia respectively 3 5 greenhouse vegetable yields and apparent n budget greenhouse vegetable yields in the n fertilized treatments con and rf were significantly higher than in the ck treatment p 0 05 however no significant difference in vegetable yields was observed between the con and rf treatments whereas the pfpn in rf was significantly higher than in the con treatment both in shandong and ningxia during the monitoring years fig 6 a b this indicated that reducing fertilizer in greenhouse vegetable systems to a certain degree would not decrease the vegetable yields while still increasing pfpn the apparent total budget of n inputs and outputs in the soil vegetable system are calculated and shown in table 3 under con treatment the total n input in shandong and ningxia 3277 and 2284 kg ha 1 greatly exceeded the crop n uptake 616 and 427 kg ha 1 and resulted in a higher n surplus 2661 and 1857 kg ha 1 in contrast with the rf management it was noted that irrigation brought 769 kg n ha 1 accounting for 23 26 of the total n input to the field in shandong compared to only 45 kg n ha 1 in ningxia although n input in the ck treatment is much higher than these figures with an n surplus of 437 kg n ha 1 in shandong the vegetable n uptake was negatively impacted in the ck treatment with vegetable yields being considerably lower than yields from the con and rf treatments this implied that in order to obtain a high yield of vegetables additional n input was required to maximize yields in this study no significant reduction of vegetable n uptake was observed in our 6 year monitoring even with the reduced chemical fertilizer n application rate in the rf treatment 4 discussion 4 1 water inputs and n leaching losses our results indicate that irrigation and n leaching is a coupled process and that leaching water rates linearly increase with rising irrigation levels as no 3 n is highly mobile in soil n leaching occurs when water moves downwards to the deep soil with many studies showing that water is both the carrier and the driving force in this n movement within soils sharma et al 2012 sun et al 2012 gholamhoseini et al 2013 thus excessive irrigation is always an immediate cause of n leaching in greenhouse vegetable systems we found that the anll linearly increased with rising irrigation rates this suggests that n losses will decrease with reduced irrigation rates supporting this conclusion are studies by yu et al 2006 who reported that when water inputs were reduced from 275 mm to 29 mm the average annual no 3 n leaching amount reduced from 301 kg ha 1 to 13 kg ha 1 in an intensively irrigated vegetable field for three consecutive years 1999 2002 and fan et al 2014 who reported that the average annual no 3 n leaching rate was significantly decreased by 13 when water inputs were reduced by 43 compared to conventional flooding irrigation 1020 mm at a solar greenhouse at the shouguang vegetable research station of china from 2008 to 2011 collectively these studies indicate that optimized irrigation management could effectively reduce n leaching and prevent groundwater pollution from greenhouse vegetable fields which is necessary for continued effcient and environmentally benign and therefore socially acceptable intensfied vegetable production higher flow factors were associated with the ck treatment at both sites compared to the other treatments this maybe due to the optimum uptake of nutrients by well growing vegetables in con and rf treatments compared to suboptimal nutrient uptake and vegetable growth rates in the ck treatments under equivalent irrigation regimens zhao et al 2010 reported similar results in an intensively irrigated vegetable production system in central china where more leaching water and lower levels of nutrient uptake were detected under treatments with no fertilizer compared other fertilization treatments with the same irrigation levels water leaching was affected not only by irrigation rates but also by crop growth conditions and the soil hydraulic properties which varied with the different soil textures at each site lower water holding capacities and greater water conductivity properties of sandy or coarse texture soils have been demonstrated to promote water leaching rajput and patel 2006 hu et al 2010 and our results indicated that although the irrigation rates were higher the water flow factor in shandong was lower this was probably due to the higher sand content in the ningxia soil compared to the soil in shandong table 1 while we found no significant correlation between annual n uptake and irrigation rates p 0 05 vegetable n uptake did increase with the rate of irrigation however any extra irrigation beyond a maximum of 1385 mm reduced the vegetable n uptake wang et al 2015 also observed this phenomenon whereby increasing the irrigation rate caused yields to first increase and then decrease based on our data we surmise that the irrigation rate is too high in shandong with an estimated 44 1534 mm water potentially being wasted per annum thereby affecting the vegetables ability to absorb n in ningxia however the irrigation rates are closer to optimal levels through further optimisation may enable the amount of n uptake to be increased 4 2 n application and n leaching losses the higher n input in shandong compared to ningxia led to higher anll 344 8 kg ha 1 cf 170 7 kg ha 1 under conventional fertilization this is likely due to the fact that shandong province has been producing facility vegetables for more than 30 years bellarby et al 2018 on increasingly depleted soils soc 18 8 g kg 1 tn 1 3 g kg 1 which require greater n inputs to maintain yields while the ningxia hui autonomous region is a newly developed vegetable basin facility established more recently in 2005 yang et al 2018 where the soils are still relatively fertile soc 20 7 g kg 1 tn 2 1 g kg 1 long term vegetable production and prolonged excessive n application rates in shandong have allowed n to accumulate in the soil and groundwater thereby increasing the total n available for leaching within that system chen et al 2017 however min et al 2012 and zhao et al 2012 reported similar anll in their short studies on the yixing jiangsu province and yellow river irrigation region of ningxia plain albeit with a little lower tn leaching rates than we observed in shandong and ningxia our study covered twelve seasons of vegetable production in the two study sites over this time demonstrating that anlls decreased by about 19 23 and rn was reduced by 29 37 furthermore positive linear correlations were observed between the anlls and the total n application rates with the amount of n leaching directly related to fertilizer application levels the same conclusion was found by previous studies song et al 2009 zotarelli et al 2009 where guo et al 2010 found that the amount of no3 n leaching was decreased by about 50 when n application rate was decreased from 330 kg ha 1 to 220 kg ha 1 in addition compared with con treatment annual tn leaching factor anlf in rf was not constant and instead expressed a strengthening downward trend year by year in both shandong and ningxia this implies that we should focus on controlling fertilizer inputs in the long term in order to reduce anll instead of relying on conclusions drawn from short term research thus both n inputs and irrigation with groundwater which is also an important source of n leaching in greenhouse vegetable production systems should be considered when estimating the added n rate areas that use groundwater for irrigation we found that the majority of tdn leached as no 3 n 80 this is consistent with previous studies that also showed no 3 n was the predominant form of n in the leachate since the aerobic soil environment favored nitrification gai et al 2016 for instance no 3 n accounted for up to 90 and 70 of the tn leaching rate reported by min et al 2011b and zhao et al 2012 son also plays an important role in contaminating groundwater and accounted for 15 of tdn in our study presumably because a large amount of organic manure was applied at our two sites manure has previously been demonstrated to increase the leaching risk of son in intensively irrigated greenhouse vegetable systems quan et al 2015 if there was no organic manure application no 3 n accounted for up to 98 of the tn leaching rate with only traces of nh 4 n being detected in intensively irrigated vegetable production systems zhao et al 2010 effectively eradicting son from the leachate reducing chemical fertilizer inputs produced no significant difference in vegetable yields and pfpn was increased significantly at both of our study sites these results indicate that significant economic savings could be achieved by optimizing the urea application rates used by local farmers for instance in accordance with our rf treatment regimen a 22 reduction in fertilizer application in shangdong would equate to 344 kg ha 1 less urea applied with a value of 187 million usd and a 28 reduction in fertilizer application in ningxia would equate to 523 kg ha 1 less urea applied with a value of 20 million usd fig 6c these estimates are based on planting areas of vegetables in shandong and ningxia of 1 86 and 0 13 million ha in 2016 respectively nbs 2017 and the current average national urea price in china of 0 29 usd kg 1 https baijiahao baidu com s id 1597624679645773 396 wfr spider for pc accessed 13 april 2018 other studies have found that decreasing traditional n application rates by up to 40 did not affect yield in intensive greenhouse vegetable production systems min et al 2012 indicating that even greater environmental and ecnomic benefits may be possible with optimisation of n fertilizer application for different growing regions this approach would also reduce problems associated with excess n fertilizer accumulation in the soil sebilo et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 which eventually becomes lost from the plant soil system via n leaching heumann et al 2013 5 conclusion reducing fertilizer application in the rf treatment significantly decreased anll without affecting yield we estimate that reducing and optimizing the levels of n inputs in the shandong and ningxia sites in accordance with the rf treatment regime would save 187 million usd for shandong and 20 million usd for ningxia in vegetable production costs and considerably reduce n leaching rates a move towards precision farming methods that routinely monitor the relationships between inputs and yields would have considerable environmental and economic benefits and are worthy of more comprehensive study the downward trend of anlf in the rf treatment which tended to increase year by year implies that we should focus on controlling fertilizer inputs in the long term to reduce anll instead of relying on short term research to draw conclusions no 3 n was the main form 80 of leaching n with son also contributing 15 albeit to a much lesser extent therefore it is advisable to optimise the application of organic manure n leaching directly correlated to both the n application rate and the irrigation rate and was impacted by soil texture indirectly the optimization of n fertilizer and irrigation rates for various soil types and cropping systems perhaps also using soil conditioners or additives could address this problem further studies are required to assess whether and to what extent conventional cultivation practices can be revised to identify optimum levels of irrigation and fertilizer application without yield decline best management practices bmps integrating local agronomic practices should be recommended to the local government to be implemented as a detailed legislative policy acknowledgements this research was

11333,nitrogen n leaching is an important factor that threatens groundwater safety in intensive greenhouse vegetable production regions however managing irrigation and fertilization to reduce nitrate leaching has rarely been carried out in long term experiments in this study n leaching in two typical greenhouse vegetable systems a cucumber cucumber system in shandong and a cucumber tomato system in ningxia from 2008 to 2013 investigated should be studied using a lysimeter monitoring method the total n fertilization rate was 0 to 2508 kg n ha 1 which included three treatments no fertilizer ck 0 kg n ha 1 conventional treatment con shandong 2508 kg n ha 1 and ningxia 2239 kg n ha 1 and reduced fertilizer application rf shandong 2164 kg n ha 1 and ningxia 1716 kg n ha 1 the irrigation amount was 590 2919 mm year 1 according to vegetable water demand the results indicated that the annual total n leaching were 344 8 kg ha 1 192 3 508 3 kg ha 1 in shandong and 170 7 kg ha 1 134 9 203 7 kg ha 1 in ningxia for the con treatments compared with con treatment rf significantly decreased anll while simultaneously maintaining the yield and increasing the downward trend of the annual tn leaching factor anlf year by year meanwhile a concomitant annual cost reductions associated with the rf treatment estimated at 187 million usd for shandong and 20 million usd for ningxia anll increased linearly with the n input p 0 05 more than half of anll came from fertilizer n including chemical and manure fertilizer under con treatments while more than half of anll came from soil and water n under rf treatments the results indicated that mitigation measures for n leaching pollution from greenhouse vegetable fields should consider regulations on irrigation and fertilization keywords greenhouse vegetable field irrigation nitrogen rate nitrogen leaching non point source pollution 1 introduction many regions all over the world are entirely dependent on groundwater resources for various uses siyal et al 2012 adviento borbe et al 2018 nitrate contamination of this groundwater largely caused by agricultural nitrate leaching is a growing problem globally due to population growth and increased food demand zhang et al 2017 and can threaten the health of local populations gu et al 2013 huang et al 2017 severe nitrate contamination of groundwater is mainly associated with greenhouse vegetable cultivation due to high rates of fertilization and irrigation shi et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 vegetable production in relatively simple plastic greenhouses is an essential and rapidly growing industry in different parts of the world chang et al 2011 china in particular has rapidly increased greenhouse vegetable cultivation over the last three decades as it is highly profitable yu et al 2010 by 2010 greenhouses covered approximately 4 67 million hectares in china accounting for 65 of the total economic value of vegetable production and comprising 90 of the greenhouse fields in the world chang et al 2013 to achieve a high level of production the annual average n inputs from chemical fertilizers and manures were 1358 and 1881 kg n ha 1 respectively and even beyond 3000 kg n ha 1 in north china ju et al 2009 yu et al 2010 while the average irrigation rate was 1600 2400 mm per annum for the greenhouse vegetable systems sun et al 2012 generally the total n uptake by vegetables is less than 400 kg n ha 1 thus fertilizer n use efficiency calculated using the subtraction method in those vegetable systems could be less than 10 with conventional management practices zhu et al 2005 excess n fertilizer applied with furrow irrigation to greenhouse vegetable fields results in nutrient accumulation in soils and substantial nitrate leaching thompson et al 2007 wang et al 2016 nitrogen leaching losses from intensive vegetable systems have been identified as a major source of non point source pollution shrestha et al 2010 min and shi 2018 mounting public concern about the negative effects of excessive n fertilization and irrigation and increasing risk of groundwater pollution has now made it imperative to accurately quantify n leaching from agriculture xu et al 2013 delin and stenberg 2014 and to develop practical n management strategies to reduce n leaching without reducing yield min et al 2012 barzegari et al 2017 a number of studies have been conducted to investigate n leaching from croplands song et al 2009 yang et al 2017 but most of them focused on cereal crops observations regarding greenhouse vegetable systems are lacking or are based on short term studies min et al 2012 moreover attention was focused on the concentrations of nitrate and the amount of n leaching losses in the leachate from different fertilizer applications and irrigation sharmasarkar et al 2001 chen et al 2014 there was no systematic analysis to build up the relationships between n leaching losses n fertilizer rate and water input in a long term experiment owing to the synthesized influences of vegetable growing conditions soil properties irrigation and n application a considerable variation of annual n leaching losses exists making it hard to characterize n leaching in cultivated lands merely on the basis of short term experiments min et al 2011a the same conclusion was also drawn by li et al 2007 believing that results obtained from short term experiments were insufficient to explain the variations of nitrogen leaching losses from croplands in an arid or semi arid district there is an urgent need to investigate n leaching trends with different n application and irrigation rates in greenhouse vegetable systems and to provide practical measures to reduce n leaching while maintaining yield in those systems here it was hypothesized that n application rate and water input have a stable relationship with n leaching and that optimised n and water application rates could lead to less n leaching and consistent yields in this study we chose two typical greenhouse vegetable planting areas that are experiencing rapid growth and development one located in shandong province in which greenhouse vegetables are maintained with higher n fertilizer application 2508 kg n ha 1 and irrigation rates ranging from 1426 to 2919 mm while the second is located in the ningxia hui autonomous region in which n fertilizer application 2239 kg n ha 1 and irrigation rates ranging from 590 to 846 mm are lower six year 2008 2013 field experiments were conducted under different irrigation and fertilizer regimens to determine n leaching losses using pvc lysimeters the specific objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the leached water and the amount of total n tn nitrate n no 3 n ammonium n nh 4 n and soil organic nitrogen son in the leachate 2 to define the relationships between irrigation i and leachate l and between total n application rate and n leaching losses and 3 to decrease n leaching losses by adjusting the traditional n rates to an optimum level without yield losses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted in two greenhouse vegetable production areas located in northern china the daotian town shouguang city shandong province 36 8 n 118 9 e with a system of cucumber cucumber and the xingqing district yinchuan city ningxia province 38 4 n 106 4 e with a system of tomato cucumber shandong has an average altitude of 23 m and a typical warm temperate monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 593 8 mm and annual temperature of 12 7 the experimental soil was classified as cinnamon soils with sandy loam texture the first quarter of the cucumber growing season was from late january to mid july with variety century star 08 the second quarter of the cucumber growing period was from early august to late december with variety 787 the planting density of cucumber was 48 000 plants per hectare ningxia has an average altitude of 1100 m and a typical continental monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 233 0 mm and annual temperature of 9 the experimental soil was classified as irrigation silting soils with sandy soil the tomato growing season was from early january to mid june with variety maria while the cucumber growing period was from early august to late december with variety del 99 the planting density of tomato and cucumber was 45 000 and 48 000 plants per hectare respectively the experiments were established in 2008 with the baseline soil physical and chemical properties at the start of the experiment listed in table 1 2 2 experiment design the field experiments with three treatments no fertilizer ck conventional fertilization con and reduced fertilizer application rf were carried out in the two greenhouse vegetable systems from january 2008 to december 2013 fertilizer application rates in the con treatment were established after discussions with local farmers and based on this the total chemical fertilizer n application rate for the rf treatment was reduced from the con rates by 22 in shandong and 28 and in ningxia additionally con and rf treatments were supplemented with an equivalent n application of 44 563 kg ha 1 chicken manure in shandong and 36 200 kg ha 1 chicken manure in ningxia with average total n p2o5 and k2o content of 2 06 2 09 1 99 and 1 00 1 32 1 88 in shandong and ningxia respectively the fertilization rates for treatments are summarized in table 2 the fertilizer ratio for the first and second season was 1 1 in shandong while the fertilizer ratio for the tomato and cucumber season was 6 4 in ningxia phosphate triple superphosphate 46 p2o5 and manure fertilizers were applied as base fertilizers before each greenhouse vegetable season nitrogen urea 46 n and potassium potassium sulfate 50 k2o fertilizers were split into base and top dressing applications with hand broadcasting the nitrogen fertilizer ratio of the base and top dressing was 4 6 while the potassium fertilizer ratio of the base and top dressing was 1 1 the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications and each plot was 21 6 m2 in shandong and 23 4 m2 in ningxia with three seedbeds vegetables were transplanted to seedbeds 600 cm 120 cm in shandong 600 cm 130 cm in ningxia with plastic covering vertical movement of soil water caused by irrigation would be an essential condition and also an immediate trigger for n leaching in order to better reflect n leaching status of cultivated lands in the two intensive greenhouse vegetable systems the application amount and time of irrigation were strictly kept uniform for all the treatments and performed in accordance with the local farmers practices which were all furrow irrigations and were typically determined according to soil moisture weather conditions crop growing status etc moreover the other cropping management measures including weeding and insecticide spraying were also maintained consistent with the local farmers practices 2 3 lysimeter installation and leachate collection trial plots were separated from each other by ridges 0 5 m high to prevent cross movement of water and nutrients during irrigation events soil pits used for leaching disk installation were excavated outside each plot to prevent disturbance inside we assumed that there were little possibilities for no 3 n recycling after it had been leached below 90 cm soil depth and even if this leached no 3 n could be partially reused the quantity would be very low due to the downward movement of no 3 n under continuous irrigation therefore the in situ drainable lysimeters were installed at 90 cm depth in september 2007 as described by yang et al 2015 2 4 sample analysis and data calculations the sum of the weight of each picking record is the total yield of vegetables at maturity above ground biomass was measured in each plot partial factor productivity of applied n pfpn was defined as the ratio of yield and total fertilizer n rate and was calculated using the following eq 1 yang et al 2017 1 pfpn kg kg ty 1000 fn where ty is the total vegetable yield t ha 1 fn is the sum of chemical fertilizer n and manure n kg n ha 1 the water volumes were recorded before irrigation leachate if any was collected in each lysimeter for 1 2 days after each irrigation event until the n leaching associated with that irrigation event had ceased before no leachate was collected the depth to which the irrigation water had leached in each plot was measured and the volume was calculated as well the volume of all of the leachate collected was measured every time and a 100 ml sample was taken and frozen at 20 for further analyses the excess leachate in the lysimeter was emptied in time to avoid disturbing the next

leaching water tn leaching losses rn n uptake and the relationship between total n application rate and tn leaching losses were determined by pearson correlation analysis using a multiple curve regression model with spss 3 results 3 1 water leaching monitoring results of irrigation and average leaching water of the ck con and rf treatments from january 2008 to december 2013 are shown in fig 1 the annual irrigation and leaching water varied during the monitoring years in the shandong and ningxia experiment sites fig 1a b in shandong the amount of annual irrigation ranged from 1426 to 2919 mm with an average of 2122 mm and a coefficient of variation cv of 27 6 while the amount of annual leaching water average of ck con rf treatments ranged from 257 to 570 mm with an average of 404 mm and a cv of 30 9 accounting for 124 leaching events in ningxia the amount of annual irrigation ranged from 590 to 846 mm with an average of 700 mm and a cv of 14 5 while the amount of annual leaching water ranged from 165 to 235 mm with an average of 195 mm and a cv of 15 which covered 41 leaching events that occurred during the consecutive 6 year monitoring period ningxia presented higher flow factors compared with shandong because of the higher sand content in the soil fig 1c the flow factor of con and rf was 19 5 and 19 6 in shandong while in ningxia it was 25 2 and 25 1 however the monthly irrigation amount varied more in shandong ranging from 0 to 575 mm compared to ningxia where it ranged from 0 to 230 mm and the percentage of monthly leaching water to irrigation ranged from 0 0 to 76 2 with an average of 21 3 and 0 0 to 70 6 with an average 25 5 in shandong and ningxia respectively the flow factors of ck were significantly higher in shandong and ningxia compared with the similar flow factors between con and rf reaching 20 4 and 31 5 in shandong and ningxia respectively furthermore the amount of annual leaching water and irrigation showed a positive linear correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0 93 fig 1d p 0 001 3 2 tn leaching there were noticeable variations in anlls during the 6 year period in shandong and ningxia fig 2 the cv of the anlls under con were 36 and 14 in shandong and ningxia respectively in shandong the anll ranged from 100 0 to 240 3 kg ha 1 with an average of 163 7 4 3 kg ha 1 mean sd for the ck treatment from 192 3 to 508 3 kg ha 1 with an average of 344 8 6 2 kg ha 1 for the con treatment and from 174 0 to 372 4 kg ha 1 with an average of 278 4 8 1 kg ha 1 for the rf treatment in ningxia the anll ranged from 56 1 to 74 9 kg ha 1 with an average of 69 1 7 1 kg ha 1 for the ck treatment from 134 9 to 203 7 kg ha 1 with an average of 170 7 19 5 kg ha 1 for the con treatment and from 106 4 to 175 8 kg ha 1 with an average of 131 1 4 8 kg ha 1 for the rf treatment compared with the con treatment rf significantly decreased tn leaching losses by 19 and 23 in shandong and ningxia respectively anlf defined as the ratio of tn leached to fertilizer n applied in vegetable systems in a year is a quantitative index that explains by what percentage applied fertilizer n will be lost from the plant soil system via tn leaching the anlfs from 2008 to 2013 are shown in fig 2 for the con treatments these were 5 3 3 3 5 2 10 2 8 6 10 7 in shandong and 5 0 5 8 3 8 3 1 4 8 4 7 in ningxia with an average of 7 2 and 4 5 respectively the anlfs of the rf treatments over this period were 5 5 3 0 4 8 7 7 4 7 6 1 in shandong and 5 3 6 0 3 8 2 7 2 1 1 8 in ningxia with an average of 5 3 and 3 6 respectively the anlfs for the rf and con treatments were not significantly different in the short term 2008 2010 p 0 05 but the anlfs of rf were significantly lower than that of the con treatments over the long term 2011 2013 p 0 05 for both shandong and ningxia demonstrating that the downward trend of anlf in the rf treatment became more pronounced year by year in addition positive linear correlations were observed between average annual tn leaching losses and total n application rate including chemical fertilizer n manure n and irrigation n and the amount of irrigation fig 3 a b with a correlation coefficient of 0 8 p 0 05 and 0 9 p 0 001 respectively this implied that the leaching of tn was influenced by the n application and irrigation rates fig 3c illustrates that although there was no significant correlation between the annual n uptake and irrigation p 0 05 the vegetable n uptake increased with the rate of irrigation reaching a maximum with irrigation rates of 1385 mm per year however any extra irrigation beyond this amount would reduce the vegetable n uptake as shown in fig 3d soil annual rn amount did not show any relationship with the amount of irrigation p 0 05 3 3 composition of leaching n and its source this study found that no 3 n is the main form of n in leachates with son also playing a role fig 4 specifically in shandong the percentage of no 3 n accounting for tdn ranged from 75 5 to 84 7 with an average of 81 2 nh 4 n ranged from 1 7 to 4 8 with an average of 3 0 and son ranged from 12 3 to 21 8 with an average of 15 9 fig 4a in ningxia the percentage of no 3 n accounting for tdn ranged from 74 7 to 89 8 with an average of 83 9 nh 4 n ranged from 0 7 to 2 7 with an average of 1 8 son ranged from 9 6 to 23 2 with an average of 14 4 fig 4c the leaching tn mainly originated from the soil water system including soil and irrigation and fertilizer n chemical fertilizer n and manure n the contribution rate was defined as the ratio of soil water n and fertilizer n to tn leaching losses these results indicated that the average contribution rate of the soil water n and fertilizer n to leaching tn was 47 5 and 52 5 under con and 58 8 and 41 2 under rf in shandong fig 4b while the average contribution rate of soil water n and fertilizer n was 40 5 and 59 5 under con and 52 5 and 47 5 under rf in ningxia fig 4d this implied that leaching tn mainly came from fertilizer n at the higher rate of n fertilizer application while it was mainly from soil water n at the lower rate of fertilizer application moreover more fertilizer n was present in the leachates from ningxia compared to shandong for both the rf and con treatments 3 4 rn in the 0 100 cm soil layer the accumulation and distribution of no 3 n in the 0 100 cm soil layer differed significantly among the treatments fig 5 after 6 years rn in 0 20 cm top soil in the con treatment was signficantly higher than that in the rf and ck treatments p 0 05 both for shandong and ningxia it is notable that with the deeper soil layers rn in con treatments reduced from 186 to 76 kg n ha 1 in shandong and only reduced from 112 to 90 kg n ha 1 in ningxia the yearly average rn in each layer increased with the annual n application rate for rf and con fig 5b d illustrates that a higher rate of n fertilizer input resulted in a higher amount of rn within the 0 100 cm soil profile after vegetable harvest rn ranges in shandong were from 22 9 to 258 0 kg n ha 1 with an average of 144 8 10 3 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment from 396 9 to 957 2 kg n ha 1 with an average of 576 6 10 1 kg n ha 1 for the con treatment and from 198 7 to 815 0 kg n ha 1 with an average of 410 1 26 8 kg n ha 1 for the rf treatment while in ningxia rn ranges were from 105 6 to 346 9 kg n ha 1 with an average of 219 5 4 8 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment from 302 2 to 744 9 kg n ha 1 with an average of 480 3 18 8 kg n ha 1for the con treatment and from 198 5 to 398 7 kg n ha 1 with an average of 303 5 12 0 kg n ha 1 for the rf treatment the ratios of rn to applied fertilizer n rate were 23 and 21 in the con treatment and 19 and 18 in the rf treatments in shandong and ningxia respectively 3 5 greenhouse vegetable yields and apparent n budget greenhouse vegetable yields in the n fertilized treatments con and rf were significantly higher than in the ck treatment p 0 05 however no significant difference in vegetable yields was observed between the con and rf treatments whereas the pfpn in rf was significantly higher than in the con treatment both in shandong and ningxia during the monitoring years fig 6 a b this indicated that reducing fertilizer in greenhouse vegetable systems to a certain degree would not decrease the vegetable yields while still increasing pfpn the apparent total budget of n inputs and outputs in the soil vegetable system are calculated and shown in table 3 under con treatment the total n input in shandong and ningxia 3277 and 2284 kg ha 1 greatly exceeded the crop n uptake 616 and 427 kg ha 1 and resulted in a higher n surplus 2661 and 1857 kg ha 1 in contrast with the rf management it was noted that irrigation brought 769 kg n ha 1 accounting for 23 26 of the total n input to the field in shandong compared to only 45 kg n ha 1 in ningxia although n input in the ck treatment is much higher than these figures with an n surplus of 437 kg n ha 1 in shandong the vegetable n uptake was negatively impacted in the ck treatment with vegetable yields being considerably lower than yields from the con and rf treatments this implied that in order to obtain a high yield of vegetables additional n input was required to maximize yields in this study no significant reduction of vegetable n uptake was observed in our 6 year monitoring even with the reduced chemical fertilizer n application rate in the rf treatment 4 discussion 4 1 water inputs and n leaching losses our results indicate that irrigation and n leaching is a coupled process and that leaching water rates linearly increase with rising irrigation levels as no 3 n is highly mobile in soil n leaching occurs when water moves downwards to the deep soil with many studies showing that water is both the carrier and the driving force in this n movement within soils sharma et al 2012 sun et al 2012 gholamhoseini et al 2013 thus excessive irrigation is always an immediate cause of n leaching in greenhouse vegetable systems we found that the anll linearly increased with rising irrigation rates this suggests that n losses will decrease with reduced irrigation rates supporting this conclusion are studies by yu et al 2006 who reported that when water inputs were reduced from 275 mm to 29 mm the average annual no 3 n leaching amount reduced from 301 kg ha 1 to 13 kg ha 1 in an intensively irrigated vegetable field for three consecutive years 1999 2002 and fan et al 2014 who reported that the average annual no 3 n leaching rate was significantly decreased by 13 when water inputs were reduced by 43 compared to conventional flooding irrigation 1020 mm at a solar greenhouse at the shouguang vegetable research station of china from 2008 to 2011 collectively these studies indicate that optimized irrigation management could effectively reduce n leaching and prevent groundwater pollution from greenhouse vegetable fields which is necessary for continued effcient and environmentally benign and therefore socially acceptable intensfied vegetable production higher flow factors were associated with the ck treatment at both sites compared to the other treatments this maybe due to the optimum uptake of nutrients by well growing vegetables in con and rf treatments compared to suboptimal nutrient uptake and vegetable growth rates in the ck treatments under equivalent irrigation regimens zhao et al 2010 reported similar results in an intensively irrigated vegetable production system in central china where more leaching water and lower levels of nutrient uptake were detected under treatments with no fertilizer compared other fertilization treatments with the same irrigation levels water leaching was affected not only by irrigation rates but also by crop growth conditions and the soil hydraulic properties which varied with the different soil textures at each site lower water holding capacities and greater water conductivity properties of sandy or coarse texture soils have been demonstrated to promote water leaching rajput and patel 2006 hu et al 2010 and our results indicated that although the irrigation rates were higher the water flow factor in shandong was lower this was probably due to the higher sand content in the ningxia soil compared to the soil in shandong table 1 while we found no significant correlation between annual n uptake and irrigation rates p 0 05 vegetable n uptake did increase with the rate of irrigation however any extra irrigation beyond a maximum of 1385 mm reduced the vegetable n uptake wang et al 2015 also observed this phenomenon whereby increasing the irrigation rate caused yields to first increase and then decrease based on our data we surmise that the irrigation rate is too high in shandong with an estimated 44 1534 mm water potentially being wasted per annum thereby affecting the vegetables ability to absorb n in ningxia however the irrigation rates are closer to optimal levels through further optimisation may enable the amount of n uptake to be increased 4 2 n application and n leaching losses the higher n input in shandong compared to ningxia led to higher anll 344 8 kg ha 1 cf 170 7 kg ha 1 under conventional fertilization this is likely due to the fact that shandong province has been producing facility vegetables for more than 30 years bellarby et al 2018 on increasingly depleted soils soc 18 8 g kg 1 tn 1 3 g kg 1 which require greater n inputs to maintain yields while the ningxia hui autonomous region is a newly developed vegetable basin facility established more recently in 2005 yang et al 2018 where the soils are still relatively fertile soc 20 7 g kg 1 tn 2 1 g kg 1 long term vegetable production and prolonged excessive n application rates in shandong have allowed n to accumulate in the soil and groundwater thereby increasing the total n available for leaching within that system chen et al 2017 however min et al 2012 and zhao et al 2012 reported similar anll in their short studies on the yixing jiangsu province and yellow river irrigation region of ningxia plain albeit with a little lower tn leaching rates than we observed in shandong and ningxia our study covered twelve seasons of vegetable production in the two study sites over this time demonstrating that anlls decreased by about 19 23 and rn was reduced by 29 37 furthermore positive linear correlations were observed between the anlls and the total n application rates with the amount of n leaching directly related to fertilizer application levels the same conclusion was found by previous studies song et al 2009 zotarelli et al 2009 where guo et al 2010 found that the amount of no3 n leaching was decreased by about 50 when n application rate was decreased from 330 kg ha 1 to 220 kg ha 1 in addition compared with con treatment annual tn leaching factor anlf in rf was not constant and instead expressed a strengthening downward trend year by year in both shandong and ningxia this implies that we should focus on controlling fertilizer inputs in the long term in order to reduce anll instead of relying on conclusions drawn from short term research thus both n inputs and irrigation with groundwater which is also an important source of n leaching in greenhouse vegetable production systems should be considered when estimating the added n rate areas that use groundwater for irrigation we found that the majority of tdn leached as no 3 n 80 this is consistent with previous studies that also showed no 3 n was the predominant form of n in the leachate since the aerobic soil environment favored nitrification gai et al 2016 for instance no 3 n accounted for up to 90 and 70 of the tn leaching rate reported by min et al 2011b and zhao et al 2012 son also plays an important role in contaminating groundwater and accounted for 15 of tdn in our study presumably because a large amount of organic manure was applied at our two sites manure has previously been demonstrated to increase the leaching risk of son in intensively irrigated greenhouse vegetable systems quan et al 2015 if there was no organic manure application no 3 n accounted for up to 98 of the tn leaching rate with only traces of nh 4 n being detected in intensively irrigated vegetable production systems zhao et al 2010 effectively eradicting son from the leachate reducing chemical fertilizer inputs produced no significant difference in vegetable yields and pfpn was increased significantly at both of our study sites these results indicate that significant economic savings could be achieved by optimizing the urea application rates used by local farmers for instance in accordance with our rf treatment regimen a 22 reduction in fertilizer application in shangdong would equate to 344 kg ha 1 less urea applied with a value of 187 million usd and a 28 reduction in fertilizer application in ningxia would equate to 523 kg ha 1 less urea applied with a value of 20 million usd fig 6c these estimates are based on planting areas of vegetables in shandong and ningxia of 1 86 and 0 13 million ha in 2016 respectively nbs 2017 and the current average national urea price in china of 0 29 usd kg 1 https baijiahao baidu com s id 1597624679645773 396 wfr spider for pc accessed 13 april 2018 other studies have found that decreasing traditional n application rates by up to 40 did not affect yield in intensive greenhouse vegetable production systems min et al 2012 indicating that even greater environmental and ecnomic benefits may be possible with optimisation of n fertilizer application for different growing regions this approach would also reduce problems associated with excess n fertilizer accumulation in the soil sebilo et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 which eventually becomes lost from the plant soil system via n leaching heumann et al 2013 5 conclusion reducing fertilizer application in the rf treatment significantly decreased anll without affecting yield we estimate that reducing and optimizing the levels of n inputs in the shandong and ningxia sites in accordance with the rf treatment regime would save 187 million usd for shandong and 20 million usd for ningxia in vegetable production costs and considerably reduce n leaching rates a move towards precision farming methods that routinely monitor the relationships between inputs and yields would have considerable environmental and economic benefits and are worthy of more comprehensive study the downward trend of anlf in the rf treatment which tended to increase year by year implies that we should focus on controlling fertilizer inputs in the long term to reduce anll instead of relying on short term research to draw conclusions no 3 n was the main form 80 of leaching n with son also contributing 15 albeit to a much lesser extent therefore it is advisable to optimise the application of organic manure n leaching directly correlated to both the n application rate and the irrigation rate and was impacted by soil texture indirectly the optimization of n fertilizer and irrigation rates for various soil types and cropping systems perhaps also using soil conditioners or additives could address this problem further studies are required to assess whether and to what extent conventional cultivation practices can be revised to identify optimum levels of irrigation and fertilizer application without yield decline best management practices bmps integrating local agronomic practices should be recommended to the local government to be implemented as a detailed legislative policy acknowledgements this research was

cf ii intermittent irrigation and withdrawal at flowering until soil moisture reached field capacity iwf 100fc and iii intermittent irrigation and withdrawal at flowering until soil moisture reached 80 of the field capacity iwf 80fc the application of azolla compost at 2 5 5 0 or 7 5 of soil weight w w resulted in a higher tiller number by 16 0 37 8 and 38 9 respectively in the first year and by 18 5 27 8 and 30 2 respectively in the second year compared with the non amended control moreover the application of azolla compost at 2 5 5 0 or 7 5 of soil weight w w resulted in higher spike weight by an average over irrigation regimes of 8 6 20 8 and 21 1 respectively in the first year and 34 7 50 4 and 52 5 respectively in the second year compared with the non amended control the application of azolla compost at 5 0 of soil weight provided the highest grain yield which was on average 13 8 higher than that of the non amended control the increase of grain yield might be due to efficient absorption of nitrogen and possibly of other nutrients with azolla which promoted production and translocation of assimilates from source to sink overall azolla compost can be regarded as a desirable managerial practice in rice production particularly under water deficit conditions considering the agronomic benefits and water saving azolla compost could contribute to the development of low input cropping systems for rice production keywords azolla compost irrigation regime organic fertilizer soil amendment 1 introduction in rice production farmers often apply more nitrogen n fertilizers than

on rice growth and yield under conventional production systems azolla is an aquatic fern that is usually found in paddy water streams and pools in symbiosis with anabaena azollae alga the importance of azolla for paddy fields was first discovered in northern vietnam and then it was recognized in the us indonesia japan the philippines and china subba rao 1988 previous research reported that the integration of azolla compost with chemical fertilizer improved yield of rice and the combined application of inorganic and organic source contributed to the n economy of rice fields nayak et al 2004 singh et al 2005 azolla has spread in rice farms basins and lagoons of guilan province in recent years to an extent that has turned into a problem for aquatic ecosystems instead of being useful to paddy fields it is regarded as a pest or weed for local ecosystems whereas many countries have worked on the use of azolla as a biological or organic fertilizer in paddy fields due to its favorable impact on crop growth enhancement lumpkin and plucknett 1980 this aquatic fern is used as a basis of green manure and decomposed organic material widely known as compost bordoloi et al 2007 and as a biofertilizer for rice in several asian countries cheng et al 2010 there is limited information on the use of azolla compost as a soil amendment in rice production systems a previous study showed maximum grain yields of rice with combined application of 80 kg ha n and 5 tonnes ha of azolla compost nasrollah zadeh et al 2011 furthermore the dry biomass and height of upland kangkong ipomoea aquatica forsk plants were not affected by the type of fertilization i e azolla compost vs inorganic fertilization in urea form on the basis of the above findings the azolla compost was considered beneficial as an alternative for the urea fertilizer jumadi et al 2014 however the above studies were conducted under a single irrigation regime the effect of azolla compost on rice growth under different irrigation regimes has not been assessed therefore more information is needed to validate the effect of azolla compost on rice and its superiority as a soil amendment over different water management practices thus the objective of this study was to examine the impact of azolla compost on rice growth and yield under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a factorial pot experiment established in a completely randomized design was conducted in rice research institute of iran rasht iran for two growing seasons 2010 and 2011 under a temperate mediterranean type climate the experiment was established in plastic pots with 25 cm diameter and 40 cm height each one filled with 5 kg of soil before the initiation of the experiment in each growing season the soil was sampled to determine moisture content and dry weight for using it to fill in the pots and a soil sample was sent to the laboratory for determining n phosphorus p potassium k organic matter om ph and texture the soil analysis included standard procedures of soil testing such the walkley and black method for om determination the kjeldahl method for n determination the spectrophotometric determination for p and k and the titration method for ca additionally the field capacity fc of the soil was determined with a time domain reflectometry tdr sensor soil analysis revealed a clay texture soil properties are summarized in table 1 the soil was a typical clay with almost neutral ph moderate levels of om good retaining capacity of water and good preventing capacity of fertilizers draining away into the subsoil at first azolla compost a commercial unbranded product was added and mixed with the soil of each pot in each growing season pots with non amended soil no azolla application were used as control a sample of the azolla compost was sent to the laboratory for determining n p k om ph and cation exchange capacity the analysis of the compost included standard procedures of soil testing as described above analysis of the applied azolla compost indicated high om adequate total n p and k concentrations for supporting rice growth as well as a high cation exchange capacity table 1 at this stage the recommended rates of p k and half of n fertilizers for rice growing in the area were mixed and integrated with the soil as a basal fertilization n p and k were derived from urea 120 kg ha triple superphosphate 100 kg ha and potassium phosphate 100 kg ha respectively the fertilization rates were selected with the objective to study the effect of azolla compost on common fertilization practices for rice growing in the area the soil was then poured into pots up to 5 cm from the edge the pots were flooded and three 25 days old seedlings of the rice cv hashemi were transplanted in each pot planting was on april 27 in both years the cv hashemi is an indica rice variety with high cooking quality growing in northern iran where most people consume it the remaining half amount of the n fertilizer was applied on the soil surface at the stage of maximum tillering of plants 2 2 azolla treatments and irrigation regimes three levels of irrigation by four levels of azolla compost application were examined in the study each combined treatment was replicated three times the three levels of irrigation were cf continuous flooding during the growth period which was considered as control iwf 100fc intermittent irrigation to soil saturation during the growth period and irrigation withdrawal at flowering until soil moisture reached fc and iwf 80fc intermittent irrigation to soil saturation during the growth period and irrigation withdrawal at flowering until soil moisture reached 80 of fc the four levels of azolla compost application were 0 control 2 5 5 0 and 7 5 of soil weight the azolla rates were selected based on previous literature for other crops khomami and padasht dehkaei 2010 torkashvand et al 2014 2 3 measurements and data collection soil moisture was measured on a daily basis with a time domain reflectrometry tdr sensor and as soon as the soil moisture reached the pre determined level the pots were irrigated as per treatment for more precise control of tdr the soil was simultaneously sampled and its moisture content was determined 24 h later in conventional irrigation treatments the irrigation was carried out as soon as water depth was starting to disappear from the soil surface water depth on the soil surface varied from 0 5 to 4 cm depending on the treatment the amount of irrigation water in pots was read and recorded by a graduated cylinder the irrigation interval varied with treatment rice plants grew normally throughout the growing season at the end of the growing season about mid september data for basic morphological parameters of rice yield components and grain yield were determined after sampling all plants of each pot the proportion of filled grains was measured as the number of filled grains specific gravity 1 06 g ml to the total number of spikelets grain yield was determined in each pot adjusted to 14 moisture the experiment was repeated in an identical way in the next growing season using fresh soil from a different field point to fill the pots 2 4 data analysis all data were subjected to a combined over year analysis of variance anova following a three by four factorial approach three irrigation levels by four azolla compost applications the analysis was performed with the statistical package for social sciences spss because there was a significant triple interaction year by irrigation by azolla application in most variables data were analyzed separately for each year and are also presented separately for each year differences between treatments were compared with the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 3 results there was a significant interaction of treatments with years given that irrigation was the exactly the same in both years this interaction was attributed to the higher mean air temperature 25 3 vs 24 0 c and the higher mean sunshine hours 5 76 vs 5 54 h in the first than in the second growing season accompanied by higher mean sunshine hours at maturity in the second growing season 5 00 vs 5 20 h averaged over irrigation regimes the application of azolla compost resulted in greater tiller production of rice plants compared with control no azolla application in both years fig 1 the application of azolla compost at 2 5 5 0 or 7 5 of soil weight resulted in higher tiller number by 16 0 37 8 and 38 9 respectively in the first year and 18 5 27 8 and 30 2 respectively in the second year in both years the effect of azolla compost on tiller production was more evident in iwf 80fc compared with cf with reference to plant height this trait was not affected significantly by azolla compost application albeit a significant increase in plant height in iwf 80fc in the second year compared with cf fig 2 averaged over irrigation regimes the application of azolla compost resulted in greater spike number of rice plants compared with control no azolla application in both years fig 3 the application of azolla compost at 2 5 5 0 or 7 5 of soil weight resulted in higher spike number by 3 1 to 8 5 fig 3 the effect was more evident in iwf 80fc in the second year compared with cf nevertheless spike length was not affected significantly by azolla compost application and was greater in iwf 100fc than cf in both years fig 4 averaged over irrigation regimes spike weight was increased with azolla compost application from 8 6 to 21 1 in the first year and 34 7 to 52 5 in the second year compared with the non amended control fig 5 the effect was more pronounced in the iwf 100fc compared with cf the percentage of filled grains was not affected significantly by azolla application or irrigation regime in any year fig 6 in both years the application of azolla compost at the rate of 5 0 of soil weight provided the highest gain yield which was on average higher by 13 9 that the non amended control no azolla application fig 7 further increase of azolla compost rate did not have a significant effect on grain yield in the first year but showed a slight increase in grain yield in the second year averaged over azolla compost rates there was a slight decrease in grain yield in iwf 80fc in the second year compared with cf the maximum grain yield was observed with 5 0 azolla compost in iwf 100fc 4 discussion this study examined the impact of azolla compost on rice growth and yield under different irrigation regimes basic morphological parameters of rice plants yield components and grain yield were determined the application of azolla compost resulted in greater tiller production of rice plants compared with control no azolla application in both years the number of effective tillers is a very important morpho physiological trait of rice ying et al 2013 which normally increases with increasing n rate prasertsak and fukai 2014 pirmoradian et al 2004 the high tillering capacity is a desirable trait in rice production given that tiller number per plant is closely related to the panicles number miller et al 1991 to some extent the yield potential of a rice variety may be characterized by tillering capacity wu et al 1998 moreover grain yield of rice plant highly relies on the number of spike bearing tillers produced by each plant filled grains and grain weight maske et al 1997 in the present study the increase of grain yield with azolla compost might be due to efficient absorption of n and possibly of other nutrients which promoted production and translocation of assimilates from source to sink resulting in high spike weight and thus in high grain yield azolla biofertilizer treatments improved n use efficiency in rice attributed to reduced n loss and enhanced n uptake by rice plants yao et al 2018 adequate n availability maintains the green leaf area after spiking paving the way for active photosynthesis and grain production yoshida 2009 it should be noted that control plants without azolla did not show any visible symptoms of inadequate n availability in the present study on the other hand the height of rice plants was not affected significantly by the application of azolla compost this specific response is beneficial considering that excessive n fertilizer rates cause poor lodging resistance in rice zhang et al 2016 and lodging in rice production often limits grain yield and quality by breaking or bending stems given the substantial differences in n addition from the control to the level of 7 5 azolla compost addition the n addition might be considered excessive but probably the slow n mineralization in the different azolla levels made this extra n not excessive to be detrimental also the percentage of filled grains was not affected significantly by the application of azolla compost in this study despite the fact that excess n can reduce the percentage of filled grains in rice williams 2010 concerning water management findings support that rice does not need to be continuously submerged to produce high yields when adequate water is provided at critical growth stages as also found in previous studies mishra and salokhe 2010 pascual and wang 2016 zhang et al 2016 when the irrigation water suffices to keep soil surface wet the highest rice yield can be realized in addition to saving on water use a controlled soil drying or a moderate soil drying so that the plant can rehydrate overnight and photosynthesis is not severely inhibited during the mid and late grain filling stages can greatly promote whole plant senescence triggering assimilate remobilization yang and zhang 2010 therefore the gain from a better use of pre stored assimilates outweighs the possible loss due to a shortened grain filling period leading to an increased grain filling rate and increased grain yield yang and zhang 2006 in this study the decrease in the applied water did not reduce the grain yield of rice so that grain yield showed a constant or ascending response to the reduction of irrigation in total the insignificant variation of yield can be related to adequate water supply by all irrigation regimes i e none of the irrigation regimes stressed the plants and therefore the yield was not affected similar results have been reported by bouman and tuong 2001 tabbal et al 2002 and belder et al 2004 excessive water use in rice cultivation not only lowers water productivity but also increases no3 n leaching causing environmental pollution by contaminating ground and surface water resources thakur et al 2015 drought may not result in yield loss in all climates and in all soils sometimes drying paddy soil to as high as 80 of saturation moisture does not reduce yield and even improves the quality and marketability of the grains there are a lot of reports about zero or a little decrease in yield in exchange for a considerable saving on irrigation water under the application of optimum irrigation interval mohammad et al 1995 abu and malgwi 2011 kima et al 2014 pascual and wang 2016 grain yields at different treatments revealed that the use of azolla compost at the rate of 5 0 of soil weight can increase rice grain yield the negative response of rice in terms of grain yield with azolla compost at 7 5 of soil weight could be the result of increased number of unproductive tillers that shaded the productive tillers and reduced grain production as also confirmed by the lower spike weight particularly in the treatment iwf 80fc compared with iwf 100fc by contrast this effect did not appear in the treatment iwf 100fc compost influences plant growth and biological yield desirably and increases om thereby improving the availability of nutrients gupta and potalia 1990 previous studies showed that compost application had a positive impact on grain yield of rice arshad et al 2004 rizwan et al 2007 bi et al 2009 compost consists of fractions of organic c and n that can increase soil fertility warman 2005 diacono and montemurro 2010 vano et al 2011 also activating enzymes function and microbial soil biomass zaman et al 2002 ros et al 2006 therefore azolla compost can provoke soil microbes activity thereby increasing nutrient recycling in the soil gupta and potalia 1990 found that compost impacted plant growth and yield positively and improved om in the soil and that the physicochemical and biological properties of compost caused the nutrients to become more available enhancing rice grain yield evidently since the particles of om have high water absorption potential compost improved soil water retention potential moreover compost modified soil physical properties including soil bulk density structure porosity and pore size morachany et al 2009 however these effects are largely dependent on the kind and the rate of compost used the extent of organic matter improvement with compost addition and the time required for this improvement data of this study showed that azolla compost could contribute to reaching an environmentally friendly cropping system in rice production it could help cope with the yield loss induced by the lack or deficiency of some nutrients acting as a source for storage of nutrients and water in soil these are significant features that cannot be added to soil by chemical fertilizers compost has a lot of advantages over raw unrotted organic matter and common chemical fertilizers because its content materials are gradually delivered to the plants and it can keep its reserves for a long time it should be noted however that replacing chemical fertilizers with azolla compost was not an objective of this study overall the use of azolla as a green manure has great potential in rice as indicated by the results of this study but constraining factors to its use are also significant for example the economics of azolla use is very important as the technology is quite labor intensive therefore often farmers may have little or no economic advantage in choosing azolla over chemical fertilizer because the possible additional costs of labor land opportunity irrigation phosphate fertilizers application and pesticides might render the use of azolla uneconomical this study contributes useful information into the thin body of literature on the effect of azolla compost on rice growth and yield data on the impact of azolla compost on rice growth and yield under different water management practices are limited to improve and maintain the productivity of agricultural land an integrated approach to determine the most favorable plant microorganism interaction is vital the current trend of low input chemicals in sustainable agricultural systems is expected to contribute to this goal less water consumption as well as prevention of environmental problems with appropriate soil amendments as the best treatment for cultivation in areas with water shortage and drought conditions can be achieved with use of azolla compost in rice production future azolla research should concentrate on development of efficient field management methods that can be used by farmers 5 conclusions the application of azolla compost at the rate of 5 0 of soil weight resulted in higher tiller number spike number spike weight and grain yield of rice plants compared with the non amended control whereas height of rice plants spike length and percentage of filled grains were not affected the study confirms the positive effect of azolla compost on rice growth and provides practical information on the usefulness of the azolla compost as a soil amendment in rice cultivation under different water management compared with the traditionally practiced continuous flooding findings point out the possibility of use of this material for improving rice growth and productivity it should be noted however that the present study evaluated the effect of azolla compost and irrigation on one rice cultivar growth and grain yield cv hashemi in pot trials pot trials are valuable in relating observed measurements to actual plant response and thereby are important in establishing basic principles on soil fertilizer plant relationships however due to large variation in environmental factors results of pot experiments can be indicative with respect to field conditions therefore field experiments with more cultivars are required to further assess the effect of azolla compost on rice growth and yield under different irrigation practices

by an average over irrigation regimes of 8 6 20 8 and 21 1 respectively in the first year and 34 7 50 4 and 52 5 respectively in the second year compared with the non amended control the application of azolla compost at 5 0 of soil weight provided the highest grain yield which was on average 13 8 higher than that of the non amended control the increase of grain yield might be due to efficient absorption of nitrogen and possibly of other nutrients with azolla which promoted production and translocation of assimilates from source to sink overall azolla compost can be regarded as a desirable managerial practice in rice production particularly under water deficit conditions considering the agronomic benefits and water saving azolla compost could contribute to the development of low input cropping systems for rice production keywords azolla compost irrigation regime organic fertilizer soil amendment 1 introduction in rice production farmers often apply more nitrogen n fertilizers than those required for maximum crop growth and grain yield peng et al 2002 however the continuous use of chemical fertilizers inflicted deleterious effects on soil organic matter reserves creating further n deficiency long term use of inorganic fertilizers in conventional agricultural systems has led to soil acidification nutrient imbalance and loss of organic matter thus causing disturbances in chemical and biological balance bobul ska et al 2015 amanullah and hidayatullah 2016 amanullah et al 2016 reducing cation exchange capacity of the soil and enhancing salt accumulation matocha et al 2016 in view of the above problems application of organic amendments is an environmentally friendly approach for crop fertilization that has been well documented by many researchers okur et al 2016 organic amendments have a positive role in vigorous crop growth and yield enhancement amanullah et al 2016 and therefore a global interest in these substances as alternatives and supplements to chemical n fertilizers has been raised poor levels of organic matter in agricultural soils increased the use of organic wastes as organic soil improvers organic amendments to restore soil fertility clapp 2007 organic wastes enhance soil organic matter provoke soil microbial activity improve soil physical characteristics thereby amending soil structure and raise aeration and water holding capacity plaza et al 2004 tejada et al 2009 in addition to these benefits organic wastes also represent a major source of nutrients for plants and microorganisms and thereby promote crop production tejada and gonzalez 2006 hernandez et al 2014 the use of composted organic materials as fertilizers can be a good alternative to inorganic fertilization in crop production for a sustainable agriculture amanullah and khan 2015 compost is a general term referring to plant based biowaste or sludge materials used as soil amendments after aerobic decomposition under controlled conditions martínez blanco et al 2013 in general its use on agricultural land improves several parameters including plant growth and crop yield hall and bell 2015 abdou et al 2016 padilla et al 2017 soil carbon

soil amendment composting transforms fresh organic materials known as feedstocks into stable forms that release nutrients slowly amanullah et al 2015 therefore compost has a unique ability to improve soil characteristics this material promotes soil structure by increasing the stability of soil aggregates particularly in sandy soils however there is limited information on the influence of compost on rice growth and yield under conventional production systems azolla is an aquatic fern that is usually found in paddy water streams and pools in symbiosis with anabaena azollae alga the importance of azolla for paddy fields was first discovered in northern vietnam and then it was recognized in the us indonesia japan the philippines and china subba rao 1988 previous research reported that the integration of azolla compost with chemical fertilizer improved yield of rice and the combined application of inorganic and organic source contributed to the n economy of rice fields nayak et al 2004 singh et al 2005 azolla has spread in rice farms basins and lagoons of guilan province in recent years to an extent that has turned into a problem for aquatic ecosystems instead of being useful to paddy fields it is regarded as a pest or weed for local ecosystems whereas many countries have worked on the use of azolla as a biological or organic fertilizer in paddy fields due to its favorable impact on crop growth enhancement lumpkin and plucknett 1980 this aquatic fern is used as a basis of green manure and decomposed organic material widely known as compost bordoloi et al 2007 and as a biofertilizer for rice in several asian countries cheng et al 2010 there is limited information on the use of azolla compost as a soil amendment in rice production systems a previous study showed maximum grain yields of rice with combined application of 80 kg ha n and 5 tonnes ha of azolla compost nasrollah zadeh et al 2011 furthermore the dry biomass and height of upland kangkong ipomoea aquatica forsk plants were not affected by the type of fertilization i e azolla compost vs inorganic fertilization in urea form on the basis of the above findings the azolla compost was considered beneficial as an alternative for the urea fertilizer jumadi et al 2014 however the above studies were conducted under a single irrigation regime the effect of azolla compost on rice growth under different irrigation regimes has not been assessed therefore more information is needed to validate the effect of azolla compost on rice and its superiority as a soil amendment over different water management practices thus the objective of this study was to examine the impact of azolla compost on rice growth and yield under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a factorial pot experiment established in a completely randomized design was conducted in rice research institute of iran rasht iran for two growing seasons 2010 and 2011 under a temperate mediterranean type climate the experiment was established in plastic pots with 25 cm diameter and 40 cm height each one filled with 5 kg of soil before the initiation of the experiment in each growing season the soil was sampled to determine moisture content and dry weight for using it to fill in the pots and a soil sample was sent to the laboratory for determining n phosphorus p potassium k organic matter om ph and texture the soil analysis included standard procedures of soil testing such the walkley and black method for om determination the kjeldahl method for n determination the spectrophotometric determination for p and k and the titration method for ca additionally the field capacity fc of the soil was determined with a time domain reflectometry tdr sensor soil analysis revealed a clay texture soil properties are summarized in table 1 the soil was a typical clay with almost neutral ph moderate levels of om good retaining capacity of water and good preventing capacity of fertilizers draining away into the subsoil at first azolla compost a commercial unbranded product was added and mixed with the soil of each pot in each growing season pots with non amended soil no azolla application were used as control a sample of the azolla compost was sent to the laboratory for determining n p k om ph and cation exchange capacity the analysis of the compost included standard procedures of soil testing as described above analysis of the applied azolla compost indicated high om adequate total n p and k concentrations for supporting rice growth as well as a high cation exchange capacity table 1 at this stage the recommended rates of p k and half of n fertilizers for rice growing in the area were mixed and integrated with the soil as a basal fertilization n p and k were derived from urea 120 kg ha triple superphosphate 100 kg ha and potassium phosphate 100 kg ha respectively the fertilization rates were selected with the objective to study the effect of azolla compost on common fertilization practices for rice growing in the area the soil was then poured into pots up to 5 cm from the edge the pots were flooded and three 25 days old seedlings of the rice cv hashemi were transplanted in each pot planting was on april 27 in both years the cv hashemi is an indica rice variety with high cooking quality growing in northern iran where most people consume it the remaining half amount of the n fertilizer was applied on the soil surface at the stage of maximum tillering of plants 2 2 azolla treatments and irrigation regimes three levels of irrigation by four levels of azolla compost application were examined in the study each combined treatment was replicated three times the three levels of irrigation were cf continuous flooding during the growth period which was considered as control iwf 100fc intermittent irrigation to soil saturation during the growth period and irrigation withdrawal at flowering until soil moisture reached fc and iwf 80fc

with the traditionally practiced continuous flooding findings point out the possibility of use of this material for improving rice growth and productivity it should be noted however that the present study evaluated the effect of azolla compost and irrigation on one rice cultivar growth and grain yield cv hashemi in pot trials pot trials are valuable in relating observed measurements to actual plant response and thereby are important in establishing basic principles on soil fertilizer plant relationships however due to large variation in environmental factors results of pot experiments can be indicative with respect to field conditions therefore field experiments with more cultivars are required to further assess the effect of azolla compost on rice growth and yield under different irrigation practices
